           <p>
            This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the
            <em>
             Infernal Machine
            </em>
            once functioned as this craft’s central command console.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the
            <em>
             Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad
            </em>
            . Yet with Lum’s eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.

            is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.

            <em>
             Infernal Machine
            </em>
            ’s great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine’s inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an

             Astral Projection

           </p>
           <p>
            As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the
            <em>
             Infernal Machine

            generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table.
