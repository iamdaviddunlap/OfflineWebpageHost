           </h1>
           <p>
            Characters who don't have a Dark Gift might gain one in the course of their adventures. At the DM's discretion, sinister forces might contact a character and offer them a Dark Gift in return for some service or future favor. If a character already has a Dark Gift, accepting such a bargain causes them to lose their current Dark Gift and gain a new one. A Dark Gift gained as a result of such a bargain reflects the agenda of the being or beings offering the bargain, be it the Dark Powers, a Darklord, or a more mysterious force. The particulars of the Dark Gift and how it will affect a character must be clear to a player before they choose whether or not to accept.
           </p>
           <p>
            The offer of a Dark Gift might manifest in a dream, in a moment of frozen time, or when the character is alone. Typically, only one character is aware of a bargain, its terms, and whether or not it was accepted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The DM might have a mysterious force intervene and offer a Dark Gift whenever a desperate or thematic instance presents itself, such as in any of the following cases:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             A Darklord will negotiate with a party only if a character seals the deal by accepting their Dark Gift.
            </li>
            <li>
             Time stops while a character is on the brink of death. A mysterious voice offers to save the character's life, but only if they accept its Dark Gift.
            </li>
            <li>
             An experiment or magical accident goes wrong. The DM allows a character to accept a Dark Gift or some other peril as a result.
            </li>
            <li>
             A character breaks a vow or suffers a curse, gaining a Dark Gift as a result.
            </li>
            <li>
             A character touches a mysterious amber sarcophagus, and a force within entreats them to accept its influence in the form of a Dark Gift.
            </li>
           </ul>

            Your soul isn't your own or, at least, it wasn't always yours. Whether you've lived past lives, your soul was swapped into a different body, or you have a link connecting you to another being, you experience echoes from another life. These echoes grant you knowledge, talents, or even languages you can't always explain, but they also intrude on your perceptions and beliefs unexpectedly.

With effort, you can bend this shadow puppetry to your will.

If the number is odd, reduce the total by the number rolled. If the number is even, increase the total by the number rolled.

            <strong>
             Entwined Existence.
            </strong>
            Your symbiote is a separate entity with its own physical form bound to yours. It isn't a separate creature and relies on you to survive. It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The DM sets the symbiote's abilities or determines them randomly (roll 4d6 for each score, ignoring the lowest roll and totaling the rest). The symbiote can see and hear using your senses.
            <br/>
            The symbiote speaks, reads, and understands two languages; one that you speak, as well as one appropriate to its nature. Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Perception, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill if you don't already have it, representing the symbiote's counsel and guidance.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you die, so does your symbiote. If you are subsequently returned to life, your symbiote revives as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Sustained Symbiosis.
            </strong>
            Your symbiote has a vested interest in your survival and takes steps to ensure it. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to have your symbiote expend one of your Hit Dice to roll it and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success. If it uses this feature on a death saving throw, you succeed on the save and regain 1 hit point regardless of the number rolled on the d20.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once you succeed on a saving throw due to this trait, the symbiote can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Symbiotic Agenda.
            </strong>
            Your symbiote has an agenda that drives it, and it expects you to assist it in achieving those goals. How permissive or patient it is in resolving its agenda depends on its personality (work with your DM to determine these details). If you have an opportunity to advance its agenda and don't act on it, the symbiote can try to force your hand. You must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the symbiote's Charisma modifier) or be charmed by the symbiote for 1d12 hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            While charmed, you must try to follow the symbiote's commands. If you take damage that is not self-inflicted, you can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
           </p>
           <p>
            Roll or choose from the Symbiotic Agenda table to determine the symbiote's goal, working with your DM to detail the specifics or create another agenda.
