          Introduction
         </h2>
         <p>
          Wizard spells are arguably the best spell list in the game, capable of
addressing nearly any situation with a single spell. Nearly nothing is beyond
the Wizard’s ability, with the possible exception of healing (and even then,
options like Vampiric Touch and Life Transference exist). Wizards are also
          <a data-id="16386" data-type="page" href="../../../feats/ritual-caster/index.html">
           ritual casters
          </a>
          , allowing them to further capitalize on their growing library of spells
added to their spellbook(s) without cutting into the spells which they can
prepare every day like other spellcasters must.
         </p>

         </span>
         <p>
          While other classes can cast many of the same spells, the Wizard can often
cast them better due to their unique ability to write spells in a spellbook
and cast any of them as rituals. Rituals are so central to what makes the
Wizard great that collecting ritual spells is nearly required to play the
class to its full potential.

target. If you can hit two targets, the total damage will beat any other
cantrip (Eldritch Blast doesn’t count), and since it’s on Dexterity saves
many bulky melee enemies will reliably fail. However, it’s hard to count on
two enemies being adjacent, and generally when they are you want to use
leveled spells to take advantage of the situation.

Bolt, but less damage. In exchange, you get a better damage type and the
target can’t regain hit points for a turn which can be a big help against
enemies with regeneration or enemy clerics. This also imposes Disadvantage
on the next attack if the target is undead, but many undead also have
resistance to necrotic damage so Chill Touch isn’t always a good option
against undead. Still, if you need a staple, go-to damage cantrip that isn’t

extinguish them, change their color, etc., but if you want to light a torch
you need to use flint and tinder like a commoner. You can use this to
dramatically improve the effectiveness of torches, or to snuff out enemy
light sources at a distance, but those are situational uses that you can
address with better light sources like the Daylight spell or by using water.

ongoing damage only applies when a creature enters the area or ends their
turn there, so you can only get extra damage if you can force an enemy into
the space or if you cast it on them and they remain in their space. If you
have an ally who likes to grapple enemies, or if you need to block a narrow
space like a hall or doorway, this is extremely useful if you’re not already

as you gain levels because Concentration is such a precious resource, and
many of the best spells require Concentration. If your game doesn’t
include an option to retrain cantrips, I would skip Create Bonfire
entirely. If you have a way to retrain cantrips, consider taking Create
Bonfire at low levels, but be prepared to replace it if you find that
you’re not using it consistently.

works while you’re tied up or have your hands full, making it a great option
for War Caster. It also imposes a -1d4 penalty on the target’s next saving
throw making them an easier target for save-or-suck spells, or you can just
repeatedly hit them with Mind Sliver and watch enemies try to beat your
spell save DC with a +0 save bonus and the -1d4 penalty from your previous
hit.

it’s probably a bad cantrip. The only important function is to create
difficult terrain, but you’re limited to two ongoing effects, which means
you only get two 5-foot squares. And, again, you could do that with a
shovel. You’re about as likely to use this in combat as you are to use a
shovel, too.

you can send your familiar to deliver the spell, and for an owl that’s less
risky than it is for you, but using your familiar this way is a risk to a
powerful asset which costs 70 minutes and 10 gp to replace. Is Shocking

doesn’t know that they’ve been targeted by the spell if they succeed on the
saving throw, but you don’t know if they succeeded or failed unless your DM
decides to tell you (and they are under no obligation to do so). So

challenging spell; if you just want damage, cast Burning Hands. With a
1-minute duration and 2d4 damage each round, you can deal a total of 20d4
damage to each target (average 50) which is enough to kill many creatures up
to CR 2 or 3 (ignore the table in the “creating a monster” rules in the DMG;
real monster stats tend to have high “offensive CR” and low “defensive CR”
so very few of them have hit points which line up with those rules).

                                                  However, you’re almost certainly not going to get the full damage, and
that’s probably fine. If you spend an Action and a spell slot to cast this
and a target spends their Action to remove the effect, you have traded
your Action for theirs and probably also did a bunch of damage. In
encounters where your party outnumbers your enemies, that’s a winning
trade for you. In encounters where your enemies outnumber your party,
you’re in a target-rich environment and may be able to hit 3 or more
targets, in which case trading your own Action for one Action from several
enemies is a great way to offset your enemies’ numerical advantage.

                                                  Lines are a difficult AOE because it’s often difficult to catch more than
two enemies in a straight 5-foot wide line. It’s also all-or-nothing, so
creatures which pass the save are totally unharmed. This requires
Concentration, so if you don’t affect multiple targets you may need to
weigh the benefits of whatever ongoing damage you’re getting against the
ability to spend your Concentration on a different spell instead.

no use beyond carrying heavy objects for you, so you’ll likely never cast
this unless you cast it as a ritual.

later turns. The primary use case for Witch Bolt is when you’re facing large

rarity since most combats last around 3 rounds.

                      An ally who likes to grapple will do a lot to make this effective. Holding
an enemy in place will guarantee damage every round, but dragging the enemy
out and then back in will also trigger the damage, effectively doubling your
damage output. The Push Weapon Mastery can also be very effective here,
allowing you push enemies into or through the space in order to trigger the
damage without relying on Grappling. The abunsance of forced movement effects
and speed debuffs in the 2024 rules, coupled with the ability to reposition
the effect, make this extremely effective.

large amount of fuel which you probably don’t have laying about. You can
multilane the body, but that’s gross and in many campaign settings the gods
view that sort of thing as evil. So if you need to maintain a body until you
can give it a real burial, this is your best bet. Fortunately, you can cast
it as a ritual.

with anything that raises creatures from the dead. That includes Revivify.

can cast 3rd-level spells and until you can scrape together enough diamond
dust to raise them.

to filter that through your character into something that would make sense

a mistake. Keep in mind that it only resets six seconds of conversation, so
a short sentence is all that you can cover. You can’t spend an hour berating

that you can’t be reached by most creatures which rely solely on melee
attacks, a surprising number of creatures. If you’re happy fighting at
range, you can comfortably snipe at your foes from relative safety.

unpleasant things which can’t fly.

melee-only creatures essentially harmless so long as the spell persists.

                                                 The 10-minute duration means that you can easily use this to ascend
cliffs or tall walls, or raise targets high enough into the air that you
might not be able to see them. In 10 minutes you can raise the target
2,000 feet.

                                                  Levitate’s big challenges are its Action economy, Concentration, and that
it allows a Constitution save. In combat, spending an Action to raise the
target an additional 20 feet into the air is rarely worth the Action cost,
though enemies using ranged weapons might be forced to suffer Disadvantage
on their attacks if you can put them at long range. Constitution saves are
more of a problem since Constitution saves are frequently high, and
enemies with relatively poor Constitution save bonuses tend to be
spellcasters or other creatures well-equipped to fight at range.

the message in the volume at which you originally spoke so you can turn a
piece of paper into an extremely unpleasant (though harmless) surprise.

Short of huge, strong creatures that you should never target with this spell
anyway, targets are a massive disadvantage when attempting to escape.
Spellcasters, Dexterity-based martial enemies, and most humanoids (including
many strong ones) can’t easily escape this, and being Restrained makes them
extremely vulnerable to attack. It’s not as lethal as Hold Person, but it
doesn’t have a creature type limitation and it’s much harder to escape. You
can use an Action on later turns to try to damage the target again, but
since they’re restrained you get Advantage on attacks against them, and if
you have an attack cantrip that may be more reliable than forcing another
saving throw.

option, and it doesn’t require Concentration so you can easily use it
alongside other great options like Fly. It’s easy to compare this to Blur
since they’re the same level and fill the same niche. Blur applies
Disadvantage, but Disadvantage is only useful if your AC is high enough that
attackers have a reasonable chance to miss their attacks. When enemies’
attack bonuses have long outstripped the AC provided by Mage Armor and
Shield, Mirror Image remains useful. However, since its usefulness
diminishes quickly it works best against enemies making small numbers of
attacks with high damage. Also, the 1-minute duration can be challenging
when it’s an Action to cast.

up around the creature, and eating it like a venus fly trap. The creature
“treats the phantasm as if it were real”, and unless they know to use
Intelligence (Investigation) to disbelieve the illusion they’ll spend 10
rounds struggling against a non-existent trap which is slowly killing them.
An ally might try to convince them that something is amiss, but that’s time
that your enemies are trying to get their act together while you’re hitting
them with other spells. The save is Intelligence, and Intelligence saves
tend to be relatively low, especially at low levels where beasts are still a
threat.

appears when the rope is perpendicular to the ground, so its full length

60-foot rope, I recommend carrying a much shorter length of rope for just
this purpose. 10 feet at most is typically sufficiently tall that none of
your party members need to duck, and any medium sized creature in party
can lift any small or frail allies nearly to the top of the rope. 10 ft.
of rope should also reach its full length before hitting a ceiling in most
locales, but if you’re worried you can always shorten the rope before
casting Rope Trick.

across three attacks. If you have Advantage on all of the attacks or have
some other attack bonus like Bless the expected damage increases
considerably, so when those opportunities arise be sure to take them. Making
numerous attacks means that you’re likely to hit with at least some of them,
but you’re also likely to miss with some of them and therefore deal only
partial damage. The best way to think about stuff like this is to rely on
averages: if you’re sticking to the Attack vs. AC progression, you’re
expected to hit around 65% of the time, so you can expect an average of 65%
of the damage from any effect which relies on an attack. Scorching Ray deals
a total of 6d6 damage (avg. 21), and 605% of that is 13.65 expected damage
(disregarding critical hits, which are more common because you’re making
multiple attacks).

cantrips improve at 5th level). The best use cases for this are the

You can use this to accomplish a lot of things. This is more effective,
reliable, and immediate than Geas. However, the 8-hour duration requires
Concentration, so if you want to use this while adventuring you’re
committing a significant resource for a full day to get the full duration of
the spell. This spell benefits greatly from your own creativity, so the more
thought you put into its use the more effective it will be.

much or your DM may grow tired of your shenanigans and instill some sort
of consequences. Strangely, the spell doesn’t state that the target knows
that they were charmed, so much like a “Jedi Mind Trick”, the target will
carry out the specified action as though it made sense to do so even if
they’ll regret it later.

Action means that enemies who can’t attack at range basically spend their
whole turn walking. Enemies stuck in melee who don’t want to be there may be
stuck there. Enemy spellcasters or creatures with lots of special abilities
will lose big chunks of their turn.

which are consistently one of the lowest saves across the full level
range. In 5e, Intelligence doesn’t do a lot, so unsurprisingly most
adventurers and most monsters are idiots. Capitalize on that. This is a
great way to force enemies to expend Legendary Resistances.

annoying but usually not impactful. The big draw here is the difficult
terrain to deter melee enemies and Disadvantage to deter ranged attackers.
This competes conceptually with Blur since both options impose Disadvantage,
but there are some trade-offs. Blur only lasts 1 minute, but the
Disadvantage applies to all attacks rather than just ranged attacks. Warding
Wind lasts 10 minutes and makes it hard for enemies to move near you,
potentially keeping them from reaching you in melee. I’m not sure which
spell is better, but given that Warding Wind lasts longer and can handle
effects that normally require Gust of Wind, I think Warding Wind may be
slightly better.

control, but with some complications. This competes for space with Hold
Person and Maximilian’s Earthen Grasp. Compared to Earthen Grasp, Web can
affect more than one creature and has a much better duration, but Web may be
easier to escape. Web requires an initially Dexterity saving throw, then
creatures can make Strength checks to escape on later turns. Strength checks
are going to be hard compared to your Spell Save DC since Strength checks
will never add a Proficiency Bonus, but many creatures will be good at
either Strength or Dexterity, so your ideal targets are creatures which are
bad at both like many spellcasters. The webs can also be burned away, so any
creature that can deal fire damage, or which is carrying something like
flint and steel or a lit torch can easily escape without struggling through
a series of Strength checks. Being Restrained doesn’t prevent creatures from
taking such actions. Given all of the comparisons, I think Web is a better
option for handling groups of foes, but Maximilian’s Earthen Grasp is better
against single foes.

damage is enough that you won’t regret casting it instead of a cantrip, and
even at higher levels it’s a great way to place some difficult terrain. The
difficult terrain effect is nearly permanent, so if you have time you can
use this to set up ambushes and choke points which can define encounters
against anything that can’t fly.

combat if you can avoid it. And of course, you don’t want to try casting
this during combat. Still, if you can isolate a single enemy outside of
combat you may be able to ply them for information or send them on errands
which will save you trouble later. Tragically, the spell only lasts an hour
so just as you’re getting really attached to your new best friend the
effects end, and the targets knows that you charmed them. You may be able to
cast this repeatedly or you may be able to negotiate the situation
peacefully even after the spell ends, but many people don’t take kindly to
being charmed.

spellcaster’s spells early in a fight should dictate the outcome of the
fight, and Hypnotic Pattern is a great example of such a spell. Take a group
of creatures out of a fight for a full minute on only one save. Targets
don’t get another save, and the effect doesn’t end until the spell does or
someone breaks targets out of the effect. This means that you can focus on
enemies which pass the initial save, then gradually eliminate the remaining
targets one at a time. This doesn’t scale with spell level, but it really
doesn’t need to. A 30-foot cube is enough to hit several creatures, and so
long as your Spell Save DC is decent you’ll do fine. Even if enemies spend
an Action to break their allies out of the spell, you’ve spent one Action to
incapacitate them and they’re spending more than that just to fix it without
actually harming you or your allies.

describes it as a done) which it creatures is impenetrable and impassable
like a wall of force, except for creatures which are inside the sphere when
you cast the spell (your party, usually). Since it’s opaque, most low-level
teleport effects like Misty step can’t be used to get inside it. Your allies
can use it for cover, then dart in and out to attack or cast spells. You as
the caster are stuck inside the hut since the spell ends if you leave, but
that doesn’t stop you from summoning something to go fight on your
behalf.

you cast the spell you could spend two meteors when the spell is cast then
spend your Bonus Action to fire two more. Each meteor deals 2d6 damage, so
at 6 meteors you can deal a total of 12d6 damage, beating Fireball by half.
However, the 5-foot radius on the meteors is tiny so you’re lucky if you can
hit just two creatures. Fortunately, you have 10 minutes to find good
targets if you don’t mind dedicating Concentration to keeping this running
as your pool of meteors gradually depletes. Probably your best bet is to
cast this before going into a fight, then fire meteors as a Bonus Action
between casting other spells.

but it has to compete with other Wisdom save options at the same spell
level. Compared to Hypnotic Pattern, Slow severely handicaps targets, but
they can still fight back. Hypnotic Pattern’s targets can’t act at all until
they’re released from the effect, but it’s also a Charm effect which some
creatures are immune or resistant to.

didn’t like you while it’s alive it’s unlikely to be helpful after you’ve
killed it. Your best bet is to use this on an ally with information that you
can’t get otherwise. Cast Gentle Repose on the corse to keep it intact so
that you can hit it with Speak with Dead again 10 days later.

                                                    (Optional): An
interesting choice for the Bladesinger. The extra damage works well if
you’re making weapon attacks, but the limited range means that you’re only
going to use it in melee or so close to melee that you’re basically in
melee, which means that you need to be running Bladesong at the same time.
At this level, you’re not very durable and you don’t have Song of Defense to
save you in an emergency, so this is a big gamble compared to defensive
buffs like Blur. The damage notably scales with spell level, so casting this
at 5th level or even 7th level is really tempting, but 6th level brings
Tasha’s Otherworldly Guise and Tenser’s Transformation, which compete for
space. Which works for you will depend on your build and your preferred
tactics. Learn all three and experiment to find which one you like best.

prone typically isn’t a problem in 5e because standing costs so little.
However, being knocked prone while flying causes you to fall, potentially
taking a bunch of damage. This spell notably doesn’t require that it be cast
on the ground or on top of a body of water. You could cast this in mid-air,
or even wholly underwater. Using it mid-air seems like a good way to counter
multiple flying enemies. However, hitting more than two enemies with a line
effect (even one that’s wide like Tidal Wave) can be very difficult, so it’s
rare that you’ll hit more than two targets with this.

duration, Tiny Servant is in many ways a temporary familiar. Unlike a
familiar it has fixed stats and it can attack, but attacking is definitely
not its intended function. With 60-foot blindsight, it’s a portable sentry.
It’s not smart enough to follow complex commands and it can’t see, so it
can’t discern invisible foes from visible ones, but you can command it to
inform you of approaching creatures, or you could command it to chase a
specific foe which you know to be present but can’t see. I recommend casting
this on something small, portable, and loud like a hand bell so that the
servant can communicate by ringing itself. Still, as good as this spell is I
would wait until you’ve got plentiful 3rd-level spells before you consider
it.

saving throw and very few creatures are good at those. Second, many powerful
enemies like fiends are extraplanar, so you can easily remove them with a
single spell (though many of them can cast Plane Shift to come right back,
so watch out for that). Finally, casting the spell at a higher level allows
you to target additional creatures so you can remove big parts of an
encounter for up to a minute, deal with anything that passes the initial
round of banishment, then prep yourself for everything else to drop back in
while your party stands around with readied actions.

magmin or something. The spell isn’t limited to vanilla elementals; any
creature of the Elemental creature type qualifies.

little else that turn. Strength and Dexterity checks will lag saving throws
considerably, so even characters with good physical ability scores will have
trouble passing the DC. Unfortunately, despite how good this spell is it
competes with other options of the same level like Sickening Radiance which
are much better for crowds and Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere which is better
for single targets.

Two types of dice for no readily apparent reason. Two types of damage, which
makes sense but is still annoying. Compare this to Erupting Earth: ice
Storm’s AOE is much bigger (20 ft. cube vs. 20 ft. radius cylinder), but it
does an average of just 3 more damage, and the difficult terrain only lasts
until the end of your next turn so it’s nearly pointless. This simply isn’t
good enough to justify being a spell level higher than Erupting Earth.

like would not.

poor mental stats, the save will be hard to pass and Frightened will make
their attacks and ability checks much less effective. How the Frightened
condition works is somewhat confusing because there’s no indication where
the “illusory manifestation” appears, if it has a location at all. I think
that the intent is that the target is Frightened, but their movement isn’t
hampered like it would normally be by the Frightened condition. Because
casting Phantasmal Killer increases the damage by a d10 every time (rather
than just the on the first damage roll like many spells), this remains an
effective option well beyond its spell level.

The damage is low for a spell of this level, especially for one that’s
single-target, but the damage alone isn’t why you’re here. The save is
Intelligence, and those tend to be among the lowest saves, even at very high
levels, and the target is Incapacitated on a failed save, robbing them of a
turn, so despite it being single-target with lackluster damage it’s a
powerful tool against single foes. Even better, if you know the target’s
name (often easy for named antagonists), you can cast this without line of
sight, allowing you to hide behind walls, in areas of magical darkness, or
somewhere else safe.

underwhelming, but don’t let that deter you. This is a great spell to cast
into a room then shut the door, but even if that’s not an option it’s a
fantastic way to handle crowds. With a 30-foot radius you can hit a huge
number of targets, and with a 10-minute duration you can easily kill
anything stuck in the area for an extended period. The 4d10 damage is fine,
and negating invisibility is great, but the real appeal is the levels of
Exhaustion. One level makes targets less able to resist grappling or other
crowd control spells like Maximilian’s Earthen Grasp or Web which your
allies could cast to keep enemies in the area. Two levels halves targets’
speed, making it harder for them to move out of the area. Three levels
imposes Disadvantage on saves so their condition will deteriorate even
faster. If targets somehow survive until 5 levels of exhaustion (they’ll
have taken 20d10 radiant damage by now, which is a lot), their speed drops
to 0 so you no longer need to do anything to prevent escape. Just wait for
them to hit 6 levels of Exhaustion, which results in death if a total of
24d10 radiant damage somehow hasn’t killed them. Just be warned: this spell
affects allies, too, and if the spell ends the levels of Exhaustion are
removed instantly.

space to wreak all kinds of havoc if you’re clever..

useful, but Summon Greater Demon is a double-edged sword. The demon is only
under your control so long as it keeps failing Charisma saves, so you want
to pick something with poor Charisma saves to keep it under your control as
long as possible. In a pinch you can use the option to create a safe space
and bottleneck the demon in a room full of enemies, then walk away and let
the demon run wild. Even at this level a CR 5 is still decently powerful,
and thanks to 5e’s flat math a CR 5 will remain a meaningful addition to the
party for a reasonably long time. As your spell slot levels improve, you can
summon more powerful demons, which keeps the spell useful for a long time.
It may wane in effectiveness a few levels after you max out at 5th-level
spell slots, but if you can find a demon with good utility options Summon
Greater Demon may remain viable long past the end of its usefulness in
combat.

level and a different damage type. The same range, the same AOE, the same
save, the same school. But Vitriolic Sphere deals acid damage, and instead
of dealing the damage all up front, some of it is applied at the end of
targets’ next turns. The initial damage exceeds Fireball’s initial damage by
a few points, but on it’s own not by enough to justify the spell level
difference. The big addition is that you get half of the initial damage at
the end of targets’ next turns. That’s a huge damage boost, but it only
applies if the targets fail their saves, and obviously it only matters if
they’re still alive. This is a great spell early in a fight, especially if
you know that you’re not going to kill the targets in one shot, but that’s
also the time when you should be dropping spells like Sickening Radiance or
Wall of Fire, so maybe use this as your second spell in an encounter.

              : This spell is
complicated, but when it works it can be profoundly effective, but you need
to carefully choose the objects which you animate to get the most out of the
spell and you don’t always have the luxury of abundant options. First, avoid
any object with feet or legs like tables and chairs; choosing objects which
are forced to fly makes them much more useful. From there, you need to weigh
the benefits of various size objects. Larger objects can take up more space
and deal more damage per attack, but having numerous small attacks may deal
more damage. Larger objects have considerably more hit points but
considerably worse AC. Medium creatures have the worst attack bonus, and
attack bonuses improve as you move away from Medium in either direction,
altering the amount of damage which you can expect from each attack.
              <p>
               Looking at all of the various factors, in most cases your best option is
10 tiny objects. Enemies still can’t move into their space, and with a
total of 10 attacks they’ll easily deal more damage than any other
combination of objects. Over 10 rounds, 10 attacks per round, 100 total
attacks, totalling 100d4+400 damage, avg. 650. Expect attacks to hit
roughly 50% of the time, but even then against a single target that’s an
average of up to 325 damage if the target doesn’t do something about.
               <p>
                If you select objects which will fly, they can easily encircle an enemy,
keeping them in place either in the air or on the ground. Granted, with
just 20 hit points they’re vulnerable to AOE damage, but it’s easy to look
for other spells whenever that’s a problem. And, if you can’t find
adequate targets you can carry around a sack full of daggers or loaves of
bread or something else light and portable.

have plenty of ways to handle single targets, but generally once the target

spell’s duration, allowing you to repeatedly harass the target and move on
to a new target once the previous one falls.

through armies, this spell is hard to use in the small, tactical fights

that the effect moves away from you makes the spell difficult to keep in
place, and RAW it’s unclear if the effect stops if it hits a solid barrier
or if it’s happy to roll straight through solid objects like castle walls.
RAW, the spell moves away from you rather than from your original position
when casting the spell, so you may be able to pilot the effect by running
around it, but with a 20-foot radius you may need more than the typical
25/30 ft. speed most humanoid races have if you want to make more than
slight adjustments to the cloud’s direction every round. If you want run
fully around to the opposite side of the cloud, you need to move upwards of
60 feet (half the circumference of a circle with 40-foot diameter is roughly
62.5 feet, but that doesn’t account for positioning on a grid).

8d6 damage (just 8 points more damage on average), and if you cast Fireball
as a 5th-level spell Cone of Cold does just 1 point more damage on
average.

                         : As a DM, I’m going to
ask you a personal favor: Don’t cast this spell on anything except human
corpses. The Monster Manual contains only a handful of skeleton and zombie
stat blocks, and if you do something silly like raise a bunch of zombie
wolves your DM is going to need to generate a new stat block for them in the
middle of a game session. At some point I’ll write a “Big Book of Skeletons”
and “Big Book of Zombies” to convert every living creature in the Monster
Manual, but that’s probably a long way off. I think the intent is that you
should use the generic “Zombie” stat block used for humanoid zombies, but it
never explains what to do if players use this on any other kind of corpse.

1/4 creatures for up to an hour is not going to have a huge impact unless
you just need five lukewarm bodies to carry stuff around. There’s
something to be said for the Zombie’s Undead Fortitude since most
creatures can’t deal radiant damage, but the DC for the save is going to
be too high so your zombies are still going to die quickly. Summon Undead
will usually be more effective.

fine concept, but at just 4d8 damage it’s going to take a profoundly long
time to kill any single target worthy of a 5th-level spell slot. Sure, the
damage is guaranteed, but spells like Hunger of Hadar and Sickening Radiance
will do similar damage in an AOE along with other benefits. Enervation
simply isn’t good enough for the spell slot.

situational by design. It has a 1-minute casting time and Verbal components,
so you’re not going to break this out in combat or while sneaking around in
a dungeon. You’re going to restrain the subject, and stand around chanting
for a full minute and hope that they fail the save. Once that’s done, you
need to give them a suitable command (read the spell description). Generally
you’ll want it to be something that benefits you, but will also take the
target most of the duration to keep them from becoming a problem for you.
Also remember that the base effect of the Charmed condition makes it easier
for you to talk the creature into doing things with Charisma checks, so a
Geased creature may be a useful ally for the duration of the effect even if
the original order isn’t directly related to what you want them to do.

                                 Increasing the spell level extends the duration, but weirdly the damage
doesn’t increase. 5d10 is a nice pile of damage, but it doesn’t scale with
spell level and at some point the target will get smart enough to wake up,
trigger the 5d10 damage, take a short rest, then go about their business.
If the damage scaled this would be less of a problem, but damage is so
easily repaired in 5e outside of combat that without further penalties
Geas is more a tax on hit dice than the magical shackles it’s intended to
be.

target is out of compliance, or make the damage impossible to heal until
they go a day without taking it. Neither of those is a perfect solution,

devils using their talisman, but getting one of those would be a plot point

The fact that the subject needs to be “of legendary importance” severely
limits the spells usefulness, and you might not benefit from this more than
once or twice in an entire campaign. In previous editions this was a great
way to ask the DM for background information which they often had available
but with no excuse to share, which is both informative for the players and
rewarding for the DM who has spent hours crafting fun lore with no in-game
reason to share it. You can still use it for major places, items, and
characters, but “legendary importance” is highly subjective so your DM can
make this totally useless if they don’t feel like sharing.

effective save-or-suck spell. Compare it to Hold Monster against a single
target, which is the same level. Hold Monster allows additional saves every
round, though admittedly Paralyzed is more lethal than Incapacitated. The
target is unaware of its surroundings, so you can reasonably get Advantage
on attack rolls against it, but as long as it isn’t damage you could also
fully restrain the target before the spell’s duration expires. However, the
target gets Advantage on their save if you’re fighting it, so you need to
hit them with this before fighting starts. That typically means before
Initiative is rolled, but your DM may let you do it if the creature is
Surprised.

you came to their rescue. Then you’ve won a fight, and earned the real
treasure: the friends that you made along the way, and whatever their
previous friends had in their pockets.

The ability to communicate silently across limitless distance is a massive
tactical advantage in most situations where other creatures are a problem.
The fact that this has no range limit once it’s in effect means that you can
use it to communicate with allies while they scout around, potentially
including beasts, familiars, and summoned creatures. This also neatly solves
the challenge of language barriers, so if you can get a target to sit around
for 10 minutes you no longer need Tongues.

intelligence saves, so expect most creatures to fail the save. The 8d6
damage feels underwhelming at this spell level, but subtracting a d6 from
attack rolls and ability checks for a full minute is a significant debuff.
This is a good option to start a fight with a large number of martial
enemies because they’ll be impacted most by debuff and most martial enemies
have poor Intelligence saves.

require a crane in real life. Against enemies, lifting them into the air and
making them Restrained can easily be a death sentence if you have other
allies who can follow up with ranged attacks or who can reach the target via
flight or some other means. Because the target must remain within the
spell’s range, be careful about holding the target directly above your own
head to get them to the maximum height. It’s perfectly fine to hold them 30
feet off the ground roughly 30 feet away from you horizontally. The target
falls prone if they take damage from the fall, which should slow most
creatures enough that they can’t get into melee with you without dashing.
Then you can attempt to pick them up again on your next turn because the
spell lasts 10 minutes and you can use it every turn without limit. Just
remember that they do get to make an opposed ability check, so you may fail
to grab them.

floors and ceilings like caves and castles, and even if you don’t use this

collapsing structures, or generally just ruining anything made of stone. It

isn’t glamorous, it’s difficult to overstate how effective a solid stone
barrier can be at solving problems. Walling off some of the enemies an
encounter can take one challenging counter and make it two very easy
back-to-back encounters. You do need to maintain Concentration, but that
also means that when you’re ready to deal with whatever you decided to wall
off temporarily you can just drop Concentration rather than breaking down
your own wall. Outside of a life of adventure, this spell is powerful enough
that you could make a decent living in construction based on this spell
alone. If you ever decide to settle down, find somewhere with enough stone
to anchor the spell and build yourself a nice stone house.

contingent spell when you cast Contingency, so you need to provide any
material components (potentially consuming them), and there’s no guarantee
that your contingent spell will be triggered, so avoid spells with an
expensive material component unless they’re a really good option for some
reason. Once you get access to Wish, you can use it to make most spells in

darkvision, flight, a telepathic bond with you, and the ability to attack on
its own. However, it’s still very frail and the only way to address that is
to give it part of your hit points maximum. Wizards are notoriously frail,
which makes that a terrifying gamble, especially considering that you can
just recreate your homunculus by casting the spell again so long as you
haven’t lost your fancy dagger. Most likely, your homunculus will serve
basically the same role as a familiar: a scout, a courier, and occasionally
a vehicle for Dragon Breath. If your familiar or someone else in the party
can fill those roles already, you might skip this spell and spend that
1,000gp elsewhere.

homonculi are typically depicted as grotesque human-like things resembling
a partially-melted baby doll with wings, but the new official art
resembles a somewhat-cute bat-frog-squirrel thing. I think that’s an
artistic improvement, but if you still want a flying nightmare baby you’re
free to imagine your homunculus however you like so long as you don’t draw
me a picture of it.

collection of sapphires, and start reclaiming your items (provided that no
one has picked them up after your untimely demise).

level rather than the level of the spell slot used to cast it. Even in
fights with spellcasters who can cast 9th-level spell slots, you can cast
this as a 9th-level spell and use Counterspell against any 9th-level spells
which they cast (though you’ll need to roll an ability check and hope for
the best). This spell also uniquely cripples enemy warlocks, since their
spell slots cap at 5th level and they’re heavily reliant on cantrips. They
can still use their Mystic Arcanum unless you upcast Globe of
Invulnerability, but they only get 4 of those at most, and you’ve got plenty
of spell slots for Counterspell. Despite all these strengths, you still need
to be cautious: 1 minute is not a long time, and enemies can still move into
the globe unimpeded and attack you at point-blank range. Keep your allies
inside the sphere both to protect them and to let them protect you, and
beware non-spell attacks like breath weapons and pointy sticks.

Generally an enemy might use this to try to take over a player’s body, but
I’ve never seen a player use this successfully. The spell also has a lot of
open questions: What happens if you gain a level while possessing another
creature’s body? Are hit points a class feature for the spell’s purposes?
What about racial traits like weapon and armor proficiencies? How much of
your body needs to be nearby? I recommend avoiding this spell as a player,
and as a DM I recommend keeping Counterspell handy since the effect can be
ended by Dispel Magic.

a Bonus Action). This is a great way to sneak past Legendary Resistances,
and if you’re positioned well in the initiative order your allies might get
to spend their turns attacking the target with Advantage.

is immune to being charmed. Save Otto’s Irresistible Dance for powerful
single foes who might otherwise be difficult to target with save-or-suck
spells.

complicated and I love it. The casting time is 1 Action, so you can use it
really quickly but somehow script a 5-minute performance in under 6 seconds.
It has a 25gp expensive material component which it doesn’t consume for
reasons I don’t understand. The 30-foot cube area is enough to fill a
decently large stage, allowing you to script entire plays (albeit short
ones). The triggering condition is flexible enough that you can use a
separate casting of Programmed Illusion to trigger it. There’s a 10-minute
cooldown on each performance, but you could have three spells overlapping to
trigger a perpetual 15-minute loop. Just to mess with people, you could add
another Programmed Illusion that triggers when another one is either
dispelled or discovered to be an illusion. Honestly, if you can’t find a way
to abuse this you’re not trying hard enough.

an ally (or a random humanoid you stumble upon), but I think as a DM I might
frown upon that. I might not do anything about it, but there would be

raise the dead, as the spell makes no mention of how that’s handled.

situational benefits. You also get the equivalent of Extra Attack. That’s a
weird benefit since most wizards have little business using weapons. So the

Tenser’s Transformation. The Bonus Action casting time offers some appeal
as a quick buff when the action economy really matters, but it’s difficult
to combine this with Bladesong since they both take a Bonus Action. If you
can manage that minor challenge, this offers a great way to get a grab bag
of defenses in a hurry, and unlike Tensor’s Transformation it doesn’t lock
you out of casting spells.

as a bladesinger, but even then it has some problems. First, while you gain
proficiency in armor and shields and weapons, you probably don’t just have
decent armor and stuff laying around, and donning full plate takes longer
than the spell lasts. Second, if you lose Concentration, you’re now in armor
in which you’re likely not proficient, so you can’t cast spells. If you’re
not already decent with a weapon, this won’t help. And on top of that, you
gain a level of Exhaustion when the spell finishes, which is pointlessly
cruel.

beyond those which make it unusable by other wizards. With the Action
casting time, you can start this and Bladesong on the same turn and with
50 temporary hit points you’re suddenly much more durable beyond just your
crazy AC.

which reduces your ability to protect your comparably tiny number of hit
points. The Bladesinger won’t benefit from the Extra Attack replacement,
and you give up the ability to cast spells which includes melee attack
cantrips like Booming Blade. Still, Advantage with your attacks and a
bonus 2d12 force damage on top of all of that is a huge pile of damage
output, easily offsetting the damage lost from Booming Blade.

               : Similar in many ways
to Melf’s Minute Meteors. Crown of Stars does considerably more damage per
charge (2d6 vs. 4d12), but Crown of Stars only affects one target as opposed
to a negligibly small AOE. Upcasting Minute Meteors gets you a total of 14
meteors for a total of 28d6 damage (assuming that nothing passes the save,
of course). Crown of Stars will deal a total of 28d12 at the same spell
level, and it’s delivered much faster over considerably fewer projectiles.
If we ignore the possibility of critical hits from Crown of Stars, you would
still need to hit two targets per meteor with Melf’s Minute Meteors to
exceed Crown of Stars’ average damage, and considering you need to do it 14
times in the span of 10 minutes that seems incredibly unlikely. If you’ve
been relying on minute meteors, it’s time to upgrade. Crown of Stars doesn’t
require Concentration, and with a 1-hour duration you get six times as long
to spend half as many projectiles. This may not be a go-to option for every
spellcaster, but if you can set it up before you walk into a fight and if
you don’t normally have many uses for your Bonus Action, it’s a great boost
to your damage output.

anything to stop you, either by breaking your Concentration or by meddling
with the fireball. In some cases you may find that the fight is over or the
combatants have all relocated before you can trigger the effect. Possibly
your best option is for an ally who is exceptionally good at Dexterity
saving throws (especially if they can get Advantage and/or some other buff
like Resistance or Bless) to grab the fireball and throw it the maximum of
40 feet to trigger it somewhere more effective just before the spell’s
1-minute duration expires. If you can pull this off at the start of a fight,
22d6 damage is a great way to introduce yourself.

feet, which is plenty to accommodate a party of adventurers and a sizeable
retinue. The suggested 100 banquet guests would each have 50 square feet (a

example, is largely helpless against this spell.

difficult to manage for other enemies. 1 Intelligence and 1 Charisma is
obviously very poor, but what is the victim capable of? Could a character
use class features other than spellcasting? What are they smart enough to
do in combat? There’s a lot of room for the DM to interpret how this works
and which abilities creatures can still use. While that could be fun and
very effective, it also makes the spell’s effect totally dependent on the
DM and their interpretation of what an affected creature is mentally
capable of doing.

with a bunch of improvements. The damage is fully doubled, the damage type
is improved (though fire is still one of the most commonly resisted damage
types), and Dexterity saves are more effective than Constitution saves. The
damage roughly matches a Fireball cast at the same level (avg. 45 vs. avg.
45.5 for Fireball), and the damage applies every round for the full 1-minute
duration. However, it still retains some of Cloudkill’s biggest issues.
First, the damage applies when the spell is cast but only re-applies to
creatures inside the effect when they end their turn inside the cloud. With
a 20-foot radius, most creatures can easily walk out of the cloud. The spell
is also forced to move 10 feet every round, and the text explaining how that
works is absolutely nonsensical. RAW you get to choose the direction, but
you only get to choose that it moves directly away from you. Fortunately,
Jeremy Crawford clarified that

small area if you choose to do so.

              : A relatively safe way
to explore the Astral Plane, but it has some complications. Avoid Githyanki
at all cost; their silver swords can cut your astral cord and kill you
outright. If things ever look bad for you, spend the Action to return
everyone to their bodies. If any of your allies drop to 0 they’ll go back to
their body unharmed, but if you don’t see it happen you may not know about
it so you need to have a way for your party to contact your astral
projection from wherever you hid your bodies. If you ever get forcible
returned to your body and don’t have a chance to end the spell intentionally
and bring your allies back too, they can always get home by punching
themselves down to 0 hit points.
              <p>
               While you have this spell running, make sure that your party’s bodies are
hidden and protected somewhere that your enemies (or curious but hungry
monsters) can’t get to you, but that won’t be immediately dangerous if you
return to your body with no spell slots. A comfortable, but totally sealed
underground hideout is a great option that you could feasibly create using
Stone Shape and some patience.

but check with your DM; you may need to solve the issue of keeping your
bodies hydrated. Since you don’t need to breath, maybe submerge everyone
in a shallow pool of water fed by a Decanter of Endless Water? Or maybe
get a dedicated sect of monks to tend your bodies.

you’re exploring the Astral Plane, so this can be a good way to keep your

whatever.

you can drag them (potentially against their will and without a save) to
your location. This is easy to abuse by going to a plane where you know
they aren’t (pocket dimensions work great for this, but there are so
many planes that it’s hard to accidently be on the same one), then
forcibly summon them. You could summon your biggest antagonist after
spending a bunch of time setting up traps, buffs, and readied actions,
then have your party stomp them into the dirt. If you’re extra clever,
you can use Astral Projection to fight whatever you’re summoning whiel
projected so if something goes wrong you won’t actually die and you
could try again later. I think the intent of this function was to summon
an ally to help you in a fight, but I think my idea is more useful.

unclear what the back looks like or how it functions. It’s not described
as solid, so it’s entirely possibly that you can fire projectiles
through it from the rear, while projectiles from the front pass into the
portal. I can’t imagine that you can see through the portal, so this may
be hard to do, but it may be possible. Check with your DM.

Since nothing is specified, I presume that you’re left holding the
component. That means that you’re now responsible for ensuring that no one
ever casts a 9th-level Dispel Magic on that component, and you’re also not
allowed to use that component again for fear of releasing the previous
target. My advice: throw the component into a demiplane surrounded by traps.
If the target is portable (such as with the Sleep option), throw them in

to turning one ally into a CR 17+ dragon, turning up to 10 of your allies
into Tyrannosauruses (Tyrannosaurs? Tyrannosauri?) simply isn’t as
effective, even if the phrase “I turn us and our horses into
tyrannosauruses” is one of the coolest things I can think to say during a

turning your party of adventurers into toothy lizards may actually make them
weaker.

is fantastic and it certainly does plenty of it, if you don’t outright kill
your targets you’ll still need to deal with them the next round. Also, keep
in mind that targets can only be affected once, so don’t both making the

very difficult to know if the target has less than 100 hit points. And, even
if they do, Power Word Kill isn’t necessarily your best option. Meteor Swarm
deals an average of 140 damage, so if the target is at less than 100 hit
points they’re in trouble anyway. Granted, you can’t Meteor Swarm someone
across a dinner table, but I think Meteor Swarm will be more reliable in
most situations where you need to end a life in the space of a few

you to change forms to suit the situation at a moment’s notice. However, it
takes an action to change forms so you want to avoid doing so in combat.
Generally you should have a few go-to combat forms, but avoid any creature
that has spellcasting in its stat block, as losing the creature’s
spellcasting will typically reduce the creature’s CR considerably. If you’re
ever unsure what to pick, pick a dragon. It’s hard to go wrong with a
high-CR dragon.
