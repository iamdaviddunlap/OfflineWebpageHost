Construct is low complexity to\n\tbuild because so many of the decision points are essentially mandatory, but\n\tit&#8217;s high complexity to play because you&#8217;re managing a minion. Weapon is\n\tcomplex both to build and to play because Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s weapons are so\n\tintricate, and many of the modifications will add even more complexity to your\n\tStrikes by giving you new things to do with your weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The Construct Innovation is unique among minion features\n\tin that it allows you to give your Minion three Actions immediately, which\n\ttypically requires a class feat for other characters like the Druid and the\n\tRanger. Weirdly, Construct Innovation is also by far the easiest Inventor to\n\tbuild. There is an obvious feat choice at basically every level where you gain\n\ta Class Feat, so you rarely need to agonize over your build choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repairing your construct is crucial to making it effective. Sure, every\n\tInventor is going to maximize Craft, but you as the Inventor need to be able\n\tto use the Repair action to much greater effect because your construct&#8217;s\n\tcontinued existence depends on it. Expect to take feats like Quick Repair and\n\tSpecialty Crafting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s unclear what the DC is to repair your companion. Unlike\n\tTreat Wounds which allows you to optionally, Repair&#8217;s effectiveness is\n\tmultiplied based on your Proficiency, so the ideal situation is for the DC to\n\tbe low enough that Assurance makes a Critical Success a guarantee, but that\n\tseems unlikely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inventor&#8217;s class entry doesn&#8217;t require a Craft check to do anything built\n\tinto the class (such as rebuilding your destroyed construct) except to trigger\n\tthe Overdrive Action, which uses the &#8220;Standard&#8221; DC for your level, and that\n\tseems to be the best answer available. Tragically, Assurance won&#8217;t be a magic\n\tbullet here. It oscillates in and out of being a guaranteed Success depending\n\ton your level. Of course, that means that with maximized ranks, maximized\n\tIntelligence, and maybe an item bonus, you can roll a Critical Success\n\treasonably often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Construct Companion is limited in how it can benefit from items. &#8220;The\n\tonly item bonuses they can benefit from are to Speed.&#8221; This means no item\n\tbonuses to attack, AC, damage, saves, skills, etc. Improvements to your\n\tcompanion&#8217;s stats come almost exclusively from advanced along the Advanced,\n\tIncredible, Paragon track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"modifications\">Modifications<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Accelerated Mobility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup>: Extra movement speed is a helpful way to avoid spending your minions&#8217;\n\t\tactions to Stride multiple times in one turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Amphibious Construction<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup>: Only useful if you expect to be adventuring in and around water.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Increased Size<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup>: This causes your construct to occupy more space, which can be helpful for\n\t\tprotecting squishy members of your party, but may also make it difficult to\n\t\tbring your construct into small spaces.

Personally I\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t use this with a weapon that&#8217;s already Deadly because upgrading the\n\t\tDeadly die to d12 isn&#8217;t as impactful as adding a d8 to a weapon that doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thave it. If the weapon had Deadly d4 they wold be equivalent, but there are\n\t\tno Deadly d4 weapons as of this writing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhanced Damage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup>: Simple but effective. Works especially well with Megaton Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extensible Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup> (Melee only): Imagine a whip\n\t\twith 15-foot reach. It&#8217;s nice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Impossible Alloy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup>: Technically this is only situationally useful, but with 7 different types\n\t\tof metal there may be enough enemies where this matters that it&#8217;s worth the\n\t\tcost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Momentum Retainer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup> (Melee only): Similar to\n\t\tAttack Refiner. Combining any two or three of Agile, Backswing, and Forceful\n\t\tmakes for a very powerful weapon, but it&#8217;s hard to accomplish.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Omnirange Stabilizers<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup> (Ranged only): Very few\n\t\tweapons have the Volley trait, and for other weapons it&#8217;s rare to be in a\n\t\tsituation where you need that much range. Thrown weapons are a possible\n\t\texception since they typically have very short range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rune Capacity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GG<\/a><\/sup>: Weapon runes can do a lot.
