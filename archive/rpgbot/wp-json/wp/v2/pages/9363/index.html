It&#8217;s a martial Striker which\n\tcan branch out as a Face and Scout depending on your skills. But if you look\n\tat the Gunslinger and think &#8220;this is a fighter with guns (or crossbows,\n\ttechnically)&#8221;, you&#8217;re missing a lot of what makes the Gunslinger special.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The fundamental difficulty with using Firearms, much like crossbows, is that\n\tit costs actions to reload them. The Gunslinger goes to absurd lengths to\n\tStretch the action economy (and the hand economy in some cases) in order to\n\tmake firearms as effective as using a bow. Gunslingers will frequently have\n\tturns where they do 5 or more Actions worth of things. Several of those things\n\tare reloading, but it&#8217;s still pretty cool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Between the diversity of firearms and the four subclasses published in Guns\n\tand Gears (5 if you count the Spellshot archetype), there are enough options\n\tto cater to a wide variety of gunslinger concepts and builds, and there is\n\tplenty of room to experiment with different weapons as your character\n\tadvances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Gunslinger Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Gunslinger&#8217;s Way<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#conventional-alldexterity\">Conventional All-Dexterity<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#drifter-vanguard-and-kickback-weapon-enthusiasts\">Drifter, Vanguard, and Kickback Weapon Enthusiasts<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-skill-feats\">General Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats\">Gunslinger Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Gunslinger-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#weapons-drifter\">Way of the Drifter Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-pistolero\">Way of the Pistolero Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-sniper\">Way of the Sniper Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-vanguard\">Way of the Vanguard Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Gunslinger Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+ hit points is plenty for a\n\tback-line Striker like the Gunslinger. You won&#8217;t hold up if enemies focus\n\ttheir attacks on you, but at least you&#8217;re not running 6+ hit points like a\n\twizard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: Gunslingers are\n\toffense-heavy, but with only light armor, 8+ hit points, and poor Will saves,\n\tthey&#8217;re vulnerable both to focused attacks and to many spells.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span>: Among the best progressions in\n\t\tthe game, though a few classes like the Ranger and the Rogue hit proficiency\n\t\tadvances earlier than the Gunslinger.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Roughly average Fortitude\n\t\tsaves, really good Reflex saves (not quite as good as the Rogue), and among\n\t\tthe worst Will save progressions in the game. Don&#8217;t neglect your Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 4+Int Trained skills\n\t\tat level 1, which is average.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Attacks<\/span>: You match the Fighter for the\n\t\tbest weapon proficiency progression in the game, though only for firearms\n\t\tand crossbows. You even get Advanced firearms and crossbows, but the\n\t\tproficiency progression is one step behind Simple\/Martial firearms and\n\t\tcrossbows. Proficiency with other weapons is also one step behind firearms,\n\t\tand the Singular Expertise feature prevents you from changing that.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Light armor and medium, but\n\t\tthe Gunslinger is totally dependent on Dexterity, so light armor is your\n\t\tbest option. Your proficiency progression is typical for most non-tanky\n\t\tclasses.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: The Gungslinger&#8217;s class DC is used for very feat\n\t\tthings, but the Critical Specialization Effect for firearms calls for a\n\t\tFortitude save and gives the target Stunned 1 if they fail, which is really\n\t\tgood. Crossbows don&#8217;t care about your class DC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gunslinger&#8217;s Way<\/strong>: Subclasses &#8211; Gunslinger&#8217;s Way, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gunslinger Feats<\/strong>: See Gunslinger feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Singular Expertise<\/span>: Your non-firearm and\n\tnon-crossbow weapons are always one step behind your firearms and crossbows.\n\tThat&#8217;s not a problem for many gunslingers, but it&#8217;s a problem for difters and\n\tfor some vanugards. You get a very modest +1 circumstance bonus to damage, but\n\tcircumstance bonuses are common and the bonus doesn&#8217;t scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stubborn<\/span>: More Will saves and a second\n\tattempt to resist Control effects like the spell Dominate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gunslinger Weapon Mastery<\/span>: Master at level 5\n\tis really good, and you get critical specialization effects for firearms and\n\tcrossbows, so you&#8217;re both more likely to score a crit and you get more\n\tbenefits for doing so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilant Senses<\/span>: The Gunslinger&#8217;s Perception\n\tprogression is excellent. More is always great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage on weapon\n\tattacks, and since your proficiency is already Expert or Master with weapons\n\tthat gunslingers care about, you&#8217;re getting a better damage bonus than most\n\tclasses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advanced Deed<\/strong>: Varies by subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gunslinger Expertise<\/span>: More class DC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Reflex saves are the most common\n\ttype of &#8220;Basic Save&#8221;, and often Basic Saves are the ones where the difference\n\tbetween a Success and a Critical Success is the most significant. This will\n\tprotect from a lot of damage from area effects like fireballs and breath\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gunslinging Legend<\/span>: Legendary at level\n\t13.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Medium Armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC is always\n\twelcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Greater Deed<\/strong>: Varies by subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: You&#8217;re\n\tLegendary or Master in the weapons which you care about the most, so this is a\n\tbig damage boost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Juggernaut<\/span>: Better saves are always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shootist&#8217;s Edge<\/span>: More class DC, and you can\n\tattack at much longer range than normal before you need to worry about\n\tpenalties.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Senses<\/span>: Legendary in Perception\n\tfeels really good, and you&#8217;ll use it almost constantly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Medium Armor Mastery<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat. You get this a few levels behind martial classes like the Champion and\n\tthe Fighter, but you also need it less than they do.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Gunslinger&#8217;s Way<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-drifter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Ways.aspx?ID=1\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Way of the Drifter<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drifters are built to fight in or near melee using a melee weapon in one hand\n\tand a firearm in the other, most commonly a rapier and a pistol of some sort.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a pair of Blazons of Shared Power as soon as fundamental runes become an\n\toption. You&#8217;re going to use two weapons (sword and pistol, etc.) and\n\tenchanting both is prohibitively expensive compared to Blazons of Shared\n\tPower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Drifter and the Vanguard are both built for melee, it&#8217;s easy to\n\tdraw comparisons between the two. Drifters use two separate one-handed weapons\n\tand generally focus more on damage output, while vanguards use two-handed\n\tweapons and are typically more durable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Slinger&#8217;s Reload: Reloading Strike<\/span>:\n\t\tUnfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t remove the Manipulate trait from the Reload\n\t\taction, so if you&#8217;re in an enemy&#8217;s reach you may provoke Reactions. That\n\t\tmakes this difficult to use safely unless you&#8217;re using a reach weapon like a\n\t\twhip or a gnome flickmace. If you can manage to use this safely, you can\n\t\teasily switch between melee and ranged attacks, using Reloading Strike while\n\t\tin melee to reload your firearm before moving out of melee to get back to\n\t\tshooting.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Deeds<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Initial Deed: Into the Fray<\/span>: As many\n\t\t\t\tas three free Actions whenever you roll initiative. It won&#8217;t matter\n\t\t\t\tbeyond your first turn, but it also means that your first turn can be\n\t\t\t\tsomething more interesting than drawing weapons and getting into\n\t\t\t\tmelee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Advanced Deed: Finish the Job<\/span>: You&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tgoing to miss with attacks. It&#8217;s just a reality of the game. This takes\n\t\t\t\tsome of the sting out of missing, especially if your first attack in a\n\t\t\t\tturn misses despite not having a Multiple Attack Penalty.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Deed: Drifter&#8217;s Wake<\/span>: The\n\t\t\t\tfree Stride is nice, and I love that you can attack at any point during\n\t\t\t\tthe Stride, but there are some frustrating limitations due to\n\t\t\t\tammunition. First, you have no way to reload during all of this. If you\n\t\t\t\tstarted your turn without your crossbow\/firearm loaded, you&#8217;re down to\n\t\t\t\tjust melee attacks. Even if you were already loaded, most likely you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tonly going to make one ranged attack. Your best bet is to use your one\n\t\t\t\tloaded shot, use the Stride to move so that you&#8217;re flanking, make your\n\t\t\t\ttwo remaining Strikes with your melee weapoon. You might use your\n\t\t\t\tremaining movement to move out of melee reach, or you might stay in\n\t\t\t\tplace so that you&#8217;re helping an ally flank. On your next turn, reload\n\t\t\t\tyour firearm with Reloading Strike unless you&#8217;re happy to make three\n\t\t\t\tmelee attacks then Stride away.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Way Skill: Acrobatics<\/span>: While not\n\t\tincredibly useful on its own, Acrobatics lets you qualify for Cloud Step and\n\t\tImplausible Infiltration, both of which are spectacular.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-pistolero\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Ways.aspx?ID=2\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Way of the Pistolero<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple to play, effective, and perhaps the most iconic version of the\n\tGunslinger dating all the way back to its original publication in Pathfinder\n\t1. With a small dependence on Charisma, pistoleroes can serve as a Face\n\toutside of combat, and they have just a splash of debuff options on top of\n\ttheir role as a Striker in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raconteur&#8217;s Reload<\/span>: Create a Diversion is\n\t\tgreat, but it&#8217;s hard to make it work more than once in an encounter unless\n\t\tthe targets&#8217; Perception DC is absolutely awful. The Confabulator skill will help\nwith this, but it&#8217;s not infallible. Similarly, Demoralize will\n\t\tonly affect a target once, then they&#8217;re totally immune to your Demoralize\n\t\tfor 10 minutes. In lengthy encounters, that means that you either need to\n\t\tchange targets or repeatedly use Create a Diversion and hope for the best.\n\t\tAnd, to complicate things further, Create a Diversion&#8217;s benefits end at the\n\t\tend of your current turn, so you can&#8217;t use it to be hidden between turns unless\n\t\tyou spend another Action to either Hide or Sneak.\n\t\tEither way, this is going to lock you into Deception and\/or Intimidation.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Deeds<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Initial Deed: Ten Paces<\/span>: +2 to\n\t\t\t\tinitiative (it&#8217;s a Circumstance bonus so it doesn&#8217;t stack with\n\t\t\t\tIncredible Initiative), draw a weapon for free, and Step 10 feet at the\n\t\t\t\tbeginning of your turn so you don&#8217;t accidentally start in melee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Deed: Pistolero&#8217;s Retort<\/span>: A\n\t\t\t\tfree attack outside of your own turn. Multiple Attack Penalties reset\n\t\t\t\tevery turn (not every round) so no matter how many attacks you made on\n\t\t\t\tyour turn you can still make this attack if your crossbow\/firearm is\n\t\t\t\tloaded. Just remember that you need to have your weapon reloaded at the\n\t\t\t\tend of your turn, and if you&#8217;re attacking melee you might provoke\n\t\t\t\treactions from other enemies when you do so.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Deed: Grim Swagger<\/span>: This\n\t\t\t\tshould be the first thing you do (except for your free Steps from Ten\n\t\t\t\tPaces) at the beginning of every single encounter. Frightened 2 is a\n\t\t\t\thuge debuff, but you might also cause enemies to spend their first turn\n\t\t\t\tFleeing, which puts your party at a massive action economy\n\t\t\t\tadvantage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Way Skill: Deception or Intimidation<\/span>: Both\n\t\tgood Face skills, and you need either or both to make Raconteur&#8217;s Reload\n\t\twork.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-sniper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Ways.aspx?ID=3\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Way of the Sniper<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where pistoleros are brash, in your face, and use one-handed weapons, the\n\tSniper is generally more reserved, fights at longer range, and uses the\n\tbiggest two-handed weapon they can manage. Without the reliance on\n\tCharimsa-based skills, snipers make excellent Scouts, and in combat they&#8217;re a\n\tpure Striker with few frills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Covered Reload<\/span>: The sniper&#8217;s whole deal is\n\t\thiding and shooting stuff before going right back to hiding. Since reloading\n\t\ttypically takes an Action, you can Strike, Hide and Reload at the same time\n\t\tusing Covered Reload, then still have an Action to do something else. At\n\t\thigher level you&#8217;ll frequently use Sniper&#8217;s Aim and Vital Shot as your go-to\n\t\tattack options.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Deeds<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Initial Deed: One Shot, One Kill<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\tDraw a weapon and deal a little bit of extra damage on your first Strike\n\t\t\t\tin each encounter. Keep in mind that you need to use Stealth for\n\t\t\t\tinitiative, so you need to be really consistent about hiding before\n\t\t\t\tcombat starts.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Deed: Vital Shot<\/span>: Persistent\n\t\t\t\tdamage is really good and can add up very quickly, especially since this\n\t\t\t\tcan apply up to 3d6 of it. Most creatures can&#8217;t heal themselves to\n\t\t\t\tcounteract this, so given enough time this is guaranteed death for most\n\t\t\t\tcreatures. Ideally, you want to spread this around during combat so that\n\t\t\t\tevery enemy worth the time is bleeding.\n\t\t\t\t<p>To clarify how the damage works here: The amount of bleed damage\n\t\t\t\t\tmatches the damage dealt by One Shot, One Kill, so it&#8217;s 1d6, 2d6, or\n\t\t\t\t\t3d6 depending on your level. It doesn&#8217;t have any actual interaction\n\t\t\t\t\twith One Shot, One Kill. It just uses the damage progression.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Deed: Ghost Shot<\/span>: Covered\n\t\t\t\tReload allows you to hide and reload with one Action, so hiding usually\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t cut into your action economy very much unless you&#8217;re using a\n\t\t\t\tweapon with Capacity (an air repeater, a repeating crossbow, etc.), but\n\t\t\t\tthat&#8217;s not the entire benefit. Ghost Shot allows you to not give away\n\t\t\t\tyour location, which prevents enemies from moving to where you don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\thave cover, and it makes it hard for them to know where to Seek to find\n\t\t\t\tyou. You can make multiple shots in quick succession with a Capacity\n\t\t\t\tweapon, but even if you just use Ghost Shot, reload load, then use Ghost\n\t\t\t\tShot again that&#8217;s still a good turn.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Way Skill: Stealth<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to be\n\t\thiding a lot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-vanguard\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Ways.aspx?ID=4\" class=\"rating-orange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Way of the Vanguard<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vanguard tries to turn the Gunslinger into a melee-adjacent Defender.\n\tWhile there are some good ideas, the Vanguard doesn&#8217;t give the Gunslinger a\n\tmeaningful reason to be in melee in the first place, and if you&#8217;re not in\n\tmelee, you&#8217;re not using the Vanguard&#8217;s features, so why bother being a\n\tvanguard at all?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clear a Path<\/span>: Using Shove to push an\n\t\tenemy away from you before you reload means that reloading won&#8217;t provoke\n\t\tReactions (provided that you successfully Shoved the creature). You get a\n\t\tbonus to the Shove if your previous action was a ranged Striked wit hthe\n\t\tsame weapon, but that attack likely already triggered Reactions, so the\n\t\tbenefits of the Shove are minor in that case.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Deeds<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Initial Deed: Living Fortification<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\tGreat protection if you roll poorly on Initiative. The Mithral Tree is a\n\t\t\t\tgreat example of a firearm with the Parry trait.

The bonus\n\t\tdamage easily offsets the initial Action cost, but you generally want to use\n\t\tthis on enemies that really don&#8217;t want to be stuck in melee with you because\n\t\tmany tough martial enemies have the Opportunity Attack Reaction and will eat\n\t\tyou alive if you try using this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Come At Me!<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Focus on one target at a time.

Sure,\n\t\tthe Multiple Attack Penalty is going to make most of them horrendously\n\t\tinaccurate, but how cool does it feel to make six strikes in one turn? This\n\t\tfeat feels really cool, but fighting with two pistols is difficult with\n\t\tlittle reward, and this feat doesn&#8217;t solve that problem.

You want to have a big\n\t\tdamage die and ideally some property runes that will benefit from critical\n\t\thits like Flaming or Frost.

This will alos trigger your\n\t\tweapon&#8217;s critical specialization effect, so keep in mind what weapon you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing: crossbows will immobilize the target until they spend an Action to\n\t\tEscape, and firearms will force the target to make a save or be Stunned 1,\n\t\trobbing them of an Action on their turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Piercing Critical<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: More critical hits is great, but since you can score a critical hit by\n\t\texceeding the target&#8217;s AC by 10, critting on a 19 isn&#8217;t as important as it\n\t\twas in PF1 or as it is in DnD. That means that we need to look at the\n\t\tfundamental math of the game to figure out if this is worth the feat. By\n\t\tthis level you&#8217;re Legendary with firearms, you should have 20 or 22 Dexterity\ndepending on whether or not you have an &#8220;Apex Item&#8221;, and you should have +3 weapons, so\n\t\tyour attack bonus is +34 or +35 before considering temporary modifiers. The\n\t\tGamemastery Guide&#8217;s rules for constructing creatures include a table of AC\n\t\tprogressions (table 2-5, page 62) which we can use to do math. An extreme AC for\n\t\ta level 18 creature is 45, which means that we hit on a 10 and a 20 will\n\t\texceed the target&#8217;s AC by 10. That means that for enemies of your level with\n\t\textreme AC, you&#8217;re only scoring a critical hit on a natural 20.\n\t\tBy extension, that means that Piercing Critical doubles your likelihood of\n\t\tscoring a critical hit against those creatures. Such creatures are rare, but\n\t\tif you&#8217;re facing higher-level foes, Piercing Critical becomes progressively more\n\t\tuseful against foes that are higher level than you are.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unerring Shot<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Only worthwhile if you find that you&#8217;re frequently suffering range\n\t\tpenalties.

I&#8217;m also going to assume that you&#8217;re using\n\t&#8220;classic firearms&#8221; rather than something more advanced.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-drifter\">Way of the Drifter Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Drifters are built to fight with a melee weapon in one hand and a ranged\n\tweapon in the other. You can certainly build around both Strength and\n\tDexterity, but there&#8217;s little reason to do so. More likely you&#8217;ll have a\n\tsplash of Strength for bonus melee damage, but you&#8217;ll otherwise build around\n\tDexterity. That means finesse weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because drifters are comfortable in or near melee, range is much less of a\n\tconcern. Short-range weapons like dragon mouth pistols work better for\n\tdrifters than for pistoleros who typically don&#8217;t want to be in melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combination weapons and bayonettes look tempting for drifters, but they&#8217;re a\n\ttrap. Reloading Strike requires separate one-handed weapons. You could try two\n\tone-handed combination weapons, but doing so means that you&#8217;re using two\n\tweapons which are both worse and more expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Double-Barreled Pistol<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Less damage than a typical pistol, but having two barrels means that when\n\t\tyou&#8217;re in melee you can load two barrels by using Reloading Strike twice,\n\t\tthen make two shots when you get out of melee.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Main-Gauche<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Poor damage, but the Parry trait offers a way to boost your AC when\n\t\tyou&#8217;re stuck in melee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapier<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Deadly d8 is tempting, but your firearm is still your primary weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shortsword<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Agile is great since your firearm is your primary weapon. Once you get\n\t\tDrifter&#8217;s Juke, you&#8217;ll get a lot of mileage out of Agile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Whip<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Reach means that you can use this with Reloading Strike without being in\n\t\tyour target&#8217;s reach. Drifters don&#8217;t get a way to negate opportunity attacks\n\t\twhen you use a ranged weapon in melee, so this makes it easy to use your\n\t\tfirearm and melee weapon in the same turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-pistolero\">Way of the Pistolero Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Pistolero is among the simplest gunslingers. The majority of pistoleros\n\twill use a single one-handed weapon. Some will instead of use two, but doing\n\tso is a build on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using two weapons, you want either a Capacity weapon or an air\n\trepeater. Air repeaters trade low damage for the ability to make 5 attacks\n\tbefore needing to reload, which takes 3 Actions and requires free hands, so\n\tyou want to avoid it in combat if you can. Capacity weapons take 1 Action to\n\tchange barrels, but doing so doesn&#8217;t require a free hand, so you can use\n\tPaired Shots, then spend some actions to rotate barrels. That all sounds\n\tgreat, but then you take Dual-Weapon Reload at level 1 and your capacity\n\tweapons are made obsolete by a pair dueling pistols.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Air Repeater<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Less damage than a dueling pistol, but the ability to make 5 Strikes\n\t\tbefore you need to reload means that you can output damage much faster,\n\t\tespecially if you get weapon property runes that add more damage per hit.\n\t\tThe three actions to reload are brutal in combat, but you can use\n\t\tRaconteur&#8217;s Reload three times in total to reload. You can also get a set of\n\t\tBlazons of Shared Power, and instead of reloading you can just use another\n\t\trepeater in your other hand, allowing you to make a total of 10 Strikes\n\t\tbefore you reload.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clan Pistol<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Trade the Dueling Pistol&#8217;s Concealable trait for another 20 ft. of\n\t\trange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Double-Barreled Pistol<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Less damage than a typical pistol, but having two barrels means that you\n\t\tcan attack multiple times before needing to reload, making reloading a bit\n\t\tmore convenient. You might have turns where you reload several times and\n\t\tturns where you fire multiple times and don&#8217;t reload at all.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling Pistol<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: The go-to weapon for the Gunslinger. Concealable, concussive, fatal d10,\n\t\t1d6 base damage, and 60 ft. range is enough to keep you at a very\n\t\tcomfortable distance from your enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flintlock Pistol<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Players native to Pathfinder 1st edition likely look first to the\n\t\tFlintlock Pistol, but this is a mistake. Get a dueling pistol instead. The\n\t\tonly reason for a gunslinger to use a flintlock pistol over a dueling pistol\n\t\tis that you can actually afford two of them at level 1.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hand Cannon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Larger damage die than the Flintlock Pistol, and the Modular trait means\n\t\tthat it can also deal slashing damage. But a weapon with Concussive is\n\t\tgenerally good enough that you don&#8217;t need to worry about damage type. The\n\t\trange is also poor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hand Crossbow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: As much damage and range as the Dueling Pistol, but you give up\n\t\tConcealable, Concussive, and Fatal d10 for the Hand Crossbow&#8217;s relative\n\t\tquietness compared to a firearm.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pepperbox<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: A trap. Take dual-weapon reload and go for dueling pistols.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Slide Pistol<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: A trap. Take dual-weapon reload and go for dueling pistols.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-sniper\">Way of the Sniper Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Snipers typically make a very small number of high-damage attacks. Therefore,\n\tyou want the biggest, highest-damage weapon you can get and the longest range\n\tyou can manage so that you can fight from a comfortable distance without\n\tworrying about range penalties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sniper&#8217;s best weapons have the Kickback trait, so you&#8217;ll want to use a\n\tstabilizer, take the Sniper&#8217;s Aim feat at 6th level, or have 14 Strength to\n\tnegate the penalty. If you don&#8217;t have 14 Strength, a monopod reduces the\n\tpenalty from Kickback to -1 without cutting into your action economy at the\n\tbeginning of an encounter. A tripod negates the penalty, but takes an action.\n\tA shielded tripod lets you Take Cover, so after you spend the Action to set it\n\tup you can use Sniper&#8217;s Reload to Take Cover behind it and reload in a single\n\tAction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arquebus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Compared to the Jezail, the Arquebus adds the Kickback property in\n\t\texchange for another 60 feet of range. While that&#8217;s an impressive addition,\n\t\tmost encounters won&#8217;t make that range difference meaningful, so managing\n\t\tkickback will often be a frustrating allocation of resources and effort for\n\t\tminimal benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crossbow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 30 feet more range than the Jezail, and much quieter than a firearm, but\n\t\tyou do give up both Concussive and Fatal Aim d12, so while a crossbow is\n\t\tsubtler than a firearm it&#8217;s also less lethal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flintlock Musket<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Probably your starting gun, but you want to upgrade as soon as you can\n\t\tafford to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Harmona Gun<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: The biggest damage die you can get on a firearm and 150 ft. range, but\n\t\toffset by Kickback. If you got this route, you&#8217;re expecting to fight from as\n\t\tfar away as possible and you&#8217;re relying on that d10 damage die to do all of\n\t\tthe work.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavy Crossbow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Not good enough to justify the 2 Actions to reload it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jezail<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: While you can use the Jezail one-handed, snipers generally don&#8217;t have a\n\t\treason to do so. If you&#8217;re using the Jezail two-handed, it&#8217;s a linear\n\t\tupgrade from the Flintlock Musket, improving the damage die by one step,\n\t\tadding 20 feet of range, and increasing the Fatal die size by one step.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-vanguard\">Way of the Vanguard Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Vanguards are built to fight in or near melee using a two-handed firearm, and\n\tthe Vanguard&#8217;s features and feats require Athletics checks, so you need the\n\tStrength to back up Athletics. That means that combination weapons and weapons\n\twith Kickback are easier to manage than they are for more gunslingers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arquebus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Vanguards are typically in the thick of melee, but since you have the\n\t\tStrength to offset Kickback, it&#8217;s a straight upgrade compared to the\n\t\tJezail<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blunderbuss<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Short range, but Scatter makes it easier to handle crowds (though the\n\t\tdamage from Scatter isn&#8217;t amazing). Add Large-Bore Modifications when you\n\t\tcan to get more Scatter range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crossbow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 30 feet more range than the Jezail, and much quieter than a firearm, but\n\t\tyou do give up both Concussive and Fatal Aim d12, so while a crossbow is\n\t\tsubtler than a firearm it&#8217;s also less lethal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarven Scattergun<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: 10 feet more range than the Blunderbuss and it adds the Kickback trait.\n\t\tVanguards have the Strength to negate Kickback, so it&#8217;s a minor upgrade. If\n\t\tyou hit 18 Strnegth, add Large-Bore Modifications when you can to get more\n\t\tScatter range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavy Crossbow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Not good enough to justify the 2 Actions to reload it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Jezail<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: While you can use the Jezail one-handed, snipers generally don&#8217;t have a\n\t\treason to do so. If you&#8217;re using the Jezail two-handed, it&#8217;s a linear\n\t\tupgrade from the Flintlock Musket, improving the damage die by one step,\n\t\tadding 20 feet of range, and increasing the Fatal die size by one step.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Tree<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: The Parry trait is great for the Vanguard, offering a way to boost your\n\t\tAC while you&#8217;re in melee. Grab a Reinforced Stock for melee attacks, and\n\t\tyou&#8217;re good to go.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reinforced Stock<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: This turns any weapon into a combination weapon. The majority of actual\n\t\tcombination weapons which appeal to vanguards will deal more damage (d8),\n\t\tbut will have worse firearm damage. Which you prefer depends on how much\n\t\ttime you expect to spend in melee.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explorer&#8217;s Clothing<\/span>: Once you reach 10th\n\t\tlevel, your Dexterity could reach 20. At that point, Explorer&#8217;s Clothing\n\t\tprovides the same AC as Leather Armor, but without a check penalty and with\n\t\tless Bulk. You&#8217;ll still want to put runes on it to boost your AC, bu\n\t\ttransferring runes from your previous armor is easy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leather<\/span>: Most gunslingers will live in\n\t\tLeather armor until they raise their Dexterity to 20, and even then you only\n\t\tneed to change to Explorer&#8217;s Clothing if you don&#8217;t have 10 Strength.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Studded Leather<\/span>: If you start with 16\n\t\tDexterity, this may be the right choice. You&#8217;ll get the same AC as Leather\n\t\tarmor with 18 Dexterity, and since the Dex cap doesn&#8217;t matter beyond your\n\t\tAC, raising your Dexterity doesn&#8217;t mandate changing armor. However, the\n\t\tStrength Threshold is higher than Leather, so if you don&#8217;t have 12 Strength\n\t\tyou might change to Leather once you have 18 Dexterity, provided that you\n\t\thave 10 Strength to meet Leather&#8217;s Strength Threshold.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chain Shirt<\/span>: Noisy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hide \/ Scale Mail<\/span>: Fine options if you\n\t\twant to stop at 14 Dexterity, but there&#8217;s little reason to do so.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<!--\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\">Artillerist<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>:\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\">Beast Gunner<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>:\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\">Bullet Dancer<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>:\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\">Demolitionist<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>:\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\">Firework Technician<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>:\n\t<\/li>\n\t-->\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pistol Phenom<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GaG<\/a><\/sup>: Depends on your ability to make Pistol Twirl worthwile, and you need to\n\t\tinvest in Performance to make the feats work, which is frustrating because\n\t\tPerformance has such limited uses otherwise.
