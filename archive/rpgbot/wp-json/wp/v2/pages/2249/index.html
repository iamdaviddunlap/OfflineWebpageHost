Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"introduction\">Introduction<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you just want to get really angry and hit stuff. I get it. The\n\tBarbarian is almost exclusively limited to a defender\/striker role, but that\n\tdoes not make them boring by any means.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Barbarian Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hit Points<\/span>: d12 is the biggest hit die in\n\tthe game.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Full BAB.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Fortitude is the Barbarian&#8217;s only\n\tgood save.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor, shields, and\n\tmartial weapons. That gets you everything you need to get by, but not having\n\theavy armor can be a problem for low-dexterity Barbarians who need a decent\n\tAC.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill points, and a few decent\n\tskills.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Movement<\/span> (Ex): Some extra move speed\n\tis nice when you like to get into melee combat quickly, and it offsets the\n\tspeed lost by wearing medium armor. Remember that it doesn&#8217;t work in heavy\n\tarmor, so be sure to trade this in for an ACF if you want heavy armor.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Illiteracy<\/span>: REEDING IS FOAR WIZZURDS.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rage<\/span> (Ex): Rage is why your play a\n\tBarbarian. it&#8217;s good at first level and it stays good at every level. This is\n\tthe primary reason for Barbarian class dips, and since Rage doesn&#8217;t improve\n\tuntil 11th level, a single level dip into Barbarian is very appealing for many\n\tStrength-based builds. The only thing you give up by not sticking to Barbarian\n\tis users per day, but you can pick up Extra Rage if you really need it.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Trap Sense<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Very\n\tsituational.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Damage Reduction<\/span> (Ex): DR\/- is fantastic,\n\tbut it scales very slowly, and won&#8217;t make up for a real AC.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Rage<\/span> (Ex): More rage bonuses! By\n\tthis level your Strength should be boosted by at least a +4 enhancement bonus,\n\tso your Strength should be extremely high while raging.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indomitable Will<\/span> (Ex): Enchantment is one\n\tof the most dangerous schools, especially for a raging Barbarian who could\n\teasily murder their own party, so a bonus on saves is helpful. However,\n\tEnchantment effects still make up a very small minority of magic in the game,\n\tso this is situational at best.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tireless Rage<\/span> (Ex): Fatigued is essentiall\n\tnothing, but it&#8217;s nice that you can continue to burn through rages without\n\tconsequence.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Mighty Rage<\/span> (Ex): Still more rage bonuses!\n\tBy this level an extra +2 is pretty small, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Berserker Rage<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: The biggest limitation on Rage is its limited number of uses per day, so\n\t\tnaturally you need to be careful to only use it when you need it. Berserker\n\t\tRage makes that decision for your: If you fall below 5xlevel hit points, you\n\t\tneed to Rage. You get that wonderful Strength bonus, but not the dangerous\n\t\tConsitution bonus which can take you from angry to dead instantly at the end\n\t\tof your Rage. You get a typeless bonus to all saves instead of the Con bonus\n\t\tto Fortitude and the Morale bonus to saves against fear. On top of all that,\n\t\tyou get bonus DR which stacks with your existing Barbarian DR. Altogether\n\t\tthis is a really great trade. The rules don&#8217;t explain how your rage ends if\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t recieve healing, so RAW you can stay in Rage for days while your\n\t\tnatural healing kicks in.
