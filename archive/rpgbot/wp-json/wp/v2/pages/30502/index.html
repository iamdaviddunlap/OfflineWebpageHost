Mechanically, it&#8217;s a fantastic support build which can add a ton of durability to your party, as well as helping your party to focus on important targets with Flavor Blast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While Monster Dish is the subclass&#8217;s signature feature, Flavor Blast is arguably more important to whether or not a Gastronomer Wizard will be effective at the table. Before you pick this subclass, encourage your party to choose player options like Path of the Beast Barbarian, Circle of the Moon Druid, Beast Master Ranger, or the Dhampir lineage so that they have bit attacks to benefit from Flavor Blast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The folks at Mage Hand Press were kind enough to provide a physical review\n\tcopy for this article.

Yes,\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/tools\/#cooks-tools\">that is a thing<\/a\n\t\t>.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monster Dish<\/span>: The subclass&#8217;s signature\n\t\tfeature, this allows you to turn a dead body into a massive pool of\n\t\tTemporary Hit Points. It scales with CR, so the THP granted will naturally\n\t\tscale as your party gains levels. The minimum is always 1d6, but you could in\n\t\ttheory get 30d6 for killing something of CR 30 like the Tarrasque.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unfortunately, you only get to use this once per day, and the corpse can\n\t\t\tonly be 24 hours old. Your most likely use case is to use this when your\n\t\t\tparty takes its first Short Rest in a day, and you can prepare one of the\n\t\t\tenemies you defeated that day. If you&#8217;re adventuring on back-to-back\n\t\t\tdays, you might drag around the body of the scariest thing you fought\n\t\t\trecently.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that Gentle Repose is a Ritual, and it will keep your next feast\n\t\t\tfrom spoiling despite a lack of refrigeration. There&#8217;s no mechanic which\n\t\t\tmakes this necessary, but it might quiet some awkward questions.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flavor Blast<\/span>: Massively dependent on\n\t\tyour party composition. Since this only benefits bite attacks, it&#8217;s only\n\t\tgood if your party uses bite attacks. If no one in your party bites things,\n\t\tthis is functionally a dead level.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If your party does use bite attacks as a go-to offensive option, this\n\t\t\tcould be nearly perpetual Advantage on attacks against targets of your\n\t\t\tchoosing. Use reliable low-level spells like Tasha&#8217;s Mind Whip to force\n\t\t\tfailed saves, and encourage your party to line up at the buffet. You could\n\t\t\tsummon creatures with bite attacks to add even more mouths, but Wizards\nget surprisingly few options to summon things that bite.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bottomless Feast<\/span>: Heroes&#8217; Feast is an\n\t\tamazing buff, but it&#8217;s too expensive to cast on a daily basis even in 5e\n\t\twhere money is functionally useless. Remember that it increases targets&#8217;\n\t\tmaximum hp rather than granting Temporary Hit Points, so you can absolutely\n\t\tcombine this with Monster Dish to massively pad your party&#8217;s hit points.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ravenous Magic Mouth<\/span>: A one per day\n\t\tcombat summon. Much like Spiritual Weapon, it&#8217;s not a creature, it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\toccupy space, and it can&#8217;t be attacked or destroyed. It doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\tConcentration, either, which is pretty great. If you&#8217;re facing Medium-sized\n\t\tenemies, using the mouth to swallow them is a great way to take enemies out\n\t\tof the fight potentially permanently. The damage of the bite and the acid\n\t\taren&#8217;t crazy high, but having an enemy in a pocket dimension taking ongoing\n\t\tdamage means that they&#8217;re dying and can&#8217;t do a thing to hurt you, so this is\n\t\teffectively a save-or-suck every round as a Bonus Action for a full minute.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>It&#8217;s not clear if the mouth benefits from Flavor Blast. It&#8217;s not a\n\t\t\tcreature. RAW I think it does not since you are commanding the mouth to\n\t\t\tattack, rather than making a bite attack yourself. But I do think that the\n\t\t\tintent is for this to work with Flavor Blast. Check with your DM.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">School of Gastronomy Wizard Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2685\">typical wizard<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">School of Gastronomy Wizard Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#races\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2685\">typical wizard<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">School of Gastronomy Wizard Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly the same as a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2685\">typical wizard<\/a>.

By this level you have a ton of spell slots, but you&#8217;re still routinely using level 1 and 2 spells like Absorb Elements and Shield, so melting down mid-level spell slots to get a ton of extra level 1 and 2 spell slots can be very effective.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Signature Spell:<br>&#8211; Any 2 3rd-Level Spells<br>Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>There aren&#8217;t any amazing 3rd-level spells that synergize well here, so choose whatever works for a typical Wizard.

Mechanically, it&#8217;s a fantastic support build which can add a ton of durability to your party, as well as helping your party to focus on important targets with Flavor Blast. While Monster Dish is the subclass&#8217;s signature feature, Flavor Blast is arguably more important to whether or not a Gastronomer Wizard will be effective at the table.
