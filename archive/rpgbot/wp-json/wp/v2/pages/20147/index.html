Then it gives\n\t\tany weapon you add the Thrown property, which builds very nicely off of\n\t\tCrushing Throw. And, finally, if you do throw the weapon, it immediately\n\t\treturns to your hand in time for the rest of your extra attacks. A lot of\n\t\tpeople will take this subclass so they can be large, but this here is the\n\t\treal power behind the Path of the Giant: the first barbarian that&#8217;s fully\n\t\tfunctional at range.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Mighty Impel<\/span>: If throwing weapons isn&#8217;t\n\t\tenough for you, with Mighty Impel you can also throw creatures.

The\n\t\t30-foot range is easily enough to put enemies into dangerous locations like\n\t\tan ongoing spell effect or into positions where they can&#8217;t fight back, such\n\t\tas in a pit, out a window, or on a high ledge where their melee weapons\n\t\tcan&#8217;t reach anyone. It&#8217;s only green because occasionally you won&#8217;t fight\n\t\tsomething small enough for you to just throw into the sky for free falling\n\t\tdamage and prone.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that you can do this before attacking, so you might choose to\n\t\t\tuse this and forgo Reckless Attack for the round.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Demiurgic Colossus<\/span>: Get larger (if you\n\t\tchoose), have more reach (independent of size changing), and do more damage\n\t\twith your Elemental Cleaver.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Path of the Giant Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>This is still a Barbarian.
