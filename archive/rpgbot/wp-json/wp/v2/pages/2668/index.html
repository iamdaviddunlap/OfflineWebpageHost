The image of a rough-hewn explorer braving a\n\tdangerous world with a loyal beast at their side is a classic fantasy trope,\n\tand the Beast Master executes on that trope very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One word of caution: If you think a drow ranger who fights with two swords\n\tand has a panther as their beast companion, <em>it has been done<\/em>. By some\n\tbizzarre feat of group think, every new player at one point in their career\n\twill arrive at this character concept independently. The idea may have\n\toriginated from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Drizzt_Do%27Urden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drizzt Do&#8217;Urden<\/a>,\n\tliterally the most iconic ranger in DnD&#8217;s history, but I&#8217;m not confident in\n\tthat assertion because I&#8217;ve met numerous new players experiencing this\n\tphenomena who have never heard of Drizzt, the Forgotten Realms, or any other\n\testablished proper nouns, real or imagined. I&#8217;m starting to believe that R. A.\n\tSalvatore may have been an early victim of this phenomenon rather than the\n\toriginator of the idea. But none of that will help you mechanically optimize\n\tyour character, so let&#8217;s move on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Player&#8217;s Handbook presents the Ranger&#8217;s Companion feature, and Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything presents a replacement feature called Primal Companion. Primal Companion is both easier and more effective than Ranger&#8217;s Companion, and I recommend using it instead of Ranger&#8217;s Companion in every case, but I&#8217;m not you and I try to encourage people to make their own decisions, so advice for both version of the subclass is presented below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/dnd-5e-beast-master-ranger-handbook\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15652\">Beast Master Ranger Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master-v2\">Beast Master with Primal Companion<\/h4>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>While not officially a &#8220;version 2&#8221; of the subclass, the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/ranger#PrimalCompanion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Primal Companion<\/a>\n\treplacement feature completely alters the way the the beast Master functions.\n\tThe simple correction to the action economy around managing your beast frees\n\tthe Ranger to do other things with their Action, and while that will typically\n\tmean attacking for most rangers don&#8217;t feel the need to limit yourself to\n\tmartial attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casting spells which take an Action feel like much less of a commitment than\n\tfor most rangers, and you should strongly consider Fighting Style (Druidic\n\tWarrior) and pursue cantrips as your go-to combat option since your companion\n\tuses your Spellcasting Attack Modifier for its attack bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you&#8217;re not attacking using your Bonus Action (TWF and Crossbow Expert\n\tbuilds are staple ranger options), Hunter&#8217;s Mark and Favored Foe become less\n\tof a crucial part of your tactics so you can explore other combat options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Companion<\/span>: Your defining feature,\n\t\tyour companion is equal parts pet and weapon. Unlike summoned pets which\n\t\tother classes might use (Dancing Item, Wildfire Spirit, etc.), your pet\n\t\tsticks around all the time. You don&#8217;t need to summon it or whatever.\n\t\tHowever, like any other member of your party it needs food, healing,\n\t\tetc.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exceptional Training<\/span>: Making your\n\t\tcompanion&#8217;s attacks magical is the only thing you actually benefit from\n\t\there, but it&#8217;s crucial. Resistance to non-magic weapon attacks is common and\n\t\tbecomes more common as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestial Fury<\/span>: Your beast gets two attacks\n\t\tand it still only costs you a Bonus Action (or half of an Attack action) to command them.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Share Spells<\/span>: This is a fantastic way to\n\t\tshare buff spells, especially those which require Concentration.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master-primal-companion\">Primal Companion Options<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything presents a replacement mechanic for the Beast Master&#8217;s Companion feature. Rather than selecting an animal with a published stat block, you pick from one of three generic beasts and you can describe it however you like. If you want a sabretooth tiger, a dinosaur, a komodo dragon, or just a dog, you&#8217;re using the same stat block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More important than simplifying the challenges of picking a companion, the\n\tnew Companion feature also corrects the action economy issues which were the\n\tfundamental problem which made the Beast Master such a poor option. Commanding\n\tyour companion is now done as a Bonus Action, allowing you to do interesting\n\tthings on your turn like attacking or casting spells without leaving your pet\n\tto stand adjacent to your enemies and Dodge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raising your companion from the dead now takes a spell slot (so long as you\n\tdo so within an hour of its death), allowing you throw your companion into\n\tcombat with little regard for its safey confident in the knowledge that you\n\tcan bring it right back to life good as new. Obviously that&#8217;s a horrible way\n\tto treat an animal that you&#8217;re supposed to be emotionally bonded with, but\n\tthis is a game, your companion is a class feature, and as a DM I wouldn&#8217;t make\n\ta fighter spend 8 hours feeding a wild longsword table scraps until they were\n\tfriends, so no one should hold rangers to the same standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing your companion is also much easier now. If you suddenly find\n\tyourself on a boat trip and want a suitable aquatic companion, you can change\n\tyour companion after a Long Rest. This may be hard for players who want to\n\tbond with a single animal, but you might choose to think of your ranger as\n\tmaster of <em>all<\/em> beasts rather than a master of just one beast that you\n\tdrag around everywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only shortcoming of the Primal Companion feature is the limited set of\n\tcompanion choices. None of them appear to work as mounts (though your DM might\n\tstill allow it), and no matter how you dress up the stats any two beast\n\tmasters are going to feel very similar to one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Beast of the Land<\/span>: Simple and iconic.\n\t\tWith 40 ft. land and climb speed, this thing can get around very quickly.\n\t\tThe damage will match or exceed a weapon, and Charge allows your companion\n\t\tto knock foes prone if they can get a running start. Unfortunately, since\n\t\tyour beast only gets one attack until you get Bestial Fury at level 11, it\n\t\tcan&#8217;t capitalize on knocking enemies prone on its own for half of the level\n\t\trange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beast of the Sea<\/span>: Only viable in aquatic\n\t\tcampaigns. 5-foot land speed is not enough for your sharktopus to hobble\n\t\taround on land and be effective in combat. If you can somehow get its speed\n\t\tup to reasonable amount (look for spells like Longstrider with long\n\t\tdurations which don&#8217;t require Concentration), you may be able to make this\n\t\twork on land. If you can do it, the Beast of the Sea&#8217;s attacks grapple when\n\t\tthey hit, which is a powerful option not normally available to players.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast of the Sky<\/span>: 60-foot fly speed and\n\t\tFlyby. Less hit points than the other options, but with the ability to\n\t\tremain perpetually out of melee reach that&#8217;s less of a problem. The damage\n\t\tis also slightly lower than Beast of the Land, but Beast of the Land deals\n\t\t6.5+PB on average and the Beast of the Sky&#8217;s 5.5+PB isn&#8217;t noticably lower.\n\t\tHaving a flying companion discourages you from using your companion as a\n\t\tDefender by interposing itself between you and your enemies, but Beast of\n\t\tthe Sky&#8217;s AC is just as good as the other options and if your companion&#8217;s\n\t\thit points are looking problematic it can use Flyby to withdraw to\n\t\tsafety.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master-v1\">Beast Master with Ranger&#8217;s Companion<\/h4>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The original version of the Beast Master faces several mechanical issues, the\n\tlargest of which are the lack of viable companion options and the frankly\n\tawful action economy. Commanding your companion to attack consumes one of your\n\tattacks when you take the Attack action, so rather than pointing your\n\tcompanion at an enemy then doing your own thing you spend your Action every\n\tturn commanding your companion while you run around in the background largely\n\tuseless except as a target for ranged attacks. Staple options like Hunter&#8217;s\n\tMark and Favored Foe are largely worthless for the Beast Master, so you give\n\tup staple class options and get back what amounts to a disappointing set of\n\tremote control teeth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do choose to play the original Beast Master, the biggest decision to\n\tmake is your type of companion, and while there is an abundance of options the\n\tvast majority of them are absolute garbage. Assuming you&#8217;re fine with one of\n\tthe handful of truly effective options, your companion can be an effective\n\taddition to the party. However, remember that your companion gets just 4 hit\n\tpoints per ranger level and will have a fairly low AC compared to yours, so\n\tyour companion will require frequent healing and protection which can make it\n\ta frustrating tax on your party&#8217;s limited resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger&#8217;s Companion<\/span>: Your choice of\n\t\tcompanion is as defining as your choice of Fighting Style.

Swallow adds an additional way to inhibit (and often kill) small\n\t\tcreatures, many of which are bad at escaping grapples. Despite the low DC to\n\t\tescape the frog&#8217;s grapple, it still costs the target their action to do so,\n\t\twhich means that the target is wasting the bulk of their turn just\n\t\toffsetting the effects of your pet. In many encounters, that could be a\n\t\tfight-winning advantage. Once you get Bestial Fury at 11th level, remember\n\t\tthat Swallow is a specific action, not a type of attack, so your frog can&#8217;t\n\t\tbite something and swallow it on the same turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Poisonous Snake<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MM<\/a><\/sup>: Blindsight (though the range is tiny), poison with very solid damage, and\n\t\ta swim speed, but the poison allows a save and the DC won&#8217;t scale so you&#8217;ll\n\t\tbe less effective against creatures with good Constitution saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Giant Rat<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MM<\/a><\/sup>: Darkvision, Keen Smell, and Pack Tactics.

This companion is a durable fighting companion with some minor supportive abilities, and over time the drake grows in size and gains the ability to fly and serve as a mount. With the ability to serve as an essentially disposable front-line martial character, the drake is a powerful and effective pet welcome in practically any party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drakewarden and the Beast Master share many similarities, so see &#8220;Beast Master vs. Drakewarden&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/drakewarden\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31499\">Drakewarden Ranger Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Draconic Gift<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thaumaturgy<\/span>: Fun flavor, but rarely\n\t\t\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tongue of the Dragons<\/span>: Not especially\n\t\t\t\tuseful for the Ranger since they&#8217;re not a good Face, but your drake\n\t\t\t\tspeaks draconic so it&#8217;s nice to be able to talk to it.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drake Companion<\/span>: The central feature of\n\t\tthe Drakewarden. Drake Companion is modeled very similarly to the Primal\n\t\tCompanions introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything, and follows very\n\t\tsimilar rules for commanding it, summoning it, what happens if it &#8220;dies&#8221;\n\t\t(it&#8217;s a spirit that you summon back into physical form).\n\t\t<p>The drake is a decent tank with a starting AC of 16 and a decent pool of\n\t\t\thit points, and since you can replace with for the cost a spell slot of\n\t\t\tany spell level, you can afford to throw your drake in front of you to\n\t\t\tdefend you while you do things like archery.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>While the drake is already a decent combat pet, it also improves as you\n\t\t\tgain levels, adding additional damage, the ability to fly, and the ability\n\t\t\tto be used as a mount.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Infused Stikes notably uses the phrase &#8220;extra damage&#8221;, which means that\n\t\t\tthe additional die is multiplied on a critical hit.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Bond of Fang and Scale<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drake Mount<\/span>: This is the first class\n\t\t\t\tfeature we&#8217;ve gotten which provides a mount with scaling hit points. 5th\n\t\t\t\tedition has been out for 6+ years.\n\t\t\t\t<p>While this is obviously an amazing benefit, it has some serious\n\t\t\t\t\tchallenges if you&#8217;re eyeing a mounted combat build. The drake is\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligent, which means that it&#8217;s an uncontrolled mount. That means\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it acts on its own turn, which the Drake Companion feature\n\t\t\t\t\tspecifies is immediately after yours. Taking your full turn (or taking\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ready action) then waiting for your drake to move somewhere\n\t\t\t\t\tconvenient for you isn&#8217;t helpful for melee builds, and even for ranged\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilds it&#8217;s often frustating because you can&#8217;t reposition to deal with\n\t\t\t\t\tcover or enemies who are slightly out of range. If you can make it\n\t\t\t\t\twork it&#8217;s great, but expect to spend many turns in a bad location to\n\t\t\t\t\tattack.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Because your can ride your drake, try to find a Saddle of the\n\t\t\t\t\tCavalier. It will dramatically improve your drake&#8217;s durability.\n\t\t\t\t\tMounted Combatant is also an option, but I wouldn&#8217;t bother getting\n\t\t\t\t\tboth since it&#8217;s so easy to re-summon your drake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Fang<\/span>: Confusingly, this doesn&#8217;t make\n\t\t\t\t\tyour drake&#8217;s attacks magical. Instead, you add a d6 damage of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttype chosen when you summon the drake. That d6 will get around\n\t\t\t\t\tresistance and immunity to non-magical weapon damage types, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flat damage bonus is still piercing damage so anything with\n\t\t\t\t\tresistance\/immunity is a huge problem for your drake.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resistance<\/span>: Persistent damage\n\t\t\t\tresistance for you, and since you can resummon your drake for the cost\n\t\t\t\tof a spell slot you can change the damage type whenever necessary.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Drake&#8217;s Breath<\/span>: The damage matches\n\t\tFireball. It&#8217;s a good AOE damage option, but it doesn&#8217;t magically make you a\n\t\tBlaster. Still, the Ranger is generally ill-equipped to handle crowds, so\n\t\tthis is a welcome addition.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-\">Perfected Bond<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Empowered Bite<\/span>: Another d6 damage,\n\t\t\t\tbringing the total to 3d6+5 at this level (3d6+6 very soon). That&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tnot a ton on a single attack, but it&#8217;s much more than most characters\n\t\t\t\tcan do with a Bonus Action.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Large Drake<\/span>: Aside from making it hard\n\t\t\t\tto fit your drake through doors, this is excellent. The ability to ride\n\t\t\t\tyour drake while flying makes flight easily accessible and puts archery\n\t\t\t\tbuilds safely out of enemy reach.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reflexive Resistance<\/span>: This is great\n\t\t\t\tif you or your dragon take a big hit from a single source of damage like\n\t\t\t\ta spell or a critical hit. Don&#8217;t burn your limited uses on every random\n\t\t\t\tattack; you&#8217;ll only get 5 or 6 per long rest.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Beast Master-vs-drakewarden\">Beast Master vs. Drakewarden<\/h4>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Drake Companion feature and the Primal Companion features are so similar, it&#8217;s natural to compare the Beast Master (with the Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything updates, of course) to the Drakewarden. There is a lot of overlap, but Drakewarden isn&#8217;t just &#8220;Beast Master but better&#8221;; there are actually some interesting trades to consider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first notable difference is when they take their turns: primal companions take their turn at the same time as the player, so you can interweave actions so that you and your companion can very precisely coordinate your attacks. The Drake Companion is simpler, but less flexible: it takes its turn immediately after yours and acts on whatever orders you gave it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beast of the Land is the closest to the Drake Companion when you first\n\treach level 3, so we&#8217;ll start by comparing the two. The base stats between the\n\tDrake Companion and the Beast of the Land are fairly similar, but there are\n\tsome noteworthy differences. The drake has +1 better AC than the beast and has\n\td10 hit dice (which only matters when you spend hit dice to heal). Both share\n\ta 40 ft. land speed, but the beast also has a 40 ft. climb speed. The drake is\n\tstronger, but the beast has better Dexterity and Charisma. The drake adds your\n\tProficiency Bonus in Dexterity and Wisdom saves, while the beast adds it to\n\t<em>all<\/em> saves. The Drake can speak Draconic, but the beast can only\n\tunderstand languages. The beast and the drake get additional features\n\t(Draconic Essence and Infused Strikes vs. Charge), but it&#8217;s hard to make a\n\tdirect comparison between the two. They&#8217;re both good, but they&#8217;re obviously\n\tvery different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The attacks for Primal Companions and the Drake Companion are notably\n\tdifferent in several ways. Primal Companions use your Spellcasting attack\n\tbonus for their attack bonus, compelling you to build your ranger around\n\tWisdom and potentially to look for magic items which improve your spell attack\n\tmodifier (and spell DC if you want to use Beast of the Land&#8217;s Charge ability).\n\tThe Drake Companion uses its own Strength bonus for attack rolls, but adds\n\tyour Proficiency Bonus. This allows more flexibility in your choice of\n\tFighting Style, but also means that your drake&#8217;s attack bonus is likely lower\n\tthan that of a comparable Primal Companion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The damage progression on attacks is also different. The drake&#8217;s bite damage\n\tis 1d6 + Proficiency Bonus, while the beast&#8217;s is 1d8 + 2 Proficiency bonus,\n\tgiving the Beast of the Land +3 damage on average (other Primal Companions are\n\tonly +2 ahead on average). Both companions get magical attacks at level 7, but\n\tthe drake also improves their damage by 1d6, closing the gap in their attack\n\tdamage. At level 11, Primal Companions get to make two attacks, effectively\n\tdoubling their damage and putting them well ahead of the Drake Companion. The\n\tdrake adds another d6 at 17th level, but that won&#8217;t match the 1d8+8 dealt by\n\tthe Beast of the Land at that level by their second attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>But the Drake Companion isn&#8217;t just a scaly bite attack, so a one-to-one\n\tcomparison isn&#8217;t a perfect comparison. If you&#8217;re just comparing the two for\n\tdamage output on their attacks, Beast Master comes out ahead. But the\n\tDrakewarden still has some important selling points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drake Companion advances beyond just damage, which is perhaps both the\n\tmost fun and most impactful part of the companion. You can explicitly use it\n\tas a mount, an option which is frustratingly omitted from the rules for Primal\n\tCompanions. The Drake Companion gains the ability to fly, and you can\n\teventually ride it while flying, a capability not matched by the Beast of the\n\tAir.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drakewarden also allows you to build your character differently since your\n\tcompanion&#8217;s attacks aren&#8217;t dependent on your spellcasting ability. You also\n\tget Drake&#8217;s Breath, rather than just adding more features to your companion\n\tlike the Beast Master does. The Beast Master is still good, but there is one\n\tclearly optimal way to build them, so diverging from a Druidic Warrior build\n\ttrades raw mechanical effectiveness for what might be a more interesting and\n\tdiverse build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize all of the above quickly: The Drakewarden is a ranger who has a drake companion who fights alongside them in combat, but the companion is a complement to their own capabilities. The Beast Master is a ranger whose fighting style revolves around their companion. In many ways, the companion <em>is<\/em> their fighting style.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fey-wanderer\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/ranger#FeyWanderer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fey Wanderer<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Tricky and challenging, yet very effective, the Fey Wanderer is an excellent subclass with a lot to offer to players who know how to use it to its fullest.

The damage is psychic, which is\n\t\trarely resisted. It only applies once per target per turn, but if you can\n\t\thit multiple targets they&#8217;ll all take the bonus damage. It also applies on\n\t\tOpportunity Attacks (Hunter&#8217;s Mark does, too, but it&#8217;s still really nice).\n\t\tThe one drawback is that it doesn&#8217;t work quite as well as Hunter&#8217;s Mark does\n\t\twhen focusing on a single target, so Hunter&#8217;s Mark may still be worth the\n\t\tspell slot.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this applies once per target per turn, you&#8217;re motivated to attack\n\t\t\tmultiple targets if that&#8217;s an option.

That works great, and can\n\t\t\tlead to scenarios like dragons being frightened by their own Frightful\n\t\t\tPresence. To make this as effective as possible, you want allies in your\n\t\t\tparty who can reliably pass saving throws against charm\/fear effects.\n\t\t\tThese are nearly always Wisdom or Charisma saves, so high scores in those\n\t\t\tability scores and proficiency in the saves both help, but also look for\n\t\t\tracial traits like Brave and class features which help like Aura of\n\t\t\tProtection.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The less-obvious use case is using this offensively. If you have allies\n\t\t\twho can produce charm\/fear effects (often spellcasters, but there are\n\t\t\tnon-spell options too), you can capitalize on any creatures who pass saves\n\t\t\tagainst your allies&#8217; abilities and force another creature to save against\n\t\t\tBeguiling Twist.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fey Reinforcements<\/span>: Summon Fey once per\n\t\tday for free without the 300gp material component.

As a reminder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dmg\/dungeon-masters-workshop#Step11Damage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">combat is only expected to last 3 rounds on average<\/a>. This means that, roughly 1\/3rd of the time, you get extra extra attack and an additional d8 damage on top. That&#8217;s already very good, but you also get a substantial bonus to initiative to try and take that bonus damage and remove something from the fight before it gets to act.\n<p>The bonus speed will help you get into position,\n\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re built for melee, but the real bonus is the extra\n\t\tattack. If you can get Hunter&#8217;s Mark running before initiative is rolled,\n\t\tyou absolutely should so that your first turn can be a big pile of\n\t\tdamage.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Umbral Sight<\/span>: Getting free Darkvision is\n\t\tfantastic on its own, but invisibility to Darkvision is absolutely crazy.\n\t\tMost creatures that will ambush you using Darkvision won&#8217;t have a light\n\t\tsource in their possession, so you functionally have Improved Invisibility.\n\t\tEven if an enemy finds a light source, if you extinguish it you&#8217;re right\n\t\tback to invisibly murdering them.\n<p>Invisibility at this level normally comes at great cost: a highest-level spell slot, Concentration, and a prohibition against doing nearly anything aggressive with it. This has none of those costs, it just only applies when something is only able to see you because of its Darkvision. This means that we should be trying to be in darkness in combat as much as is physically possible. Work to make sure that everyone else in your party can function without light as well so that enemies are relying on Darkvision wherever possible.<\/p>\n<p>While it is incredible, it does have its limitations. The feature specifies that it only works in darkness. That means that it doesn&#8217;t work if there&#8217;s dim light (candles, etc.). It must be actual darkness. It also doesn&#8217;t work on things that can perceive you because of truesight, tremorsense, blindsight, etc. Only Darkvision. With that said, in the right conditions, this is one of the best class features in the game.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Mind<\/span>: Additional saving throw\n\t\tproficiencies are always welcome, especially when they&#8217;re for a commonly targeted save.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stalker&#8217;s Flurry<\/span>: Not quite as powerful as\n\t\tan additional attack, but still extremely helpful. The fundamental math of\n\t\t5e assumes that a player following the attack vs. AC progression will hit\n\t\twith attacks roughly 65% of the time against CR-appropriate foes. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tmaking two attacks per turn, you have a roughly 58% chance to miss with at\n\t\tleast one attack, so you&#8217;ll benefit from Stalker&#8217;s Flurry consistently.\n<p>Unfortunately, the wording on Dread Ambusher means that, if the extra attack from the feature misses you do miss out on the d8 damage bump even if the attack Flurry grants you off of it connects, but even so we\u2019re not going to sneeze at free attacks.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadowy Dodge<\/span>: It only works once per\n\t\tround because it consumes your Reaction, but that&#8217;s often plenty.

The extra attack\n\t\t\t\talso gives you another chance to apply the bonus damage from Planar\n\t\t\t\tWarrior. You might look at Haste&#8217;s additional action alongside Distant\nStrike and think that you can trigger Distant Strike&#8217;s additional attack twice. You do get the teleportation,\nbut since you only make one attack there&#8217;s no way to attack two creatures to get the extra attack.\nIt&#8217;s often more efficient to cast Elemental Weapon if all you care about is damage output, but Haste also provides movement and defensive buffs which you might want.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: A wonderful spell, but\n\t\t\t\tyou likely don&#8217;t have the Wisdom to back it up with a decent spell DC\n\t\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re built around Druidic Warrior, which is a poor choice for the Horizon Walker.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">17th-Level<\/span>: One of the safest and\n\t\t\t\teasiest ways to transport your entire party long distances, but full casters\nhave been casting this since level 9.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Portal<\/span>: Situational. In most\n\t\tgames this won&#8217;t matter much, but in a plane-hopping campaign it could be\n\t\textremely useful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Planar Warrior<\/span>: Since this consumes your\n\t\tBonus Action, two-weapon fighting and other sources of bonus action attacks\n\t\tlike Crossbow Expert generally won&#8217;t work well for you, and the damage boost from Hunter&#8217;s Mark is rarely worth the spell slot and action cost to cast or re-target it. Despite shaking up much of the typical ranger build strategy, the benefits are excellent.\n\t\tBonus damage, and weapon damage on the affected attack all becomes force\n\t\tdamage (which is resisted by almost nothing). It only works once per turn,\n\t\tso you may be able to do more total damage by investing heavily in two-weapon fighting or\n\t\ttaking Crossbow Expert, but this is free, it scales on its own at level 11,\n\t\tand without the need for two-weapon fighting, melee rangers can easily\n\t\tjustify using a shield.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ethereal Step<\/span>: One round is frequently all\n\t\tyou need. Walk through walls or doors or slip past enemies (including those\n\t\twhich have Blindsight or can see invisibility). Etherealness even lets you\n\t\tmove upward or downward, allowing you to move through floors and ceilings\n\t\t(albeit at half the rate as moving horizontally).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Distant Strike<\/span>: The teleportation is on\n\t\ttop of your normal movement. If you have two enemies to attack in a small\n\t\tenough area, you could teleport back and forth between the two while\n\t\tattacking in order to trigger the additional attack from Distant Strike.\n\t\tThis isn&#8217;t limited to melee, so this gets much easier with ranged weapons,\n\t\tallowing you to teleport out of melee before attacking multiple targets, and then easily\n\t\ttriggering the additional attack.\n<p>You\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need to hit both targets, so think of the additional attack from Distant\n\t\tStrike as a free attack against a different enemy while you&#8217;re busy\n\t\tfocusing on your primary target.<\/p?\n\t\t<p>Consider casting Haste before you jump into combat. The additional attack\n\t\t\tprovided by Haste is an Attack action, so it qualifies for triggering Distant\n\t\t\tStrike&#8217;s teleportation (though not another free attack since the Haste action\nonly gets you one attack), allowing you to teleport and attack four times (2 from Extra\n\t\t\tAttack, one from Haste, one from Distant Strike) in a turn without using\n\t\t\tyour bonus action. You can still use your Bonus Action to engage in\n\t\t\ttwo-weapon fighting, but it won&#8217;t trigger the teleportation because it&#8217;s\n\t\t\tnot part of the Attack action.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spectral Defense<\/span>: You don&#8217;t need to use\n\t\tthis until you get hit, so if your AC is decent and you manage to avoid\n\t\tdrawing too many attacks, this can prevent a ton of damage. Spectral Defense\n\t\tworks against all forms of attacks, including spell attacks, but since it\n\t\tgives you resistance to the damage it won&#8217;t stack with any other\n\t\tresistances. This isn&#8217;t quite as good as Uncanny Dodge (which halves the\n\t\tdamage rather than granting Resistance to it), but it&#8217;s close.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hunter\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/ranger#Hunter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hunter<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, unpretentious, and lacking any of the fancy magic nonsense common to\n\tmany ranger subclasses, the Hunter is a simple yet effective martial option.\n\tThe Hunter also notably has the most decision points of any ranger subclass,\n\tallowing you to tailor your build to your play style and your role in the\n\tparty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite mostly focusing on offensive options, the Hunter is arguably the most\n\tdurable ranger archetype, as it has the most options to directly prevent the\n\tRanger from taking damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While still perfectly viable, Hunters can&#8217;t compete with the capabilities of the new subclasses presented in Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything.

Unfortunately, since this doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tapply to every enemy, you may find that numerous encounters don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tbenefit from Giant Killer. If you know that your campaign will involve\n\t\t\t\tnumerous oversized enemies (Storm King&#8217;s Thunder is a great example if\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re looking at published campaigns), this is a good choice.\n\t\t\t\tOtherwise, you might just decide to be happy only using this some of the\n\t\t\t\ttime.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Horde Breaker<\/span>: In encounters with\n\t\t\t\tnumerous foes, this is a significant damage boost, but the extra attack\n\t\t\t\thas strict requirements and doesn&#8217;t cooperate with staple ranger options\n\t\t\t\tlike Hunter&#8217;s Mark\/Favored Foe which encourage you to focus on bringing\n\t\t\t\tdown one target at a time rather than spreading damage to multiple foes.\nConsider instead buffs that boost your weapon on all attacks like Elemental Weapon or Guardian of Nature.\n\t\t\t\t<p>Melee builds will have trouble using this unless you have reach,\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially if enemies are attacking your allies rather than swarming\n\t\t\t\t\tyou.

This won&#8217;t benefit much from Hunter&#8217;s Mark\/Favored Foe, but\n\t\t\t\thitting three or more foes will typically deal more damage than focusing\n\t\t\t\ton a single marked target.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Whirlwind Attack<\/span>: Melee builds not\n\t\t\t\tbuilt around two-weapon fighting will get the most out of this ability\n\t\t\t\tsince their normal attacks deal higher damage than TWF builds, and since\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not taking the Attack action you can&#8217;t spend your Bonus Action to\n\t\t\t\tmake an additional attack. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s limited to creatures\n\t\t\t\twithin 5 feet of you, so you can&#8217;t abuse reach to get additional\n\t\t\t\ttargets.\n\t\t\t\t<p>However, even TWF builds may find this ability helpful since they may\n\t\t\t\t\tstill get the same number of attacks without consuming their Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\tAction, allowing you to use it for something like casting a spell.<\/p><\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Superior Hunter&#8217;s Defense<\/span>: Uncanny Dodge\n\t\tis clearly the best option here, but Evasion is good, too.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Evasion<\/span>: With high Dexterity and\n\t\t\t\tproficiency in Dexterity saves, this makes you practically immune to AOE\n\t\t\t\tdamage effects like Fireball and breath weapons.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stand Against the Tide<\/span>: The\n\t\t\t\tpositioning to make this work is very difficult in most situations, and\n\t\t\t\tas soon as enemies see you do this they&#8217;re reasonably going to space\n\t\t\t\tthemselves out to prevent you from doing it again.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: The majority of damage\n\t\t\t\tyou will take in the game will come from attacks. Combined with\n\t\t\t\tMultiattack Defense, you can reduce the damage of the first hit, then\n\t\t\t\tdramatically reduce the likelihood of suffering further hits.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monster-slayer\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/ranger#MonsterSlayer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monster Slayer<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, the Monster Slayer is a simplified version of the Hunter. It functions very similarly, though it lacks the customization options, and, due to the subclass features, there&#8217;s much less build flexibility. That said, it&#8217;s still a very functional and effective subclass, striking a good balance between damage output and durability without the stress of additional decision points. If you&#8217;re looking for a relatively simple ranger, the Monster Slayer is a great choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/monster-hunter\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31067\">Monster Slayer Ranger Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monster Slayer Magic<\/span>: Most of the\n\t\toptions are situational or difficult for you to use.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd-Level<\/span>: An excellent defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th-Level<\/span>: Situational, and your\n\t\t\t\tsave DC likely won&#8217;t be good enough to make this work well.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">9th-Level<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: A wonderful spell, but\n\t\t\t\tyou likely don&#8217;t have the Wisdom to back it up with a decent spell\n\t\t\t\tDC.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">17th-Level<\/span>: Great, but your spell DC\n\t\t\t\tis probably still mediocre.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunter&#8217;s Sense<\/span>: Great if you have time to\n\t\tobserve the creature from hiding, but I would rarely spend an Action to do\n\t\tthis during combat.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slayer&#8217;s Prey<\/span>: As far as I can tell this\n\t\tstacks with Hunter&#8217;s Mark\/Favored Foe. Both Hunter&#8217;s Mark and Slayer&#8217;s Prey\n\t\trequire Bonus Actions, so use this first since it&#8217;s free, but against tough\n\t\tfoes definitely consider using both.\n\t\t<p>While Slayer&#8217;s Prey provides a damage bonus as large as Hunter&#8217;s Mark, it\n\t\t\tonly works once per turn. This means that tactics like Two-Weapon Fighting\n\t\t\tand Crossbow Expert are less important, and the Bonus Action cost to\n\t\t\tactivate Slayer&#8217;s Prey and cast or re-target Hunter&#8217;s Mark means that your\n\t\t\tBonus Action on most turns is already committed, so Two-Weapon Fighting\n\t\t\tand Crossbow Expert are hard choices.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Supernatural Defense<\/span>: A bit unreliable\n\t\tsince multiple foes might force you to make saving throws in quick\n\t\tsuccession, but this is still fantastic. Be sure to keep Slayer&#8217;s Prey\n\t\trunning and keep it focused on the foe most likely to force you to make a\n\t\tsaving throw. Remember that you can use Slayer&#8217;s Prey an unlimited number of\n\t\ttimes, so you can easily change targets whenever you need.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic-User&#8217;s Nemesis<\/span>: Not quite as good\n\t\tas being able to cast Counterspell, but it still might prevent an enemy from\n\t\tescaping or prevent them from casting a spell which would really ruin your\n\t\tday.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slayer&#8217;s Counter<\/span>: This is absurdly good.\n\t\tThere&#8217;s no limitation on its usage, so if you&#8217;re fighting a spellcaster\n\t\t(most spells force saving throws) you might be able to get free attacks\n\t\tagainst them every round. However, you&#8217;ll need to be able to reach the\n\t\tcreature that created the effect, so stick to ranged weapons.\n\t\t<p>You can repeatedly trigger this by running a Concentration spell like\n\t\t\tHunter&#8217;s Mark. The save to maintain Concentration qualifies, and if you\n\t\t\thave good enough Constitution saves (consider the Resilient feat) you can\n\t\t\treliably maintain Concentration while fishing for free attacks with\n\t\t\tSlayer&#8217;s Counter.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swarm-keeper\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/ranger#Swarmkeeper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swarmkeeper<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Swarmkeeper is most obviously associated with bugs, since those are what you generally think of when someone says &#8220;swarm&#8221;. But don&#8217;t let that limit your thinking. The subclass entry suggests a swarm of pixies as an example, and I&#8217;ve seen some very imaginative of swarmkeeper rangers with swarms of opossums and raccoons. You might have a swarm of birds, fish, lizards, or any number of other miniscule critters. Their appearance is purely cosmetic and has about as much mechanical impact as your character&#8217;s hair color, but it&#8217;s a fantastic character detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swarmkeeper is simple to play, but a lot of fun. Gathered Swarm adds a small but meaningful tactical consideration to every turn, encouraging the player to apply their attacks strategically rather than simply piling damage onto the first things in need of stabbing. The subclass has no decision points, so it&#8217;s an easy option for new players but also has enough mechanical hooks that veterans will some room to push the subclass beyond its expected capabilities. It&#8217;s a welcome addition in a party that can effectively capitalize upon area control effects like Wall of Fire provided by allies, but even without those options the Swarmkeeper still works well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/swarmkeeper\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14590\">Swarmkeeper Ranger Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-164\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gathered Swarm<\/span>: Using this will add some\n\t\ttactical complexity to every one of your turns. Keep in mind that this only\n\t\tworks once per turn so it&#8217;s no replacement for something like Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\tMark\/Favored Foe in terms of sheer damage output, and you&#8217;ll want to have a\n\t\tplan at the start of your turn before you start attacking. This will be more\n\t\treliable if you&#8217;re making multiple attacks, so consider two-weapon fighting\n\t\tuntil you get Extra Attack.  One more subtle note: The trigger is any attack, so it\u2019s not restricted to weapon attacks and can include spell attacks.\n\t\t<p>While each of the options below are rated as\n\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> to indicate that they are only\n\t\t\tsituationally useful, their combined capabilities are excellent. It&#8217;s like\n\t\t\thaving a toolbox with three tools in it: any one tool can only do a couple\n\t\t\tthings, but between the three of them you can do a lot.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Damage<\/span>: Your go-to option in most\n\t\t\t\tcases, but also your option of last resort. Use the other options if\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;re going to have any significant impact. Otherwise, the 1d6 damage\n\t\t\t\tis a small but satisfying bonus. Unfortunately, since this is from a\n\t\t\t\tseparate source rather than &#8220;extra damage&#8221; added to your attack, the\n\t\t\t\tdamage isn&#8217;t multiplied on a critical hit. Creatures which resist piercing damage typically have resistance to piercing damage\n\t\t\t\t<em>from non-magical attacks<\/em>. This isn&#8217;t an attack, so those\n\t\t\t\tresistances don&#8217;t apply.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Move Target<\/span>: Moving enemies can\n\t\t\t\tforce them to break grapples with your allies, and can put them into bad\n\t\t\t\tplaces like ongoing area damage, open pits, etc.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Move Self<\/span>: This is the option you\n\t\t\t\tare least likely to use, but it&#8217;s still helpful. Moving yourself 5 feet\n\t\t\t\tcan get you out of melee reach, out of grapples, out of area effects,\n\t\t\t\tand generally out of trouble.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Swarmkeeper Magic<\/span>: Some really good\n\t\tutility options, but the offensive options will be hard to rely upon.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd-Level<\/span>: Mage hand is a good\n\t\t\t\tcantrip, and rangers generally don&#8217;t get cantrips. Even if you take\n\t\t\t\tDruidic Warrior, Mage Hand isn&#8217;t an option. Faerie Fire is a great\n\t\t\t\tcombat option, but your save DC will likely be low, so save it for when\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re facing a crowd (statistically some of your enemies will still\n\t\t\t\tfail their save) or when you&#8217;re facing enemies which have poor Dexterity\n\t\t\t\tlike ogres or the Tarrasque.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-Level<\/span>: Web is one of the best area shutdown spells in the game.a hard choice. It\u2019s like a persistent version of Entangle, where creatures can be subjected to the spell over and over just for being in the area. Thrown over a group of foes, statistically some of them will fail their saves and even if they all make the strength check, not save, to escape, we\u2019ve made them all lose an action. And we have a great forced movement ability so we can just shove people back inside when they escape. Now, they might burn their way out of the webs if they happen to have a way to do fire damage but then just don\u2019t web the Red Dragon and you can avoid that one issue.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th-Level<\/span>: A great way to infiltrate\n\t\t\t\tplaces, to escape, to scout, and generally to go somewhere without other\n\t\t\t\tcreatures causing you trouble. The move speed is very limited, so\n\t\t\t\tcombine this with buffs like Longstrider to boost your speed and get\n\t\t\t\tmore done in the 1-hour duration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th-Level<\/span>: Even though you get it\n\t\t\t\tmuch later than dedicated spellcasters, Arcane Eye is still one of my\n\t\t\t\tabsolute favorite divination options for scouting from a safe\n\t\t\t\tdistance.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">17th-Level<\/span>: Constitution saves tend\n\t\t\t\tto be high and ranger&#8217;s save DCs tend to be low, which is a hard\n\t\t\t\tcombination. But with a 10-minute duration and half damage on a\n\t\t\t\tsuccessful save, with a particularly good damage type, if you can trap enemies in an enclosed space or\n\t\t\t\trepeatedly knock them into the area with Gathered Swarm, you can still\n\t\t\t\tdeal huge amounts of damage even if enemies consistently pass the saving\n\t\t\t\tthrow. If nothing else, you can plug a choke point while the full casters concentrate on other impressive effects.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Writhing Tide<\/span>: Flight of any kind is\n\t\tgreat, but 10 ft. speed definitely isn&#8217;t much. You can get off the ground\n\t\tand over small obstacles, but don&#8217;t expect to travel like this. Remember\n\t\tthat you can Dash if necessary, so if you have nothing else to do you can\n\t\tfly up to 200 feet on one usage. You can also boost your speed with buffs\n\t\tlike Longstrider and Haste, which will go a long way to make this more\n\t\tuseful both in and out of combat.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mighty Swarm<\/span>: Huge improvements to the\n\t\tmovement options. The damage option improves so little I&#8217;m confused why they\n\t\tbother to improve it at all.<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Damage<\/span>: 1d6 to 1d8 is not a meaningful\n\t\t\t\tdifference.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Move Target<\/span>: Knocking the target prone\n\t\t\t\tis great if you have melee allies who will benefit from them being prone\n\t\t\t\tor if you need to cut the target&#8217;s movement. However, if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tattacking at range you&#8217;ll make your own life harder by knocking your\n\t\t\t\ttarget prone.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Move Self<\/span>: +2 AC for one round. If\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re fighting in melee that&#8217;s a huge benefit and you should consider\n\t\t\t\tusing this every turn.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Swarming Dispersal<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\thave plenty of daily uses for this. Use it to gain Resistance against\n\t\thigh-damage attacks like critical hits or high-level spells, and also to get\n\t\tyourself out of melee combat if you don&#8217;t want to be there. You can\n\t\ttechnically use this by willingly taking damage in order to trigger the\n\t\tteleportation, but it&#8217;s probably not a significant abuse case because the\n\t\tuses per day are limited and the range is so short. Still, if you need to\n\t\tget out of somewhere nasty (a grapple, a pool of acid, an ongoing spell\n\t\teffect, etc.) you can always slap yourself for 1+Str damage to trigger the\n\t\tteleportation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e Ranger&#8217;s subclasses.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":2665,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"post-templates\/article-page.php","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[24,17],"tags":[36],"class_list":["post-2668","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","category-dnd","category-dnd5","tag-dnd"],"rankMath":{"parentDomain":"rpgbot.net","noFollowDomains":[],"noFollowExcludeDomains":[],"noFollowExternalLinks":false,"featuredImageNotice":"The featured image should be at least 200 by 200 pixels to be picked up by Facebook and other social media sites.","pluginReviewed":false,"postSettings":{"linkSuggestions":true,"useFocusKeyword":false},"frontEndScore":false,"postName":"subclasses","permalinkFormat":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/%pagename%\/","showLockModifiedDate":true,"assessor":{"focusKeywordLink":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-admin\/edit.php?focus_keyword=%focus_keyword%&post_type=%post_type%","hasTOCPlugin":{"simpletoc\/plugin.php":"SimpleTOC"},"primaryTaxonomy":false,"serpData":{"title":"","description":"Few classes have benefited more from the evolution in subclass design than the Ranger.
