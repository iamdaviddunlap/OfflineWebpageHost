Keep in mind that the state of the meta periodically changes as new source materials are released, and the article will be updated accordingly as time allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"absolute-legend\">Absolute Legend<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The purpose of Legendary Actions is incredibly straightforward: to make a solo monster a credible threat without being overwhelmingly strong. This isn\u2019t really explained by either the Monster Manual or the Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide. Let\u2019s break that purpose in half and tackle each side individually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"credible-threat\">Credible Threat<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>In D&amp;D, no matter the edition but especially in 5E, the Action Economy usually determines the outcome of evenly matched fights. That is to say, unless one side is overwhelmingly stronger than the other, the side with more actions will typically win. Legendary Actions solve this problem in a clever way. A creature with Legendary Actions can take one, and only one, at the end of another creature\u2019s turn. This means that a Legendary Creature has about as many actions as a 4-person party, but also that the number will drop if there are less creatures in the combat. But why go through all this trouble when we can just make the monster stronger?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"overwhelming-force\">Overwhelming Force<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We could just make the monster hit harder with bigger numbers. Why go through all this trouble of taking extra attacks when we could just load all that damage into one big attack and kill a player a turn? Because spiking the players is not the point of a boss fight. The job of the dungeon master is to facilitate fun and interesting adventures. The role of the Legendary Creature is to change up that formula occasionally to a solo fight without just throwing a deadly encounter or one-shotting a character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-makes-an-action-legendary\">What Makes an Action Legendary?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There aren&#8217;t really hard and fast rules for Legendary Actions, but we can infer a few guidelines from the published ones. If the monster primarily makes attacks, making one of these attacks usable as a Legendary Action is fairly common. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/909482-fleecemane-lion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fleecemane Lion<\/a>, for example, makes a claw attack, which is weaker than its bite, while the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/17042-unicorn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unicorn<\/a> makes a hooves attack, which is stronger than its horn attack. Some monsters also gain entire abilities that can only be used as Legendary Actions. Continuing to use the Fleecemane Lion and the Unicorn, the Lion has a roar that causes fear, while the Unicorn can increase a target\u2019s AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The other key part of a Legendary Action is the cost. A Legendary Creature has a set number of Legendary Actions that reset at the beginning of its turn and each use costs at least one of these actions, but some stronger features cost multiple actions. The aforementioned roar of the Lion and the AC boosting shield of the Unicorn both cost two actions, for example. From this I would have to say that actions with multiple targets or actions with lingering effects should cost multiple actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there\u2019s not really a hard rule about specifics. The best advice I can really give is to read the stat blocks of published Legendary Creatures to get a feel for what makes sense. You\u2019ll even find that some Legendary Creatures don\u2019t even follow these guidelines. Vecna, for example, instead can take three Reactions per round in place of Legendary Actions. Other creatures occasionally are Legendary by just having the Legendary Resistance feature without actually taking extra Legendary Actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"putting-it-all-together-some-assembly-required\">Putting It All Together (Some Assembly Required)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While there are some great Legendary Creatures already published, how do we go about building one of our own? Making a monster from scratch is already a tough prospect and now we have to add on all these extra Legendary features. Well for that, we at RPGBOT have a tool, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/tools\/monsterizer\/\">the Monsterizer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>This utility will assist you in calculating where your monster ends up on the scale of CR in real time as you tweak the numbers. If you\u2019re already familiar with how it works, that\u2019s great. I&#8217;m sure you\u2019ll have no trouble figuring out how to use it to gauge Legendary features as well. If you\u2019re not already familiar with the use of the Monsterizer, then read on and I\u2019ll walk through how I created the Hobgoblin Commando.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hobgoblin-commando\">Hobgoblin Commando<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Hobgoblin-Commando-652x1024.png\" alt=\"Hobgoblin Commando Legendary Creature Stat Block\" class=\"wp-image-15808\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-wand-make-my-monster-grow\">Magic Wand (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BWbkxaTU1Z0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Make my Monster Grow!<\/a>)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s break down what I did in the Monsterizer. When you first open the Monsterizer, you\u2019ll be on the intro and changelog screen, but you\u2019ll want to head to the second page for the basics. Now, you can build a monster completely from scratch with this tool, but it\u2019s just so much easier to start with an existing creature. I have started with the basic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/16925-hobgoblin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hobgoblin<\/a> in order to make a solo boss encounter. Honestly, Hobgoblins are scary. They have 18 AC from Chain mail and a shield, and what is basically 2d6 Sneak Attack dice. We\u2019ll be changing a lot of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>On this first page, after picking the base creature, we can rename it to whatever we want to appear in the stat block. If you\u2019re following along with me, that\u2019s where I named it Hobgoblin Commando. We can leave things like type and alignment alone, but the Target CR is important. This is where we choose the actual displayed CR of the monster as opposed to the calculated CR. We\u2019ll be fine-tuning the traits and actions of the creature later to get our calculated CR to match our target CR, but the target CR also determines the Proficiency Bonus of the monster. For the Hobgoblin Commando, I wanted to get it to CR 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Further down on this page we decide the ability scores, movement speeds, and skill proficiencies. For the Commando, I boosted Strength and Constitution a bit and gave it proficiency in a handful of skills that help us define the creature. The big one is Athletics since it\u2019s used in one of our Legendary Actions. We\u2019ll talk more about that later, but we\u2019ve also got some other seemingly strange choices, like Arcana. This represents that the Commando is no stranger to the dangers posed by magic users. Medicine on the other hand is for leaving foes barely alive but stable so that they may recount the tale of their almost fatal encounter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-this-a-bad-enough-dude-to-rescue-the-president\">Is This a Bad Enough Dude (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2evKkHi_qmo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">To Rescue the President?<\/a>)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>On the next page we\u2019ll find the defensive stats, but more importantly this is the first page that will display our calculated CR. The Monsterizer calculates two values, D(efensive)CR and O(ffensive)CR based on the stats and abilities we give to the monsters and then averages them together for actual CR. We\u2019re aiming for a calculated CR of 3 with our Hobgoblin Commando.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Monsterizer provides the Hobgoblin\u2019s stats from the SRD, but we\u2019re going to modify these a bit. The Hobgoblin\u2019s AC is 18 because of Chain mail and a shield, but we\u2019ll lower that to 16 because we\u2019re ditching the shield. 18 AC would be too much with the HP we\u2019re going to add. The Monsterizer will display the expected values for our target CR. In this case, 13 AC is the expected value for CR 3, but by being +2-3 over expected AC we are adding +1 to our base DCR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Where did our base DCR come from? Our base DCR comes from our HP, which Monsterizer tells us to aim for 100 to 115. We\u2019re going to set it to 60 (specifically 8d8 with a 2 Con modifier and 1 Additional HP modifier) because of our Legendary Persistence feature. I\u2019m treating it as identical to Legendary Resistance as far as HP calculations: \u201cEach per-day use of this trait increases the monster\u2019s effective hit points based on the expected challenge rating: 1\u20134, 10 hp; 5\u201310, 20 hp; 11 or higher, 30 hp.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Further down, we find the saving throws. As the Monsterizer explains, adding up to two save proficiencies won&#8217;t cause any adjustment to our calculations, so we give it Constitution and Wisdom for sturdiness. Below the saves are where we could add resistances and immunities if we wanted. We\u2019re not going to do that on this monster, but feel free to play with the options. You\u2019ll find that adding a few resistances will eventually start calculating the DCR from the hit points of the monster as if they were doubled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rip-and-tear-until-it-is-done\">Rip and Tear (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NgAm664NloA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Until it is Done<\/a>)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The next page, Actions, is where (almost) all of our OCR comes from. We have to tell the Monsterizer a few things about how we fight. Right at the top there will already be set to Attack, but if you\u2019re following the Hobgoblin Commando you\u2019ll need to adjust the attack bonus to +5. This won&#8217;t modify any of the actions below, but the Monsterizer can\u2019t read those to determine this value, which can impact our OCR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Actions page does a wonderful job of explaining exactly how it does what it does in long paragraph form, so in the interest of not repeating the tips in the tool I\u2019ll just discuss what I changed on the Hobgoblin. As you can see on the stat block above, for flavor I\u2019ve swapped out the longsword for a functionally identical battleaxe and traded the longbow for handaxes. That\u2019s pretty straightforward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>What is a bit more complicated is just below the actions. You\u2019ll find some sections that are collapsed by default: Bonus Action, Reaction, Lair Action, Legendary Action. We\u2019ll want to open up the Legendary Action section and have a look at what should be pretty familiar after the Actions section above. I wanted to give the Commando something cool and something basic to do with these actions, so it can either Shove everyone in melee range or make attacks with the Handaxes it has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>After we\u2019ve filled all of that in, the Monsterizer adds up the average damage we can do over three rounds if we just choose the highest damage action every round to find our DPR. This will finally give us our base OCR. If you did everything as I have, you\u2019ll find it does 26 DPR and that lands us at our CR 3 target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-aside\">Spells Aside<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The monster I\u2019ve built does not have spells, but I need to point out that the next page does not have any effect on the calculations. Instead, any spells that might be used to do damage in a fight need to be input on the actions page. That is what the show and hide buttons are for if you don\u2019t want to clog up a stat block with multiple spell descriptions while still adding the numbers to the calculations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extra-extra-read-all-about-it\">Extra Extra (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eCwazG_NdbI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read All About It!<\/a>)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is the page where we add any special features or traits to the Monster. You\u2019ll notice the Hobgoblin\u2019s Martial Advantage will already be here, but I\u2019ve removed that from the Hobgoblin Commando. Too much solo training has made it lose any advantages that are normally gained from Hobgoblin teamwork. But instead the Hobgoblin Commando has trained in a special technique that I made up based on Legendary Resistance. I called it Legendary Persistence<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Legendary Persistence: <em>(3\/day) If the Hobgoblin Commando is subjected to a Condition, it can prevent the Condition if it so chooses.

You might wonder why I didn\u2019t just use Legendary Resistance instead. I decided that what I wanted from the Commando was the ability to avoid being crowd controlled without being able to automatically pass on saving throws against damaging effects. This also allows the Commando to slip out of a Grapple, something Legendary Resistance cannot prevent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>This page is also where we enter the Tactics, Description, and Inventory boxes for the monster. Even if you don\u2019t intend to publish the monster anywhere for anyone else to read, you\u2019ll be glad you wrote these things down when you pull the monster out three months later. Trust me.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"breaking-it-down-to-build-it-back-up\">Breaking it Down (To Build It Back Up)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Commando\u2019s Legendary Features to see why I made the choices I made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"faceaxe\">Faceaxe<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With Faceaxe, I wanted the Hobgoblin to have an attack option in order to do some damage, but I didn\u2019t want it to just make extra swings with the primary Battlaxe. As some insight into the iterative design process, at first these Handaxe attacks were only usable as Legendary Actions, but later I decided they made a lot of sense as a replacement for the Longbow attacks of the original Hobgoblin, thus now showing up as both Actions and Legendary Actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"heavy-shove\">Heavy Shove<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With this Legendary Action, I wanted something dramatic and cool that can be done if the Commando is feeling pressured in melee. This can even build some tension if the players notice the Commando holding back on spending some Actions before it first uses this Legendary Action to suddenly knock a PC Prone for Advantage on later attacks. Because it can hit multiple targets and because it can impose the Prone condition, I priced this action at two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"legendary-persistence\">Legendary Persistence<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, Legendary Creatures typically have some kind of defensive feature as well to avoid immediately dying. For most this is Legendary Resistance, but I just wanted to protect the Commando from most crowd control Conditions, particularly anything that removes the ability to take actions, without inhibiting pure damage effects. Clever players will be able to figure out that it has no immunity to difficult terrain or other control-like effects that don\u2019t impose Conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Legendary Creatures are a tool to be used at all levels of play to add variety and spice to your campaign. I believe the name itself <em>Legendary<\/em> gives this unfortunate sense of \u201cOh no I can\u2019t use those, those are Epic monsters that only level 20 PCs are allowed to fight.\u201d But as you can hopefully now see, adding these to your DM toolbox and knowing how to use them at every level of the game is just another skill to practice and become familiar with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I will leave you with one last lesson for the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/tools\/monsterizer\/\">Monsterizer<\/a>: You can import and export the monsters in various formats.
