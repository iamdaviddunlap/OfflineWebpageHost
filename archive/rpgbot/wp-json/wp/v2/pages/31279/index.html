Playing a death cleric typically means worshipping an evil deity, which in most campaigns can quickly turn into a problem since the players are typically intended to be the \u201cheroes\u201d of the story. That said, there\u2019s no mechanical reason to deny access to the Death Domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>A highly offense-focused subclass, the Death Domain Cleric adds martial weapon proficiency and several options for dealing necrotic damage. However, the domain lacks almost any support or utility options, so you\u2019ll need to fall back on the Cleric\u2019s normal spells and core features to provide those capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Death Domain Cleric Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Death Domain Cleric Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Death Domain Cleric Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Death Domain Cleric Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Death Domain Cleric Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Death Domain Cleric Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Death Domain Cleric Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Death Domain Cleric Build &#8211; Stabby, Murdery Death<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The 3rd-level\n\t\toptions are the worst part of the domain, but the rest of the spell list is\n\t\tgreat.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: False Life is a fantastic\n\t\t\t\tbuff at any level. The hit points aren&#8217;t big, but with an hour duration\n\t\t\t\tyou can afford to spend a 1st-level spell slot several times a day to\n\t\t\t\treduce your need to heal your allies. Ray of Sickness is mediocre at\n\t\t\t\tbest.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">3rd Level<\/span>: Both of the effects last\n\t\t\t\tonly a minute, and allow repeated saves. Unless you can almost guarantee\n\t\t\t\tthat the target will fail their save, these aren&#8217;t reliable debuffs.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Animate Dead requires\n\t\t\t\tfrequent re-casting in 5e, so having it prepared every day for free is\n\t\t\t\tnice. Vampiric Touch is a great way to combine healing and damage\n\t\t\t\toutput, and isn&#8217;t normally available to Clerics.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: Blight deals decent\n\t\t\t\tdamage, especially against plants, but doesn&#8217;t scale particularly well\n\t\t\t\tand doesn&#8217;t have a fun secondary effect. Death Ward seems horribly out\n\t\t\t\tof place on the Death domain, but it&#8217;s a great buff.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Antilife Shell is a great\n\t\t\t\tway to protect yourself, but Cloudkill is very hard to use since you\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t redirect its path, and the damage isn&#8217;t justifiable if it only\n\t\t\t\thits enemies once.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Proficiency<\/span>: Martial weapons are\n\t\tnice, but the difference between a mace and a longsword isn&#8217;t significant\n\t\tsince Clerics never get Extra Attack. You probably don&#8217;t want to use reach\n\t\tweapons, either, since you don&#8217;t have heavy armor to keep your AC high when\n\t\tyou forgo a shield, though the Whip may be a worthwhile exception.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Reaper<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t many Necromancy\n\t\tcantrips, and many of them are already on the Cleric&#8217;s spell list, like Toll\n\t\tthe Dead. Chill Touch is also a good choice: it has better range than\n\t\toffensive cleric cantrips (Sacred Flame and Toll the Dead have a range of\n\t\tjust 60 ft.) and the damage is good. You&#8217;ll want to use Toll the Dead if you\n\t\tcan get within range, but having expanded range makes it more likely that\n\t\tyou can reach two enemies within 5 feet of each other.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The biggest problem with Reaper is that it&#8217;s difficult to control when\n\t\t\tenemies will be adjacent to each other. You can use the Telekinetic Feat\n\t\t\tto help, but it&#8217;s not a perfect solution. This will be much more impactful\n\t\t\tif you have allies with forced movement options or who like to grapple.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While the obvious use is offensive, Reaper also works with Spare the\n\t\t\tDying. Of course, if you&#8217;re casting Spare the Dying on two creatures, you\n\t\t\tshould probably cast Aid or Mass Healing Word.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Touch of Death<\/span>: This\n\t\treally isn&#8217;t a lot of damage. It&#8217;s a nice damage boost, but you want Channel\n\t\tDivinity to be more impactful than this. If your group uses the Optional\n\t\tClass Features, you&#8217;ll almost certainly get better results from using\n\t\tHarness Divine Power to get another spell slot. It does work on any melee\n\t\tattack, though, so you can use it with Inflict Wounds, Vampiric Touch, and\n\t\tSpiritual Weapon.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Inescapable Destruction<\/span>: Considering that\n\t\tyou probably took Chill Touch and\/or Toll the Dead, and that some of the\n\t\tcleric&#8217;s go-to single-target damage spells will deal Necrotic damage,\n\t\tresistance to Necrotic damage can be a problem. Immunity is still an issue,\n\t\tbut complete immunity to necrotic damage is rare, and generally limited to\n\t\tvery high-level creatures (Liches, etc.). Still, the Cleric&#8217;s biggest\n\t\tsources of damage typically deal radiant damage, so on the rare occasions\n\t\tthat you do encounter resistance or immunity to necrotic damage it&#8217;s easy to\n\t\tswitch to radiant.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Strike<\/span>: Necrotic damage is among\n\t\tthe most reliable damage types, so, as far as Divine Strike goes it&#8217;s hard\n\t\tto find a better option. See also:\n\t\t<a href=\"#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\">Divine Strike vs. Cantrips<\/a>,\n\t\tabove.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Reaper<\/span>: Many Necromancy spells\n\t\tlike Inflict Wounds and Blight are single-target. The ability to affect two\n\t\ttargets with one casting doubles their effectiveness, though requiring the\n\t\ttargets to be adjacent does severely limit how often you can apply this.\n\t\tKeep in mind that this isn&#8217;t purely offensive: it also works with False\n\t\tLife!<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Death Domain Cleric Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">typical Cleric<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Death Domain Cleric Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/races\" data-type=\"page\">typical Cleric<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Death Domain Cleric Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\">typical Cleric<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Death Domain Cleric Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\">typical Cleric<\/a> with martial weapons, though most clerics with martial weapons also get heavy armor, so you&#8217;re more likely to use Dexterity-based weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Death Domain Cleric Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\">typical Cleric<\/a>.

Inescapable Destruction will make your offensive spells like Toll the Dead, Inflict Wounds, and Spirit Guardians, as well as Channel Divinity (Touch of Death) even more reliable.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>4th-level spells.

Between Booming Blade, Divine Strike, and Channel Divinity (Touch of Death) we can make an attack do a decent amount of damage. But your spell attacks will be more reliable, so lean toward Inflict Wounds and Spiritual Weapon if you can justify the spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Our subclass spells at this level aren&#8217;t great, so not much deviation from typical Cleric tactics. Consider casting Summon Celestial.

Upcasting Inflict Wounds with Channel Divinity (Touch of Death) is both more reliable and more damaging than Harm.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: War Caster<\/td><td>A pretty typical choice for the Cleric. Improving Concentration is great, and we can hit enemies with Booming Blade or something else nasty in place of an Opportunity Attack.<br><br>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think you can use Reaper with War Caster. If you target a second creature with a Necromancy Cantrip using Reaper, it no longer qualifies to be used with War Caster.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Divine Strike +2d8<br>Destroy Undead (CR 3)<\/td><td>Our Booming Blade attack is now pretty great. 1d6 + 3 + 2d8 necrotic + 2d6 Thunder for an average of 22.5 damage, plus we can use Touch of Death to add another 16, and we might get Booming Blade&#8217;s secondary damage, too.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Lucky<\/td><td>Lucky is for use with Improved Reaper. Getting all set up to hit two enemies with a single 5th-level Inflict Wounds and Improved Reaper and then missing feels awful. You can also use Lucky for saves if you need it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Improved Reaper<br>Destroy Undead (CR 4)<\/td><td>Unfortunately, your spell options here are very limited: it needs to be a Necromancy spell which targets only one creature when the spell is cast, which rules out Vampiric Touch. Even so, you have a few good options:<br><br>&#8211; Blindness\/Deafness: You could upcast it to get more targets, but you can also use Improved Reaper to get 2 targets with a 2nd-level spell slot.<br>&#8211; Blight: About as much damage as Inflict Wounds, but it&#8217;s on a Con save, so it&#8217;s less reliable.<br>&#8211; Contagion: Inflict a horrifying debuff of your choice. I like Slimy Doom because your party can stun-lock the affected creature as long as the spell lasts.<br>&#8211; Inflict Wounds: Upcasting this to 5th level yields average damage just below 40, and you can add Channel Divinity (Touch of Death).<br>&#8211; False Life: Share the buff with a friend!<br>&#8211; Animate Dead \/ Raise Dead: I think you can also use these, but technically a dead body is an object, so I&#8217;m not totally certain. It feels like it&#8217;s intended to work, but RAW it shouldn&#8217;t.<br><br>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think you can use Improved Reaper with War Caster. If you target a second creature with a spell, it no longer qualifies to be used with War Caster. It would be a great combo, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s allowed. But as far as i can tell you can still use Touch of Death on each target (this still uses two uses of Channel Divinity as normal).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (3\/rest)<\/td><td>More Touch of Death between each rest!
