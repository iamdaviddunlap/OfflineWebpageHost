The AP has\n\tlong been a community favorite, in part due to the kingdom management\n\tmechanics, which have been functionally nonexistent in official DnD\/Pathfinder\n\tcontent since at least the launch of 3rd edition DnD in 2001. It&#8217;s hard to\n\tdeny the appeal of turning your overpowered combat monster into a monarch with\n\tan army at their back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>These rules are complicated. They involve quite a bit of math, there are\n\tsignificant balance issues, there are numerous trap options, and it&#8217;s entirely\n\tpossible for your kingdom to devolve into anarchy within your first few turns\n\tbefore you can even build a farm to feed your populace. The system also\n\tpunishes small parties by giving you fewer filled Leadership Roles and fewer\n\tLeadership Activities. This isn&#8217;t a good system for small parties, and there\n\tare many rough edges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Kingmaker 2e&#8217;s Kingdom Rules were developed\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/threads\/rzs43olo?Rules-that-hamper-a-fledgling-kingdom-in-the-AP#5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost entirely by James Jacobs<\/a>, and then hoping my team can spare some time to edit, I absolutely\n\tsympathize. Under the circumstances, I think they&#8217;re pretty decent. The linked\n\tthread includes some length discussion and several suggestions from James\n\tabout what he would change or do differently given another chance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>From my discussions online, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of folks making homebrew fixes to\n\tthe system to address the larger pain points. A user on Twitter directed me to\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1NHksCXkXbjtrv-26VgFHNbyYldatVwag9lM44IWxIXo\/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vance and Kerenshara&#8217;s Rule Changes<\/a>, which seem to be pretty popular if the number of people looking at the\n\tGoogle Doc at any one time is any indication. From reading them in depth, I\n\tagree with most of the changes, but I&#8217;m concerned that it will swing things\n\ttoo far in the opposite direction and make Kingdoms too good at too many\n\tthings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article contains the absolute bare minimum of spoilers. I&#8217;m going to rob\n\tyou of the fun of learning the system for yourself, but I&#8217;m not a monster.\n\tAlso, I haven&#8217;t finished playing the campaign yet. You&#8217;ll still want access to\n\tthe Kingmaker Companion Guide and the Kingmaker Player&#8217;s Guide, but stay out\n\tof the Companion Guide as much as you can because it contains spoilers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article also doesn&#8217;t address warfare mechanics. Those will need a\n\tseparate article.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a

With very minimal investment, you can be prepared for your Kingdom\n\tTurns to be as efficient and effective as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"time-tracking-and-downtime\">Time Tracking and Downtime<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Kingdom Turns are expected to take place roughly once every month, and\n\tplayers are expected to spend one week every month attending to their duties\n\tas a leader (see Leadership Roles on page 18). Of course, it&#8217;s totally unclear\n\twhere you&#8217;re expected to be when you spend this downtime. As a GM I would rule\n\tthat you need to be in one of your kingdom&#8217;s settlements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this to matter, you&#8217;ll need to do some time tracking. Pick a date when\n\tthe kingdom starts and take notes. A huge number of days will be spent\n\ttraveling from place to place. The need to travel back to civilization will\n\tmake things like mounts, roads, and teleportation extremely valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your group should also discuss how they want to handle Downtime. Kingmaker\n\tabsolutely requires Downtime, if only for the one week of leadership duties,\n\tbut if you&#8217;re going to travel back to civilization to run the country, you\n\tmight as well sneak in some other Downtime, too. My recommendation: 1 week of\n\tgovernment work, 1 week of Downtime, then spend the rest of the month\n\tadventuring. Golarian&#8217;s calendar is just the real-world Gregorian calendar\n\twith the serial numbers shaved off, so months can range from 28 to 31 days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hexploration\">Hexploration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Kingmaker is a hexcrawl. The playable portion of the world is separated into\n\ta hex grid, with each hex representing a geographical section of the map. Some\n\tportion of those hexes will eventually be your kingdom. But, in order to claim\n\tthose hexes, they must first be reconnoitered and cleared.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need a basic understanding of the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=3103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hexploration<\/a> rules,\n\tespecially the Hexploration Activities. The vast majority of player characters\n\thave a land speed of 25 ft, which gives you just 1 Hexploration Activity per\n\tday. This means that traveling in difficult terrain can take 2 or 3 days per\n\thex, and reconnoitering a hex will take an entire day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get mounts. Horses, ponies, mules, commoners banging coconuts, whatever. Get\n\tmounts with a minimum of 30 ft. speed. 30 ft. gets you 2 Hexploration\n\tActivities, which fully doubles your efficiency at the cost of a few gold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, consider the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=3906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Efficient Explorer<\/a>\n\tSkill Feat, especially in a large party that can afford to devote Skill\n\tIncreases to lore skills. An additional Hexploration Activity for the entire\n\tparty is significant. A total of 3 Hexploration Activities if your party\n\tincreases their travel speed and someone also takes Efficient Explorer means\n\tthat your party can race across the landscape, reconnoitering as they go with\n\tlittle worry for time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you&#8217;ll also need to spend Skill Increases on Lore skills to\n\tsupport this. Hills Lore, Forest Lore, and Plains Lore will see the most\n\treturn on investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"preparing-hexes\">Preparing Hexes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve improved your daily Hexploration Activity count, make a habit of\n\treconnoitering hexes at every opportunity unless you&#8217;re under specific time\n\tpressure (chasing a quest, rushing back to town, etc.). Reconnoitering can\n\ttell you if a hex contains valuable resources, terrain features,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a hex is reconnoitered, it needs to be \u201ccleared,\u201d which usually involves\n\tfighting something dangerous in the area. You can use the Clear Hex Activity\n\tduring your Kingdom Turns, but that&#8217;s a Region Activity. You get just 3 of\n\tthose per turn for your entire kingdom, and you need them for things that you\n\tcan&#8217;t do with your party of traveling violence specialists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hex that has been both reconnoitered and cleared is now eligible for Claim\n\tHex. See Managing Hexes, below.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"roads\">Roads<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Once your kingdom is founded and starts to expand, strongly consider building\n\troads through difficult terrain such as forests. Hills and plains are Open\n\tTerrain, so you move through at 1 Hex per Hexploration Activity, but other\n\tterrain is slower. Roads improve the hex&#8217;s terrain by one step, making it more\n\tefficient to travel through that hex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"companions\">Companions<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Companions are easy to get wrong, but they&#8217;re a massively powerful tool for\n\tyour kingdom. Each companion provides a unique benefit (usually a Leadership\n\tActivity) which is stronger than the default options available to you. Gaining\n\tInfluence with companions and appointing them to their preferred leadership\n\troles will make your Kingdom significantly more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The named Companions, including those who you&#8217;ll meet in the very first\n\tsection of the game, can be helpful additions to your kingdom. Each Companion\n\thas one or two Leadership Roles to which they&#8217;re well suited, allowing them to\n\tautomatically Invest those roles. In addition, they&#8217;ll offer new Kingdom\n\tActivities and possibly new Structures which you can only create if you have\n\tthat Companion appointed as a leader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the Kingmaker Companion Guide for information about individual\n\tCompanions, though beware that it contains significant spoilers.

Jubilost explicitly offers\n\tthe moment that you found your Kingdom. That gives you a minimum of 3 NPCs\n\tthat can fill and Invest Leadership Roles. In a party of 5, that fills every\n\trole immediately, so your party immediately gets +60 XP Milestone reward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that NPCs in Leadership Roles do not get to perform Leadership Activities. You can fill 6 roles with NPCs, but it is not wise to do so. Find a balance between getting the special benefits that you want and getting enough Leadership Activities. In addition, individual leaders can usually only attempt the same Leadership Activity once per turn, so having more players means that you can attempt powerful actions like <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Actions.aspx?ID=1497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Process Hidden Fees<\/a> several times in each Kingdom Turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-basics-of-managing-a-kingdom-in-kingmaker\">The Basics of Managing a Kingdom in Kingmaker<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores-attributes\">Ability Scores \/ Attributes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Ability Scores work just like they do for characters.

If you\n\treally want to go to war, build around Loyalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Kingmaker was published prior to the Remaster, it still uses the terms\n\t\u201cability scores\u201d and \u201cability modifiers.\u201d \u201cAbility Modifiers\u201d is\n\tinterchangeable with \u201cAttributes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"culture\">Culture<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Culture is the most powerful Ability Score because it&#8217;s the basis for the\n\tMagic skill, which is the most powerful skill in the game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Culture-based checks can receive a Circumstance Bonus for the entire turn\n\twhen you use the Improve Lifestyles Activity during the Upkeep Phase.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"culturebased-skills\">Culture-based Skills<\/h5>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Art<\/span>: Great for managing Unrest, crafting\n\t\tLuxuries, and generating Fame\/Infamy with Create a Masterpiece.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Folklore<\/span>: Used almost exclusively for\n\t\tCelebrate Holiday.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic<\/span>: The most important skill in the\n\t\tgame.

The\n\tActivities which you&#8217;ll perform during the Upkeep Phase can&#8217;t be replaced\n\tusing Creative Solution or Supernatural Solution, and those activities are\n\tcrucial for generating the RP that you&#8217;ll need to build powerful buildings and\n\tto gain Kingdom Levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Economy-based checks can receive a Circumstance Bonus for the entire turn when you use the <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Actions.aspx?ID=1410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collect Taxes<\/a> Activity during the Upkeep Phase. Using this on back-to-back turns results in a point of Unrest which you won&#8217;t be able to remove before you Trade Commodities and Manage Trade Agreements, so you may not want to do this every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"economybased-skills\">Economy-based Skills<\/h5>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Boating<\/span>: Weirdly useful, provided that\n\t\tyour capital has a water border. In early turns, Go Fishing allows you to\n\t\tgather Food Commodities until farms become functional. It can also be used\n\t\tto Establish Trade Agreement and to reduce Unrest.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Exploration<\/span>: All about claiming new Hexes.\n\t\tGreat in concept, but Claim Hex can be done with magic, and you can handle\n\t\tmost of the other uses by playing Pathfinder and going on adventures with\n\t\tyour characters.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Industry<\/span>: Primary used to Trade\n\t\tCommodities. Because Trade Commodities happens before your Activity Phase,\n\t\tit can&#8217;t be handled with Magic, and it&#8217;s very difficult to get a\n\t\tCircumstance Bonus on the check, making Industry irreplaceable.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trade<\/span>: Primarily used to Manage Trade\n\t\tAgreements and to Purchase Commodities. Because Manage Trade Agreements\n\t\thappens before your Activity Phase, it can&#8217;t be handled with Magic, and it&#8217;s\n\t\tvery difficult to get a Circumstance Bonus on the check, making Trade\n\t\tirreplaceable. Trade also has more Activity options than any other skill,\n\t\tand you outright can&#8217;t Collect Taxes if you&#8217;re not trained.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"loyalty\">Loyalty<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Culture-based checks can receive a Circumstance Bonus until the end of your\n\tnext turn (not the end of your current turn) from the Celebrate Holiday\n\taction.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attribute-skills\">Attribute Skills<\/h5>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intrigue<\/span>: With almost as many Activity\n\t\toptions as Trade, Intrigue does a lot. Clandestine Business can get you\n\t\tLuxury Commodities and additional RP, and you can reduce Unrest and Ruin\n\t\twith multiple activities. Trained should be plenty to get access to the\n\t\tTrained Activities.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Politics<\/span>: Primarily used to Improve\n\t\tLifestyle. Like with Trade Commodities and Manage Trade Agreements, Improve\n\t\tLifestyle is performed before the Activity Phase and can&#8217;t be handled with\n\t\tmagic, and it&#8217;s very difficult to get a Circumstance Bonus on the check. The\n\t\tbenefit is a Circumstance bonus to Culture-based checks for the turn, which\n\t\tcrucially includes the Magic checks which you can use to replace nearly\n\t\teverything else. You need Politics at least Trained.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Statecraft<\/span>: Primarily used to establish\n\t\tDiplomatic Relationships and to Request Foreign Aid. It&#8217;s important, but\n\t\tRequest Foreign Aid isn&#8217;t essential beyond low levels, and you won&#8217;t need to\n\t\tSend Diplomatic Envoy often enough that you can&#8217;t handle it with\n\t\tSupernatural Solution. Trained should be plenty to get access to the Trained\n\t\tActivities.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warfare<\/span>: Primarily used to command\n\t\tarmies, but can also be used to reduce Unrest. You should at least be\n\t\tTrained for when you need to go to war, but that likely won&#8217;t be for the\n\t\tfirst few Kingdom Levels. If someone declares war on your Village of a few\n\t\thundred people, conventional warfare is not going to save you.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stability\">Stability<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>There is no specific way to receive a Circumstance Bonus to Stability-based\n\tchecks. You&#8217;ll need to rely on other sources like Focused Attention.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stabilitybased-skills\">Stability-based Skills<\/h5>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agriculture: Used to establish farmlands and to harvest crops. Basically\n\t\tonly exists for food. Once you have enough farms, this becomes completely\n\t\tuseless, so absolutely don&#8217;t go past Trained.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Defense: Used to Fortify Hexes and to reduce Unrest. If you&#8217;re worried\n\t\tabout war, Fortify Hex can be very important.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Engineering: Useful, but entirely replaceable with Magic thanks to the\n\t\tPractical Magic Kingdom Feat. If you dumped Culture for some reason, this is\n\t\tessential.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wilderness: Almost identical to Exploration, but instead of letting you\n\t\tHire Adventurers to play the game for you, it lets you generate food and\n\t\treduce Unrest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"charter\">Charter<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your Charter describes the general purpose of your new Kingdom. Mechanically,\n\tit&#8217;s Ability Boosts and Ability Flaws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what to pick, choose Open and put the boosts into Culture\n\tand Economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules for selecting a Charter are on page 12.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"heartland\">Heartland<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The primary function of your Heartland is to give you an Ability Boost when\n\tfounding your kingdom. Your Heartland is determined by the hex in which you\n\tchoose to place your original Capital, and it needs to be a hex that you have\n\tReconnoitered (though not Cleared, for some reason).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When choosing your Heartland your starting Hex, note the Terrain Features\n\trule on page 41. A Hex can contain only one Terrain Feature, such as a\n\tSettlement, so you can&#8217;t put your capital in a Hex with an existing Terrain\n\tFeature even though the Choose a Heartland text doesn&#8217;t say so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Favored Land benefit sucks. Ignore it. 2 Region Activities in a single\n\thex per turn is sometimes useful, but the -2 penalty for doing so is absolute\n\tnonsense. Don&#8217;t bother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules for selecting a Heartland are on page 13.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"government\">Government<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of Government is much like a Background: Ability Boosts, Skill\n\tProficiencies, and a Kingdom Feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Despotism<\/span>: If you plan to build around\n\t\twarfare, you want this or Feudalism. Despotism is more proactive, while\n\t\tFeudalism is more defensive. Despotism likes marching armies. Feudalism like\n\t\twalls and fortifications.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Feudalism<\/span>: See Despotism.<\/li>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Oligarchy<\/span>: Great economically.

This is, without question, the best\n\t\tchoice.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leadership-and-positions\">Leadership and Positions<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your kingdom has 8 leadership positions. They can be filled by players or by\n\tNPCs that the party has befriended, or covered by the Civil Service Kingdom\n\tFeat. Empty positions come with penalties, so you should avoid them at all\n\tcosts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this system punishes small parties, as a GM I recommend being very\n\tlax about letting NPCs fill Leadership Roles, otherwise the entire kingdom\n\tmanagement system becomes incredibly punishing before players even learn how\n\tit works.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"invested-positions\">Invested Positions<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>You get 4 Invested Positions by default, and can change them each turn during\n\tthe Upkeep phase. Certain events respond differently depending on which\n\tpositions are invested, but there&#8217;s no way to go into those without\n\tspoilers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each position has an associated Ability Score, and an invested position\n\tprovides a Status Bonus to checks with that Ability Score. The bonus starts\n\tfrom +1 and increases with Kingdom Level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no further information, your best bet is to get the Status Bonus for all\n\t4 ability scores, then try to Invest as many positions as possible with\n\tNPCs.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ruin-ruins\">Ruin \/ Ruins<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>\u201cRuin\u201d here refers to the degradation of your society, not to ruined\n\tstructures that are probably full of monsters and treasure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain actions and events will lead to acquiring Ruin. When an individual\n\tRuin reaches its threshold, your kingdom suffers a permanent Ruin Penalty\n\twhich applies to all checks made with the matching Ability Score. These\n\tpenalties have no maximum, so letting Ruin spiral out of control can have\n\tdevastating consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruin is explained on pages 38 and 39 of the Kingmaker Player&#8217;s Guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See \u201cManaging Ruin\u201d, below, for more.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unrest\">Unrest<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unrest is the general measure of your populace being unhappy. War, failing\n\tcertain checks, and other events can cause Unrest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kingdom-checks\">Kingdom Checks<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your kingdom has a Control DC determined by your kingdom&#8217;s level. The DC\n\tincreases with level, increasing by slightly more than 1 per level on average,\n\tsimilar to the standard DC progressions used throughout the PF2 rules. This\n\tmeans that the DC will grow faster than your proficiency, making skills less\n\treliable unless you find bonuses elsewhere to keep pace. You&#8217;ll also need to\n\tavoid skills in which your kingdom isn&#8217;t proficient when the DC is too high to\n\treasonably achieve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See page 18 of the Kingmaker Player&#8217;s Guide for the Control DC table. It&#8217;s\n\talmost identical to the level-based DC table, but the DCs from levels 1\n\tthrough 4 are 1 lower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with other checks in PF2, there are three types of bonuses\/penalties, and\n\tthe largest bonus and the largest penalty of each type apply to all checks.\n\tBonuses of the same type don&#8217;t stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Circumstance: Usually from some temporary effect. You can get Circumstance\n\t\tbonuses from performing specific activities, and they&#8217;ll generally apply to\n\t\tone check, though some last for your turn or even multiple turns.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Item: Usually from buildings. You&#8217;ll need to expand your settlements to\n\t\tmake space for additional buildings. Look for item bonuses to every skill in\n\t\twhich your Kingdom is proficient. Item bonuses are capped by the size of the\n\t\tSettlement where your building is built, but you should only build Item\n\t\tBonus buildings in your capital (see \u201cManaging Settlements,\u201d below), which\n\t\tis likely your largest Settlement. Unlike normal Item Bonuses, these item\n\t\tbonuses stack up to the Item Bonus Maximum determined by your Kingdom\n\t\tSize.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Status: Usually from Invested leadership roles. You get a minimum of 4\n\t\tinvested roles (more with certain NPCs), and there are 2 roles matched to\n\t\teach Ability Score, so you should <em>always<\/em> have a Status Bonus to\n\t\tKingdom Checks. The bonus starts at +1 and increases with kingdom level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"negotiation-dc\">Negotiation DC<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>While the vast majority of checks are against your Kingdom&#8217;s Control DC,\n\tchecks involving outside groups use that group&#8217;s Negotiation DC. These DCs are\n\tfixed, so checks involving those groups will get gradually easier as your\n\tProficiency Bonus increases. As long as you&#8217;re at least Trained, you&#8217;ll\n\teventually be able to establish Diplomatic Relationships and Trade\n\tAgreements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the sidebar on page 23 of the Kingmaker Player&#8217;s Guide.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fame-or-infamy\">Fame or Infamy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fame and Infamy are two sides of the same coin. They provide the same benefit\n\t(rerolling Kingdom Checks or suppressing anarchy\/ruin), but can come from\n\tdifferent sources. Keeping track of your Fame is crucial because Critical\n\tFailure on checks is frequently awful and costly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a maximum of 3 Fame\/Infamy, and it sticks around between Kingdom\n\tTurns. Plan to end your turn with no more than 2 Fame\/Infamy because you get 1\n\tat the beginning of each Kingdom Turn. There&#8217;s little sense letting it go to\n\twaste unless you&#8217;re rolling extraordinarily well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can spend Fame\/Infamy for two things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Reroll a Kingdom Check. This is the primary use. It&#8217;s a Fortune effect, so\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t combine this with Creative Solution or Supernatural Solution. Like\n\t\tother rerolls, you&#8217;re stuck with the second roll, which can be worse. Use\n\t\tresponsibly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoid Anarchy\/Ruin: Like using Hero Points to stabilize your character, you\n\t\tcan spend all of your kingdom&#8217;s Fame\/Infamy to prevent anarchy or to prevent\n\t\ta ruin penalty from occurring. Check the specific rules text on page 42.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can earn Fame\/Infamy from 4 sources:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Critical Success on a Kingdom Check. Yes, every single time. This is very\n\t\teasy to forget.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build a Famous\/Infamous Structure. These structures have the Famous and\/or\n\t\tInfamous tag in their description. Ex: Castle. Famous buildings are\n\t\tgenerally pro-social like Luxury Tavern, while Infamous buildings are\n\t\tgenerally anti-social like Illicit Market.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a Masterpiece. Once per Kingdom Turn. Decent if you&#8217;re good at Arts,\n\t\tbut doing this once per turn isn&#8217;t good enough to justify heavily investing\n\t\tin a skill.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Noteworthy Acts. Entirely up to the GM.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Focused Attention is especially useful here. It&#8217;s one of very few things with\n\ta fixed DC, which means that Critical Successes become more likely as your\n\tskills improve. You can use Focused Attention both for the bonus to future\n\tchecks and to farm Fame\/Infamy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules for Fame and Infamy are on page 42 of the Kingmaker Player&#8217;s\n\tGuide.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"managing-hexes\">Managing Hexes<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"preparing-hexes\">Preparing Hexes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>See \u201cAdventuring\u201d, above. You cannot Reconnoiter Hexes as part of a Kingdom\n\tTurn, and Clear Hex is a wasteful risk when your party of adventurers is\n\tuniquely suited to clearing Hexes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"claiming-hexes\">Claiming Hexes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>You need to Claim Hexes as quickly as possible and as often as possible.\n\tWeirdly, you&#8217;re very bad at when the game starts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can claim Hexes with 4 skills (one for each Ability Score), so you can&#8217;t\n\taccidentally build a Kingdom that&#8217;s functionally incapable of expansion. You\n\tcan still be really bad at it if you don&#8217;t invest in one of these skills, but\n\tyou won&#8217;t be completely dead in the water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Exploration (Economy)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intrigue (Loyalty)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Magic (Culture)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wilderness (Stability)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pledge-of-fealty\">Pledge of Fealty<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Pledge of Fealty (page 25)<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"roads\">Roads<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Build Roads Activity lets you improve how quickly you can travel through\n\ta hex by one step. For example: Forests go from Difficult Terrain to Open\n\tTerrain. As your Kingdom expands, the ability to move quickly will become\n\timportant.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"managing-settlements\">Managing Settlements<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your Kingdom will start with 1 Settlement, which is your original Capital.\n\tYou might do just fine with only one Settlement. This section addresses both\n\tthe founding and growth of new Settlements.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"location-location-location\">Location, Location, Location<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your initial Capital&#8217;s location is a bit more complicated than placing future\n\tSettlements because it also determines your Kingdom&#8217;s Heartland, which\n\tdetermines its Ability Scores. Pick a hex that gets you the Heartland that you\n\twant and tries to follow the advice below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several factors can inform what makes a good location for a Settlement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Accessibility: How easy is it for your party to reach the Settlement? One\n\t\tof the benefits of Settlements is that you can go there to trade and perform\n\t\tDowntime Activities. If you can&#8217;t reach the Settlement, its value to you is\n\t\tlimited.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Farmland: Farms within the Influence of any of your Settlements reduce the\n\t\tConsumption or your entire Kingdom. This makes Hills and Plains surrounding\n\t\tyour Settlements extremely valuable. A single Settlement in a good location\n\t\twith a big enough Influence radius may be able to feed your entire\n\t\tKingdom.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pre-Existing Structures and Ruins: Some Hexes will include pre-existing\n\t\tStructures. Building a Settlement in these Hexes allows you to incorporate\n\t\tthose Structures for free, saving you the resource cost to build them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proximity to Other Settlements: Settlements will have a growing radius of\n\t\tInfluence, and there&#8217;s no benefit to having overlapping Influence. Spreading\n\t\tSettlements can also mean that you can more easily reach a safe location\n\t\twhile exploring the map.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Water: Water is absolutely crucial. You can only build Lumberyards and\n\t\tPiers on water borders, and they&#8217;re both fantastic. Having a water border\n\t\talso allows you to use Boating for the Establish Trade Relations task.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"influence-radius\">Influence Radius<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Influence provides two functions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Farms must be within the Influence of a Settlement<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Item Bonuses from Structures usually only apply to Kingdom Checks with the\n\t\tInfluence of the Settlement which provides them. However, your Capital&#8217;s\n\t\tstructures provide Item Bonuses in your entire Kingdom, so there&#8217;s little\n\t\treason to care about this benefit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s really just farms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Influence is detailed on page 47 of the Kingmaker Player&#8217;s Guide.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-capital\">Your Capital<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Build a Town Hall. That should be your first priority after building your\n\tfirst Tenements in your capital. Getting 3 Leadership Activities per players\n\tis a massive advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your capital has a unique and essential benefit: any Item Bonuses provided by\n\tbuildings in your capital apply in all of your settlements regardless of\n\tInfluence. This makes space in your capital exceptionally powerful and\n\tvaluable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify buildings that will provide Item Bonuses to skills which your\n\tkingdom cares about. Plan to build those buildings as soon as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"structures\">Structures<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your Settlement begins as a Village with one 4-lot block. To advance to a\n\tTown, you need to fill that block&#8217;s 4 lots. You need at least one housing unit\n\tto avoid being Overcrowded, so start by building a Tenement or Houses, and\n\tplan to put things in that first block which will never need more than 1 lot\n\tif you upgrade them later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that you can go straight to advanced versions of structures rather\n\tthan upgrading lower-level ones. Once your Kingdom Level improves, this makes\n\tit easier to build high-level buildings. High-level buildings might also\n\trequire more lots than their low-level versions, such as going from a Town\n\tHall to a Castle, which makes upgrading impossible unless you left space for\n\tit.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"housing\">Housing<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As your settlement expands, you&#8217;ll get additional blocks. You need one lot of\n\thousing for each occupied block, or your Settlement becomes Overcrowded, and\n\tyou start generating Unrest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan to build a Tenement before you put anything into a new block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Housing does not need to be in every block, you just need as much housing as\n\tyou have occupied blocks. Some buildings also can&#8217;t be in the same block as\n\thousing, such as a Tannery. The most efficient and least annoying way to\n\thandle housing is to dedicate one or more blocks to housing. Fill those blocks\n\twith Tenements like a magical slumlord or build Houses if you have ample\n\tLumber and don&#8217;t want the Ruin from building Tenements.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"growth\">Growth<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Upgrading a Village to a Town requires you to fill all 4 lots in your\n\tSettlement&#8217;s singular Block. Upgrading a Settlement from Town to any higher\n\ttier requires you to be the minimum Kingdom Level, and then to use 2 of the\n\tlots on every block in your Settlement. The Settlement fully upgrades when you\n\tBuild a Structure and place it in a new block for the next tier of\n\tSettlement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you found a new Settlement, it will take a minimum of 5 Kingdom Turns to\n\tturn it into a Town, 6 more Kingdom Turns to it into a City, then 10 more\n\tturns to turn it into a Metropolis. In a little less than 2 years, your\n\tSettlement can go from nonexistent to a Metropolis.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"managing-commodities\">Managing Commodities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Commodities have two functions: you can trade them, and you can use them to\n\tbuild buildings in your Settlements and to pay for Consumption if you don&#8217;t\n\thave enough farm hexes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commodities are available from several sources, including Work Sites and\n\tseveral Leadership Activities.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"capacity\">Capacity<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>By default you can store 4 of each type of commodity, but that capacity\n\tincreases as your Kingdom Size increases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Foundry: +1 Ore Capacity and a very nice VTT<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Granary: +1 Food Capacity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lumberyard: +1 Lumber Capacity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secure Warehouse: +1 Luxury Capacity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stonemason: +1 Stone Capacity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You need enough capacity to store enough commodities to build every structure\n\tyou want in each of your Settlements. The most expensive structures require up\n\tto 20 of one commodity, except for the Amiri-exclusive structure which takes\n\t30 Stone. If you can store 40 of each type of commodity, you should be fine\n\tunless you have numerous Settlements.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"work-sites\">Work Sites<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Work Sites automatically generate Commodities every turn during the Upkeep\n\tphase, so you&#8217;ll want Work Sites that generate each type of Commodity, but not\n\tso many that you&#8217;ll overflow your capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to get an Item Bonus to Establish Work Site checks. You\n\tget these bonuses from the same buildings that increase your Commodity\n\tCapacities. Each building grants +1, but remember that in the Kingdom Rules\n\tyou can stack Item Bonuses up to your Kingdom&#8217;s Item Bonus Maximum, which is\n\tdetermined by your Kingdom Size.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"resource-hexes\">Resource Hexes<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you establish a Work Site on a Resource Hex, the Work Site generates 2\n\tcommodities of its type instead of just 1. You&#8217;ll need to explore the map to\n\tfind Resource Hexes, then expand toward them.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"purchase-commodities\">Purchase Commodities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Beyond Work Sites, Purchase Commodities is the primary option for acquiring\n\tcommodities. However, it costs you RP to do so. It&#8217;s in the name. Success gets\n\tyou 2 Commodities for 8 RP for Luxuries or 4 RP for anything else. If you take\n\tthose 2 Commodities, then use them for Trade Commodities on your next turn, a\n\tSuccess will get you 2 Resource Dice on the turn after that. Even when your\n\tkingdom is tiny, 2d4 RP (average 5) is a good trade for 4 RP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you critically succeed on Purchase Commodities, you get a total of 6\n\tcommodities: 4 of the type you wanted, and 2 of any other type except\n\tLuxuries. If you want Luxuries, you&#8217;ll need to pay extra or make them\n\tyourself.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"food\">Food<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Gather Livestock, Go Fishing, and Harvest Crops all generate Food\n\tCommodities. They all use the exact same rules, but a different skill. They&#8217;re\n\talso Region Activities, which is frustrating because you only get 3 of those\n\tper turn, and they&#8217;re for crucial actions like Claim Hex that you need for\n\tyour kingdom to grow long term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, until you hit level 3 you can&#8217;t establish farms, so you&#8217;ll need to\n\tspend Food Commodities or RP, and RP turns into experience, so you want to\n\tminimize RP costs as much as possible. You will need to build farms to\n\tmitigate this cost. But, for reasons I can&#8217;t fathom, farms don&#8217;t generate Food\n\tCommodities, so building extra farms doesn&#8217;t generate a surplus that you can\n\ttrade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only uses for Food Commodities are to pay for Consumption or for use with\n\tTrade Commodities. You can trade other commodities which are much easier to\n\tgenerate, so I recommend reserving Food solely to pay for Consumption when\n\tyou&#8217;re building or upgrading Settlements and need a few turns to build new\n\tfarms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources of Food Commodities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gather Livestock<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go Fishing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Harvest Crops<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Purchase Commodities (4 RP)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"luxuries\">Luxuries<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>User for building specialized structures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources of Lumber Commodities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Clandestine Business<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Craft Luxuries<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Purchase Commodities (8 RP)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lumber-ore-and-stone\">Lumber, Ore, and Stone<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Used for building structures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources of Lumber Commodities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Work Sites<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Purchase Commodities (4 RP)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"managing-resource-points-rp\">Managing Resource Points (RP)<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-do-you-need-rp\">Why Do You Need RP?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>RP is used for building structures and for performing certain Leadership\n\tActions, then any left over at the end your turn turns into Kingdom XP (up to\n\ta maximum of 120).<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"resource-point-rp-sources\">Resource Point (RP) Sources<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Remember that each PC Leader can only select the same Leadership Activity\n\tonce per turn, so the spammable actions should be performed once by each party\n\tmember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In no particular order:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Upkeep Phase: You get 4 + Kingdom Level Resource Dice automatically.

While it&#8217;s not immediately a problem, it\n\twill eventually become one. Where Unrest imposes an immediate penalty that can\n\tbe quickly repaired, Ruin will build until eventually it overflows and becomes\n\ta semi-permanent penalty which can stack without a maximum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, your Ruin Threshold for each Ruin is 10. When you reach that\n\tThreshold, you reduce that Ruin by your Threshold (you don&#8217;t just reset it to\n\t0), and increase the Ruin Penalty by 1. For example: You have 9 Crime and a\n\tCrime Threshold of 10. You gain 3 Crime. You then subtract your Ruin Threshold\n\tof 10, reducing Crime from 12 to 2, then increase your Crime Penalty by 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruin Resistance is a recurring benefit. At Kingdom Level 5 and every 3 levels\n\tthereafter, you receive Ruin Resistance, which repeats the same benefits each\n\ttime: clear on Ruin, and increase that Ruin&#8217;s Threshold by 2.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"increasing-ruin-thresholds\">Increasing Ruin Thresholds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re struggling with Ruin, it may be helpful to increase your Ruin\n\tThresholds.

Clandestine\n\tBusiness can increase Corruption, some Structures can increase Crime, but\n\tevery other source (barring things which might be spoilers which I don&#8217;t know\n\tabout) allows you to pick. If you&#8217;re worried about Corruption and Crime, you\n\tcan simply avoid using Clandestine Business and building Crime-related\n\tstructures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can distribute Ruin between types to prevent one from getting out of\n\thand, or you can pile it all into one type so that you only need to worry\n\tabout managing one variety of Ruin. If you choose to pile all of your Ruin\n\tinto a single type, Ruin Resistance becomes especially useful. You&#8217;ll be able\n\tto periodically reset to 0, and the growing Ruin Threshold will make it safer\n\tto continue piling Ruin into a single Threshold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But which Ruin should become the dumping ground for whatever Ruin you might\n\tgenerate? I see two ways to pick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you can pick a dump stat. Of the four Ability Scores, choose the one\n\twhich your Kingdom cares about the least. Write off that Ability Score and any\n\trelated skills, and you can happily accumulate Ruin Penalties with minimal\n\tconsequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can pick the ruin which is easiest for you to reduce with\n\tRepair Reputation. Each Ruin is targeted by a different skill, so you could\n\tpick the one where your skill is the strongest. For example: Trade (Economy)\n\tcan be used to reduce Corruption, so a Kingdom focused on Economy might pick\n\tCorruption because they&#8217;ll be able to reduce Corruption reliably.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"managing-unrest\">Managing Unrest<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Unrest is awful. Even 1 point imposes a penalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crush Dissent feat can prevent Unrest once per turn with a successful\n\tWarfare check, but you need to invest heavily in Warfare to avoid Critical\n\tFailure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Unrest<\/th><th>Penalty to All Kingdom Check<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>&gt;1<\/td><td>-1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&gt;5<\/td><td>-2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&gt;10<\/td><td>-3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&gt;15<\/td><td>-4<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leadership-actions\">Leadership Actions<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Leadership Actions are the most accessible way to reduce Unrest.

Even so, it&#8217;s less\n\tcomplicated than Quell Unrest, and has a helpful Critical Success effect. Your\n\tparty can also use it multiple times on the same turn, though using it on\n\tback-to-back turns imposes a +4 DC increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quell Unrest is the default way to reduce Unrest. However, your kingdom can\n\tonly Quell Unrest once per Kingdom Turn, and you can&#8217;t use the same skill to\n\tdo so on back-to-back turns. This means that you&#8217;ll need to either need to\n\thave two skills that are good enough to support Quell Unrest or you&#8217;ll need to\n\tresort to Rest and Relax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Provide Care can also be used to Reduce Unrest. It&#8217;s very straightforward,\n\tbut it also only allows one skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Rest and Relax and Quell Unrest are \u201cgeneral actions\u201d, meaning that they\n\tcan work with multiple skills. Rest and Relax works with Arts, Boating,\n\tScholarship, and Trade. Quell Unrest works with Arts, Folklore, Intrigue,\n\tMagic, Politics, and Warfare. Provide Care uses Defense. That&#8217;s a total of 10\n\tskills that can be used for reducing Unrest, and Arts can be used for two of\n\tthe Activities.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"region-activities\">Region Activities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fortify Hex reduces Unrest by 1 if you&#8217;re successful.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"civic-activities\">Civic Activities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Many buildings can reduce Unrest when they&#8217;re constructed, but housing and\n\twalls are especially effective for their cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a Tenement costs 1 lumber, reduces Unrest by 1, and adds housing\n\tcapacity to prevent becoming Overcrowded.

This is where the Kingdom\n\t\tRules really start to work as intended after the possible multi-year period\n\t\tof suffering at levels 1 and 2. Towns get 4 blocks for a total of 16\n\t\tlots.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t>Expansion Expert (2 Hexes): The permanent +2 Circumstance bonus will be\n\t\tconsistently useful. You no longer need to devote a Leadership Action to\n\t\tFocused Attention to hunt for the Circumstance Bonus to guarantee that\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll get a Hex.<br \/>The ability to claim 2 Hexes per turn also means that\n\t\tyour Kingdom can grow twice as quickly. Keep an eye on the DC increase\n\t\timposed by higher Kingdom Sizes. If you grow too quickly and can&#8217;t stack\n\t\tbonuses enough to offset the DC change, you may find that your Kingdom is\n\t\tunmanageable.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t>Fine Living: Free lifestyle and 1 permanent +1 Circumstance Bonus to Craft\n\t\tand Earn Income. If you&#8217;re not using the Downtime mechanics at all, there&#8217;s\n\t\tno benefit here. Of course, that would be a weird choice in Kingmaker.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t>Ability Boosts: You only get to boost 2 Ability Scores every 5 levels. Like\n\t\tthe rules for Player Characters, going above 18 (+4) requires 2 boosts to\n\t\tget to the next modifier. This could make it more appealing to improve your\n\t\tlower Ability Scores, but as always Pathfinder rewards specialization over\n\t\tdiversification.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li>5 Ruin Resistance: See Managing Ruin<\/li>\n\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t>Experienced Leadership: An automatic increase to the Status Bonuses to\n\t\tKingdom Checks. By now you&#8217;ve gotten very good at using Invested Leadership\n\t\tRoles to keep the Status Bonus to every check.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t>Expansion Expert: 3 Hexes per turn. Keep in mind that this will be all of\n\t\tyour Region Activities for the turn, which means that you can&#8217;t Build Roads\n\t\tor Fortify Hex if you&#8217;re rushing to grab every Hex you can reach.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t>Settlement Construction (City): Cities can expand to all 9 blocks for a\n\t\ttotal of 36 lots.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li>10 Life of Luxury: An upgrade from Fine Living. The bonus is now +2.<\/li>\n\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t>Civic Planning: One extra floating Civic Activity is very powerful. This\n\t\tcan either help small Settlements catch up to larger ones, or you can keep\n\t\tputting it into your Capital to ensure that you&#8217;re stacking Item Bonuses to\n\t\tbenefit your entire Kingdom.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t>Settlement Construction (Metropolis): A Metropolis a full second Urban Grid\n\t\tof 9 blocks, fully doubling the size of a City.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li>16 Experienced Leadership: Status Bonuses are now +3.<\/li>\n\n\t<li value=\"20\"\n\t\t>Envy of the World: Several excellent benefits. If you&#8217;re good at farming\n\t\tFame\/Infamy (which you can likely guarantee by using Focused Attention), you\n\t\tcan routinely prevent Unrest and Ruin.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kingdom-feats\">Kingdom Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Ignore the Status Bonuses from feats.

The +2 Circumstance Bonus to New Leadership\n\t\twill not matter often enough to justify.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cooperative Leadership<\/span>: The DC of 20 for\n\t\tFocused Attention is static, so it becomes easier as you gain levels. You\n\t\tshould absolutely take this at some point, but not at low levels when you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t reliably beat DC 20.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crush Dissent<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to invest\n\t\theavily in Warfare, this is great. Otherwise, skip it and see Managing\n\t\tUnrest, above.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fortified Fiefs<\/span>: Useful once war becomes\n\t\tan issue, but largely pointless before then.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Insider Trading<\/span>: The easiest, most\n\t\treliable increase to RP in the game.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Kingdom Assurance<\/span>: The progression of\n\t\tyour Proficiency Bonus compared to the Control DC means that you will be\n\t\tguaranteed to fail checks at 16 of the 20 levels even if you maximized the\n\t\tchosen skill at every opportunity. If you are simply Trained, you always\n\t\tfail, but never criticall fail. Therefore: This is good if you are happy\n\t\twith the Failure result for the chosen skill. See \u201cKingdom Assurance Math\u201d,\n\t\tbelow.\n\t\t<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Kingdom Assurance (Industry) means that you can always use Trade\n\t\t\t\tCommodities to trade 1 to 4 commodities for 1 Resource Die on your next\n\t\t\t\tturn. Kingdom Assurance (Trade) used with Manage Trade Agreements\n\t\t\t\tguarantees 1 RP per Trade Agreement, though you may struggle to\n\t\t\t\testablish those without investing in Trade.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Kingdom Assurance (Intrigue) means that you can always use Clandestine\n\t\t\t\tBusiness to get 1 Resource Die at the cost of 1 Unrest and 1\n\t\t\t\tCorruption.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Kingdom Assurance (Intrigue) means that you can always use Request\n\t\t\t\tForeign Aid to get consistent results. The DC for Request Foreign Aid\n\t\t\t\twill vary depending on who you&#8217;re calling upon, but you get RP for\n\t\t\t\tFailure or anything better.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Muddle Through<\/span>: You can manage Ruin with\n\t\tRepair Reputation. You should be reducing your Ruin rather than very\n\t\tslightly increasing your capacity for it. See Managing Ruin, above.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Practical Magic<\/span>: Impossibly good. Magic is\n\t\tthe best skill in the game due to this feat, and it&#8217;s so impactful that this\n\t\tsingle feat sets the meta for the entire ruleset.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Pull Together<\/span>: Nice insurance against\n\t\tinevitable disaster. The tracking is a pain, but it&#8217;s still really good. Of\n\t\tcourse, you also have Fame\/Infamy for rerolls, and generating more\n\t\tFame\/Infamy from Critical Successes may be enough that you never need Pull\n\t\tTogether.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Skill Training<\/span>: The default if you don&#8217;t\n\t\tknow what else to take. You&#8217;ll never get enough Skill Increases to cover\n\t\teverything you want, so expect to take this several times.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-3-kingdom-feats\">Level 3 Kingdom Feats<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Endure Anarchy<\/span>: Reducing Unrest by an\n\t\tadditional 1 can make a big difference. If you&#8217;re routinely doing things\n\t\tthat trigger Unrest like Collect Taxes or leaving your Settlements\n\t\tOvercrowded, or if you&#8217;re at war often, this may be consistently useful. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re better about managing Unrest and rarely go above 6, don&#8217;t bother.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspiring Entertainment<\/span>: Only worthwhile\n\t\tif your Culture is significantly better than your Loyalty. The Status Bonus\n\t\twill become obsolete at level 8, and even from levels 3 through 7 it&#8217;s not\n\t\tworth being +1 better than what you get from Invested Leadership Roles.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Liquidate Resources<\/span>: Tempting at low levels\n\t\twhen RP is scarce, but you really need to get good at generating RP if you\n\t\twant your kingdom to succeed.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Quick Recovery<\/span>: Without getting into\n\t\tspoilers, it&#8217;s difficult to say how important this will be, but +4 is a\n\t\tmassive bonus in PF2. You will get a Status Bonus from your Invested\n\t\tLeadership Roles, but it nevers gets higher than +3. Of course, that means\n\t\tthat this feat&#8217;s benefits diminish as you gain levels, which doesn&#8217;t feel\n\t\tgreat.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-7-kingdom-feats\">Level 7 Kingdom Feats<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Free and Fair<\/span>: New Leadership should be an\n\t\texceptional rarity, so you&#8217;re doing this for Pledge of Fealty. Pledge of\n\t\tFealty is really good, and a +2 Circumstance Bonus is nice, but by this\n\t\tlevel you should be able to comfortably get a Circumstance Bonus from\n\t\tanother source. Focused Attention can get you +3 at the cost of a Leadership\n\t\tAction, and you get considerably more Leadership Actions than Kingdom\n\t\tFeats.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quality of Life<\/span>: One extra Luxury\n\t\tCommodity once per turn, which feels very small, but in a game where you\n\t\tmight take hundreds of Kingdom Turns, it will add up over time unless you\n\t\talready have an easy way to generate Luxuries.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The second half of the feat offers access to higher-level magic items in\n\t\t\tyour Settlements. You can start building Magic Shops at your next Kingdom\n\t\t\tlevel, and you can stack that benefit up to 3 times. The befits provided\n\t\t\tby Structures appear to stack with this, so it may be worthwhile if your\n\t\t\tSettlements are falling behind your party&#8217;s level. But be careful about\n\t\t\tputting too many resources into raising that item level or you may find\n\t\t\tthat your Settlements sell items that you can&#8217;t afford.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-11-kingdom-feats\">Level 11 Kingdom Feats<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fame and Fortune<\/span>: A fantastic way to\n\t\tpassively generate RP.

The math is a bit complicated, but it could significantly boost how quickly you progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes 1,000xp to gain a Kingdom Level. The most reliable source of XP is\n\tRP. You will get 5d4 RP by default at level 1, averaging to 12.5. With one\n\tKingdom Turn per month, you should reach level 2 in a little less than 7 years\n\t(80 turns over 80 months) of in-game time, assuming that you never spend\n\tRP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously that&#8217;s insane, so you&#8217;ll want to speed that up however possible. If\n\tnothing else, you need to rush to level 3 so that your capital can grow from a\n\tVillage to a Town in order to open up more blocks for buildings and to get an\n\tInfluence radius so that you can benefit from farms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming hexes will get you 10 XP per hex, so prioritize that as much as\n\tpossible. Use Focused Attention to get a Circumstance bonus on the check to\n\tClaim Hex, then either use Creative Solution, Supernatural Solution, or a Fame\n\tpoint so that you can reroll in the event of a failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That gets us to 22.5 XP per turn, so we&#8217;re down to 44.44 turns to hit level\n\t2, which is just under 4 years. A big improvement, but still insanely long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for ways to get bonus RP and Resource Dice. See Managing RP, above. If\n\tyou can generate 4 of the same commodity (save Food to pay for Consumption\n\tcosts) and then successfully Trade Commodities, that will generate 4 Resource\n\tDice on the following turn. Clandestine Business can get you 2 dice\n\timmediately on a Success. The Insider Trading feat gets you 1 Resource Die per\n\tturn, but you may not have that feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kingdom Events also get you 30 XP per event, and you can expect those roughly\n\tevery third turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we assume +6 Resource Dice from trade and Clandestine Business, 11 dice\n\tnow get us an average of 27.5 RP. Add the 10 for a hex and an average of 10 XP\n\tper turn from events for a total of 47.5. That&#8217;s 21 turns, which is just under\n\t2 years. We need more, and all that&#8217;s left is Milestones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Page 44 has a page of Milestones. Several of these will take a massively long\n\ttime to reach, but there are a few easy ones that you could hit within a few\n\tKingdom Turns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Claim your first Landmark (+40): You&#8217;ll see some landmarks during play. You\n\t\tshould be able to identify them by Reconnoitering hexes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claim your first Refuge (+40): What qualifies as a Refuge is nebulous, but\n\t\tyou should be able to identify them by Reconnoitering hexes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reach Kingdom Size 10 (+40): Claim Hex a total of 9 times. You were going\n\t\tto do that anyway.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Establish Diplomatic Relations For the First Time (+60): This requires the\n\t\tSend Diplomatic Envoy Leadership Activity. You should be able to do this on\n\t\tyour first Kingdom Turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>All Eight Leadership Roles (+60): If you have a large party and\/or your GM\n\t\tis letting you interact with Companions frequently, you might even reach\n\t\tthis during your first Kingdom Turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Establish Your First Trade Agreement (+80): You want to do this as soon as\n\t\thumanly possible so that you can Trade Commodities and Manage Trade\n\t\tAgreements. You should be able to do this on your first Kingdom Turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be able to get 200 XP on your first kingdom turn, then another 120\n\tfrom claiming 9 hexes which include at least 1 Landmark and 1 Refuge. That&#8217;s\n\t360 total. Subtract that from 1000 and divide by 47.5, and we can hit level 2\n\tin 13.6 Kingdom Turns, which is just slightly over a year. We&#8217;ll need at least\n\t9 to hit Kingdom Size 10, so that makes sense<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s way down from just under 7 years, but it&#8217;s still an insanely long\n\ttime, and we&#8217;ve burned through the easy Milestones, so level 3 is even harder.\n\tIt also doesn&#8217;t account for RP which you may have spent as part of Kingdom\n\tActivities or for the climbing DC for Clandestine Business which makes it\n\timpractical to use more than once every 3rd turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we&#8217;ve reached the second tier of Kingdom Size, our Resource Die size\n\tupgrades to d6. With those same actions we&#8217;ll now have 12d6 instead of 11d4\n\t(remember that you get more Resource Dice as you gain Kingdom Levels). With an\n\taverage of 42 XP from converting RP, +10 from claiming hexes, and +10 average\n\tfrom events we&#8217;re not generating an average of 62 XP per turn. That gets us to\n\tlevel 2 in 16.1 turns, which is about a year and a half.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can speed this up more with trade agreements. Look for every\n\topportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have one more important tip: The Companion Jubilost volunteers to help run your Kingdom when you found it. If he&#8217;s assigned the role of Treasurer, you get access to a Leadership Action called <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Actions.aspx?ID=1497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Process Hidden Fees<\/a> that lets you generate additional Resource Dice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A typical use case is to have a party of 4 Process Hidden Fees a total of 4\n\ttimes (once per PC Leader). Let&#8217;s assume for the sake of argument that\n\teveryone generates 1 Resource Die, but you can only use this every other turn,\n\teither because someone rolled a Failure or because you don&#8217;t want the\n\tautomatically lowered degree of success for using it on back-to-back turns.\n\tThat gives you an average of 2 additional Resource Dice per turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we look at our math from above with an average of 5 additional RP, things\n\tget a lot better for us. Let&#8217;s assume that we won&#8217;t get Kingdom Size 10 and\n\tits +40 XP simply because we&#8217;re going too fast and can&#8217;t claim enough Hexes\n\tbefore we hit level 2. We&#8217;ll hit level 1 at around 12.1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we continue that strategy, we&#8217;ll then hit level 3 in 14.5 months, down\n\tfrom 16. So we&#8217;ll get from level 1 to level 3 in 26.6 months instead of 29.7.\n\tIt&#8217;s not a huge reduction, but it&#8217;s 3 months earlier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See \u201cManaging Resource Points\u201d for more on generating RP.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"growth-how-fast\">Growth: How Fast?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your kingdom&#8217;s size imposes an increase to the Control DC based on the number\n\tof hexes that your kingdom controls, increasing when the kingdom&#8217;s Size\n\treaches 10, 25, 50, and 100. If you&#8217;re not prepared, the DC increase will make\n\tyour life very hard. Of course, it also increases your Resource Die size and\n\tCommodity Storage, both of which can be very beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, rush to size 24 (Province), then consider sitting there until\n\tyou&#8217;re ready. Increasing your Kingdom Level and building buildings with Item\n\tBonuses to offset the increased Control DC will be crucial. The increased\n\tResource Die size and Commodity Storage will give you a lot of flexibility and\n\tresources without the Control DC getting out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"math-kingdom-assurance-and-trained-skills-vs-control-dc\">Math: Kingdom Assurance and Trained Skills vs. Control DC<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The math is bad. You will be almost perpetually 2 points behind Success if\n\tyou maximize a skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can also use this table as an idea of how effective a skill will be if we\n\tleave it at Trained or if we maximize it. You can get Circumstance Bonuses,\n\tItem Bonuses, and Status Bonuses up to +3 each without anything weird\n\thappening for a total of +9.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 10 your Status Bonus and Item Bonus are both capped at +2, so we can\n\tget +7 on top of our checks. With that +7, a Trained skill succeeds on a d20\n\troll of 8, succeeding 65% of the time. At level 20, a Trained skill with the\n\tfull extra +9 bonus succeeds on a d20 roll of 9, succeeding 60% of the time.\n\tThat&#8217;s surprisingly okay, especially since it assumes +0 ability modifiers. Of\n\tcourse, it also doesn&#8217;t account for the increased Control DC from your Kingdom\n\tSize increasing,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Control DC<\/th><th>Maximum Proficiency<\/th><th>Outcome<\/th><th>Trained<\/th><th>Outcome<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16 (Expert)<\/td><td>Success<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>Success<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>23 (Master)<\/td><td>Success<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>Success<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33 (Legendary)<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>Failure<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"look-for-chains-of-bonuses\">Look for Chains of Bonuses<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Stacking bonuses will make your checks considerably more reliable. If an\n\tActivity is important, walk backwards from that Activity to find bonuses that\n\twill enhance it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: Supernatural Solution is really good. I want bonuses to that, so\n\tI search the Player Guide. Magic Shop provides a +1 Item Bonus, so I want to\n\tget an Item Shop. I&#8217;ll get a Status Bonus from certain Leadership Positions,\n\tso I make sure to Invest one of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That just leaves a Circumstance Bonus, which requires a bit more effort in\n\tthis case. Supernatural Solution uses the Magic skill, which is based on the\n\tCulture Ability Score. Improve Lifestyle can get you a Circumstance Bonus to\n\tall Culture-based checks for a Kingdom Turn. Having a Mansion gets you an Item\n\tBonus to Improve Lifestyle, so we want a Mansion.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-is-great-engineering-is-trash\">Magic is Great, Engineering is Trash<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Practical Magic Kingdom Feat is insanely good.

Thaumocracy will be able to lean\n\t\tinto magic right away, but Oligarchy will generate RP slightly faster to\n\t\trace to level 3.
