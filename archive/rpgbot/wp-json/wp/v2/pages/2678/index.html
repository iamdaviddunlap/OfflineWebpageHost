Warlocks are primarily a Blaster, Face, and Striker, but depending on your spells and subclass you can add Controller, Support, and a little bit of Healer to the Warlock&#8217;s role options within the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Warlock is arguably the easiest of any spellcaster class to play. You get only a handful of spell slots at a time, and never have to juggle multiple spell slot levels. Warlocks learn spells permanently, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about changing your spells on a daily basis. Warlocks also get the most powerful damage cantrip in the game, giving them a solid, reliable option for damage output in between your big spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the Warlock is one of the most customizable classes in the game. You get two major decision points with your Otherworldly Patron (the Warlock&#8217;s Subclass) and your Pact Boon, plus spells known and a pile of Eldritch Invocations. This wide degree of customization makes it easy to play warlocks back-to-back with very little overlap in your builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Warlock typically fills the party&#8217;s Wizard-equivalent role, offering\n\toptions as a Controller and Striker, and with some minor investments the\n\tWarlock can also serve as the party&#8217;s Face. The Warlock falls a bit short in\n\tterms of Utility spell options compared to similar spellcasters, but that can\n\tbe mitigated with Pact of the Tome and a few Invocation choices if your party\n\tcan&#8217;t compensate for that shortcoming. The Hexblade subclass also offers the\n\tability to serve as a Defender, though Hexblades still lean more toward damage\n\toutput than durability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our supporting material for the Warlock:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/pact-boons\">Warlock Pact Boons Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/invocations\">Warlock Eldritch Invocations Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11380\">Warlock Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\">Warlock Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/spells\">Warlock Spells Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/otherworldly-patrons-and-you\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"16930\">Otherworldly Patrons and You<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/warlocks-level-1-4-spells-and-invocations-building-a-powerful-conjurer-rpgbot-podcast-s4e46\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26946\">WARLOCKS Level 1 \u2013 4: Spells and Invocations; Building a Powerful Conjurer \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E46<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/warlocks-level-5-20-from-hexes-to-hell-leveling-up-and-releasing-the-darkness-rpgbot-podcast-s4e50\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27084\">WARLOCKS Level 5 \u2013 20: From Hexes to Hell: Leveling Up and Releasing the Darkness \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E50<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

You get a total of\n\t8 invocations over the course of 20 Warlock levels (provided that you don&#8217;t\n\ttake the Eldritch Adept feat to get another), which feels like a lot but isn&#8217;t\n\tenough that you&#8217;ll be able to take everything you want.

Pact Boon\n\toffers several options which all offer very different abilities, producing\n\tvery different types of warlocks.

You can already get your spell slots\n\tback with a short rest, so all this does is save you 59 minutes of standing\n\taround.

These rules are optional, and you should not assume that your DM will allow these features without consulting them first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments and suggestions for specific Optional Class Features are presented here, but for more information on handling Optional Class Features in general, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\">Practical Guide to Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Additional Warlock Spells<\/span> (Addition):\n\tEverything added by this optional feature makes sense on the Warlock&#8217;s spell\n\tlist, And surprisingly few of them are additions from existing sources (just\n\t4). Most of the new spells are published or re-published in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron\n\tof Everything.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing the expanded spell list on all warlocks. The new spells\n\tadd a lot of interesting options for the Warlock which encourage them to go\n\tbeyond staple options like combining Eldritch Blast with whatever leveled\n\tspell, encouraging the Warlock to have a more diverse and interesting spell\n\tlist.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Pact Boon Option: Pact of the Talisman<\/span>\n\t(Addition): A new Pact Boon option.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Pact of the Talisman on all warlocks. It&#8217;s neat and\n\toffers some new play options for the Warlock, but it&#8217;s not more powerful than\n\tanything else available.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Versatility<\/span> (Addition): Like other\n\tspellcasters, the Warlock gains the ability to retrain a cantrip. Second, you\n\tcan retrain Pact Boon. That&#8217;s a pretty big decision point, and fortunately it\n\tallows the Warlock to retrain any invocations which require your previous boon\n\tat the same time so you&#8217;re not left crippled for several levels. Finally, you\n\tcan retrain your Mystic Arcana choices. It was always weird that you couldn&#8217;t,\n\tso I&#8217;m glad to see that change.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Eldritch Versatility on all warlocks, though retraining\n\tPact Boon makes me nervous. You can&#8217;t get anything which you couldn&#8217;t already\n\thave, so it doesn&#8217;t make your character more powerful, but retraining your\n\tPact Boon can be almost as impactful as changing your subclass. As a DM I\n\tmight allow it, but only if the player was really unhappy with whatever they\n\tchose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Charisma is all you need unless you&#8217;re going for Pact of the Blade and not\n\talso taking Hexblade for some reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.

This means that you can learn spells from your patron&#8217;s spell list (provided that they&#8217;re of a spell level which you can cast), and you get a patron ability. In our case, that&#8217;s Dark One&#8217;s Blessing. This is a great way to pad your hit points, and even though you&#8217;re only getting 4 temporary hit points at this level that&#8217;s still almost half of your normal hit point maximum (10 at this level).<br><br>Pact Magic starts off slow. You get just two spells known and just one spell slot to share between the two, so your spell slot needs to do a lot of work between short rests. Normally I recommend hex as the go-to option at this level, but Hex isn&#8217;t in the Basic Rules or the SRD, so we&#8217;ll look elsewhere. Use Burning Hands to handle multiple enemies, or save your spell slot for Hellish Rebuke if something gets into melee with you.<br><br>For cantrips, take Eldritch Blast for fighting and Mage Hand for utility. I would normal say Prestidigitation, but you get Thaumaturgy for free as a Tiefling, which I think provides enough magical miscellany to get you through first level.<br><br>When combat breaks out, your go-to option is either Eldritch Blast or your crossbow. Your crossbow will deal more damage (1d8+2 avg. 6.5 vs. 1d10 avg 5.5), but your Eldritch Blast is cooler and will be slightly more accurate. The differences are minor, so don&#8217;t stress about the decision too much. If you get dragged into melee somehow, you&#8217;re decent with a dagger, but if you&#8217;re injured you&#8217;re better served by running away than by trying to trigger Hellish Rebuke.<br><br>I typically recommend Hex as a good 1st-level spell for the Warlock because you can get so much mileage out of one spell slot. Unfortunately, Hex is omitted from the SRD, so we&#8217;ll skip it for this build.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Agonizing Blast<br><br>New Spell Known: Protection from Evil and Good<\/td><td>At this level you get your second spell slot, and you get Agonizing\n\t\t\t\t\tBlast. Agonizing Blast adds your Charisma bonus to the damage dealt by\n\t\t\t\t\tEldritch Blast, making it truly your go-to option for combat.\n\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately you won&#8217;t get a third spell slot until 11th level, so\n\t\t\t\t\tget used to managing the two you have between rests.<br><br>At\n\t\t\t\t\tthis level consider learning Protection from Evil and Good. it&#8217;s a\n\t\t\t\t\tsolid, reliable defensive spell that&#8217;s always good to have on hand,\n\t\t\t\t\teven if you don&#8217;t need it for a while.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Pact Boon (Pact of the Chain)<br>New Spell Known: Darkness<\/td><td>At third level you get to pick a Pact Boon. Pact of the Tome is probably the most effective choice, but the intent of this build is to focus on simple yet effective options so we&#8217;ll take Pact of the Chain. To fit the theme of our Fiend patron warlock, we&#8217;ll take an Imp.<br><br>The Imp is easily the best familiar option available. See our assessment of Pact of the Chain above. At this level you might consider sending your imp to attack rather than casting Eldritch Blast. If it hits, your imp will deal 1d4+3+3d6 (avg. 16) damage compared to just 1d10+3 (avg. 8.5) with Eldritch Blast, and you and the imp have the same +5 attack bonus. However, this also places your familiar in harm&#8217;s way, and repeatedly spending 10gp to cast Find Familiar can become a drain on your limited funds.<br><br>This level raises your spell slots to 2nd level, so you can start learning 2nd-level spells. We took the Devil&#8217;s Sight invocation at 2nd level so that you can see in magical darkness, so learn Darkness at this level so that you can start using the two. Keep in mind that your allies probably can&#8217;t see in magical darkness, so if you cast Darkness expect to do a lot of work on your own. Send your familiar to use the Help action to assist your allies, which will offset the Disadvantage for attacking in the dark.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Charisma 16 -&gt; 18)<br>New Cantrip: Any<br>New Spell Known: Invisibility<\/td><td>Your first Charisma does a lot for you. Your attack bonus with\n\t\t\t\t\tEldritch Blast is now higher than your imp&#8217;s attack bonus, but you may\n\t\t\t\t\tstill want to send your imp to attack for its considerably higher\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage if that has proven to be a good tactic for you.<br><br>At\n\t\t\t\t\tthis level you learn a new cantrip. I suggest a utility option like\n\t\t\t\t\tMinor Illusion or Prestidigitation, but you may want Chill Touch if\n\t\t\t\t\tyou really want more offensive options for some reason.<br><br>By\n\t\t\t\t\tthis level we have a defensive spell (Hellish Rebuke), an AOE spell\n\t\t\t\t\t(Burning Hands), and an area control spell (Darkness), so a utility\n\t\t\t\t\tspell or crowd control spell is a good addition to our arsenal. I\n\t\t\t\t\trecommend Invisibility, but Enthrall and Spider Climb are great\n\t\t\t\t\toptions too.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation: Voice of the Chain Master<br>New Spell\n\t\t\t\t\tKnown: Fly<br>Retrain Spell: Burnings Hands -&gt; Fireball<\/td><td>At 5th level you get access to some new invocation options. There are\n\t\t\t\t\tseveral great options, but I really want to lean into how great your\n\t\t\t\t\tfamiliar is so we&#8217;ll take Voice of the Chain Master. This opens a fun\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination: Voice of the Chain Master allows you to speak through\n\t\t\t\t\tyour familiar. Thaumaturgy (which you get as a racial spell) allows\n\t\t\t\t\tyou to triple the volume of your voice. Your imp can turn invisible.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo you can have your imp turn invisible, fly somewhere, and you can\n\t\t\t\t\tspeak through your imp like a terrifying invisible megaphone. I don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tknow exactly what you would use this for, but the fact that it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible makes me boundlessly happy.<br><br>5th level brings\n\t\t\t\t\t3rd-level spells, which is really exciting. The SRD doesn&#8217;t include\n\t\t\t\t\tany exciting offensive options on the Warlock list, but your patron\n\t\t\t\t\tgives you access to Fireball, so we&#8217;ll replace Burning Hands with\n\t\t\t\t\tFireball. We&#8217;ll learn Fly with the new spell known because flying is\n\t\t\t\t\treally cool.<br><br>At this level you gain the ability to cast\n\t\t\t\t\tDarkness as a racial spell. That&#8217;s a good excuse to retrain Darkness\n\t\t\t\t\tinto another new spell, but we&#8217;ll need to wait another level because\n\t\t\t\t\twe&#8217;re retraining Burning Hands at this level.<br><br>Finally, 5th\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel adds a second ray to Eldritch Blast. Two rays at 1d10+4 damage\n\t\t\t\t\teasily outdoes your imp, so it&#8217;s time for the imp to go back to a\n\t\t\t\t\tsupport role rather than an offensive one.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck<br>New Spell Known: Counterspell<br>Retrain\n\t\t\t\t\tSpell: Darkness -&gt; Dispel Magic<\/td><td>Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck adds a nice backup when you roll poorly on a saving throw. Of course, a d10 will range wildly in value, so you can&#8217;t always rely on it to save you.<br><br>At this level we&#8217;ll retrain Darkness, and add two crucial utility options to our arsenal. Counterspell allows you to shut down enemy spellcasters (though it will feel like a disappointing way to spend a spell slot) and Dispel Magic will allow you to remove problematic ongoing magical effects.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation: Repelling Blast<br>New Spell Known: Wall\n\t\t\t\t\tof Fire<\/td><td>7th level brings 4th-level spells and another invocation.\n\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately, the SRD&#8217;s options for 4th-level spells aren&#8217;t great,\n\t\t\t\t\tand there are few invocation options that are especially interesting\n\t\t\t\t\tat this level. We&#8217;ll learn Wall of Fire and Repelling Blast so that\n\t\t\t\t\tyou can put up a wall of fire and use Eldritch Blast to push enemies\n\t\t\t\t\tinto it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Charisma 18 -&gt; 20)<br>New Spell Known: Banishment<\/td><td>At this level we&#8217;re at maximum Charisma. More attack and damage with\n\t\t\t\t\tEldritch Blast and a higher save DC with everything else.<br><br>There&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tnot much else going on at this level. Grab Banishment so that you can\n\t\t\t\t\tone-shot powerful extraplanar enemies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation: Whispers of the Grave<br>New Spell Known:\n\t\t\t\t\tHold Monster<\/td><td>At this point you have a lot of options for your invocations, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdeciding can be very difficult. Whispers of the Grave is a nice,\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversally-appealing option. Adventuring involves killing a lot of\n\t\t\t\t\tthings, and sometimes those things know things that you want to\n\t\t\t\t\tknow.<br><br>Finally we&#8217;ve reached 5th-level spells. This is where\n\t\t\t\t\tyour spell slots reach their maximum effectiveness. From here on\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll continue to learn more spells, but remember that your normal\n\t\t\t\t\tspells known can only be of 5th level or lower. When you run out of\n\t\t\t\t\tgood 5th-level spells to select, look at lower-level spells which are\n\t\t\t\t\tstill useful like utility options or spells which scale with spell\n\t\t\t\t\tslot level.<br><br>At this level we&#8217;ll learn Hold Monster. It\n\t\t\t\t\tworks in nearly any fight, and sometimes it can even prevent a fight\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom happening.<br><br>This level also marks a turning point in\n\t\t\t\t\thow the Warlock advances. You no longer gain new spell levels, and you\n\t\t\t\t\tgain interesting new class features slower. Even at 20th level, your\n\t\t\t\t\t5th-level spell slots are the most important parts of your\n\t\t\t\t\tspellcasting arsenal beyond Eldritch Blast, so be prepared to look for\n\t\t\t\t\tcreative ways to apply your spells as you face new challenges.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Fiendish Resilience<br>New Cantrip: Any<\/td><td>Fiendish Resilience is a difficult ability to use. You can change the\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage resistance when you rest, but it&#8217;s often difficult to know what\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re going to face ahead of time. If you&#8217;re ever not sure, select\n\t\t\t\t\tSlashing.<br><br>With the limited options in the SRD, we&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\tquickly running out of interesting options for spells known. From here\n\t\t\t\t\ton, you&#8217;ll want to go back to lower-level spells to look for good\n\t\t\t\t\toptions.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Mass Suggestion<br>New Spell Known: Any<\/td><td>Our first Mystic Arcanum gets us accustomed to the mechanic. You get\n\t\t\t\t\tto cast each of your Mystic Arcanum spells once per day, so you want\n\t\t\t\t\teach option to be broadly useful. In this case I suggest Mass\n\t\t\t\t\tSuggestion. We have plenty of options for hindering and killing\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies, but we have very few less lethal options. Mass Suggestion\n\t\t\t\t\tallows you to conveniently remove 12 creatures. Tell them to go take a\n\t\t\t\t\tlong walk, or march out of the dungeon to gather food, or something\n\t\t\t\t\telse that conveniently removes them without actually harming them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Any)<br>New Eldritch Invocation: Any<\/td><td>It&#8217;s difficult to provide specific guidance at this point. You have everything that you need to function. If you want more AC consider increasing Dexterity, otherwise you probably want to increase Constitution. You can select any invocation available at this point, and hopefully by now there are some options that you&#8217;ve been eyeing for a while.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Force Cage<br>New Spell Known: Any<\/td><td>Force Cage is a really cool spell. It&#8217;s really easy to use it to\n\t\t\t\t\teliminate single foes or groups of foes, and in a pinch you can use it\n\t\t\t\t\tas a place to hide, as a bridge, to block a hallway, or even as a\n\t\t\t\t\tplace to take a short rest (the duration is conveniently 1 hour, the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame as a short rest).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Hurl Through Hell<\/td><td>Hurl Through Hell is a once per day damage boost. It applies on top\n\t\t\t\t\tof the effect of an attack, but there&#8217;s no limitation on what kind of\n\t\t\t\t\tattack, so you can apply this to a target hit by your Eldritch Blast\n\t\t\t\t\tor by any other spell which requires you to make and attack roll.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation: Witch Sight<br>Mystic Arcanum: Dominate\n\t\t\t\t\tMonster<br>New Spell Known: Any<\/td><td>15th level opens up the highest tier of Eldritch Invocation options.\n\t\t\t\t\tNormally I would suggest Visions of Distant Realms, but you can get\n\t\t\t\t\tmost of that function from your familiar thanks to Voice of the Chain\n\t\t\t\t\tMaster.<br><br>For this level&#8217;s Mystic Arcanum, we&#8217;ll take\n\t\t\t\t\tDominate Monster. Like Mass Suggestion it allows us to non-lethally\n\t\t\t\t\tremove a problematic creature, but it gives you more direct control\n\t\t\t\t\tover the target. If you do it right, you can dominate one monster and\n\t\t\t\t\twalk it into the next encounter or two like an extra party member.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Any)<\/td><td>Not much going on at this level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Any<br>New Spell Known: Any<\/td><td>This is the most notable level for a while. 17th level adds the\n\t\t\t\t\tfourth and final ray to Eldritch blast, and you get your final Mystic\n\t\t\t\t\tArcanum. I recommend Foresight or True Polymorph, but if you just want\n\t\t\t\t\tto kill stuff go for Power Word Kill.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation: Any<\/td><td> Your final Eldritch Invocation slot. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Any)<br>New Spell Known: Any<\/td><td>At this level your Charisma is 20 and you&#8217;ve had two other Ability\n\t\t\t\t\tScore Increases, so your ability scores should be excellent. This\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel also gives you your last new spell known.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Eldritch Master<\/td><td>20th level is a bit dry, unfortunately. Eldritch Master lets you ask\n\t\t\t\t\tfor your spell slots back once per day without completing a short\n\t\t\t\t\trest, which saves you 59 minutes once a day.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e Warlock<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":24936,"parent":2618,"menu_order":11,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"post-templates\/article-page.php","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[24,17],"tags":[12,36,5],"class_list":["post-2678","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-dnd","category-dnd5","tag-characters","tag-dnd","tag-dnd5","has_thumb"],"rankMath":{"parentDomain":"rpgbot.net","noFollowDomains":[],"noFollowExcludeDomains":[],"noFollowExternalLinks":false,"featuredImageNotice":"The featured image should be at least 200 by 200 pixels to be picked up by Facebook and other social media sites.","pluginReviewed":false,"postSettings":{"linkSuggestions":true,"useFocusKeyword":false},"frontEndScore":false,"postName":"warlock","permalinkFormat":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/%pagename%\/","showLockModifiedDate":true,"assessor":{"focusKeywordLink":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-admin\/edit.php?focus_keyword=%focus_keyword%&post_type=%post_type%","hasTOCPlugin":{"simpletoc\/plugin.php":"SimpleTOC"},"primaryTaxonomy":false,"serpData":{"title":"","description":"Warlocks are easy to play, but still very powerful.
