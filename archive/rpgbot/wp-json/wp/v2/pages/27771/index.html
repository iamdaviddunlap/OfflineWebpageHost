The Warlock&#8217;s unique Pact Magic mechanic presents a novel take on spellcasting, and their Eldritch Invocations make them one of the most customizable classes in the game. This wide degree of customization makes it easy to play Warlocks back-to-back with very little overlap in your builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Warlock is arguably the easiest of any spellcaster class to play. You get only a handful of spell slots at a time, and never have to juggle multiple spell slot levels. Warlocks also get the most powerful damage cantrip in the game, giving them a solid, reliable option for damage output in between your big spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Warlock typically fills the party&#8217;s Wizard-equivalent role, offering options as a Blaster, Controller, and Striker, and with some minor investments the Warlock can also serve as the party&#8217;s Face. The Warlock falls a bit short in terms of Utility spell options compared to similar spellcasters, but that can be mitigated with Pact of the Tome and a few Eldritch Invocation choices if your party can&#8217;t compensate for that shortcoming. The Celestial Patron subclass also adds Healer to your role options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

You get two skills and access to a couple of Face skills, but\n\tmost of your non-Face skills are Intelligence-based.

You get a total of\n\t10 invocations over the course of 20 Warlock levels (provided that you don&#8217;t\n\ttake the Eldritch Adept feat to get another), which feels like a lot, but isn&#8217;t\n\tenough that you&#8217;ll be able to take everything you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/invocations\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28237\">Warlock Invocations Guide<\/a> for more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Pact Magic<\/span>: Warlocks have a completely unique form of magic. Unlike other spellcasters, your spell slots are all the same level, and you only get a handful of them, but they recharge on a short rest. This means that you will need to rely much more heavily on cantrips, and use your leveled spells when they can be the most effective. Because Pact Magic works differently from other spellcasting, be sure to double-check the Multiclassing rules before you look at other spellcasting classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-green\">Magical Cunning<\/span>: Helpful if you&#8217;re having trouble taking Short Rests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Warlock subclasses are briefly summarized below.

Be sure to pick your favorite spells, because you can only change your Mystic Arcanum when you gain another Warlock level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>20. <span class=\"rating-orange\">Eldritch Master<\/span>: 2 more level 5 spell slots per day.

Invocations. The progression of invocations has changed. You now get 1 at level 1 instead of 2 at level 2. The maximum has also increased from 8 to 10. Pact Boons are now Invocations, which means that you can get them at level 1 or you could skip them entirely.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Pact Magic. Mostly unchanged from the 2014 rules, but now allows you to change a cantrip when you gain a Warlock level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Magical Cunning. Perform a 1-minute ritual to recover half of your Pact Magic spell slots (rounded up) once per day. A small boost to the Warlock\u2019s sustainability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>9. Contact Patron. Allows you to cast Contact Other Plane once per day. Thematically, it\u2019s to talk to your patron, but RAW you could talk to whatever the spell allows.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11. Mystic Arcanum. You can now retrain Mystic Arcanum spells. I found the inability to retrain these a huge problem in the 2014 rules, so I\u2019m excited to see this change.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Eldritch Master. Magical Cunning now restores all of your Pact Magic spell slots.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Warlock Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An increase to Charisma is too crucial to forgo, so any Background which doesn&#8217;t include Charisma is immediately out. Dexterity and Constitution are also helpful, especially for Pact of the Blade builds. Charisma-based skills are also ideal.

Unfortunately, the lack of Weapon Mastery makes your weapon options much less interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\"\n\t\t\t>Battleaxe \/ Flail \/ Longsword \/ Morningstar \/ Trident \/ Warhammer \/ War\n\t\t\tPick<\/span\n\t\t>: Frequently your go-to options for melee builds. Using a Versatile (d10) weapon\nin two hands is the most damage that you can get without running into the Heavy property, and avoiding\nthe need for 13 Strength makes your build much simpler.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glaive \/ Halberd \/ Lance \/ Pike<\/span>:\n\t\tReach.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greataxe \/ Greatsword \/ Maul<\/span>: Your best\n\t\tdamage, but you will need 13 Strength, or the Heavy property will impose Disadvantage on your attacks. Since you already need high Dexterity (light armor), Constitution, and Charisma, this may not be feasible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hand Crossbow<\/span>: Two-weapon fighting via\n\t\tCrossbow Expert. Throwing daggers gets you as many attacks, but for\n\t\tDexterity-based builds, Crossbow Expert will get you better range and better\n\t\tdamage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heavy Crossbow<\/span>: Briefly useful at low\n\t\tlevels because of its large damage die, but obsolete once you get Thirsting\n\t\tBlade. Crossbow Expert negates the Loading property, but you&#8217;re going to\n\t\ttake a feat, either take Gunner and grab a pistol or a musket or use hand\n\t\tcrossbows.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longbow<\/span>: The go-to weapon for ranged\n\t\tbuilds.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Musket<\/span>: With the Gunner feat, this is a\n\t\tlinear upgrade from the Longbow, at least in terms of damage. Range might be\n\t\tan issue occasionally, but if that worries you, take Sharpshooter. This has\n\t\tthe Loading property, which will present a problem as soon as you get Extra\n\t\tAttack.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Pistol<\/span>: Good damage for a one-handed\n\t\tweapon, and the Vex mastery. Advantage from Vex will make your DPR with a\n\t\tpistol better than DPR with a musket so long as you&#8217;re repeatedly attacking\n\t\tthe same target. If you have enough gold, you can bring a whole bunch of\n\t\tloaded pistols and repeatedly draw and fire them instead of reloading. Or\n\t\tyou could take the Gunner feat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Rapier<\/span>: Charisma-based builds want a bigger\n\t\tweapon.

Fighting Style and Weapon Mastery make you even more effective with weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Paladin<\/span>: Like a Fighter, you can get\n\t\theavy armor, shields, and Weapon Mastery. Divine Smite kets you\n\t\tyou to burn your spell slots to add a bunch of radiant damage to the attack, but you can take Eldritch Smite instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue<\/span>: Sneak Attack only works with\n\t\tweapons, so Pact of the Blade is the only good combination with rogue unless you&#8217;re\n\t\ttaking a class dip solely for Expertise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Sorcerers are also\n\t\tCharisma-based spellcasters, but their features (with the exception of\n\t\tMetamagic) are very level-dependent, so you need to devote yourself to\n\t\tleveling as a Sorcerer to benefit from Sorcerer levels unless you&#8217;re just\n\t\ttake a class dip for Font of Magic and Metamagic. If you go that route, it&#8217;s probably so that\n\t\tyou can quicken Eldrith Blast. 2 levels of Sorcerer gets you 2 types of\n\t\tMetamagic, and if you convert all of your Sorcerer spell slots to Sorcery\n\t\tPoints, you&#8217;ll get a 3 moe per day.
