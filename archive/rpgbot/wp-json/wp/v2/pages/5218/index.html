Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

With a long skill list and 6+ skill points, he Bard can cover nearly every skill. His selection of spells isn&#8217;t as broad as the Wizard or the Cleric, but the Bard gets access to many fantastic support and area control spells, as well as a few Cure spells at low levels. With the right build and archetype, the Bard can fill any role in the party. The vanilla Bard is excels at Support and is a perfect Librarian, and can sometimes work as a Striker, Healer, or Controller depending on his spell selection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"animal-speaker\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/animal-speaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Animal Speaker<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The animal speaker trades the Bard&#8217;s knowledge abilities and some Bardic Performance abilities for the ability to make friends with animals, and some animal summoning abilities. With the Bard&#8217;s maximum spell level, his summon options will fall badly behind, and the ability to befriend animals can be replaced almost entirely by the Hold Animal and Calm Animal spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Friend<\/span>: Animals are already a small\n\tsubset of potentialy enemies. Dividing this further does not make things any\n\teasier. I would choose dinosaurs if your DM let you. Dinosaurs tend to be the\n\tscariest animals, and there are more dinosaurs than any other type of\n\tanimal.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Nature&#8217;s Speaker<\/span>: Cats and Birds are\n\texcellent choices. Cats includes Lion, Tigers, and Dire versions of both,\n\twhich are fairly high CR. Birds includes horrifying things like Rocs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You get to keep the\n\tbig important songs like Inspire Courage, but your new options aren&#8217;t\n\tspectacular.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Soothing Performance<\/span>: This considerably\n\t\treduces the need for Animal Friend. With a Bard&#8217;s Charisma, the Animal\n\t\tSpeaker is probably the first character to actually be good at Wild\n\t\tEmpathy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attract Rats<\/span>: Swarms are really annoying\n\t\tat any level. Their damage is automatic, and they are great at forcing\n\t\tconcentration checks. Call up rats whenever you need to control an area,\n\t\thandle some casters, or wittle down enemies with tough AC but no DR.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/span>: Summon spells are\n\tdecent, but Summon Natures Ally doesn&#8217;t give you many good options. Because\n\tyou also don&#8217;t get the highest level version of the spells, your summons will\n\tgenerally be too weak to accomplish anything in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fascinate, Inspire Competence, Lore Master, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Geisha, Songhealer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"arcane-duelist\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/arcane-duelist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arcane Duelist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Arcane Duelist trades in many of Bardic Performance&#8217;s compulsion effects and Bardic Knowledge for better combat options. Arcane Duelist leaves the Bard&#8217;s skill list untouched, so you can still serve as a Librarian with sufficient intelligence and skill ranks, but it becomes a much less prevalent part of the class. With less offensive combat spells than the Wizard, the Arcane Duelist is still a Support class, but with better damage output than a typical Bard, and much less emphasis on skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Strike<\/span>: Arcane Strike is a decent\n\tfeat for a Bard, but not nearly as impactful as Bardic Knowledge. Many people\n\treally like Arcane Strike, and for good reason. The ability to bypass DR\/magic\n\twith any random stick you pick up can be very nice, and it allows you to\n\tswitch weapons without sacrificing the feat&#8217;s damage bonus. However, the bonus\n\tis fairly small, so don&#8217;t go expecting this to throw the battle in your\n\tfavor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You still get inspire\n\tcourage, which is good because you will need it to keep up with the Fighter\n\tand the Magus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Rallying Cry<\/span> (Su): Situational, but miles\n\tbetter than Countersong, and more effective than the Paladin&#8217;s Aura of\n\tCourage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bladethirst<\/span> (Su): Similar to the Magus&#8217;s\n\tability to enhance weapons, but any weapon within 30 feet. At 13th level when\n\tyou can start a performance as a swift action, you can use it to buff all of\n\tyour allies&#8217; weapons. Combine with Lingering Song for maximum\n\teffectiveness.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Bladethirst<\/span> (Su): By using Lingering\n\tSong and activating your song as a swift action every 3 rounds, you can easily\n\tmaintain your full Bladethirst enhancement on 3 targets without issue. This is\n\tlargely redundant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: You get several excellent\n\tfeats. Disruptive and Spellbreaker make you excellent at fighting enemy\n\tspellcasters, and Penetrating Strike allows you to bypass DR, which becomes\n\tvery common at high levels. Step Up can really improve the effectiveness of\n\tSpellbreaker, and you need Weapon Focus to get any use out of Penetrating\n\tStrike.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Bond<\/span> (Ex): One extra spell slot per\n\tday is nice, plus you can enhance your weapon without an item creation feat,\n\tand you don&#8217;t need to drop your weapon to cast spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Armor<\/span> (Ex): And suddenly you&#8217;re a\n\ttank. As a bard you likely spent most of your career depending on dexterity to\n\tboost your AC, so the heaviest armor you will probably ever wear is going to\n\tbe Celestial Armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Countersong, Jack-of-All-Trades, Lore Master, Mass Suggestion, Suggestion, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"archaeologist\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/archaeologist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Archaeologist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently Indiana Jones was a Bard. The Archaeologist gets some Rogue abilities in place of Bardic Performance, and gets a really cool luck bonus ability. However, the archetype doesn&#8217;t replicate Trapfinding until 6th level, and doesn&#8217;t have any combat options beyond the luck bonus. The concept is really fun, and the abilities are good on their own, but you give up the Bard&#8217;s signature features (Bardic Performance and their versatility with skills) for some very limited luck bonuses and a sligthly better version of Trapfinding. If you want to play a bard who can handle traps, play a regular bard and take a level of Rogue to get Trapfinding. If you want easy Luck bonuses, play a Halfling and use the Halfling racial feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take this archetype without the Fate&#8217;s Favored trait, you are making a very poor life choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archaeologist&#8217;s Luck<\/span> (Ex): Luck bonuses are\n\tincredibly rare, and activating it as a swift action gives you all sorts of\n\toptions. This is trated as Bardic Performance for the purposes of feats, so\n\tyou can take Lingering Performance to effectively triple the number of rounds\n\tper day that you can use your luck bonus. The only downside is that you can&#8217;t\n\tshare it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clever Explorer<\/span> (Ex): A bonus this big to\n\tPerception is fantastic, and at level 6 the Archaeologist can disable magical\n\ttraps as though they had Trapfinding. The ability to disable devices and open\n\tlocks quickly is situational, but generally isn&#8217;t available until high levels.\n\tTaking 10 on Disable Device while distracted is even better for those rare\n\tsituations where you need to quickly disable traps.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Uncanny Dodge isn&#8217;t\n\tvery good, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trap Sense<\/span> (Ex): Trap Sense isn&#8217;t very\n\tgood, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have, especially since you don&#8217;t get\n\tTrapfinding.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue Talents<\/span>: Some Rogue talents are very\n\tgood, but many of them depend on Sneak Attack, which you don&#8217;t get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic on any character.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Talent<\/span>: See &#8220;Rogue Talents&#8221;\n\tabove.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bardic Performance, Versatile Performance, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Flame Dancer, Geisha<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"archivist\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/archivist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Archivist<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Archivist doubles down on the Bard&#8217;s already fantastic knowledge abilities. Naturalist brings an interesting replacement for Inspire Courage, and the Archivist gives up Versatile Performance for a more conventional approach to skills. With enough intelligence to fuel the Archivist&#8217;s need for skill ranks, this can be a very solid linear improvement to the vanilla Bard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You lose Inspire\n\tCourage, Suggestion, and Mass Suggestion. Instead, Naturalist provides Insight\n\tbonuses in combat, and Lamentable Belaborment lets you Daze or Confuse\n\ttargets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Naturalist<\/span> (Ex): With Bardic Knowledge and a\n\tfew ranks in Knowledge skills, you&#8217;re going to be able to easily identify\n\teverything you meet. Insight bonuses are much less common than morale bonuses\n\tlike Inspire Courage, so you can stack Naturalist with effects like Bless. The\n\tbonuses scale as quickly as Inspire Courage, but the saving throw bonus\n\tapplies to more things, and you get an AC bonus instead of the tiny damage\n\tbonus. In my oppinion, this is strictly better than Inspire Courage, which is\n\talready pretty fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lamentable Belaborment<\/span> (Ex): Dazed is a\n\tmuch better condition than Fascinated. The target can&#8217;t take actions, and\n\tdrawing weapons or taking other hostile actions won&#8217;t break the effect. Until\n\tyou actually deal damage, the target is unable to act. Confused is a risky\n\toption: The target has a 25% change to hurt themself, which means a 25% chance\n\tto break the effect. They also have a 25% chance to act normally, which means\n\tyou wasted your time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pedantic Lecture<\/span> (Su): Play entire rooms to\n\tsleep, then have your party walk around and kill or restrain them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lore Master<\/span> (Ex): With the exception of your\n\tchecks to identify monsters, you likely won&#8217;t make more than a few knowledge\n\tchecks in a day, so make sure that you get as much out of them as possible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Lore<\/span> (Ex): The ability to disarm\n\tmagical traps removes your need for a Rogue, assuming you can spare skill\n\tranks for Disable Device. Without Versatile Performance your skill ranks\n\tbecome much more precious, but this is certainly a worthwile investment.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jack of All Trades<\/span> (Ex): The best of the\n\tBard&#8217;s already fantastic skill-related abilities, and you get it five levels\n\tearly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Probable Path<\/span> (Ex): The possibilities are\n\thuge. Confirm critical threats or ensure decent rolls on saves. Get really\n\tcrazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Jack-of-All-Trades, Lore Master, Mass Suggestion, Inspire Courage, Suggestion, Versatile Performance, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Geisha<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"celebrity\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/animal-speaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Celebrity<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The only really important thing that the Celebrity gives up is Inspire Courage, but you also don&#8217;t get much back. This could be a very fun archetype for an RP-heavy campaign, but it&#8217;s not going to be noticable in a fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Famous<\/span>: Giving up Inspire Courage always\n\thurts, but this is a really fun ability. The bonus builds as you scale, and\n\tbecomes more widespread. The typical wandering adventurer lifestyle might make\n\tthis difficult to use, but in campaigns where you tend to work in a small\n\tlocal area, this will work very well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: The abilities make\n\tsense for a celebrity, but they&#8217;re situational and difficult to bring into\n\tplay.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gather Crowd<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s hard to say how\n\t\tbest to use this. This could be very powerful in RP situations, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tgoing to depend heavily on how creative you are, and how open-minded your GM\n\t\tis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shining Star<\/span> (Su): Fascinate your\n\t\tenemies, even while your allies walk up behind them with drawn weapons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Dirge of Doom, Inspire Courage, Lore Master<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Geisha, Savage Skald, Sea Singer, Songhealer, Sound Striker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"court-bard\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/court-bard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Court Bard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Court Bard sacrifices a lot of their generally utility for some interesting social abilities. These abilities are very situational, and even when they come into play they&#8217;re not fantastic. Unless you are in a highly social campaign, this archetype won&#8217;t do you any favors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: Most of your abilities\n\tcenter around controlling crowds in social situations.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Satire<\/span> (Su): Instead of buffing your\n\t\tallies, you can debuff your enemies. No save. Not as good as Inspire\n\t\tCourage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mockery<\/span> (Su): Only useful in rare social\n\t\tsituations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glorious Epic<\/span> (Su): Fantastic if you\n\t\thave a Rogue, but otherwise nearly worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scandal<\/span> (Su): Talk your way into crowds\n\t\tof enemies, then set them loose on each other.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Heraldic Expertise<\/span> (Ex): These skills will\n\tcome up most frequently for a Bard in court, and the reroll is nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wide Audience<\/span> (Su): The range limitation\n\tcan put the Bard in dangerous positions often. Expanding the range can go a\n\tlong way to keep you alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bardic Knowledge, Dirge of Doom, Frightening Tune, Inspire Competence, Inspire Courage, Jack-of-All-Trades<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"daredevil\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/daredevil-(archetype)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daredevil<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Daredevil&#8217;s abilities are cool and flashy, but not terribly effective. The Daredevil&#8217;s signature ability, Derring-do flies in the face of normal tactics mandated by Pathfinder&#8217;s combat rules. Unless your party is specifically built to take advantage of Derring-Do, the Daredevil will add very little to your party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Agile<\/span> (Ex): These are interesting skills.\n\tbut with the Exception of Bluff your bonus will bring you past the typical\n\tskill DC by very low levels, then will stop mattering.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You give up inspire\n\tcourage for Derring-do.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Derring-do<\/span> (Su): Unless your party is\n\t\thighly mobile, you will have a very hard time taking advantage of this\n\t\tpower. It&#8217;s an unfortunate reality of Pathfinder that the best tactical\n\t\toption is typically to stand in one and beat the snot out of your opponents,\n\t\tand most characters reflect this reality.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Canny Foe<\/span> (Ex): This will help you keep up\n\twith other characters who have full BAB, but it hardly makes you a combat\n\tmaneuver specalist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dauntless<\/span> (Ex): Mind-affecting effects make\n\tup almost all Will saves, which makes this bonus very good. On top of the\n\tBar&#8217;ds<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scoundrel&#8217;s Fortune<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are\n\tfantastic, and the ability to reroll any skill check gives you a lot of\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Inspire Courage, Lore Master, Versatile Performance, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Flame Dancer, Savage Skald, Sound Striker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"demagogue\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/demagogue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demagogue<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the Celebrity, but less of a distraction and more of a leader. Everything that the Demagogue can do could probably be replaced with a Diplomacy check if your DM is open minded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Famous<\/span>: Bluff isn&#8217;t as useful as Diplomacy,\n\tbut this is still very cool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: <\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gather Crowd<\/span> (Ex): See the Celebrity\n\t\tarchetype.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incite Violence<\/span> (Ex): I really wish that\n\t\tthere was a good way use this in combat. Imagine turning all of your enemies\n\t\tagainst their leader. Unfortuantely, Fascinate doesn&#8217;t work in combat, so\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t start this ability. Even so, you could get a lot done by whipping\n\t\ta bunch of commoners into a fury and pointing them at your problems.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Righteous Cause<\/span> (Ex): Very promising for\n\t\tRP, but clearly not a combat option. Of course, You could probably\n\t\taccomplish this with a series of Diplomacy checks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Inspire Courage (+1), Lore Master, Mass Suggestion, Suggestion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Geisha, Songhealer, Voice of The Wild<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dervish-dancer\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/dervish-dancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dervish Dancer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dervish Dancer is a really weird archetype. It removes all of the Bard&#8217;s abilities as a Support and Librarian, and piles on a bunch of really cool Striker abilities. The Dervish Dancer still gets the Bard&#8217;s skill list and skill ranks, but without Versatile Performance or Bardic Knowledge, the Dervish Dancer will have a lot more trouble covering the party&#8217;s skill needs. The Bard spell list also remains in place unchanged, so any Support capacity must come completely from spells. The archetype tries really hard to allow you to move around in combat while attacking, but until you pick up Dance of Fury at 12th level, your best bet is still to stand in place and make a full attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the strangest part of the Dervish Dancer is that it has no actual reliance on the Perform skill. Perform (Dance) is mentioned throughout the archetype, but is not used for anything but Versatile Dance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they both trade normal Bard features for combat features, it&#8217;s easy to compare the Arcane Duelist to the Dervish Dancer, and there is quite a bit of overlap between the two. The Arcane Duelist retains the ability to share Inspire Courage with allies, but the Dervish Dancer functions better as a singular melee threat, using Rain of Blows to output damage and Leaf on the Wind to defend themselves and rapidly recover hitpoints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: The scimitar\n\tis basically a heavier rapier that doesn&#8217;t allow weapon finesse, and the kukri\n\tis a scimitar with less damage. The rapier is a very solid weapon for a Bard\n\tbecause Bards typically need high dexterity to compensate for their lack of\n\tarmor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Battle Dance<\/span>: You selfish jerk. You picked\n\ta Bard, the iconic Support class, and you can only use your combat support\n\teffects on yourself. Because you can&#8217;t abuse Lingering Song, you need to be\n\tcareful about how frequently you use your buffs, or you will quickly run out\n\tof rounds.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge the dervish faces is that their best dances\n\tcompete for attention at the same time. Inspire Courage is your go-to until\n\tyou get Rain of Blows (which matches the attack bonus progression with an\n\tuntyped bonus and grants an extra attack which will provide considerably more\n\tdamage than Inspire Courage&#8217;s damage bonus), but when you get Dance of Fury at\n\t12th level you&#8217;ll need to decide which is more appealing from round to round.\n\tYou can use Haste to get the extra attack from Rain of Blows, but you&#8217;ll give\n\tup your Inspire Courage\/Rain of Blows attack bonus for the ability to move,\n\tlikely making it very difficult for you to hit.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rain of Blows<\/span> (Su): An extra attack is\n\t\tfantastic, and the attack bonus, coupled with Inspire Courage, will offset\n\t\tyour medium BAB. However, you become very dependent on Full Attacks, so be\n\t\tsure to position yourself in a way that you can get all of your attacks in.\n\t\tNote that this ability doesn&#8217;t specify melee weapons, so you could in theory\n\t\tuse a bow or throw things. This gets more useful at higher levels once you\n\t\thave Dance of Fury at 12th level because you can move and make a full attack\n\t\tat the same time. Combine this with Dance of a Hundred Cuts and possibly\n\t\twith two-weapon fighting for a mountain of damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Razor&#8217;s Kiss<\/span> (Su): If you depend on\n\t\tcritical hits this much, just get a Keen weapon. The assumption is that you\n\t\twill use this with your scimitar or kukri, but I would much rather buy a\n\t\tkeen weapon and use Inspire Courage or Rain of Blows so that I could\n\t\tactually hit something.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leaf on the Wind<\/span> (Su): You may not want to\n\t\tuse this in combat unless you are very badly wounded; any round in which you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t attack is a round in which your enemies get to do more than you. The\n\t\tdodge\/reflex bonuses are pretty great, so you can use this in place of Full\n\t\tDefense. The real draw here is the healing effect. At 14th level you have\n\t\t28+ rounds of performance, and you heal 14 points each round that you use\n\t\tthe ability. That&#8217;s potentially 392 points of healing, assuming you don&#8217;t\n\t\tuse your other performances. This can let you fight and soak up damage all\n\t\tday long. Use this before you rest every night to spend any leftover\n\t\tperformance rounds and ensure that you wake up with full hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dance of Fury<\/span> (Su): This largely solves\n\t\tthe issue of Full Attacks. Be sure to take Mobility or put ranks into\n\t\tAcrobatics or you&#8217;re going to take a lot of damage from attacks of\n\t\topportunity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fleet<\/span> (Su): Bonuses to move speed are always\n\tnice, and this can help you get into melee range on a round in which you\n\tactivated a battle dance. However, because you depend on Full Attacks to use\n\tRain of Blows, you won&#8217;t get as much use out of this as you would hope.\n\tHowever, the addition of Dance of Fury at level 12 allows you to move as part\n\tof a Full Attack, at which point this because a fantastic improvement to your\n\tmobility.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Versatile Dance<\/span> (Ex): Despite the intent\n\tof the archetype, you don&#8217;t technically need Perform (Dance) because you don&#8217;t\n\thave any abilities which use a Perform skill, and without Versatile\n\tPerformance, you don&#8217;t get any benefit for <em>any<\/em> perform skills.\n\tBecause the Dervish Dancer is a Striker archetype, your Charisma may be lower\n\tthan your Dexterity, at which point you may be better served completely\n\tignoring this ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battle Fury<\/span> (Su): If Spring Attack and\n\tWhirlwind Attack got together and spawned an ability, it would be Battle Fury.\n\tThe usefulness of this ability depends heavily on your speed and the number of\n\tenemies available, so make sure to pick up movement enhancements like\n\tLongstrider and Boots of Striding and Springing. Also keep in mind that\n\tTwo-Weapon Fighting builds won&#8217;t benefit from this ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Dirge of Doom, Frightening Performance, Mass Suggestion, Proficiencies, Suggestion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"detective\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/detective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Detective<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Detective gives up a lot of the Bard&#8217;s skills and combat buffs to really focus on investigation. While the investigation abilities would work really well for detective work, the archetype doesn&#8217;t get you anything useful for other situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You give up all of\n\tyour combat buff options for some lackluster options related to being a\n\tdetective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Careful Teamwork<\/span> (Su): The initiative bonus\n\tis helpful, and the 1 hour duration is pretty good. The other bonuses are\n\tsituational, but don&#8217;t hurt to have. You get to find and disable traps with\n\tthe Detective&#8217;s Arcane Insight ability, so the Dosable Device bonus can be\n\tvery helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">True Confession<\/span> (Su): Very situational, and\n\tnot very good. Breaking enchantment effects can be nice, but there are much\n\teasier ways to do it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Show Yourselves<\/span> (Ex): Good for revealing\n\tinvisible creatures, but the 30 foot radius makes it difficult to use when\n\tenemies are hiding.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Eye for Detail<\/span> (Ex): Perception is the most\n\trolled skill in the game, and Sense Motive is crucial to the Detective&#8217;s True\n\tConfession performance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Insight<\/span> (Ex): The ability to find\n\ttraps removes the need for a Rogue, and your bonus from Careful Teamwork can\n\tmake you very skilled at Disable Device. The other bonuses are very\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Investigation<\/span>: Instead of Versatile\n\tPerformance the Detective gets a bunch of really good divination spells added\n\tto the Bard spell list, and gets some free spells known off of the list of new\n\tspells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bardic Knowledge, Inspire Courage, Inspire Heroics, Inspire Greatness, Versatile Performance, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Flame Dancer, Savage Skald, Sound Striker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dirge-bard\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/dirge-bard-(archetype)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dirge Bard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dirge Bard trades in some of the Bard&#8217;s skill capacity and a couple of their less important knowledge powers in exchange for some cool Necromancy abilities.

Because you have a limited\n\t\tnumber of performance rounds, the longest you will ever be able to animate\n\t\tthe dead is just over four minutes. You can&#8217;t abuse Lingering Song because\n\t\tthe corpses can only be animated once. Also, you have to supply your own\n\t\tbodies. Imagine needing to haul a wagon of bodies around to animate, then\n\t\thaving to spend several rounds getting them out of the wagon before you can\n\t\tfight things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haunted Eyes<\/span> (Ex): Energy drain and death\n\teffects are very scary, and a +4 bonus is huge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Secrets of the Grave<\/span> (Ex): This provides\n\tsome very interesting options, but don&#8217;t expect to be a lord of the undead on\n\tpar with a Wizard or Cleric.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Haunting Refrain<\/span> (Su): Fear effects are\n\tgenerally gentle, but there are a few fear effects which can completely end a\n\tfight, and many of them are either on the Bard spell list, or they are a\n\tNecromancy spell that you can add to your spell list with Secrets of the\n\tGrave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Jack-of-all-trades, Lore Master, Versatile Performance, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Flame Dancer, Geisha, Sound Striker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"flame-dancer\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/flame-dancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flame Dancer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>An entire archetype dedicated to protecting your allies from fire and the &#8220;On<br>\n\tFire&#8221; condition.

You sacrifice most of the Bard&#8217;s offensive capacity by removing the Bard&#8217;s armor and most weapons, but Tea Ceremony hugely expands the utility of Bardic Performance. The Geisha gives up Striker and Defender potential and focuses almost solely on Support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When combining with other archetypes, remember that Tea Ceremony can only work with a limited number of performance effects, and many archetypes sacrifice one or more of those effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Giving up\n\tthe small set of martial weapons that the Bard gets hurts, and losing armor is\n\teven worse. Take a look at my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk#weapons\">Monk Handbook<\/a>&#8216;s\n\tweapons section for help selecting a Monk weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tea Ceremony<\/span> (Su): While it can&#8217;t be used\n\tduring combat, the 10 minute duration on these effects is hard to ignore.\n\tThough the text of Tea Ceremony does not specify, it should be assumed that\n\tyou can only affect the number of allies specified in the performance&#8217;s\n\tdescription, so you can&#8217;t use Tea Ceremony to affect 20 people with Inspire\n\tHeroics. Keep in mind that is <em>in addition to<\/em> the normal functions of\n\tBardic Performance. Before a planned fight, have a tea party to get Inspire\n\tCourage, then spend your time in combat activating other songs and casting\n\tspells. Need to find a secret door? Tea party to inspire competence with\n\tPerception. Need to make some friends? Tea party to inspire competence with\n\tDiplomacy. The uses are practically endless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Geisha Knowledge<\/span>: Your choice of Perform\n\tskill may depend on what other archetypes you select, if any. The bonus to\n\tcraft checks will likely never matter, but the bonus to Diplomacy is pretty\n\tfantastic. Losing Bardic Knowledge always hurts, but you can still compensate\n\twith a decent intelligence score and ranks in all of the important knowledge\n\tskills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Scribe Scroll<\/span>: Bards generally aren&#8217;t item\n\tcrafters, and as spontaneous casters they generally have enough spell slots to\n\tmeet their needs. However, with no armor and a very poor list of available\n\tweapons, you&#8217;re going to need as much magic as you can get your hands on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Proficiencies, Bardic Knowledge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Animal Speaker, Archaeologist, Archivist, Celebrity, Demagogue, Dirge Bard, Flame Dancer, Savage Skald, Songhealer, Sound Striker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"magician\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/magician\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magician<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Magician trades in many of the Bard&#8217;s signature abilities for some extra abilities pertaining to spellcasting. The abilities are weird grab bag, and many of them are very difficult to use. The best part of the archetype is adding some non-bard spells to your spells known, but at that point it makes more sense to play a Wizard or Sorcerer. As a whole, the archetype is ineffectual, situational, and not very interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: Giving up Inspire\n\tCourage always hurts, and the best option you get in return is Spell\n\tSuppresion, which is only useful when you&#8217;re facing enemy spellcasters.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dweomercraft<\/span> (Su): Most of these checks\n\t\tare fairly rare. Caster Level checks will be nice at high levels when Spell\n\t\tResistance is common, but the other bonuses are unlikely to be\n\t\timportant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Suppression<\/span> (Su): This is miles\n\t\tbetter than Countersong, and since your normal go-to option was given up for\n\t\tDweomercraft, you can afford to start and maintain this in every fight\n\t\tfeaturing enemy spellcasters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Metamagic Mastery<\/span> (Ex): At this point you\n\tcan start a new performance as a swift action, so ending your Metamagic Master\n\tperformance to make use of the ability means almost nothing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Magical Talent<\/span> (Ex): The bonus to UMD is\n\tpretty fantastic, and the Spellcraft bonus will help with Spell Suppresion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Counterspell<\/span>: Counterspelling is a\n\thorrible mechanic, and you should never waste your time counterspelling.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Extended Performance<\/span> (Su): Just take\n\tLingering Song.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expanded Repertoire<\/span> (Ex): Pick some good\n\toptions from the Wizard spell list. Because your save DCs will be slightly\n\tbehind Wizards, you make want to stray away from Save-or-Suck spells, but\n\tthere are tons of great buffs which Bards don&#8217;t normally get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Bond<\/span> (Ex): The Weapon and Familiar\n\toptions are the most logical for a Bard, and you can&#8217;t take either. I would\n\trecommend a ring instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wand Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Apparently you were\n\tsupposed to waste your Arcane Bond on a wand. To make the best use of this,\n\tget a wand of a spell which has an effect that doesn&#8217;t depend on caster level.\n\tDominate Person seems like a logical choice. Wands still aren&#8217;t fantastic, but\n\tthis helps quuite a bit. Combined with your UMD bonus, you can really depend\n\ton wands to expand your spell options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bardic Knowledge, Countersong, Dirge of Doom, Frightening Tune, Inspire Courage, Jack-of-All-Trades, Lore Master, Versatile Performance, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Sound Striker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sandman\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/sandman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandman<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Right off the bat, I&#8217;m going to point out that Stealspell is bad. It eats up your performance rounds, and doesn&#8217;t really get you anything interesting. Fortunately, that isn&#8217;t the only power the Sandman gets. The Sandman gets some really fantastic save-or-suck sleep effects, and some cool protections against spells. The Sandman also gets a small amount of sneak attack, and some cool stealth powers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: Slumbersong and Mass\n\tSlumber Song are possibly the most effective sleep effects in the game. And\n\tsleep is the cousin of death.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stealspell<\/span> (Su): This is really difficult\n\t\tto use. You need to know what spells the target knows or has prepared, which\n\t\tyou can only really gurantee with your allies. Enemies generally won&#8217;t spam\n\t\tthe same spell every round, so you can&#8217;t use this to harm them in any\n\t\tmeaningful way. You can use Stealspell to borrow spells from your allies to\n\t\thelp them cast spells quickly, but it&#8217;s at the expense of your Bardic\n\t\tPerformance rounds. Because you don&#8217;t have Inspire Courage or Inspire\n\t\tHeroics, you don&#8217;t have anything to sink a ton of rounds into, so you can\n\t\tafford to hold onto your ally&#8217;s spell for a while.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slumber Song<\/span> (Sp): Save or suck, and the\n\t\tDC will exceed your spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dramatic Subtext<\/span> (Su): The wording is\n\t\tsomewhat ambiguous, but if you use some form of Perform that doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\tan instrument, you may be able to cast spells while restrained or grappled.\n\t\tCheck with your GM. At the very least, you can use this to cast spells in\n\t\tsocial situations which can give you a huge advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Stealspell<\/span> (Su): Waiting until\n\t\tlevel 15 to make Stealspell a useful offensive option is disappointing.\n\t\tStealing spell resistance is actually a pretty good trick at high levels\n\t\twhen most big enemies will have spell resistance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mass Slumber Song<\/span> (Sp): AOE Save or\n\t\tSuck.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Catching<\/span> (Su): This is incredibly\n\t\tpowerful, even if the cost in Bardic Music rounds is very high. Imagine\n\t\treversing a Finger of Death or something similarly nasty.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master of Deception<\/span> (Ex): Bluff, Sleight of\n\tHand, and Stealth are some of the Rogue&#8217;s most iconic skills. Coupled with the\n\tability to disable traps, and you are basically a Rogue with a magical\n\tguitar.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneakspell<\/span> (Ex): This places much more\n\timportance on Stealth, and makes Invisibility very powerful for you. Combined\n\twith Slumber Song, you can sneak into rooms and end encounters in the surprise\n\tround with a very impressive save DC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Trap Sense<\/span> (Ex): Trap sense has never been\n\tgood.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Sneak Attack<\/span> (Ex): With such slow scaling,\n\tthis doesn&#8217;t magically turn you into a DPS Striker. However, Sneak Attack on a\n\tbard is a lot of fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bardic Knowledge, Deadly Performance, Inspire Competence, Inspire Courage, Inspire Greatness, Inspire Heroics, Lore Master, Mass Suggestion, Suggestion, Versatile Performance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"savage-skald\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/savage-skald\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Savage Skald<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Savage Skald is a Support Bard designed to support Barbarians. Unless you have a Barbarian in the party, I would never consider this. Even then, it&#8217;s not very good. This might be fun for the Cohort of a Barbarian with Leadership, but even then just to provide free Rage rounds using Incite Rage. Instead, try the Skald class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You give up your\n\tnon-combat songs for the ability to cause Rage, as the spell. Rage is a\n\t2nd-level Bard spell, and even then it&#8217;s not very good.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspiring Blow<\/span> (Su): Effects which trigger\n\t\ton critical hits are awful unless your character is built specifically for\n\t\tcritical hits, and without full BAB, you can&#8217;t really do that. On top of\n\t\tthis issue, the bonus is garbage.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incite Rage<\/span> (Su): Useful to throw on a\n\t\tFighter or a Barbarian, but still not great.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Song of the Fallen<\/span> (Sp): Very costly.\n\t\tActivating this will consume nearly half of your music rounds for the day,\n\t\tleaving you very little time to make use your new Barbarian friends.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Berserkergang<\/span> (Ex): DR is\/- nice.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Battle Song<\/span> (Su): Still not great.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fascinate, Jack-of-All-Trades, Mass Suggestion, Soothing Performance, Suggestion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Celebrity, Daredevil, Detective, Geisha, Songhealer, Street Performer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sea singer\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/sea-singer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sea Singer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I would only take this archetype in a very simulationist seafaring campaign. The abilities mostly pertain to travel, and the most interesting ability is Familiar. You can still make them work in other campaigns, but you lose a lot of the benefits if you&#8217;re not facing challenges associated with sailing,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: You mostly trade some of\n\tthe less-frequently used performance options for situational options which\n\tmostly relate to surviving at sea. They still work to outside of sailing,\n\tthough their utility is significantly reduced. At least you get to keep\n\tInspire Courage.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sea Shanty<\/span> (Su): The listed effects are\n\t\tuncommon, and sickened\/nauseated typically have short durations. You could\n\t\tuse this to remove Fatigue\/Exhaustion from some sources like from forced\n\t\tmarches or from hunger, but these effects are still rare unless you&#8217;re\n\t\ttaking actions which cause them.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Still Water<\/span> (Su): Stormy waters are a\n\t\tclassic story device in stories involving sea travel. Any sailor would love\n\t\tto have this ability handy, but it&#8217;s unlikely to be important in any other\n\t\tcampaign.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Whistle the Wind<\/span> (Su): Fantastic for\n\t\tsailors, but almost entirely useless for adventurers. Gust of Wind is very\n\t\tsituational, and it&#8217;s available as a 2nd-level spell. If you need it, you\n\t\tcan buy scrolls or a wand or something.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Call the Storm<\/span> (Su): An excellent grab\n\t\tbag of abilities.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">World Traveler<\/span> (Ex): The list of knowledge\n\tskills is decent, but Linguistics really won&#8217;t get you anything interesting.\n\tThe rerolls are also nice. It&#8217;s a fine ability, but it&#8217;s definitely not an\n\timprovement on Bardic Knowledge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Familiar<\/span>: Familiars are absolutely\n\tfantastic. They use their master&#8217;s skill bonuses, so you could send the monkey\n\tto open locks or disable traps. Flying familiars make excellent scouts,\n\tespecially for observing distant ships.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sea Legs<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but better\n\tthan Well-Versed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bardic Knowledge, Countersong, Inspire Competense, Mass Suggestion, Suggestion, Versatile Performance, Well-Versed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Celebrity<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"songhealer\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/songhealer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Songhealer<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Songhealer gives up Versatile performance and a couple of high level performance abilities for some really fantastic healing abilities. As long as no one in the party outright dies, this could allow the Bard to completely fill the party&#8217;s need for a Healer. Combined with the Bard&#8217;s already fantastic Support abilities, this is a great option for a character that doesn&#8217;t plan to spend all of their time dealing damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhance Healing<\/span> (Su): This will really\n\timprove that wand of Cure Light Wounds. And let&#8217;s be honest: If you don&#8217;t have\n\tone, you&#8217;re either very low level, very poor, or very dead. Unfortunately,\n\tit&#8217;s not nearly as good as Versatile Performance, and it&#8217;s the only thing you\n\tget out of the archetype until 14th level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: Both options are\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Performance<\/span> (Su): Trading 5 rounds\n\t\tof music for Heal is a pretty good trade.

The performance types which you give up aren&#8217;t super important, but the Soundstriker&#8217;s abilities can really be a lot of fun and do a lot of damage. However, the Soundstriker can&#8217;t keep pace with most other Blasters, so this shouldn&#8217;t be considered the character&#8217;s primary function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: The Soundstriker gives\n\tup Inspire Competence and Suggestion, but gets some very unique performances\n\twhich can deal damage using Bardic Performance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wordstrike<\/span> (Su): Amusing, but the damage\n\tis very small. Of course, sonic damage is rarely resisted, and this doesn&#8217;t\n\trequire an attack or require a saving throw. It also doesn&#8217;t specfy\n\t&#8220;unattended object&#8221;, so you might be able to use this to mess up enemies&#8217;\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weird Words<\/span> (Su): With a decent Charisma\n\tscore, this can be an effective group damage spell. You can also improve the\n\tcool-factor by using onomotopoetic sound effects (think Adam West&#8217;s Batman:\n\tPow! Bam! Wap!). This won&#8217;t keep up with things like fireball in terms of\n\tdamage, but you don&#8217;t have to worry about hitting your allies, and damage type\n\tis versatile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Inspire Competence, Suggestion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Celebrity, Daredevil, Detective, Dirge Bard, Geisha, Magician, Songhealer, Street Performer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"street-performer\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/street-performer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Street Performer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The abilities of the street performer primarily center around bluffing and distraction. You will be very dependent on your Charisma to boost your performance save DCs, and because none of your abilities do any damage, your allies will need to capitalize on invisibility to deal damage on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: Instead of boosting\n\tyour allies with Inspire Courage, you generally support them by making them\n\teffectively invisible. This can be very powerful, but make sure that your\n\tallies are capable of capitalizing on this benefit.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disappearing Act<\/span> (Su): A bit like\n\t\tInvisiblity, this can be very valuable for protecting weak characters and\n\t\tconcealing rogues. Allowing a saving throw makes this more difficult to use,\n\t\tand the 30 foot range is hard.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Harmless Performer<\/span> (Su): The sanctuary\n\t\teffect is amusing, but causing enemies to lose spells is absolutely\n\t\tfantastic. You will need to alternate between Disappearing Act and Harmless\n\t\tPerformer to avoid becoming a big noisy target.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Madcap Prank<\/span> (Su): Though unpredictable,\n\t\tmany of the effects caused by Madcap Prank are very problematic. I wouldn&#8217;t\n\t\trely on this a lot, but it might save your life in a pinch.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slip through the Crowd<\/span> (Su): Turn it on,\n\t\tconceal the whole party, and get to stabbing.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gladhanding<\/span>: Earning gold by performing is\n\thardly a way to get by compared to collecting +1 swords. Using Bluff in place\n\tof Diplomacy is amusing, and with the Streetwise bonus, your Bluff skill will\n\tbe fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Streetwise<\/span>: An interesting grab bag of\n\tskills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Quick Change<\/span> (Ex): Disguise is very\n\tsituational, but the bonuses to Bluff and the ability to take 20 once per day\n\tcan be very useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bardic Knowledge, Countersong, Inspire Competence, Inspire Courage, Inspire Greatness, Inspire Heroics, Lore Master<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Savage Skald, Songhealer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"voice-of-the-wild\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/bard\/archetypes\/paizo-bard-archetypes\/voice-of-the-wild\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Voice of the Wild<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice of The Wild sacrifices a lot of the Bard&#8217;s normal capabilities with skills in favor of expanded spell options and the ability to enhance allies with animal aspects which provide a variety of useful bonuses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wild Knowledge <\/span>(Ex): Bardic knowledge, but it\n\tonly applies to one skill.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature Magic<\/span>: Losing Versatile Performance\n\treally limits the Bard&#8217;s utility with skills, but Nature Magic opens up a ton\n\tof options.
