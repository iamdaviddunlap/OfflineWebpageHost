This seems like a\n\t\tgreat combination, but it requires that you have multiple characters in the\n\t\tparty built to use the same skills, and that&#8217;s a rarity in a game like\n\t\tPathfinder 2e where there a ton of competencies to cover between a group of\n\t\t3-6 people. You can also use Inspire Imitation outside of combat, but short\n\t\tof searching rooms and infrequent scenarios like climbing cliffs or leaping\n\t\tover chasms I don&#8217;t see many times that this would be useful.
