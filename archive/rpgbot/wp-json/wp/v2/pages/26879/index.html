The Fighter&#8217;s feats are numerous, diverse, and cater\n\tto a broad variety of playstyles. Any type of weapon can be supported by the\n\tFighter&#8217;s feat options, allowing you to truly master whatever way your\n\tcharacter prefers to fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, in some ways the Fighter is locked into the feats designed\n\tfor their preferred tactics. A fighter built for archery is going to take\n\tlargely the same feats as every other archer. This isn&#8217;t a bad thing, of\n\tcourse. If you&#8217;re going to build an archer, you&#8217;re going to build an archer,\n\tand the feats to support that are mostly obvious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>When considering feats, remember the Fighter&#8217;s level 9 Combat Flexibility and\n\tlevel 14 Improved Combat Flexibility features. These give you two additional\n\tClass Feats of 8th level and 1th level which you can change on a daily basis.\n\tYou can&#8217;t change them to prepare for every encounter, but if you&#8217;re expecting\n\ta change in terrain like going from open fields to narrow dungeon corridors,\n\tor if you&#8217;re facing a known enemy, you can use these slots to pick up\n\tsituationally useful feats which will better prepare you for what&#8217;s to\n\tcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fighter-class-feats\">Fighter Class Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#1stlevel-fighter-feats\">1st-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-2\">2nd-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-4\">4th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-6\">6th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-8\">8th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-10\">10th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-12\">12th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-14\">14th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-16\">16th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-18\">18th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-20\">20th-Level Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#legacy-fighter-class-feats\">Legacy Fighter Class Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#1stlevel-legacy-fighter-feats\">1st-Level Legacy Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-2\">2nd-Level Legacy Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-4\">4th-Level Legacy Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-6\">6th-Level Legacy Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-8\">8th-Level Legacy Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-10\">10th-Level Legacy Fighter Feats<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

That&#8217;s an extremely specific situation, and if you hit, this is\n\t\texactly the same as making a regular Strike. So this is situational, only\n\t\tuseful for single-weapon melee builds, and it only matters if you miss on\n\t\tyour second Attack in a turn where you&#8217;re planning to attack three times,\n\t\twhich is rarely the right tactical decision.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=4771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Point Blank Stance<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Excellent for\n\t\tarchers. The attack penalty for Volley weapons like the Longbow is a huge\n\t\tproblem, and the +2 damage bonus for non-Volley weapons can have a huge\n\t\timpact.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Prior to the remaster, this feat was called &#8220;Point Blank Shot&#8221;, and it\n\t\t\thad the Open trait, which required you to use it as the first Action on\n\t\t\tyour turn.

This\n\t\tis a good fallback, but if you&#8217;re committed to using a shield, you&#8217;re\n\t\tprobably counting on using the Shield Block Reaction, which will conflict\n\t\twith this until you get Quick Shield Block. If you&#8217;re not actively using\n\t\tShield Block and still want the AC bonus, use Farabellus Flip if it&#8217;s\n\t\tavailable to you.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=4773\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snagging Strike<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is a great first\n\t\tattack every round. Making the target Off-Guard reduces their AC, which\n\t\tnot only makes your own follow-up attacks more reliable, but makes things a\n\t\tlittle easier for all of your allies because the effect remains until the\n\t\tstart of your next turn or until the target moves away.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=4774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sudden Charge<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Great action\n\t\teconomy, and you still have another Action to draw a weapon or raise a\n\t\tshield. For melee characters, this is a great way to close to melee range\n\t\twithout giving up the ability to attack on your first turn.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=4775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vicious Swing<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is only\n\t\teffective with a weapon that uses d12 damage dice, and even then it&#8217;s not\n\t\tgreat. Your best use cases are on turns where you have three Actions and\n\t\tnothing better to do except make attacks, or when you&#8217;re facing an enemy\n\t\twith damage resistances. While those turns happen, they&#8217;re not every turn,\n\t\tsometimes you&#8217;ll need an Action to Step or something like that so the Action\n\t\tcost to make Power Attack more effective then other options doesn&#8217;t always\n\t\tmake sense.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>At low levels, the additional damage die can be more impactful than the\n\t\t\tadditional damage from a second Strike due to the Multiple Attack Penalty,\n\t\t\tbut weirdly the math on Power Attack actually improves at around 10th\n\t\t\tlevel. The math here is complicated, and how good Power Attack looks\n\t\t\tdepends heavily on when Runes of Striking become available, the\n\t\t\tavailability of other damage boosts like Property Runes, the prevalence of\n\t\t\tdamage resistances, and what baseline AC you use to calculate the\n\t\t\tlikelihood of hitting with your Strikes.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because the math is so complex here, it&#8217;s hard to definitively recommend\n\t\t\ttaking or not taking Power Attack. My advice: if your GM is going to let\n\t\t\tyou retrain it, give it a try and see if it works out for you. If there&#8217;s\n\t\t\ta risk that it won&#8217;t work out and you&#8217;ll be stuck with it forever, look\n\t\t\telsewhere.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p>Prior to the remaster, this feat was called &#8220;Power Attack&#8221;.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-2\">2nd-Level Fighter Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=4776\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aggressive Block<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing your shield to block an attack, pushing an enemy 5 feet away probably\n\t\tputs them out of reach, thereby denying them the ability to make another\n\t\tattack.
