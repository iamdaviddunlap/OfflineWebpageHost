Each maneuver, much like a spell, is a tool tailor-made to address a specific situation or problem, allowing the Battle Master to respond dynamically to scenarios which are often more complex than simple hit point attrition and which require more nuanced solutions than swinging your weapon until your enemy falls down. Some maneuvers even allow the Fighter to be effective in social situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Martial Adept feat and the Superior Technique Fighting Style have not\n\tbeen reprinted in the 2024 rules. Since the 2024 rules are\n\tbackwards-compatible with the 2014 rules, Martial Adept should still be\n\tavailable. It would be reasonable to assume that Superior Technique is\n\tavailable as a Fighting Style feat, but a strict reading of rules would mean\n\tthat it isn&#8217;t since it hasn&#8217;t been reprinted under the new version of the\n\tFighting Style feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Superiority<\/span>: You get four\n\t\tsuperiority dice, which means you get to use 4 maneuvers between each\n\t\tshort\/long rest. You gradually get more dice, allowing for more maneuvers at\n\t\thigher levels, and you gradually add more known maneuvers. You can replace\n\t\tknown maneuvers as you level, but since there aren&#8217;t any maneuvers with\n\t\tprerequisites or anything, you really only need to replace maneuvers that\n\t\tyou tried and didn&#8217;t like.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Many maneuvers add your superiority die to the damage roll if you hit.\n\t\t\tSince the damage die is added to the damage roll, the additional damage is\n\t\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit. This makes it especially appealing to apply\n\t\t\ta maneuver when you score a critical hit so that you get both a big pile\n\t\t\tof damage and a cool rider effect.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Student of War<\/span>: An Artisan&#8217;s tool and\n\t\tanother skill from the Fighter&#8217;s skill list. Artisan&#8217;s tools provide a few\n\t\tuses as described in the Equipment chapter of the PHB, and another skill may\n\t\toffer some useful options outside of combat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Know Your Enemy<\/span>: Vulnerabilities are\n\t\tvanishingly rare in 5e, but knowing an enemy&#8217;s resistances and immunities\n\t\tcan make life much easier against some enemies. You won&#8217;t need this in every\n\t\tfight because most enemies have no resistances or because their resistances\n\t\tare obvious (fire elementals are immune to fire, etc.).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This does not specify immunity to damage, so it appears to also affect\n\t\t\timmunity to conditions. However, advantage\/disadvantage on saves against\n\t\t\tspecific conditions aren&#8217;t considered resistances\/vulnerabilities.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Combat Superiority (d10)<\/span>: These\n\t\tbumps only amount to an increase of 1 each, but they feel very nice. Because\n\t\tyou&#8217;re using Superiority Dice so frequently the small bonus adds up.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless<\/span>: This ensures that you always\n\t\thave at least one superiority die, so you can use maneuvers much more\n\t\tfreely. The free die is once per turn, so it&#8217;s especially useful for\n\t\tReactions. You can also use it outside of combat with Commanding Presence,\n\t\tgiving yourself a perpetual +1d8 to some types of Charisma checks, making\n\t\tyou fairly effective as a Face even with awful Charisma.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Combat Superiority (d12)<\/span>: These\n\t\tbumps only amount to an increase of 1 each, but they feel very nice and\n\t\tsince you&#8217;re using Superiority Dice so frequently the small bonus adds\n\t\tup.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-master-maneuvers\">Battle Master Maneuvers<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Melee-only maneuvers are marked with (M), while non-attack utility maneuvers are marked with (U).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ambush<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (U): A bonus\n\t\tto Stealth can have a huge impact even though you&#8217;re likely not sneaking\n\t\tduring combat. How effective this will be depends somewhat on your DM and\n\t\thow they apply the Stealth rules. If your DM asks for repeated Stealth\n\t\tchecks in quick succession, this won&#8217;t work out. But, if you can make one\n\t\tcheck and sneak through a room or disappear into a crowd or explore a small\n\t\tarea, this could be very helpful. This can also be used when rolling\n\t\tinitiative which is useful if you have something like the Bugbear&#8217;s Surprise\n\t\tAttack.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bait and Switch<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (U):\n\t\tSituational, but very interesting if you have frail allies who tend to get\n\t\tstuck in melee from time to time. Switching places with them can pull them\n\t\tout of melee reach, and, if they can act before your enemies, your ally could\n\t\twithdraw to safety, removing the need for you to boost their AC and thereby\n\t\tallowing you to keep that benefit for yourself without feeling selfish.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Commander&#8217;s Strike<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: (U) If you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have a Rogue in your party, this is generally a poor option since you\n\t\tshould do enough damage on your own that you should reserve your limited\n\t\tpool of Superiority Dice for other options. If you have a Rogue in the\n\t\tparty, this becomes a fantastic option which you should capitalize on any\n\t\ttime your Rogue can reliably hit the target. Sneak Attack works once per\n\t\tturn (not once per round), so allowing the Rogue to make an extra attack on\n\t\tyour turn means a big pile of extra Sneak Attack damage.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Commanding Presence<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Adding a\n\t\tsuperiority die is enough to offset a poor Charisma score, allowing the\n\t\tBattle Master Fighter to serve as a Face without further splitting their\n\t\tattention on ability scores. This notably omits Charisma (Deception), so\n\t\tthere&#8217;s mechanical incentive to be honest.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disarming Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Bonus\n\t\tdamage and you get to force the target to drop one item if they fail a\n\t\tStrength save. Unfortunately, relatively few enemies use weapons, and the\n\t\tones that do predominantly rely on Strength and will therefore have high\n\t\tStrength saves. That means that this is unreliable against most melee\n\t\tcombatants, but can see some use against foes armed with ranged weapons or\n\t\tenemy casters holding some kind of focus or wand.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Distracting Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very\n\t\thelpful with a Rogue or some other Striker in the party, especially against\n\t\tenemies with high AC. However, its usefulness diminishes if you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tan ally who can follow your attack with a single high-damage attack to\n\t\tcapitalize on Advantage. Sneak Attack is an obvious example, but also look\n\t\tfor high-damage attack spells like Inflict Wounds and Chromatic Orb.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Evasive Footwork<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: (U)\n\t\tDisengage as a Bonus Action and get an AC bonus until your next turn.\n\t\tObviously great if you need to Disengage, but you might even use this just\n\t\tfor the AC boost if you&#8217;re expecting to draw a lot of attacks.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feinting Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Advantage\n\t\ton your own attack and bonus damage. You don&#8217;t want to use this on every\n\t\tattack, but you can use it in conjunction with a Vex weapon to chain\n\t\tAdvantage on your attacks, or you could use it with an Unarmed Strike to\n\t\tmore reliably knock your target prone to get Advantage on future\n\t\tattacks.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Goading Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A good\n\t\ttaunt mechanic, but not as effective as Menacing Attack unless your target\n\t\tis resistant or immune to fear.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lunging Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: (M) Dash as\n\t\ta Bonus Action and potentially a damage bonus with a melee attack. A good\n\t\tway to close to melee, but you don&#8217;t need to Dash frequently, so this is\n\t\tonly situationally useful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Maneuvering Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: It&#8217;s rare\n\t\tthat this will provide a significant advantage unless you&#8217;re using the\n\t\tflanking variant rule or something. Movement in 5e is easy, and using\n\t\tsomething like Menacing Attack to impose Disadvantage on a potential\n\t\tOpportunity Attack is likely sufficient in most cases, or you can use\n\t\tPushing Attack to push enemies away and get allies out of grapples.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Menacing Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Frightening\n\t\ta target makes them considerably less effective, and, with clever positioning\n\t\tor the Push Weapon Mastery, you can use this to keep the target away from\n\t\tyour allies. However, beware of creatures that are immune or resistant to\n\t\tfear effects.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Parry<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: (U)\n\t\tReducing damage is often much more effective than waiting to heal it later,\n\t\tbut it is probably more effective to spend the same Superiority Die to\n\t\tdefeat your attacker than it is to spend it reducing a little bit of damage.\n\t\tThe damage reduced also doesn&#8217;t scale much since your Superiority Dice scale\n\t\tin size so slowly, so this may be a good option at low levels when you have\n\t\trelatively few hit points, but consider retraining at once you&#8217;re more\n\t\tconfident in your durability.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precision Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Great\n\t\tagainst enemies with high AC, or if you absolutely need to make one attack\n\t\thit, but don&#8217;t rely on it too heavily or it will eat through your\n\t\tSuperiority Dice. Sometimes you need to accept that you missed.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This is used after you make the attack roll, but you don&#8217;t want to use\n\t\t\tthis every time that you miss. If you&#8217;re paying enough attention to know\n\t\t\tthe target&#8217;s AC based on dice rolls, you can estimate when using this\n\t\t\tmakes sense. The closer you are to hitting, the more likely this is to\n\t\t\twork. At an average bonus of 4.5 (more once your dice advanced to d10\/d12)\n\t\t\tI recommend only using this if you&#8217;re within 4 points of hitting.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>It&#8217;s easy to compare Precision Attack to Feinting Attack since both make\n\t\t\tit easier to hit. Feinting Attack provides Advantage and a damage boost,\n\t\t\tbut you need to use it before the attack. Precision Attack is nice because\n\t\t\tyou can use it after your attack roll if you know that your Superiority\n\t\t\tDie could turn a near-miss into a hit, so you&#8217;re not forced to gamble a\n\t\t\tSuperiority Die that you might not need to spend. Feinting Attack provides\n\t\t\ta damage bonus, which means that even if you didn&#8217;t need Advantage you\n\t\t\tstill get something out of spending your die. Precision Attack doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\trequire you to spend your Bonus Action. Taking all of these considerations\n\t\t\tinto account, they&#8217;re roughly equivalent. Which is better depends greatly\n\t\t\ton your build and your situation. If you use Bonus Actions heavily,\n\t\t\tdefinitely go for Precision Attack.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pushing Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Using an\n\t\tUnarmed Strike to Shove or using a Push weapon is typically sufficient for\n\t\tStrength-based melee builds, but for Dexterity-based builds and for ranged\n\t\tbuilds, this can be a helpful way to break grapples or knock enemies out of\n\t\tposition. Small creatures also aren&#8217;t penalized for their size, making this\n\t\tan easy and reliable way to push enemies. It&#8217;s still only situationally\n\t\tuseful, but it&#8217;s difficult to replicate by any other means short of\n\t\tmagic.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rally<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This won&#8217;t\n\t\tbe a lot of hit points, until you&#8217;ve gained a few levels, but the temporary\n\t\thit points don&#8217;t have a specified expiration, so they last until they run\n\t\tout or the target takes a Long Rest. You can start each day by rallying your\n\t\tallies, then immediately take a Short Rest to get your Superiority Dice\n\t\tback.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Riposte<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: (M) Spend a\n\t\tsuperiority die for an attack as a Reaction. Seems like a fantastic trade to\n\t\tme, especially if you\u2019re using a big two-handed weapon and do a lot of\n\t\tdamage per attack. Also great if you have a once per turn damage boost like\n\t\tSneak Attack from levels in Rogue.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Sweeping Attack<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is\n\t\tvery little damage, and you can get much better utility from your\n\t\tsuperiority dice.

True Strike looks appealing\n\t\t\ton its face, but Intelligence-based attacks are a harder prospect since\n\t\t\tyour Intelligence will lag behind your Strength or Dexterity.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The text explicitly calls of the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s spells &#8220;Wizard\n\t\t\tSpells&#8221;, which means that Wizard features and Eldritch Knight features work\n\t\t\twell together when multiclassing.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Bond<\/span>: Very cool, but it rarely\n\t\thas any mechanical impact unless you plan to throw your weapon(s) or want to\n\t\tappear unarmed somewhere. Casting spells like Light or Darkness on your\n\t\tbonded weapon before throwing it means that you can place the spell effect\n\t\tat greater range and recall the weapon in order to throw it again. But this\n\t\tcombo is both more work and less effective than most methods for abusing\n\t\tmagical darkness.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can accomplish some odd shenanigans like bonding to oversized weapons\n\t\t\tor even siege weapons in order to freely teleport a massive object to\n\t\t\tyourself, but be cautious about how much your DM will tolerate before they\n\t\t\thave your bonded trebuchet appear in your hand and summarily crush it.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">War Magic<\/span>: A fantastic way to use weapons\n\t\tand spells at the same time. Most spells will rely on your Intelligence to\n\t\tattack, so your best options are Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade because\n\t\tthey rely on weapon attacks.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade aren&#8217;t available, your next best\n\t\t\tbet may be True Strike to add an on-hit damage boost to a hit with your\n\t\t\tweapon. Your Intelligence is probably going to lag behind your Strength\/Dexterity,\n\t\t\tso try to get Advantage before you attack to make up for the relative loss\n\t\t\tof attack bonus. Using a Vex weapon or knocking your target prone are\n\t\t\tgreat options.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Once you pick up Eldritch Strike, you might switch to a cantrip which\n\t\t\tcalls for a saving throw like Toll the Dead. Whether Toll the Dead will\n\t\t\tdeal more damage than a weapon cantrip will depend on your other build\n\t\t\tchoices.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that this works each time that you take the Attack action. If\n\t\t\tyou use Action Surge, you can use War Magic again. Unfortunately, this\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t work with Haste because Haste places additional limits on the\n\t\t\tadditional Action which it provides.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Strike<\/span>: Since your Intelligence\n\t\tprobably won&#8217;t be as high as that of a real Wizard, save DCs can be a real problem.\n\t\tImposing disadvantage will make your spells considerably more effective.\n\t\tThis can enable some interesting combinations like attacking a bunch of\n\t\tadjacent enemies, then using War Magic to hit them with Acid Splash or Sword\n\t\tBurst, or shooting a bunch of enemies with a bow then hitting them with a\n\t\tfireball on the next turn.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Charge<\/span>: This is as much movement as\n\t\tusing the Dash action for most characters, so, combined with Action Surge,\n\t\tyou get to do almost as much as you could in a complete additional turn (you\n\t\tstill don&#8217;t get a second Bonus Action).<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved War Magic<\/span>: Level 1 and 2 spells\n\t\twon&#8217;t be great for damage at this level compared to an entire Action worth\n\t\tof attacks, but you can easily use this for buffs like Enlarge\/Reduce,\n\t\tdebuffs like Ray of Sickness, save-or-suck spells like Tasha&#8217;s Hideous\n\t\tLaughter, and area control options like Web.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you&#8217;re making a spell attack, I strongly recommend a Vex weapon to\n\t\t\tmake up for your Intelligence likely not being at 20. If you&#8217;re relying on\n\t\t\ta saving throw, you still want to attack your target(s) first to trigger\n\t\t\tEldritch Strike to debuff their saves.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This doesn&#8217;t conflict with War Magic, so you could trade three attacks to\n\t\t\tcast a Cantrip and a level 1 or level 2 spell in one Action. Once you get\n\t\t\tto level 20 and get your 4th attack, you can make a weapon attack and\n\t\t\tstill cast spells twice in a single Action. Literally no one else gets to\n\t\t\tdo that.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that you&#8217;re still limited to casting one spell with a spell slot\n\t\t\tper turn, so even if you use Action Surge, you won&#8217;t be able to cast\n\t\t\tanother level 1 or level 2 spell with Improved War Magic.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"psi-warrior\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Psi Warrior<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Psi Warrior Fighter is a martial psionics user, making use of a\n\tsemi-magical mechanism known as &#8220;psionics&#8221; to produce effects which are\n\tborderline but technically not magical. Is it magic? Not quite, but more &#8220;yes&#8221;\n\tthan &#8220;no&#8221;. The Psi Warrior plays similarly to the Battle Master, but with\n\tconsiderably less analysis paralysis since you get a fixed set of\n\tabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psionic Power<\/span>: Your pool of Psionic Energy\n\t\tDice are your defining resource. You get from 4 to 12 dice over your career,\n\t\tand the size goes from d6 to d12 over the course of your career. That sounds\n\t\tlike a big pool, but they mostly recharge on a Long Rest, and between Long\n\t\tRests you can recharge just one die per Short Rest.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If your DM adheres to the Adventuring Day rules in the DMG, that means\n\t\t\tyou can recharge just two dice per day. Across a full day of adventuring,\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s a small pool to work with. You need to be cautious about spending\n\t\t\tyour dice rather than burning through them in the first encounter. The\n\t\t\tinitial options for spending your Psionic Energy Dice are easy ways to\n\t\t\tquickly burn through your dice for modest amounts of damage or\n\t\t\tprotection.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protective Field<\/span>: Preventing some or\n\t\t\t\tall of the damage from an attack can keep you or an ally fighting, and\n\t\t\t\tcan help allies maintain Concentration on spells. Save this for when hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints are low or when an ally&#8217;s Concentration is crucial, otherwise you\n\t\t\t\trisk running through your Psionic Energy dice in a hurry.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Psionic Strike<\/span>: A modest burst of\n\t\t\t\tdamage. The damage is a separate source from your attack (it deals\n\t\t\t\tdamage on its own rather than adding damage to the attack), so it&#8217;s not\n\t\t\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>I wouldn&#8217;t consider this a go-to option until you add Telekinetic\n\t\t\t\t\tThrust at level 7 because your pool of dice is too small and too\n\t\t\t\t\tprecious to spend on something as mundane as a tiny bit of damage.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, you might make an exception in cases where the extra damage\n\t\t\t\t\tcould kill the creature or cause it to lose Concentration (since it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\ta separate source of damage it forces a second saving throw).<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Movement<\/span>: Situational.\n\t\t\t\tYou get it once per Short Rest, which is often be enough, but you can\n\t\t\t\tuse it again for a Psionic Energy Die if you need to. This is forced\n\t\t\t\tmovement (even though the target is willing), so you can use it to pull\n\t\t\t\tallies out of melee (even if they&#8217;re grappled) without provoking\n\t\t\t\tOpportunity Attacks.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-none\">Telekinetic Adept<\/span>: Two new options for\n\t\tusing your Psionic Energy Dice.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Psi-Powered Leap<\/span>: Even though the\n\t\t\t\tflight only lasts until the end of your current turn, that&#8217;s enough to\n\t\t\t\tget into melee with flying enemies and beat them up (consider using\n\t\t\t\tAction Surge to maximize the benefits) or Shove them prone to force them\n\t\t\t\tto fall. You can also use this to fly over pits, high walls, and other\n\t\t\t\tbarriers. You get this once for free, but if you need it again you can\n\t\t\t\trecharge it with a Psionic Energy Die.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Thrust<\/span>: Unarmed Strikes\n\t\t\t\tand Topple mastery weapons are typically sufficient for Strength-based\n\t\t\t\tfighters who want to knock enemies prone, but this is a great counter to\n\t\t\t\tflying enemies for Dexterity-based builds. Flying creatures that are\n\t\t\t\tknocked Prone fall, which can both cause a lot of damage and bring them\n\t\t\t\tinto melee range.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>While this doesn&#8217;t consume a Psionic Energy die on its own, this is\n\t\t\t\t\tan optional rider effect that you add to Psionic Strike, which does\n\t\t\t\t\tconsume a die.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Guarded Mind<\/span>: Charm and Fear effects are\n\t\tcommon and annoying across the full level range, and can take you out of a\n\t\tfight. They&#8217;re especially good counters to martial characters (like you)\n\t\tbecause they tend to require Wisdom saving throws which martial characters\n\t\tare usually bad at. Indomitable does make this somewhat redundant, but in a\n\t\tlong adventuring day you might prefer to dip into your Psionic Energy Dice\n\t\trather than spending precious Indomitable uses.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Resistance to psychic damage is nice, but only situationally useful\n\t\t\tbecause psychic damage is rare.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bulwark of Force<\/span>: +2 AC and +2 on\n\t\tDexterity saves to you and possibly the rest of your party for 1 minute,\n\t\tactivated as a Bonus Action. This is a great buff at any level, but remember\n\t\tthat it won&#8217;t stack with other sources of cover. You only get to use this\n\t\tonce per day, but you can recharge it with a Psionic Energy Die, and I\n\t\trecommend doing so. The +2 AC to your whole party will mitigate a huge\n\t\tamount of damage in a typical fight. +2 on a 20-point scale is 10% of the\n\t\tscale, so a +2 AC bonus will negate roughly 10% of all attack damage to your\n\t\tparty in that encounter.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Master<\/span>: By this level it&#8217;s\n\t\tentirely possible that you have raised both your Strength\/Dexterity and your\n\t\tIntelligence to 20, so your Intelligence checks may be very good. That makes\n\t\tTelekinesis a useful option in combat, especially against foes with poor\n\t\tStrength like many spellcasters. You can use this to lift foes into the air\n\t\tand drop them, to move them over pits or into hazards, or just to pull them\n\t\tinto melee range.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The ability to make a weapon attack as a Bonus Action while concentrating\n\t\t\ton Telekinesis is very exciting. The obvious intent is that you use your\n\t\t\tAction to use Telekinesis, and that can be a powerful combination: lift\n\t\t\tyour target into the air and shoot them, or drop them to force them to\n\t\t\tfall prone before attacking them in melee.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, you&#8217;re under no obligation to actually use Telekinesis while\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re concentrating on it. The spell has a 10-minute duration, so you can\n\t\t\teasily use it as a buff to add an attack as a Bonus Action. If you enjoy\n\t\t\tthis strategy, I think you&#8217;ll agree that spending a Psionic Energy Die to\n\t\t\trecharge this ability is well worth the cost to get an additional attack\n\t\t\twith little effort.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Your choice of subclass will greatly affect the way you function in combat.
