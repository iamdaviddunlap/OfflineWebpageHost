In the <a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/coreRulebook\/combat.html#actions-in-combat\">Actions in Combat<\/a> table, &#8220;Charge&#8221; says &#8220;No&#8221; in the &#8220;Attack of Opportunity&#8221; column because no part of the Charge action provokes an attack of opportunity beyond the parts of the action that already do so.

This has some extremely important implications:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The footnote makes the most important part of are control defense functional. If enemies could charge you and get inside your reach for free, the entire strategy would only work if enemies were actively trying to get past you. If they were happy to focus on you (which is a success by some measures), most of your build falls apart and you&#8217;re left hugely vulnerable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can get two attacks against charging enemies if you prepare an action. This means that you can get double damage with weapons with the Brace property from the prepared action and use your attack of opportunity to trip them or something.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that the AC penalty from charging applies as soon as the charge is declared, so your attacks of opportunity benefit from the AC penalty. Also remember that Combat Reflexes doesn&#8217;t allow you to get multiple attacks of opportunity against the same target for leaving one of your threatened squares, so even if you&#8217;ve got massive reach you&#8217;ll probably only get one AoO per target per turn unless you also trip them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-foot-steps\">5-Foot Steps and Their Implications<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At medium size without anything beyond a reach weapon, 5-foot steps present a serious problem. Enemies can move into your reach and stop (or be stopped), then on the following turn take a 5-foot step inside your reach, preventing you from hitting them with your fancy polearm. This then forces you to step away to attack them, putting you in a perpetual retreat until one of you dies. At low levels this will be a major problem, but as you pick up feats (see the &#8220;Feats&#8221; section, below) you can collect some options which will prevent or mitigate this problem. You can also use difficult to prevents 5-foot steps, but most area control defenders won&#8217;t have easy access to effects which create it, so you&#8217;ll need to depend on feats instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"reach-diagrams\">Reach Diagrams<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While the official SRD omits them, d20PFSRD.com provides some <a href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/gamemastering\/combat\/space-reach-threatened-area-templates\/\">excellent reach diagrams<\/a> (you&#8217;ll need to scroll half-way down the page).

The green area is your &#8220;natural&#8221; reach (the stuff you could punch). The red area is what you can reach with a reach weapon.

At small size, that&#8217;s probably still fine. Outside of that narrow band of sizes, it starts to fall apart. There are three possible interpretations of the how reach works with a whip, each of which we&#8217;ll examine. If you care about rules minutae or need to explain this to your DM, read on. If you just want to know the answer, skip to &#8220;So what&#8217;s the answer&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whips-raw\">Strict RAW<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>All creatures have 15-foot reach with whips. While this is the answer best supported by the rules text, it falls apart almost immediately when you begin to think about its implications. A colossal creature using a whip wouldn&#8217;t be able to hit creatures which it could reach with its bare hands. Tiny and smaller creatures could use a whip that&#8217;s clearly too long for them to weild effectively. If we somehow for a fine sized creature (as big as a fly) to use a whip, they would still have 15-foot reach. Imagine a fly whipping you from across a room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whips-plus-10\">+10 Method<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>All creatures extend their natural reach by 10 feet with whips. This method is supported by exactly one piece of evidence: <a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary\/demon.html#demon-balor\">Balors<\/a>. Balors are large, and have a whip with 20-foot reach. This means that at large size, whips give you as much reach as a polearm. This negates much of the usefulness of a whip, but one could argue that it makes sense if you consider the tensile strength of the weapon as you make it gradually larger. The idea of a whip large enough for a collosal creature like a giant which uses whole trees as weapons seems a bit far-fetched, but in a world where that giant exists it&#8217;s hard to argue such strict adherence to real-world physics. Maybe collosal giants use whips made of dragon leather or something. As we extend beyond the small to large size band, this interpretation faces the same issues as the Strict RAW interpretation. Flies still get to whip you from across the room, and colossal giants still can&#8217;t reach the ends of their own arms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whips-times-three\">x3 Method<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>All creatures triple their natural reach with whips. This interpretation has no basis in the official rules text. However, it has the closest thing we have ever gotten to an official FAQ\/Errata answer. According to Paizo Creative Direction James Jacobs, <a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/threads\/rzs2l7ns&amp;page=427?Ask-James-Jacobs-ALL-your-Questions-Here#21334\">whips triple the creatures natural reach<\/a>. Tiny and smaller creatures are still a weird case, and Jacobs suggest 10-foot whip reach for tiny creatures, which might still mean that flies can whip you from across a room. Notably, this also makes the balor stats incorrect. Personally I think that this is fine. It&#8217;s one bit of text in exactly one monster, and could be easily erratad if Paizo ever chose to officialy clarify whips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whips-answer\">So what&#8217;s the answer?<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Unclear, but I think the x3 method makes the most sense based on the evidence cited above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building\">Building an Area Control Defender<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Few traits cater to Area Control Defenders, and the few available are poor. Fortunately, that leaves you room to put your traits toward other aspects of your build like compensating for poor saving throws or skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bullied<\/span> (Combat): I would only take this\n\t\ton a Monk, and even then it&#8217;s not fantastic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fencer<\/span> (Combat): Unless your DM considers a\n\t\tNaginata to be similar to a dagger or a sword, this is worthless. You need\n\t\treach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tactician<\/span> (Combat): The once per day\n\t\tlimitation makes this really difficult to justify.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes\">Classes and Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Nearly any class can play an area control defender since almost every class gets proficiency with the longspear (druids and wizards are the exceptions). I won&#8217;t go into detail on every class and archetype here, but I&#8217;ll cover those classes which are well suited to the role, and any archetypes which specifically contribute to the concept.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Alchemist<\/span>: Limited to longspears by\n\t\tdefault, but a level dip into any one of several classes will get you a\n\t\tbetter reach weapon. I recommend fighter if you want a polearm, but if you\n\t\twant a whip go for Mysterious Avenger. Alchemists get a lot that works for\n\t\tare control defenders. Mutagen provides fantastic ability score buffs, and\n\t\tthe alchemist&#8217;s spell list includes lots of great options for improving your\n\t\treach, including Enlarge Person, Long Arm, and a whole bunch of polymorph\n\t\tspells including monstrous physique (monstrous humanoids) and giant form\n\t\twhich will allow you to continue using your awesome polearm and giving you\n\t\tbetter than large size, thereby increasing your reach far beyond what a\n\t\tfighter can do.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Barbarian<\/span>: If you want to do things the\n\t\thard way, go for Barbarian. You won&#8217;t get bonus feats, but Rage will give\n\t\tyou useful bonuses to your attacks and such which will be very helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodrager<\/span>: Largely identical to the\n\t\tBarbarian, but access to spells provides an extra set of options for\n\t\tincreasign your reach. Enlarge Person and Long Arm are both on the\n\t\tBloodrager spell list, and they&#8217;re two of the easiest options. The Aberrant\n\t\tbloodline provides a permanent 5 foot increase to your reach at 4th level,\n\t\twhich is amazing.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Brawler<\/span>: Falling somewhere between the\n\t\tMonk and the Fighter, the Brawler is a great option due to their bonus feats\n\t\t(which are further improved by Brawler&#8217;s Cunning) and access to Martial\n\t\tFlexibility. However, the only reach weapon in which they&#8217;re proficient is\n\t\tthe longspear, so you should strongly consider finding proficiency in\n\t\tsomething more effective like a Guisarme. You can use unarmed strikes in\n\t\tplace of armor spikes since brawlers don&#8217;t get heavy armor proficiency,\n\t\twhich allows you to attack foes inside your polearm&#8217;s reach. Martial\n\t\tFlexibility also allows you to temporarily pick up feats like Cleave, Spring\n\t\tAttack, and Whirlwind Attack in situations where those feats are useful.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Cavalier<\/span>: Charging into combat can be a\n\t\tgreat way to get into position. Unfortunately, your choice of reach weapon\n\t\talmost certainly shouldn&#8217;t be a lance due to its lack of useful properties\n\t\tlike brace and trip. If you&#8217;re fine losing the lance&#8217;s bonus damage or\n\t\tlosing the special properties, this can still be a workable option.\n\t\tCavaliers even get a handful of bonus feats to help get you up and\n\t\trunning.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: The Growth subdomain is a\n\t\tworkable option. Not only does it give the Cleric access to Enlarge Person,\n\t\tthe subdomain power allows you enlarge yourself for 1 round as a swift\n\t\taction. This is a great trick if you can&#8217;t get away with being permanently\n\t\tenlarged. However, clerics have 2\/3 BAB, don&#8217;t get bonus combat feats, and\n\t\tonly get proficiency in simple weapons so your best option is probably just\n\t\tto poke things with a longspear. Stand Still is still an option, but I\n\t\treally don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough, and if you&#8217;re gambling attack bonus on\n\t\tPower Attack you&#8217;re not going to be reliable with Stand Still.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter<\/span>: All of the feats you could ever\n\t\twant, and some archetypes which make good Area Control Defenders. Even\n\t\twithout the archetypes, Fighter is an excellent choice. On top of that,\n\t\tfighters get access to several fighter-exclusive feats like Pin Down, and\n\t\tthe Weapon Focus feat chain and the Weapon Training class feature both add\n\t\tcrucial attack bonuses which improve your combat maneuvers.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Phalanx Soldier<\/span>: Phalanx Fighting and\n\t\t\t\tReady Pike are great for Area Control Defenders, the archetype&#8217;s biggest\n\t\t\t\tgimick is using a polearm one-handed with a shield, which becomes\n\t\t\t\tlargely pointless when you pick up an animated shield.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Polearm Master<\/span>: Pole fighting is a\n\t\t\t\ttrap: use armor spikes. Steadfast Pike and Polearm Training appear to\n\t\t\t\tstack, which will make your attacks extremely reliable. Step Aside\n\t\t\t\ttotally resolves the 5-foot step issue, but doesn&#8217;t come along until\n\t\t\t\t17th level.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Inquisitor<\/span>: You can get the Growth\n\t\tsubdomain in place of an inquisition, which allows you enlarge yourself for\n\t\tone round at a time as a swift action. However, like clerics, inquisitors\n\t\tonly get simple weapons, medium armor, and 2\/3 BAB, so they face all of the\n\t\tsame limitations.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Magus<\/span>: Magi get all of the same useful\n\t\tarea control defender spells that alchemists get, but they have better\n\t\toffensive spell options which they can use in conjunction with their polearm\n\t\tshenanigans to further inhibit enemies. Access to teleportation spells like\n\t\tdimension door also means that you can teleport into position.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Monk<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s bonus feats provide\n\t\tseveral essential options for Area Control Defenders including Combat\n\t\tReflexes and Improved Trip. Monks don&#8217;t get many options for reach weapons,\n\t\tbut the Double-Chained Kama should do just fine. Unfortunately, Monks don&#8217;t\n\t\thave full BAB so you may have trouble qualifying for some feats.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Monk, Unchained<\/span>: Largely the same as the\n\t\tMonk, but no archetypes are available, and the BAB change makes it easier to\n\t\tqualify for feats.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Paladin<\/span>: Several of the Paladin&#8217;s spells\n\t\tallow you to taunt enemies or otherwise force them to attack you or remain\n\t\tinside your reach. The Adept Champion feat provides a way to get a massive\n\t\tboost to your CMB against smite targets. Plus, paladins are notoriously\n\t\tdifficult to kill.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath Against Savagery<\/span>: Holy Reach may\n\t\t\t\tbe able to supplant Lunge, but personally I prefer not to chain a\n\t\t\t\tmechanic which is so central to a build to a daily resource.\n\t\t\t\tHordebreaker is also fantastic, allowing you to skimp on Dexterity and\n\t\t\t\tCombat Reflexes.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger<\/span>: No options that cater to Area\n\t\tControl Defenders.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Swashbuckler<\/span>: The Opportune Parry and\n\t\tRiposte deed is a neat trick, but can&#8217;t be used with the polearms which area\n\t\tcontrol defenders depend upon to do their jobs.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mysterious Avenger<\/span>: If you want to\n\t\t\t\tuse a whip (which is a good option), taking a single level of Mysterious\n\t\t\t\tAvenger Swashbuckler is a great idea. It gets you proficiency with whips\n\t\t\t\tand the ability to use whips with Swashbuckler Deeds like Opportune\n\t\t\t\tParry and Riposte. Whips can be difficult, but might be worth the\n\t\t\t\teffort. It also improves the Swordmaster&#8217;s Flair dramatically (see Magic\n\t\t\t\tItems, below).<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Warpriest<\/span>: Some bonus feats, and you get\n\t\tto select them as though you were a fighter of the same level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Antagonize<\/span>: While not directly part of\n\t\tthe Area Control Defender combat strategy, Antagonize can be an excellent\n\t\tway to complement your other feats. The Diplomacy option adds a small\n\t\timpedence which makes it harder for enemies to attack your allies, and the\n\t\tIntimidate option provides a forced &#8220;taunt&#8221; effect (one of very few such\n\t\teffects in the game). The diplomacy option is great as a fallback option\n\t\twhen you don&#8217;t have a better idea for how to spend your standard action for\n\t\ta turn. Move into position, and antagonize an enemy while you wait for\n\t\tenemies to engage you. The Intimidate option only lasts one round unless the\n\t\ttarget can&#8217;t attack you that round (maybe they were tripped?), but you can\n\t\textend it for a second round as an Immediate action. That&#8217;s two rounds of an\n\t\tenemy forced to do nothing else but attempt to attack you, which is\n\t\t<em>exactly<\/em> what you want them to do. The Intimidate option only works\n\t\tonce per day, unfortunately, but I&#8217;ve used it to force enemies to run past\n\t\tseveral of my allies, drawing them away from frail allies and provoking\n\t\tseveral AoO&#8217;s in the process. Use traits to get Diplomacy or Intimate as\n\t\tclass skills, and even with poor Charisma you should be able to use this\n\t\treasonably well.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"\">Combat Expertise<\/span>: Prerequisite.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Trip<\/span>: +2 to CMB to trip.\n\t\t\t\tCombined with your weapon, that&#8217;s a big advantage. You already won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tneed to worry about attacks of opportunity against most enemies since\n\t\t\t\tthey can&#8217;t usually reach you.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Trip<\/span>: Another +2 to trip,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand the target provokes attacks of opportunity. Not only do you get\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta free attack, but so do your friends!<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Crucial. You&#8217;ll need some\n\t\tDexterity to fuel it, but 12 is fine to start if you&#8217;re playing something\n\t\tMAD like a Paladin. You can always get a belt later.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pin Down<\/span>: Requires 11 levels of\n\t\t\t\tFighter, but if you&#8217;re already a fighter this solves the 5-foot step\n\t\t\t\tproblem.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stand Still<\/span>: This is a fallback if\n\t\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t have the feats (or Intelligence) for Combat Expertise and\n\t\t\t\tImproved Trip. Both tripping and Stand Still use a Combat Maneuver\n\t\t\t\tCheck, but tripping allows you to get +2 from the weapon and +2 from\n\t\t\t\teach of Improved and Greater Trip, followed by a free attack against an\n\t\t\t\tenemy who is now prone and will draw an additional AoO when it stands.\n\t\t\t\tStand Still also only works for adjacent squares so it doesn&#8217;t take\n\t\t\t\tadvantage of reach.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"\">Dodge<\/span>: Prerequisite. The AC bonus is nice since almost\n\t\tall are control defenders will be using a two-handed weapon and foregoing\n\t\tthe AC bonus from a shield until they can get an animated shield.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"\">Mobility<\/span>: Prerequisite. You should very rarely see\n\t\t\t\tthe effects of this feat, but sometimes running past a couple of enemies\n\t\t\t\tcan get you into a really advantageous position.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Patrol<\/span>: Also requires\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCombat Reflexes, but I listed it here because I know you took Combat\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReflexes. This is a confusing feat, but it&#8217;s very good. It increases\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour reach much further than you could go otherwise, but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmovement mechanic means that you may be running all over the place\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring other people&#8217;s turns. The only restriction on this movement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis that you can&#8217;t move more than your speed before your next turn,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tso you can move around largely wherever you like and put enemies\n\t\t\t\t\t\texactly where you want them within your reach.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Spring Attack<\/span>: Occasionally\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuseful, Spring Attack will allow you to avoid an attack of\n\t\t\t\t\t\topportunity while moving past enemies to get into positon. Only take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis if you plan to also take whirlwind attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Whirlwind Attack<\/span>: Of all of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe feats in this guide, this is one of the last ones you should\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttake of the actually useful feats since it&#8217;s a secondary gimick\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto your normal AoO shenanigans. Since area control defenders\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talready invest heavily<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lunge<\/span>: Extending your reach can be a\n\t\tgreat advantage, but it only lasts until the end of your turn. That means\n\t\tthat you can&#8217;t extend your area of control between turns, which is where\n\t\tarea control defenders really shine. However, it&#8217;s a fantastic complement to\n\t\twhirlwind attack.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Power Attack<\/span>: More damage is always great,\n\t\tbut for an Area Control Defender it&#8217;s often much more important to hit\n\t\treliably than to deal a bunch of damage. Remember that the penalty applies\n\t\tto your combat maneuver checks since they&#8217;re attacks, and the decision lasts\n\t\tuntil the beginning of your next turn so you&#8217;ll suffer the effects on your\n\t\tattacks of opportunity, too.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pushing Assault<\/span>: This could be useful\n\t\t\t\tto adjust enemies&#8217; positions inside your reach, especially if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tdealing with multiple enemies. However, if you use this incorrectly you\n\t\t\t\tmay find yourself pushing enemies out of your own reach. If the enemy\n\t\t\t\tlacks ranged attacks and doesn&#8217;t want to run away, that means willingly\n\t\t\t\tre-entering your reach and facing the associated attacks of opportunity\n\t\t\t\twhere applicable. Your best use case for this is to push enemies far\n\t\t\t\tenough away that you can still hit them, but they can&#8217;t hit you. If\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re large, you want to place enemies 15 feet away at the inner edge\n\t\t\t\tof your polearm&#8217;s reach. This prevents them from using Withdraw to get\n\t\t\t\taway, it prevents them from 5-foot stepping adjacent to you, and it\n\t\t\t\tencourages them to try charging you, thereby suffering a -2 penalty to\n\t\t\t\tAC and allowing you to more easily hit them with Stand Still or trip\n\t\t\t\tthem.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Step Up<\/span>: The word &#8220;adjacent&#8221; breaks this\n\t\tfeat for us. If it said &#8220;a foe within reach&#8221;, it would be great. But\n\t\tadjacent means in an adjacent square, so they would need to be 5-foot\n\t\tstepping away from you, which brings them into your polearm&#8217;s reach. That&#8217;s\n\t\tright where you want them, so using Step Up would actually handicap you.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Focus<\/span>: A +1 attack bonus isn&#8217;t very\n\t\texciting, but you&#8217;re going to be making lots of attacks, and the bonus\n\t\tapplies to your CMB when you trip with your weapon.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Weapon Focus<\/span>: Another +1, but\n\t\t\t\tlimited to figthers (and classes that pretend to be fighters for\n\t\t\t\tfeats).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Whip Mastery<\/span>: You&#8217;ve picked up\n\t\t\t\tproficiency with whips, Weapon Focus (whip), and Whip Mastery. You can\n\t\t\t\tnow do with your whip what every other area control defender has been\n\t\t\t\tdoing with a horsechopper and armor spikes. You have the advantage of\n\t\t\t\tnot needing to maintain a set of armor spikes, but there are so many\n\t\t\t\tother ways to keep enemies out of spike range (many of which you want to\n\t\t\t\ttake even with a whip) that this seems unnecessary.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Greater Whip Mastery<\/span>: Area control\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefenders are all about holding down multiple enemies. Grappling a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle enemy with your whip means that you&#8217;re turning off your best\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrick so mildly annoy one enemy.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<!--\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Antagonize<\/span>:<\/li>\n \t<li>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"\"><\/span>:\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"\"><\/span>:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n--><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Reach is an absolute must, so only reach weapons are mentioned here (with the exception of Armor Spikes).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Spikes<\/span>: They don&#8217;t require the use\n\t\tof your hands, which means that you can use them while two-handing a\n\t\tpolearm. This allows you to threaten the area inside your polearm&#8217;s reach,\n\t\tturning your halo of pain into a circle of pain. It&#8217;s expensive to enchant\n\t\ttwo weapons, so don&#8217;t put a ton of resources into what is essentially a\n\t\tbackup plan. Instead, get cheap armor spikes and do your best to never need\n\t\tthem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Natural Weapons<\/span>: If you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tproficiency with martial weapons, armor spikes won&#8217;t be very effective.\n\t\tNatural weapons work just as well, though your hands are probably busy\n\t\tholding a weapon, so look for bite attacks, gore attacks, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"martial-weapons\">Martial Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bardiche<\/span>: Essentially a glaive with\n\t\tdifferent critical hits, and its resistant to sundering for some reason.\n\t\tPersonally I like 19-20\/x2 over x3 crits, so I would take a bardiche over a\n\t\tglaive, but neither option is a good choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bec de corbin<\/span>: Strictly better than the\n\t\tglaive, it adds Brace and a bonus to sunder some armor. That said, it&#8217;s\n\t\tstill terrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bill<\/span>: An extra +1 to AC when fighting\n\t\tdefensively is a cute trick, but it&#8217;s a shield bonus and won&#8217;t stack with an\n\t\tanimated shield. It also adds Disarm, which is nice from time to time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Glaive<\/span>: Garbage. Absolute garbage. It&#8217;s a\n\t\tlongspear with very sligthly better damage. Almost any other polearm is\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glaive-guisarme<\/span>: Adds Brace and a bonus\n\t\tto knock people off of horses. I don&#8217;t know why you would ever buy a\n\t\tglaive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Guisarme<\/span>: The go-to option for Area\n\t\tControl Defenders. Reach and Trip are all that you technically need, but if\n\t\tyou look a little further you can find better options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hooked lance<\/span>: Identidical traits and\n\t\tcomparable damage to guisarme, but with x4 criticals instead of x3. Calling\n\t\tthis a lance is confusing since it doesn&#8217;t get any of the things that you\n\t\twant from a lance. If you want crits, use this. If you want bigger base\n\t\tdamage, go for the horsechopper.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Horsechopper<\/span>: A guisarme with a bigger\n\t\tdamage die. It&#8217;s bizzare that horsechoppers are so good considering\n\t\thorsechoppers are made almost exclusively by and for goblins instead of\n\t\tprofessional smiths making weapons for soldiers. If you want bigger base\n\t\tdamage, use this. If you want crits, go for the hooked lange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lance<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re a cavalier, skip the\n\t\tlance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Longspear<\/span>: The layman&#8217;s polearm. Reach\n\t\ton a stick. Available to everyone except druids ande wizard, if you&#8217;re not\n\t\tusing your hands they should be holding a longspear in the off chance that\n\t\tan attack of opportunity might present itself.

I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the\n\t\ttrade, personally.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Kusarigama<\/span>: Double doesn&#8217;t matter, Monk is\n\t\tonly useful if you&#8217;re a Monk, and grapple won&#8217;t matter for our purposes, but\n\t\tit has both reach and trip. You also have access to bludgeoning damage,\n\t\tthough you&#8217;ll need to enchant both ends of the weapon to keep the extra\n\t\tdamage relevant. RAW, since it&#8217;s a reach weapon you can&#8217;t use the kama end\n\t\tas a non-reach weapon, but I think a reasonable GM would allow you to do so.\n\t\tIf your GM won&#8217;t, use a double-chained kama instead and complain frequently\n\t\tabout how the kama you&#8217;re holding magically reachs over 5 feet but you can&#8217;t\n\t\tuse it to scratch your own back.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kyoketsu shoge<\/span>: Reach is the only important\n\t\tpiece that we get from the kyoketsu shoge and the Kusarigama adds Trip.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mancatcher<\/span>: Only works on small and medium\n\t\ttargets. It&#8217;s barely a weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Meteor hammer<\/span>: The switching modes thing is\n\t\tstupid. The numbers just don&#8217;t justify it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Whip<\/span>: Whips are hard. They have reach and\n\t\tboth trip and disarm, which is a unique advantage. They&#8217;re also one-handed,\n\t\tleaving a free hand for a shield. However, they attack like a ranged weapon\n\t\t(they provoke AoO&#8217;s), they deal nonlethal damage, and they can&#8217;t affect\n\t\tenemies with armor or with +3 or better natural armor. Those are serious\n\t\thandicaps. You can remove the handicaps with the Whip Mastery feat, but it\n\t\trequires Weapon Focus first. If you count proficiency, you&#8217;re likely looking\n\t\tat 3 feats to make them viable, and most people don&#8217;t want to spend the\n\t\tfeats to make that happen. If you really want to use a whip, take a level of\n\t\tMysterious Avenger Swashbuckler and switch to fighter after that. The whip\n\t\thas two major advantages that make it worth the investment: they can attack\n\t\tadjacent enemies, and they give you 15 foot reach at medium size. How this\n\t\treach changes above medium size is confusing, so read the &#8220;Whips Above\n\t\tMedium Size&#8221; section, above, if you haven&#8217;t already.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of armor doesn&#8217;t matter much beyond the usual balance between Dexterity and base AC bonus.

You may\n\t\tonly get one attack against a given target in an entire round, and if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t make that attack it may mean that an enemy gets past you to attack\n\t\tyour squishy allies. The bonus applies to your attack bonus\n\t\t<em>and<\/em> your CMB, so don&#8217;t skimp on it. If you have someone in the\n\t\tparty who can cast Greater Magic Weapon, buy them a Pearl of Power.

That&#8217;s an extra chance to trip or use Stand Still or whatever\n\t\tyou like if you mess up your first attack, and if you didn&#8217;t mess up that\n\t\tfirst attack you can use it for damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Boots of Striding and Springing<\/span>: The\n\t\textra speed is very useful if you pick up Combat Patrol.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Longarm Bracers<\/span>: +5 ft. reach as a swift\n\t\taction 3\/day.

Since so much of your job is done\n\t\toutside of your turn, it can often be helpful to get some extra movement to\n\t\tposition yourself to be as effective as possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swordmaster&#8217;s Flair (Blue Scarf)<\/span>: Only\n\t\tworks once per day unless you&#8217;re a Swashbuckler and can fuel it with\n\t\tPanache, but it activates as a swift action and increases you&#8217;re reach by 5\n\t\tfeet for 1 minute.
