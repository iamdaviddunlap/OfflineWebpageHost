However, it\n\t\t\t\t\trequires Concentration, which means that you can&#8217;t combine it with\n\t\t\t\t\tother great low-level buffs like Bless.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Since Magic Weapon\n\t\t\t\t\trequires Concentration, you generally only want to use it if you lack\n\t\t\t\t\tpermanent magical weapons, and only against enemies that resist\n\t\t\t\t\tnon-magical weapons. Spiritual Weapon is a staple cleric option, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat way to convert your Bonus Action into damage output without\n\t\t\t\t\trequiring Concentration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Crusader&#8217;s Mantle is\n\t\t\t\t\tDivine Favor for the whole party. The damage per attack is still\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall, but if you have someone using Two-Weapon Fighting, allies with\n\t\t\t\t\tExtra Attack, or just a large party, the value adds up quickly. But it\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally can&#8217;t compete with Spirit Guardians, which you also get.\n\t\t\t\t\tSpirit Guardians id among the most efficient damage options in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgame, and many clerics prepare it every day.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">7th Level<\/span>: Stoneskin is a\n\t\t\t\t\tfantastic buff, but it&#8217;s very expensive and it won&#8217;t help you once you\n\t\t\t\t\tget Avatar of Battle. Freedom of movement is situationally useful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Flame Strike is a decent\n\t\t\t\t\tAOE damage spell, but for the same spell slot I would much rather cast\n\t\t\t\t\tSpirit Guardians and walk into a fight. Hold Monster is a simple\n\t\t\t\t\tsave-or-suck spell, and it scales well with spell level so it remains\n\t\t\t\t\teffective for a long time.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor is\n\t\t\tgreat on a Cleric, and Martial Weapons add a few more combat options,\n\t\t\tincluding better two-handed options if you want to go that route.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">War Priest<\/span>: As many as\n\t\t\t<em>five<\/em> extra attacks per day! This is terribly disappointing. The\n\t\t\tfact that it takes your bonus action is absurd on top of the tragically\n\t\t\tlow number of times you get to use it. Divine Strike adds to the damage so\n\t\t\tyour attacks will at least feel impactful, but Divine Strike only applies\n\t\t\tonce on each of your turns, so generally activating War Priest is only\n\t\t\tuseful at low levels or if you&#8217;re high level and missed with your\n\t\t\tattack.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Guided Strike<\/span>: This\n\t\t\tisn&#8217;t limited to weapon attacks, and clerics have a few powerful spell\n\t\t\tattacks like Inflict Wounds which will benefit. However, spell attacks\n\t\t\tbecome uncommon beyond low levels, so the value of Channel Divinity:\n\t\t\tGuided Strike diminishes over time. At high levels it&#8217;s likely better to\n\t\t\tuse the Harness Divine Power Optional Class Feature.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: War God&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>:\n\t\t\tWhile Clerics don&#8217;t typically deal a huge amount of damage on their\n\t\t\tattacks, allies like Rogues certainly do, and when they miss their one\n\t\t\tattack for the round a +10 can really change the outcome of a fight.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Strike<\/span>: While not as flashy as\n\t\t\tthe Nature Cleric&#8217;s version of Divine Strike, the ability to deal the same\n\t\t\tdamage type as your weapon allows you to change damage types with relative\n\t\t\tease by changing weapons. However, against enemies with resistance to\n\t\t\tnon-magic weapon damage, this will be very frustrating. If your game\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t use magic items, be sure to prepare Magic Weapon or similar buffs\n\t\t\twhich cause your weapon to deal damage as a magic weapon.

You\u2019re still better off focusing on spells, but it\u2019s your character so you do you.

The eventual difference between Heavy and Medium armor is 1 AC, but you need either 15 Strength or 14 Dexterity to get the most out of these options. This is a meaningful difference in choices for anyone that makes weapon attacks, but doesn\u2019t really change anything for a full caster that relies on spells and cantrips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-war-cleric-build-die-kriegerin-der-zerstorung\">Example War Cleric Build &#8211; Die Kriegerin der Zerst\u00f6rung<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In these example builds we\u2019re supposed to do two things: show off the subclass features and provide an optimized build that takes advantage of these features.

Before anyone has Extra Attack, nothing really holds it back from playing like one of the martials, with two features that give it a little boost. Then once the gang get their Extra Attacks, War domain gets something sort of rare among Clerics in that it gains a second way to spend Channel Divinity.

The reason why will be explained in the feat section below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Increased<\/th><th>Level 20<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For our race, we\u2019re taking Chromatic Dragonborn and choosing Green. As mentioned above in the race section, because the newer Dragonborn make their breath weapon as part of the attack action, Warpriest can trigger, but we don\u2019t really have the strength to take advantage of that. Instead, we\u2019ll be able to use the poison breath weapon without hurting our Skelesoldiers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re taking Sage for Arcana in order to scribe scrolls, and History to know wars. We get a pair of languages, which can be whatever works well in your campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>From Cleric, we take Insight, because it\u2019s the only really useful Wisdom skill on our class list, and Religion to know the Undead. We\u2019re not really great in the skill department, but that\u2019s not really our job anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we\u2019ll take Resilient (Constitution), giving us +1 Constitution to hit 18 as well as proficiency in Constitution saves. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/life-domain\/#why-did-we-delay-wisdom-in-favor-of-resilient-constitution\">gone on at length<\/a> in the past about how maintaining Concentration on spells for their full duration can be better than the 5-10% difference in saving throw failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we\u2019ll take an ASI for +2 Wisdom, also pushing it to 18. We do have a wild option to take Gift of the Chromatic Dragon early and further delay our Wisdom bump, but I would advise against that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, we finish Wisdom with a second +2 ASI. This level would be a more reasonable place to take the Gift early, taking the Wisdom ASI at 16th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we take the Gift of the Chromatic Dragon primarily for the reaction ability to resist elemental damage since clerics don\u2019t get Absorb Elements. Taking less damage means we have to roll lower Concentration checks. We could take this earlier in some circumstances. There are some interesting spells we could take that don\u2019t even care about our Wisdom score and the bonus action to add some damage to a weapon once per day is weak at this level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At nineteenth level, we\u2019ll take another ASI to finish raising Constitution to 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Divine Domain: War<br>-Heavy (abyssal?)

We have the option to swing this weapon, and we can do so with reasonable effectiveness for at least a few levels if we feel like it.<br><br>The major issue is not having our hands full while performing somatic components for our spells. We don\u2019t take Warcaster on this build because we\u2019ll stop using weapons with our own hands around level five.<br><br>If we do want to get our melee Cleric power fantasy out of the way before then, I suggest two-handing the Warhammer or another weapon so that we can still cast spells without having to juggle too badly. It\u2019s tough having to choose between Dragon\u2019s Breath and double slash, but, then again, it\u2019s not like War has an easy time of it in general.<br><br>If we\u2019re looking for some offensive magic, Guiding Bolt does some decent radiant damage as a spell attack which can be used with Guided Strike when we get it next level.<br><br>Protection from Evil and Good and Shield of Faith are both good defensive options.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Channel Divinity<br>-Turn Undead<br>-Guided Strike<br><br>Harness Divine Power &#8211; Optional<\/td><td>Guided Strike is helpful if we\u2019re still swinging that warhammer around, getting a bonus to hit after seeing the roll and deciding if it\u2019s worth the cost.

It also makes a great case for never using War Priest anymore. Also, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t make it look like a gun, scythe, or whip if you get bored of it being a sword that\u2019s even taller than you are.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient (Constitution)<br>-+1 Constitution (17=&gt;18)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-Cantrip<br>\u2013Light<\/td><td>Resilient (Constitution) will boost our ability to hold our Concentration spells for their full durations.<br><br>Light is a fine cantrip for seeing in the dark.

With 30 feet of radius, every skeleton (or anything else we consider an ally) crammed in that square circle will add an extra 1d4 radiant damage to every one of their attacks.

If we\u2019re not playing in the Skelebros party, this is stronger than Crusader\u2019s Mantle, but if we are in the minion pile there\u2019s a lot of complicated math that determines which is better.<br><br>I\u2019m not doing that math, as it heavily depends on how much AC the enemy targets have vs any attack bonuses our Skeletons have and how many foes there are that we can hit with Spirit Guardians.

This leaves the target with 1 HP and the other Death Ward is no longer suppressed, ready to again prevent the target from dying, which may happen very quickly since they\u2019re now at 1 HP.<br><br>Freedom of Movement is a generally useful defense buff, preventing many effects that inhibit movement and control.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Wisdom (16=&gt;18)<br><br>Destroy Undead (CR1)<br><br>Blessed Strikes &#8211; Optional<\/td><td>We\u2019ll boost our Wisdom here to keep our Save DCs and Spell Attacks from lagging too far behind the Fundamental Math.<br><br>We take the optional Blessed Strikes feature because we\u2019ve by now abandoned using weapons with our own hands.
