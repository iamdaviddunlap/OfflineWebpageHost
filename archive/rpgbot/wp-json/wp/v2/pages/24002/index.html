For help with the legacy Witch, see our <a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/focus-spells\/\">Legacy Witch Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Witch is a spellcaster granted power by a mysterious Patron. The Witch&#8217;s core features are very close to the Wizard, and their spellcasting works very similarly, but your choice of Patron Theme allows you to select the spell list of your choice similar to the Sorcerer, and the theme of the class&#8217;s features have a distinctly less scholarly bent. DnD 5e players might justifiably see thematic similarities to 5e&#8217;s warlocks, but the similarities end there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the Wizard, the Witch&#8217;s ability to learn any number of spells from\n\ttheir spell list makes them a magical tool box with a tool for every specific\n\tproblem one might encounter. Beyond that excellent foundation, the Witch&#8217;s\n\tability to select their own spell list allows them to fill nearly any role in\n\tthe party by selecting your Patron Theme and spells. Like the Wizard, the\n\tWitch&#8217;s high Intelligence gives you a lot of trained skills at 1st level,\n\tmaking it easy to play your party&#8217;s Librarian or to pick up skills to support\n\tother skill-based capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond their spellcasting, the Witch is the uncontested master of familiars, and their Focus Spells (called \u201cHexes\u201d) are truly fantastic, and include powerful Hex Cantrips which can often define your character&#8217;s best tactical options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Also see our supporting articles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/ancestries-and-heritages\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24155\">Witch Ancestries and Heritages Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/witch-feats\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24085\">Witch Feats Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/focus-spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24005\">Witch Hexes Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/witch-patrons\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24201\">Witch Patrons Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/familiars-remastered\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31305\">Familiars and Pets Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#remaster-changes\">Remaster Changes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Witch Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#attributes\">Witch Attributes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Witch Ancestries and Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Witch Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Witch Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#varying-skill-feats\">Varying Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Witch Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Witch Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Witch Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells\">Witch Focus Spells &#8211; Hexes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclass-archetype\">Witch Multiclass Archetype<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Hex Wellspring (Refocus 3 points) is no longer necessary, but it&#8217;s not clear why the rest were dropped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes to the Focus Spell rules make the Witch&#8217;s Hexes much easier to use consistently, dramatically shifting the resource management around Hexes like Cackle.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Witch Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Attribute<\/strong>: Intelligence is the Witch&#8217;s Key Attribute, and like any spellcaster it&#8217;s used for your Spell Attacks and for your Spell DCs. Those are two of your most important stats, so keep your Intelligence as high as you can get it. Intelligence also grants you additional Trained skills at 1st level, allowing you to easily invest in numerous skills, including Lore options which other classes often need to ignore in favor of more important skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: 6+Con hit points. Fortunately you\n\thave plenty of room to boost your ability scores so your Constitution bonus\n\tcan compensate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Witch&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are terrible. Your saving throw progression is very slightly\n\tworse than the Wizard&#8217;s, which you make up for by having better weapon\n\tproficiencies which you&#8217;ll almost certainly never use. Like the Wizard, your\n\thigh Intelligence will give you an abundance of Trained skills at first level,\n\tbut that&#8217;s the best part of your proficiencies beyond spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Trained at 1st level, and it\n\t\tmaxes out at Expert at 11th level. Expect to rely on allies for Perception\n\t\tchecks, and strongly consider Incredible Initiative if you don&#8217;t want to go\n\t\tlate in the turn order in every fight. You might also consider Canny Acumen\n\t\tto boost your Perception proficiency, especially if you take it well before\n\t\t11th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Only one good saving throw.\n\t\tWill is a great option, but only one good saving throw is still a serious\n\t\thandicap, and it never improves past Master. Your other saving throws will\n\t\tincrease to expert, but no further. You can take the Canny Acumen feat,\n\t\tbut that won&#8217;t get you past Expert until 17th level, so you&#8217;ll spend most of\n\t\tyour career with absolutely dismal saving throws compared to your\n\t\tallies.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: One skill from your Patron, then\n\t\t3+Int additional Trained skills for a total of 4+Int. 4+ is standard, and thanks to\n\t\thigh Intelligence you&#8217;ll start with numerous skills.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: Don&#8217;t plan to use weapons beyond\n\t\tvery low levels. You only get simple weapons and never advance past\n\t\tExpert.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: No armor proficiencies, and your\n\t\tproficiency in Unarmored Defense never increases past Expert. Expect to rely\n\t\ton spells like Mage Armor, and be sure that you have nice sturdy friends to\n\t\thide behind.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><strong>Spellcasting DC<\/strong>: Standard progression for a full\n\t\tspellcaster.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <strong>Witch Patron<\/strong>: See our\n\t<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/patrons\">Witch Patrons Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Witch Spellcasting<\/span>: The Witch is a\n\tprepared spellcaster, preparing spells that their familiar knows each day\n\tduring Daily Preparations. Your familiar learns two spells for free every\n\tlevel, but can learn more from other sources much like a wizard can add spells\n\tto their spellbook.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice of spellcasting tradition will be determined by your Patron. All\n\tfour traditions are available to the Witch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Familiar<\/span>: As central to the Witch as a\n\tspellbook is to the Wizard, your familiar is also unusually powerful compared\n\tto other familiars. Where most characters start with 2 familiar powers and\n\tmight get up to 6 with several feats, the Witch&#8217;s familiar starts with 4 and\n\tgets up to 8 without spending a single feat (4 base, 3 as you level, 1 from your Patron), but can reach 12 with two feats. This allows your familiar to be\n\tuseful, versatile, and heavily customizable.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>For help\n\twith your familiar, see our\n\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Spells<\/span>: The Witch&#8217;s Focus Spells.\n\tYou&#8217;ll get one by default and you may get more from your Patron.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Patron&#8217;s Puppet<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Free Actions are very powerful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Phase Familiar<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Great if you tend to put your familiar in harm&#8217;s way, such as by having\n\t\tit deliver touch spells.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Cantrips<\/span>: A second pool of cantrips.\n\tHex Cantrips are still a Hex, so you&#8217;re still limited to one Hex per round, but they&#8217;re Cantrips so you can use them without spending a Focus Point. Most Hex Cantrips have a 1-Action casting time, making them a great way to spend an Action before or after casting a 2-Action spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>For more help selecting Focus Spells, see our <a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/focus-spells\/\">Remastered Witch Hexes Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attributes\">Witch Attributes<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Witch&#8217;s ability score needs are extremely simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: AC and saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: HP and saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Your Key Attribute.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Perception and saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Witch Ancestries and Heritages<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Boosts to Intelligence are crucial.

That means that you can maximize at most three skills, and the rest of your skills might not advance beyond Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Feats at even-numbered levels, giving you a total of 10 Skill Feats (and maybe another from your Background) by 20th level. Generally, you want to invest these feats in the same skills which you are choosing to maximize, though in some cases you may want to grab feats from skills which don&#8217;t require that you be more than Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Surprisingly important\n\t\tbecause it&#8217;s used for maneuvering while flying.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cat Fall<\/span>: Being knocked prone while\n\t\t\t\tflying is an easy way to counter flying creatures, and enemies can do it\n\t\t\t\tjust as easily to you as you can do it to them. Cat Fall will reduce the\n\t\t\t\teffective distance you&#8217;ve fallen, allowing you to take less damage from\n\t\t\t\ta fall. However, the effects of Cat Fall scale based on your Proficiency\n\t\t\t\tlevel, so it may not be worth the skill feat unless you plan to increase\n\t\t\t\tyour proficiency in Acrobatics.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcana<\/span> (Int): A crucial knowledge skill.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Sense<\/span>: If you can make Detect\n\t\t\t\tMagic free, you should cast it frequently any time that there&#8217;s even a\n\t\t\t\tremote chance that you&#8217;ll encounter magic. You&#8217;re going to maximize\n\t\t\t\tArcana anyway, so this will get better as you gain levels. Of course,\n\t\t\t\tDetect Magic is a Cantrip which you could get by several means, and\n\t\t\t\tnormal Cantrip scaling will be faster than waiting to become Legendary\n\t\t\t\tin Arcana.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unified Theory<\/span>: Your Intelligence will\n\t\t\t\talways exceed your Wisdom, so your Arcana will always exceed your Nature\n\t\t\t\tand Religion, so at the very least this is a numeric boost to those\n\t\t\t\tskills. More importantly, you don&#8217;t need to spend Skill Increases on\n\t\t\t\tNature, Occultism, or Religion.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Athletics<\/span> (Str): Strength is your dump\n\t\tstat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crafting<\/span> (Int): You&#8217;re probably the\n\t\tsmartest person in the party, and <em>someone<\/em> in the party needs it to\n\t\thandle magic runes.

In those situations, Demoralize is\n\t\ta great use of an Action. However, that spare action may also be important\n\t\tfor the Sustain a Spell action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lore<\/span> (Int): You have the Intelligence to\n\t\tback up Lore, so pick up a variety of different Lore skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Medicine<\/span> (Wis): You&#8217;ll have enough\n\t\tWisdom to make Medicine viable, but hopefully you&#8217;ll be in a party with\n\t\tsomeone else who can cover it so that you can focus on Intelligence-based\n\t\tskills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nature<\/span> (Wis): Despite being Wisdom-based,\n\t\tNature may be an important skill for the Witch so that you can identify\n\t\tspells being cast by other spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Occultism<\/span> (Int): On par with Arcana, and\n\t\tyou have plenty of Intelligence to make it work.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bizarre Magic<\/span>: Most enemies won&#8217;t be\n\t\t\t\table to identify your magic, and the few that can will rarely care.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Performance<\/span> (Cha): There is no way for the\n\t\tWitch to make use of this short of things like the Goblin Song feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Religion<\/span> (Wis): Despite being\n\t\tWisdom-based, Religion may be an important skill for the Witch so that you\n\t\tcan identify spells being cast by other spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Society<\/span> (Int): The closest thing you&#8217;ll\n\t\tget to a Face skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): With poor Perception, Stealth\ncan be a good way to improve your Initiative rolls.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thievery<\/span> (Dex): Essential in any party, and with no armor you&#8217;ll need enough Dexterity that this is viable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"varying-skill-feats\">Varying Skill Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Recognize Spell<\/span>: With high Intelligence,\n\t\tpassable Wisdom, and easy access to spellcasting-related skills, the Witch\n\t\tis perhaps the best-suited character to identifying enemy spells.

They have a variety of interesting effects, many of which are really powerful. Notably, many Hexes (including Hex Cantrips) have a 1-minute duration and must be Sustained, making the Cackle Hex a powerful option (though expensive since it is itself a Hex and therefore consumes a Focus Point) until you can get Effortless Concentration at 16th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hex Cantrips are still a Hex, so you\u2019re still limited to one Hex per round, but they\u2019re Cantrips so you can use them without spending a Focus Point. Most Hex Cantrips have a 1-Action casting time, making them a great way to spend an Action before or after casting a 2-Action spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more help with focus spells, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-witch\/focus-spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24005\">Witch Focus Spells Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This is not a comprehensive list of archetypes which might be useful for this class.

The feats related to familiars can generally be access more easily with the Familiar Master archetype, but if you want both a better familiar and more spellcasting (maybe you&#8217;re a wizard and just couldn&#8217;t bring yourself to play witch), you might do well here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this is a spellcasting archetype, be sure to check the rules for <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spellcasting archetypes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Witch Dedication<\/span>: A familiar (which\n\t\talready costs a class feat in most cases), one cantrip, and one Trained\n\t\tskill.
