This is a whole archetype\n\tspecifically focus on Favored Terrain. Basically, pick the worst parts of\n\tvanilla Range and just use those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hunter&#8217;s Bond<\/span> (Ex): Off to a fantastic start,\n\tyou are forced to take the worse option from Hunter&#8217;s Bond.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Advantageous Terrain<\/span> (Ex): If you have 3\n\trounds to burn before every combat (you probably don&#8217;t), this can provide some\n\tsmall situational benefits to your party. Unless you spend a lot of time\n\tambushing enemies, this won&#8217;t see a lot of use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Infiltration<\/span> (Ex): Finally you can do\n\tsomething interesting in something that isn&#8217;t your favored terrain.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Superior Tactics<\/span> (Ex): Why would you ever\n\tneed to rearrange your allie&#8217;s initiatives? They can just delay until they&#8217;re\n\tin the right spot in the initiative order.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Perfect Advantage<\/span> (Ex): No you only have to\n\twaste a standard action to use Advantageous Terrain. The bonuses don&#8217;t get any\n\tbetter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Favored Enemy (2nd, 3rd, 4th), Hunter&#8217;s Bond, Master\n\tHunter<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Deep Walker, Infiltrator, Urban Ranger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"beastmaster\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/ranger\/archetypes\/paizo-ranger-archetypes\/beast-master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beastmaster<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beastmaster trades in some of the normal Ranger coolness for a very\n\tslightly better animal companion and a slightly different skill list. Unless\n\tyou have a very specific concept in mind which requires you to have more than\n\tone animal companion, you may not even notice that you took this archetype\n\tuntil you realize you missed a bonus feat slot at 6th level. If you really\n\tlike animal companions, play a druid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skills<\/span>: The Beastmaster adds\n\tAcrobatics and Escape Artist, but loses Knowledge (Dungeoneering), Knowledge\n\t(Geography), Profession, and Spellcraft. The added skills don&#8217;t contribute\n\tmuch to your character concept, and the loss of the Knowledge (Dungeoneering)\n\thurts because it covers a fairly large number of monsters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Companion<\/span> (Ex): This opens up the\n\tfull animal companion list for rangers, which is nice since they get a fairly\n\tlimited list by default. However, despite being the core component of the\n\tarchetype, you still start with your animal companion 3 levels behind a druid.\n\tThe handicap doesn&#8217;t go away until level 12. You can also split your effective\n\tdruid levels to have multiple animal companions. Of course, this will mean\n\tthat you have several progressively worse animal companions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Empathic Link<\/span> (Su): Seeing\n\tthrough your animal companion&#8217;s eyes is nice, or you could just have someone\n\tcast Clairvoyance. You also give up your 6th level combat feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Strong Bond<\/span> (Ex): And finally at level 12,\n\tyour animal companions catch up to the druid. Of course, at level 12 the druid\n\thas 6th level spells and can do all sorts of exciting things, like animating a\n\tTrant for days per caster level which could likely slaughter your animal\n\tcompanion(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Class Skills, Combat Style (6th), Hunter&#8217;s Bond,\n\tCamouflage<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Infiltrator<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"deep-walker\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/ranger\/archetypes\/paizo-ranger-archetypes\/deep-walker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deep Walker<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your game is underground, or involves a lot of dungeons, this archetype is\n\tpretty great. You sacrifice the Favored Terrain nonsense for a superior\n\tversion which only works when underground, but otherwise you&#8217;re just a\n\tbasement-themed ranger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deep Knowledge<\/span> (Ex): If you&#8217;re underground\n\ta lot, or if you are playing a subterranean or dungeon-centric campaign, this\n\tability shoots right up to blue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rock Hopper<\/span> (Ex): This won&#8217;t come up much,\n\tbut it&#8217;s nice to have once in a while.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deep Walker Camouflage<\/span> (Ex): Camouflage\n\tunderground.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">One with the Stone<\/span> (Ex): I don&#8217;t know why\n\tthey felt the need to give you a slightly weaker version of Hide in Plain\n\tSight, but I gues they needed to compensate for Deep Knowledge somewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Favored Terrain, Woodland Stride, Camouflage, Hide in\n\tPlain Sight<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Battle Scout, Falconer, Guide, Trophy Hunter, Warden,\n\tWild Stalker<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"divine-tracker\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/ranger\/archetypes\/paizo-ranger-archetypes\/divine-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Divine Tracker<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Divine Tracker trades Hunter&#8217;s Bond for two Warpriest Blessings.\n\tWarpriest Blessings include a lot of really fantastic options which can work\n\tvery well for a Ranger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Alignment<\/span>: This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Favored Weapon<\/span>: Deities&#8217; favored weapons are\n\talmost exclusively martial weapons, and Rangers are already proficient with\n\tmartial weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blessings<\/span> (Su): Many Warpriest blessings can\n\tbe used as swift actions so they won&#8217;t cut into your full attacks, and many of\n\tthem provide excellent buffs.

You get some new tricks which let your bird inflict some nice\n\tstatus conditions, but the archetype costs a combat style feat, which is a\n\tvery high price to pay for a couple of animal tricks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Feathered Companion<\/span> (Ex): You get your\n\tanimal companion three levels early, but at half hit points. You also get to\n\tpick one of two free tricks.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Roam<\/span>: Why would you possibly want this? It\n\t\tbasically lets you not have an animal companion for up to a week at a\n\t\ttime.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Distract<\/span>: Shaken is a pretty good status\n\t\tcondition, and your bird probably isn&#8217;t going to be doing a huge amount of\n\t\tdamage normally.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hunter&#8217;s Bond<\/span> (Ex): You pick the bird\n\tanimal companion. The bird is acceptable, but not particularly powerful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Swoop for the Kill<\/span> (Ex): You have to give\n\tup your 6th level style feat, which hurts, but inflicting the staggered\n\tcondition with no save is a pretty good trick..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Wild Empathy, Combat Style (6th), Hunter&#8217;s Bond<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Deep Walker, Infiltrator, Shapeshifter, Urban\n\tRanger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"guide\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/ranger\/archetypes\/paizo-ranger-archetypes\/guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guide<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking this archetype is simple: If you don&#8217;t want another specific\n\tarchetype, choose between Favored Enemy and Ranger&#8217;s Focus. If you can\n\treliably use Favored Enemy in your campaign, stick with vanilla Ranger.\n\tOtherwise, take the Guide archetype. Guide does give up a bit of Ranger&#8217;s\n\tstealthiness, but you should be able to get by just fine with decent dexterity\n\tand ranks in Stealth. Since you don&#8217;t get Sneak Attack, Hide in Plain Sight is\n\tfar less important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ranger&#8217;s Focus<\/span> (Ex): Ranger&#8217;s Focus is more\n\tversatile than Favored Enemy, and you can apply it to anything you fight. The\n\tbonus scales less quickly than Favored Enemy, but the simple utility of using\n\tit on anything is really fantastic. In any game where you are fighting a wide\n\tvariety of enemies, this is a realyly great option. You lose the ability to\n\tshare it with your allies via Hunter&#8217;s Bond, but honestly I don&#8217;t think any\n\tever did that anyway. The uses per day are fairly limited, so use it for major\n\tenemies until you have extra daily uses to spare.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Terrain Bond<\/span> (Ex): Favored Terrain isn&#8217;t\n\tone of the better ranger abilities, and sharing the +2 bonuses with your\n\tallies probably isn&#8217;t going to have a huge impact.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranger&#8217;s Luck<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are always\n\tnice, and you get to use this multiple times per day as you level. Forcing\n\tenemies to reroll is also nice, as it effectively makes you resistant to\n\tcritical hits..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspired Moment<\/span> (Ex): Sometimes you need\n\tsome extra movement in a turn. Maybe you need to move into range to full\n\tattack with your falcatas. Then maybe you want to auto-confirm those critical\n\thits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Ranger&#8217;s Luck<\/span> (Ex): Luck bonuses\n\tare very rare, and a stunning +4 bonus on your rerolls is going to have a huge\n\timpact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Favored Enemy, Hunter&#8217;s Bond, Evasion, Quarry, Improved\n\tEvasion, Improved Quarry<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Deep Walker, Infiltrator, Shapeshifter, Urban\n\tRanger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"hooded-champion\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/ranger\/archetypes\/paizo-ranger-archetypes\/hooded-champion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hooded Champion<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hooded Champion meshes the Swashbuckler&#8217;s Panache ability with the\n\tRanger&#8217;s Archery Combat Style to create a lackluster class with a dependency\n\ton every ability score.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Panache<\/span> (Ex): The Panache Pool fuels your\n\tDeeds. While Deeds are fun, the Panache pool introduces a dependency on\n\tCharisma to a class which is already very MAD.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deeds<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get a lot of deeds, and\n\tboth Derring-Do and Kip Up are poor. You get a few more deeds as you gain\n\tlevels, but you don&#8217;t get any offensive options except Dead Aim.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dead Aim<\/span> (Ex): Bows have huge range\n\t\tincrements, so you can use this from a reasonably long distance. However,\n\t\tthis is also a really fast way to burn through your Panache Pool.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hooded Champion&#8217;s Initiative<\/span> (Ex):\n\t\tInitiative bonuses are always fantastic, though they&#8217;re not as important for\n\t\tthe Ranger as they are for spellcasters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Style<\/span>: Archery is one of the best\n\tRanger Combat Styles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Favored Enemy (1st), Wild Empathy, Endurance, Evasion,\n\tImproved Evasion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Battle Scout, Beastmaster, Deep Walker, Divine\n\tTracker, Horse Lord, Infiltrator, Shapeshifter, Skirmisher, Spirit Ranger,\n\tTrapper<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"horse-lord\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/ranger\/archetypes\/paizo-ranger-archetypes\/horse-lord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Horse Lord<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mounted Combat Style: The Archetype. If you want to be a mounted ranger, this\n\tarchetype is basically a given. You give up some stealth abilities at higher\n\tlevels in exchange for a slightly better horse. Granted, you won&#8217;t do any\n\tsneaking while on horseback so you&#8217;re getting more from this archetype than\n\tyou would from vanilla Ranger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"\">Combat Style Feat<\/span> (Ex): You have to pick the Mounted\n\tCombat style, which makes sense for a horse lord.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Mounted Bond<\/span> (Ex): Animal Companion, but you have to\n\tpick something you can ride. Again, makes sense for a horse lord.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Strong Bond<\/span> (Ex): You lose camouflage to get a sligthly\n\tbetter mount. I can&#8217;t imagine you were doing a lot of sneaking on a horse, so\n\tit&#8217;s no great loss.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Spiritual Bond<\/span> (Su): Grant your mount temporary hit\n\tpoints and take damage for them. If you&#8217;re fighting mounted, having a living\n\tmount is very important, so this can be very useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Combat Style, Hunter&#8217;s Bond, Camouflage, Hide in Plain\n\tSight<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Infiltrator<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"infiltrator\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/ranger\/archetypes\/paizo-ranger-archetypes\/infiltrator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infiltrator<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rangers are stealth characters, and some of the biggest problems for stealth\n\tcharacters are vision and movement limitations. Sneaking around in the dark is\n\tvery hard without low-light vision or darkvision, and climbing walls and\n\tswimming can be done much better with a swim speed. Normally you can cast\n\tspells to overcome these hurdles, but the Ranger&#8217;s spell slots are very\n\tlimited, and there are many more exciting options on the Ranger&#8217;s spell list.\n\tThe Infiltrator handles these issues by duplicating characteristics of his\n\tfavored enemies. Depending on your favored enemy selections, you can have a\n\tfantastic array of potential adaptations available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Adaptation<\/span> (Ex): Infiltrators give up\n\tfavored terrain, which is situational and not very exciting, to get\n\tAdaptation, which is adaptable, versatile, and very exciting. The\n\teffectiveness of this ability depends heavily on which favored enemies you\n\tselect, but keep in mind that your adaptation selections do not need to\n\treflect how much you increase your favored enemy bonus for a given enemy. Many\n\tcreature types can only justify taking the favored enemy once (+2 bonus), then\n\ttaking the adaptations repeatedly. Keep in mind that you can only select a\n\ttotal of 7 apatations over the course of your career, so choose wisely.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aberration<\/span>:\n\t\t<span

wanted this to be a good archetype for the Natural Weapon combat\n\tstyle, but it falls horribly short of even that modest goal. You trade in some\n\tof the Ranger&#8217;s less interesting abilities for the ability to partially\n\tshapeshift a very small number of times per day for very short durations. The\n\tshapeshifting provides very modest bonuses to your stats, but the uses are so\n\tlimited that you can&#8217;t rely on shapeshifting as a major part of your\n\tcharacter&#8217;s tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Style Feat<\/span> (Ex): You must select\n\tthe Natural Weapon style, which is only good if you already have natural\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Shifter&#8217;s Blessing<\/span> (Su): The duration is\n\thorrible short, and the number of uses is pathetic.

Fantastic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Form of the Eagle<\/span>: Better fly speed than\n\t\tForm of the Dragon, but that&#8217;s about it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Form of the Jackal<\/span>: No more attacks of\n\t\topportunity for moving.

Strictly better than Distracting Attack in\n\t\tevery way.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Second Chance Strike<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are\n\t\tfantastic. The -5 penalty hurts a bit, this is great when you absolutely\n\t\tneed to make that shot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sic &#8216;Em<\/span> (Ex): Trade your swift action for\n\t\ta free attack for your animal companion. Basically a free attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skill Sage<\/span> (Ex): Roll twice, take the\n\t\tbetter result on a skill. Using traits you can get almost any skill in the\n\t\tgame as a class skill, max it out, and use this to be really fantastic at\n\t\tit. Use Magic Device comes to mind since you give up spells for this\n\t\tarchetype. Rerolling Stealth and Perception are also very good options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stag&#8217;s Leap<\/span> (Ex): Or you could Fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Surprise Shift<\/span> (Ex): A second 5-foot step\n\t\tin a round is occasionally very useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tangling Attack<\/span> (Ex): Entangled is a\n\t\treally great status condition. Penalized speed, -2 to attacks, -4 to dex (I\n\t\thope they&#8217;re not using dex for attacks), and they have to concentrate to\n\t\tcast spells.

If you&#8217;re\n\t\tdoing a trip build, you can hit, Upending Strike for a free trip, then get\n\t\tan attack of opportunity for tripping the foe. Hillarious and effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vengeance Strike<\/span> (Ex): You get a free\n\t\tattack as an immediate action.

You lose the\n\tcombat style feats, but two-handed weapons generally don&#8217;t require a lot of\n\tfeats.
