Be sure to put resources into Dexterity and\n\t\tConstitution to boost the Shaman&#8217;s poor saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple weapons give you\n\t\tplenty of options to supplement your spells, and medium armor will give you\n\t\ta decent AC. Unfortunately, the Shaman doesn&#8217;t get proficiency with shields.\n\t\tBecause the Shaman&#8217;s AC won&#8217;t be great, expect to spend most of your time\n\t\tfighting at range.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill ranks and a few good\n\t\toptions. Four ranks will cover all of the Shaman&#8217;s Knowledge skills, plus\n\t\tHeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: Works just like a Cleric, but with\n\t\ta different spell list. Access to your full spell list without needing to\n\t\tactually learn spells makes the Shaman very versatile, and gives you a lot\n\t\tof really great options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Orisons<\/span>: Orisons are fantastic, reliable,\n\t\tand versatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit<\/span> (Su): The Shaman&#8217;s Spirit defines\n\t\tthe Shaman&#8217;s character theme, and offers a collection of interesting\n\t\tabilities and unique hexes. For help selecting your Spirit, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/shaman\/spirits\">Shaman Spirit Breakdown<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Animal<\/span> (Ex): The Spirit Animal is a\n\t\tfamiliar, but it can also deliver hex spells which work as a touch attack.\n\t\tYour Spirit will give your familiar a buff of some sort, but very few of\n\t\tthem provide a meaningful improvement over how useful a familiar is on its\n\t\town.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Magic<\/span>: Much like Cleric Domain\n\t\tspells, this adds an extra spell slot per day, but with very limited\n\t\toptions. Be sure to consider your Spirits&#8217; spell lists when selecting your\n\t\tprimary Spirit and your Wandering Spirit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex<\/span>: Hexes are fantastic, and Shamans get\n\t\ttheir own list, plus access to the entire list of Witch Hexes. This offers\n\t\tan enormous set of great options. For help selecting Hexes, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/shaman\/hexes\">Shaman Hex Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wandering Spirit<\/span> (Su): Adds quite a bit of\n\t\tversatility to the Shaman, and allows you to select a Spirit for its Spirit\n\t\tAnimal and Hexes, then switch to another for its abilities and spell\n\t\tlist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wandering Hex<\/span>: Get a free Hex that you can\n\t\tchange every day from your Wandering Spirit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Manifestation<\/span> (Su): Varies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Shaman is a straight caster, and doesn&#8217;t have the melee capacity of a Cleric, which makes Shamans very SAD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump to 7 unless you want to carry a\n\t\tspear or something.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Needed for saves and AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Needed for saves and HP.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Only needed for skill ranks, but I\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t drop below 10 unless you&#8217;re Human.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Your spellcasting stat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Required for several Spirit\n\t\tabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:<\/li>\n<li>Dex:<\/li>\n<li>Con:<\/li>\n<li>Int:<\/li>\n<li>Wis:<\/li>\n<li>Cha:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:<\/li>\n<li>Dex:<\/li>\n<li>Con:<\/li>\n<li>Int:<\/li>\n<li>Wis:<\/li>\n<li>Cha:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:<\/li>\n<li>Dex:<\/li>\n<li>Con:<\/li>\n<li>Int:<\/li>\n<li>Wis:<\/li>\n<li>Cha:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because the Shaman is a primary caster, Wisdom is essential. Other abilities are negotiable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: The bonus to Wisdom and all of the\n\t\tDwarf&#8217;s racial defense are great. The Charisma penalty can be annoying for\n\t\tsome Spirit abilities, but it&#8217;s not likely to break your build. The Dwarf\n\t\tfavored class bonus gives your Spirit Animal some extra natural armor, but\n\t\tbecause the Spirit Animal is a familiar, it generally shouldn&#8217;t be somewhere\n\t\twhich might involve being attacked.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: Despite the decent spellcasting\n\t\tabilities, the Elf has very little to offer the Shaman.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: Small size helps with Shaman&#8217;s\n\t\tmediocre AC, the bonus to Charisma helps with some Spirit abilities, and the\n\t\tGnome&#8217;s favored class bonus grants extra Hexes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\t\tnice, and you can find a way to make use of the Half-Elf&#8217;s other racial\n\t\tabilities by using some alternate racial abilities. The biggest draw is the\n\t\tHalf-Elf favored class bonus, which allows you to learn spells not normally\n\t\tavailable to the Shaman. This opens up a lot of fantastic options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Just as good as the Half-Elf,\n\t\tbut you get Darkvision by default and different racial bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: Similar to the Gnome, but the\n\t\tHalfling favored class bonus makes your Spirit Animal better. Unfortunately,\n\t\tthe favored class bonus doesn&#8217;t specify what happens when your effective\n\t\tlevel exceeds 20, so it&#8217;s likely that your favored class bonuses will be\n\t\twasted at high levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: As usual, humans are fantastic at\n\t\teverything. The Human favored class bonus is the same as the Half-Elf and\n\t\tHalf-Orc, allowing you to learn Cleric spells which aren&#8217;t normally\n\t\tavailable to the Shaman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): Your only social\n\t\t\tskill.

It&#8217;s a bit more expensive than your typical +2 shield, so it\n\t\t\tmay not be worth the cost compared to a mithral buckler. However, it\n\t\t\tallows you to perform somatic components with the hand holding the shield,\n\t\t\twhich means that you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue,\n\t\t\tand because it has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone\n\t\t\tcan use it without issue.

If you are a 3.5 native, go read Pathfinder&#8217;s rules for staffs because they have improved dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staffs are a reliable, rechargeable source of extra spellcasting that can give spellcasters easy and reliable access to spells from their spell list which they might not want to learn, or which they might like to use so frequently that they can&#8217;t prepare the spell enough times in a given day. On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Shaman is a full caster, so multiclassing is rarely a good option unless you have a very specific build in mind.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Shaman is a divine spellcaster, and can work as a Blaster (depending on your choice of Spirit), Healer, and Support.
