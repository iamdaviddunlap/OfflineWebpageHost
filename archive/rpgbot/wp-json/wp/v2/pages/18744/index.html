They aren\u2019t particularly flashy, but they\u2019re even more versatile than most Clerics, and that\u2019s saying quite a bit. Meant to be one of the ways to have a more Wizard flavor to your Cleric, they have access to some traditionally Arcane-only divination spells which nicely augment the Cleric\u2019s innate capacity to go straight to nigh-omniscient beings for answers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with Expertise in a couple skills and the Cleric\u2019s heavily supportive magic options, you end up with a character that can know everything and do nearly anything well at a moment\u2019s notice. Scholar, Scout, and Face are all easily fakeable on a moment&#8217;s notice with the right spell selection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The only real active ability of the class doesn\u2019t work in many combats, though, so the domain can feel a little boring if you don\u2019t spend much time in civilization.

Augury is easily one\n\t\t\t\t\tof my favorite divinations, though it takes a bit of practice and\n\t\t\t\t\tfamiliarity with your DM to really make it work. If your group is ever\n\t\t\t\t\tstuck arguing about how to proceed, Augury can be used to quickly\n\t\t\t\t\tnarrow your possibilities by eliminating options which yield &#8220;woe&#8221;\n\t\t\t\t\tresults.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-red\">5th Level<\/span>: Both options are very\n\t\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: Arcane eye is a very\n\t\t\t\t\teffective way to scout nearby areas which might be dangerous or\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to access normally. Confusion is a difficult spell to use,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut if your targets will reliably fail the Wisdom saving throw, they\n\t\t\t\t\tlose 80% of their turns for the duration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-red\">9th Level<\/span>: Legend Lore and Scrying\n\t\t\t\t\tare very situational options which see infrequent use, and can nearly\n\t\t\t\t\talways wait for you to take a long rest to prepare them on the rare\n\t\t\t\t\toccasions that you need them.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blessings of Knowledge<\/span>: Two languages\n\t\t\tare nice, but quickly stop mattering when you gain access to Tongues. The\n\t\t\ttwo free Knowledge skills are much more important, especially since you\n\t\t\tget to add double your proficiency bonus, easily making up for a\n\t\t\tpotentially poor Intelligence score.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages<\/span>:\n\t\t\tThis is a fantastic utility ability. Forgot to bring a Rogue? Grab some\n\t\t\tthieves&#8217; tools, cast Guidance, and you&#8217;re ready to go.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts<\/span>:\n\t\t\tReading minds is situationally useful, but Suggestion can be very\n\t\t\teffective, especially because activating this effect has no outwardly visible effect, and they automatically fail the save against Suggestion, so you don\u2019t have to worry about what someone might do if you cast a spell at them and it doesn\u2019t work.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\t\tcan easily have 20 Wisdom, giving an excellent boost to your damage\n\t\t\toutput. Note that this only applies to Cleric cantrips, so you can&#8217;t use\n\t\t\tit in conjunction with Magic Initiate or cantrips gained by\n\t\t\tmulticlassing.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Visions of the Past<\/span>: This is very hard\n\t\t\tto rate. If your DM is creative and open-minded, this could grant you\n\t\t\tprofound insight into the plot of the game, and can provide a very potent\n\t\t\tstory-telling tool. If your DM is tight-lipped, and doesn&#8217;t like giving up\n\t\t\tsecrets, you may find this ability to be difficult to use effectively.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"knowledge-domain-ability-scores\">Knowledge Domain Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-yellow\">Dex<\/span>: Fill out your medium armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Dying is suboptimal, plus you have several of the best Concentration spells in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Since we get expertise on two knowledge skills and we\u2019re a SAD class, we can afford to bump Int to back those checks up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: The Cleric&#8217;s spells are powered by Wisdom<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"knowledge-domain-races\">Knowledge Domain Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from the standard <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/\">Cleric Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"knowledge-domain-feats\">Knowledge Domain Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from the standard <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/\">Cleric Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"knowledge-domain-weapons\">Knowledge Domain Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from the standard <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/\">Cleric Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"knowledge-domain-armor\">Knowledge Domain Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from the standard <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/\">Cleric Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing combos with proficiency on demand and mind reading, so just stick to Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-knowlege-cleric-build-oh-nowo\">Example Knowlege Cleric Build &#8211; Oh nowo<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Did you know that Thoth is literally mentioned in the PHB? \u201cThe gods of knowledge \u2014 including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth \u2014 value learning and understanding above all.\u201d Did you know that Thoth, when written in ancient Greek, is spelled \u0398\u03ce\u03b8?
