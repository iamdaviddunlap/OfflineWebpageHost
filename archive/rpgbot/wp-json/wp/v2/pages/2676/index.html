If you can hit two targets, the total damage will beat any other\n\t\tcantrip (Eldritch Blast doesn&#8217;t count), and since it&#8217;s on Dexterity saves\n\t\tmany bulky melee enemies will reliably fail. However, it&#8217;s hard to count on\n\t\ttwo enemies being adjacent, and generally when they are you want to use\n\t\tleveled spells to take advantage of the situation.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blade Ward<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Similar in function to\n\t\ttaking the Dodge action, but since your AC may be terrible this may be more\n\t\treliable.

According to Jeremy Crawford on the official\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/articles\/features\/dragontalk_jeremy-crawford\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragon Talk Podcast<\/a\n\t\t\t>, the updated version can&#8217;t be twinned with Twin Spell.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Chill Touch<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The same range as Fire\n\t\tBolt, but less damage. In exchange, you get a better damage type and the\n\t\ttarget can&#8217;t regain hit points for a turn which can be a big help against\n\t\tenemies with regeneration or enemy clerics. This also imposes Disadvantage\n\t\ton the next attack if the target is undead, but many undead also have\n\t\tresistance to necrotic damage so Chill Touch isn&#8217;t always a good option\n\t\tagainst undead. Still, if you need a staple, go-to damage cantrip that isn&#8217;t\n\t\tFire Bolt, Chill Touch is a great option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Control Flames<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Notably omitted\n\t\tfrom the function of Control Flames is the ability to create or extinguish\n\t\tthem. Druidcraft and Prestidigitation both grant the ability to light or\n\t\tsnuff out small flames. Control Flames will let you spread flames,\n\t\textinguish them, change their color, etc., but if you want to light a torch\n\t\tyou need to use flint and tinder like a commoner. You can use this to\n\t\tdramatically improve the effectiveness of torches, or to snuff out enemy\n\t\tlight sources at a distance, but those are situational uses that you can\n\t\taddress with better light sources like the Daylight spell or by using water.\n\t\tNeither function is frequent or useful enough to justify a cantrip with so\n\t\tlittle functionality.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Bonfire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: A low-budget area\n\t\tcontrol spell. It does as much initial damage as most cantrips, but the\n\t\tongoing damage only applies when a creature enters the area or ends their\n\t\tturn there, so you can only get extra damage if you can force an enemy into\n\t\tthe space or if you cast it on them and they remain in their space. If you\n\t\thave an ally who likes to grapple enemies, or if you need to block a narrow\n\t\tspace like a hall or doorway, this is extremely useful if you&#8217;re not already\n\t\tcommiting Concentration to something else.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, Create Bonfire&#8217;s reliance on Concentration can become a problem\n\t\t\tas you gain levels because Concentration is such a precious resource, and\n\t\t\tmany of the best spells require Concentration. If your game doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tinclude an option to retrain cantrips, I would skip Create Bonfire\n\t\t\tentirely. If you have a way to retrain cantrips, consider taking Create\n\t\t\tBonfire at low levels, but be prepared to replace it if you find that\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not using it consistently.<\/p\n\t\t><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dancing Lights<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An amusing distraction,\n\t\tbut you can usually accomplish the same thing using Mage Hand and a candle\n\t\tor torch.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire Bolt<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Great range and solid\n\t\tdamage. A good go-to option when all you need is damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Friends<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is hard to use. 1\n\t\tminute is not a lot of time, and you generally need to put distance between\n\t\tyourself and the subject of the spell before they turn hostile. You could\n\t\tuse this to intimidate a creature into fleeing, but in most cases you&#8217;ll\n\t\tprobably be using this quickly talk your way past a creature blocking your\n\t\tway like a guard at a gate. You generally won&#8217;t need this; between high\n\t\tCharisma and other spells, you can find plenty of options which work better\n\t\tlike Charm Person.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Frostbite<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Low damage for\n\t\ta cantrip (d6-based), but the big appeal is Disadvantage on the target&#8217;s\n\t\tnext weapon attack. Unfortunately, it works on Constitution saving throws,\n\t\tand those tend to be relatively high compared to other saving throws.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Green-Flame<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tMelee cantrips are an extremely difficult prospect for a class with d6 hit\n\t\tdice, and relying on a weapon attack rather than a spell attack just makes\n\t\tthat issue worse.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Note that Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything published an updated version of\n\t\t\tGreen-Flame Blade.

If it had more options, I would be\n\t\tinterested. If it had better range, I would be interested. But as it stands\n\t\tthis spell is almost totally useless.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infestation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Constitution saves\n\t\ttend to be high, which is this spell&#8217;s biggest problem. The damage is low\n\t\tbut tolerable, and the forced movement is enough to make it useful by\n\t\tforcing enemies to move around in dangerous places or move out of a grapple\n\t\tdespite your lack of control over the direction.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Disposable magic light\n\t\tis fantastic, but if you don&#8217;t have room for the cantrip you&#8217;ll do fine with\n\t\ttorches.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Lure<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tDespite the 15-foot range, this can be a great option for melee builds.\n\t\tAgainst enemies with poor Strength (like many enemy spellcasters), you can\n\t\tuse this to drag them into melee with you and force them to teleport or\n\t\tDisengage in order to get away from you unharmed. If you&#8217;re flying, you may\n\t\teven be able to pull enemies into the air to cause a small amount of falling\n\t\tdamage. The save is Strength, so try to reserve this for physically weak\n\t\tfoes like other spellcasters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Hand<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ability to move\n\t\tobjects at a safe distance is profoundly useful. Use it to pull levers, open\n\t\tdoors, sort your laundry, and all manner of other important but potentially\n\t\thazardous tasks where you wouldn&#8217;t want to risk your own hands.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mending<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too situational. Short\n\t\tof Rust Monsters and a few oozes, nearly nothing in 5e deals damage to your\n\t\tequipment. If you&#8217;re playing Spelljammer this is essential, but otherwise\n\t\tyou can skip it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Message<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational. Use this\n\t\tto send messages without revealing your position. Of course, the spell\n\t\trequires Verbal components and it&#8217;s not clear how loud verbal components are\n\t\tintended to be, so take precautions if possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mind Sliver<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Psychic damage on an\n\t\tIntelligence save is spectacular on its own. Intelligence saves are\n\t\tconsistently among the lowest, and psychic damage resistance\/immunity is\n\t\trare (though it does exist, especially on mindless enemies like zombies).\n\t\tThat alone makes Mind Sliver arguably the most reliable cantrip damage in\n\t\t5e, but it gets better from there. With only Verbal components, Mind Sliver\n\t\tworks while you&#8217;re tied up or have your hands full, making it a great option\n\t\tfor War Caster. It also imposes a -1d4 penalty on the target&#8217;s next saving\n\t\tthrow making them an easier target for save-or-suck spells, or you can just\n\t\trepeatedly hit them with Mind Sliver and watch enemies try to beat your\n\t\tspell save DC with a +0 save bonus and the -1d4 penalty from your previous\n\t\thit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Minor Illusion<\/span>:\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Room for plenty of\n\t\tcreative, deceptive uses. The 5-foot cube is easily enough to create\n\t\tsomething to hide behind, provided that your enemies don&#8217;t see you create\n\t\tthe illusion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Mold Earth<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: You know what\n\t\telse can do this? A shovel. Sure, shoveling will take a long time, but you\n\t\tget a limited number of cantrips, and if you can replace a cantrip with a\n\t\tmundane item it&#8217;s probably a bad cantrip. The only important function is to\n\t\tcreate difficult terrain, but you&#8217;re limited to two ongoing effects, which\n\t\tmeans you only get two 5-foot squares. And, again, you could do that with a\n\t\tshovel. You&#8217;re about as likely to use this in combat as you are to use a\n\t\tshovel, too.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison Spray<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Good damage compared to\n\t\tmost cantrips, but poison damage is commonly resisted, the range is\n\t\tessentially melee, and it&#8217;s a Constitution save.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prestidigitation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Whenever you want to do\n\t\tsomething small and magical that&#8217;s not covered by another spell, it&#8217;s\n\t\tusually covered by prestidigitation. This spell is exceptionally versatile.\n\t\tFor suggestions on how to use Prestidigitation to its fullest, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/prestidigitation\"\n\t\t\t>Practical Guide to Prestidigitation<\/a\n\t\t>.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ray of Frost<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: You have a limited\n\t\tnumber of cantrips, Frostbite is much better, and the need diversifying the\n\t\tdamage types you can deal is too important to take two cold damage\n\t\tcantrips.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shape Water<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is as\n\t\tabusable and versatile as Prestidigitation. Freeze a solid 5 foot cube of\n\t\twater and drop it on someone. Pour water into a lock, freeze it, and allow\n\t\tthe ice expansion to break the lock. Put a dome of ice over something you&#8217;re\n\t\tprotecting. Build a small bridge in 5-foot segments. Block a hallway. Freeze\n\t\ta door in place. The uses are numerous and fantastic. If you have a barrel\n\t\tof water and this cantrip, you have a solution to most problems. Honestly\n\t\tthe fact that this spell is so much better than its other elemental\n\t\tequivalents (Control Flames, Gust, and Mold Earth) is a good indication of\n\t\tjust how awful those spells are. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/shape-water\">Practical Guide to Shape Water<\/a>\n\t\tfor more on how great Shape Water is.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Shocking Grasp<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The damage is worse\n\t\tthan Fire Bolt and it&#8217;s touch range. Advantage against enemies in metal\n\t\tarmor is nowhere near enough to make this appealing. If you hit the target\n\t\tcan&#8217;t take Reactions like Opportunity Attacks or casting Counterspell, but I\n\t\tstill don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough to justify rushing into melee.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sword Burst<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): If\n\t\tyou are in a position where it makes sense to use this, you should probably\n\t\tbe running away.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderclap<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Thunder damage is\n\t\tworse than Sword Burst&#8217;s force damage, and Thunderclap uses Constitution\n\t\tsaves, which tend to be high.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">True Strike<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Typically you&#8217;ll get\n\t\tbetter results from attacking twice rather than using this then attacking\n\t\tonce. Note that you don&#8217;t get the benefits of the spell until your next\n\t\tturn, so even if you Quicken this it&#8217;s still bad.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Absorb Elements<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: A fantastic\n\t\tdefensive option at any level, this will save your life when you encounter\n\t\tan unpredictable source of elemental damage like a trap or a spell. The\n\t\tbonus damage on your next attack is largely useless, but it still feels cool\n\t\twhen you use it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Burning Hands<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The cone is just 15\n\t\tfeet, so it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll hit more than two targets. The 3d6 damage\n\t\tis fine, but it&#8217;s not enough to justify rushing into melee unless you have\n\t\tenough movement to retreat to safety after doing so.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Catapult<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Equivalent damage to\n\t\tChromatic Orb, but Chromatic Orb is more versatile and has better range.\n\t\tWhere Catapult shines is its reliability: If a target passes their saving\n\t\tthrow, the object continues moving until it hits something or runs out of\n\t\trange. If you can line up two or more targets, you odds of hitting and\n\t\tdealing damage improve considerably.

The target\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;ve been targeted by the spell if they succeed on the\n\t\tsaving throw, but you don&#8217;t know if they succeeded or failed unless your DM\n\t\tdecides to tell you (and they are under no obligation to do so).

For example:\n\t\tCreate an illusion of the floor beneath the target sprouting teeth, rising\n\t\tup around the creature, and eating it like a venus fly trap.

Making\n\t\tnumerous attacks means that you&#8217;re likely to hit with at least some of them,\n\t\tbut you&#8217;re also likely to miss with some of them and therefore deal only\n\t\tpartial damage. The best way to think about stuff like this is to rely on\n\t\taverages: if you&#8217;re sticking to the Attack vs. AC progression, you&#8217;re\n\t\texpected to hit around 65% of the time, so you can expect an average of 65%\n\t\tof the damage from any effect which relies on an attack. Scorching Ray deals\n\t\ta total of 6d6 damage (avg. 21), and 65% of that is 13.65 expected damage\n\t\t(disregarding critical hits, which are more common because you&#8217;re making\n\t\tmultiple attacks).<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Easy, reliable counter\n\t\tto invisibility.

Misty Step will, of course, get you\n\t\tfurther and do more than just avoiding Opportunity Attacks, but Tasha&#8217;s Mind\n\t\tWhip&#8217;s benefits don&#8217;t stop there. Limiting the target&#8217;s actions on their\n\t\tturn to <em>one thing<\/em> from their choice of movement, Action, and Bonus\n\t\tAction means that enemies who can&#8217;t attack at range basically spend their\n\t\twhole turn walking.

Blur only lasts 1 minute, but the\n\t\tDisadvantage applies to all attacks rather than just ranged attacks. Warding\n\t\tWind lasts 10 minutes and makes it hard for enemies to move near you,\n\t\tpotentially keeping them from reaching you in melee. I&#8217;m not sure which\n\t\tspell is better, but given that Warding Wind lasts longer and can handle\n\t\teffects that normally require Gust of Wind, I think Warding Wind may be\n\t\tslightly better.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Web<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fantastic crowd\n\t\tcontrol, but with some complications.

Compared to Earthen Grasp, Web can\n\t\taffect more than one creature and has a much better duration, but Web may be\n\t\teasier to escape. Web requires an initially Dexterity saving throw, then\n\t\tcreatures can make Strength checks to escape on later turns. Strength checks\n\t\tare going to be hard compared to your Spell Save DC since Strength checks\n\t\twill never add a Proficiency Bonus, but many creatures will be good at\n\t\teither Strength or Dexterity, so your ideal targets are creatures which are\n\t\tbad at both like many spellcasters. The webs can also be burned away, so any\n\t\tcreature that can deal fire damage, or which is carrying something like\n\t\tflint and steel or a lit torch can easily escape without struggling through\n\t\ta series of Strength checks. Being Restrained doesn&#8217;t prevent creatures from\n\t\ttaking such actions. Given all of the comparisons, I think Web is a better\n\t\toption for handling groups of foes, but Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp is better\n\t\tagainst single foes.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wither and Bloom<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Most sorcerers can&#8217;t\n\t\tprovide magical healing, so the ability to heal other creatures (even if\n\t\tit&#8217;s by spending a hit die) is very exciting.

But you have to somehow hit\n\t\twith a bunch of arrows or pass them off to someone who will, and following\n\t\tthe typical attack vs. AC progression means that a player will hit something\n\t\tlike 65% of the time, which means you&#8217;re getting 65% of the maximum damage,\n\t\tso something like 7d6.

Take a group\n\t\tof creatures out of a fight for a full minute on only one save. Targets\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get another save, and the effect doesn&#8217;t end until the spell does or\n\t\tsomeone breaks targets out of the effect. This means that you can focus on\n\t\tenemies which pass the initial save, then gradually eliminate the remaining\n\t\ttargets one at a time. This doesn&#8217;t scale with spell level, but it really\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t need to. A 30-foot cube is enough to hit several creatures, and so\n\t\tlong as your Spell Save DC is decent you&#8217;ll do fine. Even if enemies spend\n\t\tan Action to break their allies out of the spell, you&#8217;ve spent one Action to\n\t\tincapacitate them and they&#8217;re spending more than that just to fix it without\n\t\tactually harming you or your allies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incite Greed<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">AI<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is a gamble.

You could walk your full speed away (affected\n\t\ttargets can do nothing but move toward you, so they can&#8217;t take Reactions to\n\t\tperform an Opportunity Attack), drop Concentration, then hit them with a\n\t\tFireball.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Intellect Fortress<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Technically\n\t\tsituational, but an absolutely spectacular defense against enemies which\n\t\trely on spells or common effects like charm and fear effects.

You also get resistance to\n\t\tpsychic damage, which is nice if you&#8217;re fighting mind flayers, aboleths, or\n\t\tbards who enjoy Vicious Mockery. With a 1-hour duration, the Concentration\n\t\trequirement can be problematic, but it also means that you can carry this\n\t\tthrough multiple encounters at low cost, so in situations where you need\n\t\tthis it&#8217;s not going to eat all of your spell slots.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Bolt<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Regardless of its\n\t\tlength, it is very hard to target more than two targets with a line like\n\t\tLightning Bolt.

Each meteor deals 2d6 damage,\n\t\tso at 6 meteors you can deal a total of 12d6 damage, beating Fireball by\n\t\thalf. However, the 5-foot radius on the meteors is tiny so you&#8217;re lucky if\n\t\tyou can hit just two creatures. Fortunately, you have 10 minutes to find\n\t\tgood targets if you don&#8217;t mind dedicating Concentration to keeping this\n\t\trunning as your pool of meteors gradually depletes. Probably your best bet\n\t\tis to cast this before going into a fight, then fire meteors as a Bonus\n\t\tAction between casting other spells.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Energy<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A fantastic buff,\n\t\tespecially if you can set it up ahead of time, but it&#8217;s single-target and\n\t\trequires Concentration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Spirit of Death<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a>)<\/sup>: Summon Undead is\n\t\toutright better.

Hypnotic Pattern&#8217;s targets can&#8217;t act at all until\n\t\tthey&#8217;re released from the effect, but it&#8217;s also a Charm effect which some\n\t\tcreatures are immune or resistant to.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Spirit Shroud<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Without a built-in way\n\t\tto make multiple attacks and with very little reason to build around using\n\t\tweapons in melee, I don&#8217;t see a way for this to be effective.

The effects are complicated, and the 4d10 damage looks\n\t\tunderwhelming, but don&#8217;t let that deter you. This is a great spell to cast\n\t\tinto a room then shut the door, but even if that&#8217;s not an option it&#8217;s a\n\t\tfantastic way to handle crowds. With a 30-foot radius you can hit a huge\n\t\tnumber of targets, and with a 10-minute duration you can easily kill\n\t\tanything stuck in the area for an extended period. The 4d10 damage is fine,\n\t\tand negating invisibility is great, but the real appeal is the levels of\n\t\tExhaustion. One level makes targets less able to resist grappling or other\n\t\tcrowd control spells like Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp or Web which your\n\t\tallies could cast to keep enemies in the area. Two levels halves targets&#8217;\n\t\tspeed, making it harder for them to move out of the area. Three levels\n\t\timposes Disadvantage on saves so their condition will deteriorate even\n\t\tfaster. If targets somehow survive until 5 levels of exhaustion (they&#8217;ll\n\t\thave taken 20d10 radiant damage by now, which is a lot), their speed drops\n\t\tto 0 so you no longer need to do anything to prevent escape. Just wait for\n\t\tthem to hit 6 levels of Exhaustion, which results in death if a total of\n\t\t24d10 radiant damage somehow hasn&#8217;t killed them. Just be warned: this spell\n\t\taffects allies, too, and if the spell ends the levels of Exhaustion are\n\t\tremoved instantly.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit of Death<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a>)<\/sup>: The lowest-level\n\t\tsummon spell available to the Sorcerer.

The same range, the same AOE, the same\n\t\tsave, the same school. But Vitriolic Sphere deals acid damage, and instead\n\t\tof dealing the damage all up front, some of it is applied at the end of\n\t\ttargets&#8217; next turns. The initial damage exceeds Fireball&#8217;s initial damage by\n\t\ta few points, but on it&#8217;s own not by enough to justify the spell level\n\t\tdifference. The big addition is that you get half of the initial damage at\n\t\tthe end of targets&#8217; next turns. That&#8217;s a huge damage boost, but it only\n\t\tapplies if the targets fail their saves, and obviously it only matters if\n\t\tthey&#8217;re still alive. This is a great spell early in a fight, especially if\n\t\tyou know that you&#8217;re not going to kill the targets in one shot, but that&#8217;s\n\t\talso the time when you should be dropping spells like Sickening Radiance or\n\t\tWall of Fire, so maybe use this as your second spell in an encounter.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Fire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An absolutely fantastic\n\t\tarea control option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Watery Sphere<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Similar to\n\t\tMaximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp, but you can move it around and it can affect\n\t\tmultiple targets.

First, avoid\n\t\tany object with feet or legs like tables and chairs; choosing objects which\n\t\tare forced to fly makes them much more useful. From there, you need to weigh\n\t\tthe benefits of various size objects. Larger objects can take up more space\n\t\tand deal more damage per attack, but having numerous small attacks may deal\n\t\tmore damage. Larger objects have considerably more hit points but\n\t\tconsiderably worse AC. Medium creatures have the worst attack bonus, and\n\t\tattack bonuses improve as you move away from Medium in either direction,\n\t\taltering the amount of damage which you can expect from each attack.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Looking at all of the various factors, in most cases your best option is\n\t\t\t10 tiny objects. Enemies still can&#8217;t move into their space, and with a\n\t\t\ttotal of 10 attacks they&#8217;ll easily deal more damage than any other\n\t\t\tcombination of objects. Over 10 rounds, 10 attacks per round, 100 total\n\t\t\tattacks, totalling 100d4+400 damage, avg. 650. Expect attacks to hit\n\t\t\troughly 50% of the time, but even then against a single target that&#8217;s an\n\t\t\taverage of up to 325 damage if the target doesn&#8217;t do something about.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you select objects which will fly, they can easily encircle an enemy,\n\t\t\tkeeping them in place either in the air or on the ground. Granted, with\n\t\t\tjust 20 hit points they&#8217;re vulnerable to AOE damage, but it&#8217;s easy to look\n\t\t\tfor other spells whenever that&#8217;s a problem. And, if you can&#8217;t find\n\t\t\tadequate targets you can carry around a sack full of daggers or loaves of\n\t\t\tbread or something else light and portable.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bigby&#8217;s Hand<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Versatile\n\t\tand effective against a variety of enemies. The damage from both Clenched\n\t\tFist and Grasping Hand is great, and scales well with spell level. By this\n\t\tlevel you have plenty of ways to handle single targets, but generally once\n\t\tthe target passes a save they&#8217;re free of the effect. Bigby&#8217;s Hand sticks\n\t\taround for the spell&#8217;s duration, allowing you to repeatedly harass the\n\t\ttarget and move on to a new target once the previous one falls. Since this\n\t\tspell can do a lot of things with one spell, it&#8217;s a great example of spells\n\t\tthat work within the Sorcerer&#8217;s limited number of spells known.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloudkill<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Designed to be rolled\n\t\tthrough armies, this spell is hard to use in the small, tactical fights\n\t\tbetween a party of adventurers and a handful of monsters. The simple fact\n\t\tthat the effect moves away from you makes the spell difficult to keep in\n\t\tplace, and RAW it&#8217;s unclear if the effect stops if it hits a solid barrier\n\t\tor if it&#8217;s happy to roll straight through solid objects like castle walls.\n\t\tRAW, the spell moves away from you rather than from your original position\n\t\twhen casting the spell, so you may be able to pilot the effect by running\n\t\taround it, but with a 20-foot radius you may need more than the typical\n\t\t25\/30 ft. speed most humanoid races have if you want to make more than\n\t\tslight adjustments to the cloud&#8217;s direction every round. If you want to run\n\t\tfully around to the opposite side of the cloud, you need to move upwards of\n\t\t60 feet (half the circumference of a circle with 40-foot diameter is roughly\n\t\t62.5 feet, but that doesn&#8217;t account for positioning on a grid).<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Cone of Cold<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Despite the larger\n\t\ttotal area of effect, I think this is worse than Fireball. Even with a\n\t\t60-foot cone you have much less flexibility than a 20-foot-radius sphere\n\t\twith 150-foot range. Cone of Cold&#8217;s 8d8 damage on slightly exceeds Fireballs\n\t\t8d8 damage (just 8 points more damage on average), and if you cast Fireball\n\t\tas a 5th-level spell Cone of Cold does just 1 point more damage on\n\t\taverage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Control Winds<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Inconvenience\n\t\tcreatures relying on ranged weapon attacks, and slow enemies attempting to\n\t\tmove in one particular direction.

If you&#8217;re\n\t\tworried about flying enemies, cast Earthbind or something. My point is that\n\t\tthere are lower-level spells which solve the same problems that Control\n\t\tWinds solves, and they usually do a better job.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Creation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This spell is limited\n\t\tby its maximum volume and by your creativity. It takes a full minute to cast\n\t\tso it&#8217;s not going to be useful in combat, but it&#8217;s an amazing utility\n\t\toption. A 5-foot cube may not sound like a lot, but that&#8217;s enough to get up\n\t\tto all sorts of mischief. Need to block a hallway? How about a 5-foot cube\n\t\tof wood or stone? Need a quick trap? 5-foot sphere of something heavy, roll\n\t\tit down a hill. Short on ammunition? Enough arrows to fill a 5-foot cube.\n\t\tFood? 5-foot cube of non-living vegetable matter sounds a lot like food to\n\t\tme. Fancy clothes for a party? The finest cotton.

Still, there&#8217;s no better\n\t\toff-switch for a humanoid than Dominate Person. Upcasting the spell\n\t\tincreases the duration, allowing you to drag the target through a bunch of\n\t\tfights. However, the creature taking damage allows additional saves so be\n\t\tsure to keep it out of harm&#8217;s way until you can conveniently do away with\n\t\tthem at minimal risk to yourself and your allies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enervation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Remember Witch Bolt\n\t\tfrom all the way back at level 1? Enervation is the same idea: you hit once,\n\t\tthen you spend every Action for a while dealing automatic damage. It&#8217;s a\n\t\tfine concept, but at just 4d8 damage it&#8217;s going to take a profoundly long\n\t\ttime to kill any single target worthy of a 5th-level spell slot.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Far Step<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: The teleportation is\n\t\treally nice, but you can teleport with Misty Step which is 3 spell levels\n\t\tlower. Sure, Far Step lets you go twice as far and you couldn&#8217;t teleport 10\n\t\ttimes in a row with Misty Step without spending a huge number of spell\n\t\tslots, but situations where you need to teleport once every round should\n\t\tprobably be addressed by things like flying or invisibility.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Monster<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A great example of a\n\t\t&#8220;save or suck&#8221; spell. With the exception of undead, this works on any\n\t\tcreature type, and paralysis takes a creature out of a fight almost as much\n\t\tas killing them. If you have an ally who fights in melee, send them to\n\t\tfollow up with melee attacks. Automatic critical hits are too hard to pass\n\t\tup many melee allies. Keep in mind that targets get another save at the end\n\t\tof each of their turns, so you need to act quickly while targets are still\n\t\taffected.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Immolation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Against a single\n\t\ttarget with a ton of hit points and terrible reflex saves, this is a\n\t\tpassable use of a spell slot. But it&#8217;s also a slow way to kill the sort of\n\t\thigh-CR creature which you typically want to use this on, and for the same\n\t\tspell slot you could cast Fireball and deal 10d6 damage to everything in an\n\t\tAOE rather than 8d6 to one target and <em>maybe<\/em> more damage the next\n\t\tround.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Insect Plague<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Combining both ongoing\n\t\tdamage and difficult terrain, Insect Plague is a good area control option,\n\t\tfurther improved because you can place it in the air or underwater, rather\n\t\tthan on the ground. However, the radius isn&#8217;t big enough to prevent a\n\t\tcreature from escaping if its willing to spend its Action to Dash, so look\n\t\tfor other ways to force the creature to stay inside the sphere like shoving,\n\t\ttripping, or casting Wall of Stone.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Seeming<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very situational.

By the time you can cast it, proficiency bonuses will be at\n\t\tleast +4, mathematically exceeding the average increase of roughly 3.5 from\n\t\tAdvantage which the target might receive from Empower Ability. Skill\n\t\tEmpowerment pulls ahead of Empower Ability as proficiency bonuses increase,\n\t\tbut that doesn&#8217;t necessarily allow to replace Enhance Ability. Enhance\n\t\tAbility is 3 spell levels lower, has the same duration, and applies to all\n\t\tability checks for one ability score rather than just a single skill. In\n\t\tcases like sending your party&#8217;s Face to negotiate, you may want broader\n\t\tcoverage than one skill so that the target can use different skills rather\n\t\tthan forcing them to rely on the one you picked for Skill Empowerment. Skill\n\t\tEmpowerment also won&#8217;t stack with existing Expertise, which both bards and\n\t\trogues receive, so in many parties your most-likely recipient won&#8217;t benefit.\n\t\tSkill Empowerment is by no means a bad spell, it just only works better than\n\t\tEnhance Ability in certain circumstances on certain characters, and since\n\t\tsorcerers get so few spells known you really need to get as much as possible\n\t\tout of each spell you know.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Draconic Spirit<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">FToD<\/a>)<\/sup>: A sturdy, flying\n\t\tsummon with several damage resistances, the draconic spirit can find\n\t\tinvisible foes, serve as a flying mount (though it&#8217;s intelligent, so don&#8217;t\n\t\tgo riding it into melee), and its attacks are good enough to do quite a bit\n\t\tof damage. Overall, it&#8217;s a solid, versatile summoning option, though it\n\t\tmight not be as lethal as similar spells. Of course, versatility is crucial\n\t\tfor the Sorcerer, so getting several uses from one spell is very\n\t\tappealing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Synaptic Static<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Start with fireball.\n\t\tShave 30 feet off the range, change the damage type to psychic, and change\n\t\tthe saving throw to Intelligence. Very few creatures are good at\n\t\tintelligence saves, so expect most creatures to fail the save. The 8d6\n\t\tdamage feels underwhelming at this spell level, but subtracting a d6 from\n\t\tattack rolls and ability checks for a full minute is a significant debuff.\n\t\tThis is a good option to start a fight with a large number of martial\n\t\tenemies because they&#8217;ll be impacted most by debuff and most martial enemies\n\t\thave poor Intelligence saves.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Telekinesis<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fantastically\n\t\tversatile. The utility capabilities alone are well worth the spell, and with\n\t\t10 minutes to enjoy it per casting you can solve all manner of problems.\n\t\tOpen doors, safely handle traps, move obstacles, retrieve items from under\n\t\tcourches, aid in construction, or solve any number of problems which might\n\t\trequire a crane in real life. Against enemies, lifting them into the air and\n\t\tmaking them Restrained can easily be a death sentence if you have other\n\t\tallies who can follow up with ranged attacks or who can reach the target via\n\t\tflight or some other means. Because the target must remain within the\n\t\tspell&#8217;s range, be careful about holding the target directly above your own\n\t\thead to get them to the maximum height. It&#8217;s perfectly fine to hold them 30\n\t\tfeet off the ground roughly 30 feet away from you horizontally. The target\n\t\tfalls prone if they take damage from the fall, which should slow most\n\t\tcreatures enough that they can&#8217;t get into melee with you without dashing.\n\t\tThen you can attempt to pick them up again on your next turn because the\n\t\tspell lasts 10 minutes and you can use it every turn without limit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Teleportation Circle<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational, but\n\t\tgenerally one of the safest long-distance teleportation options, especially\n\t\tsince it doesn&#8217;t have a cap on the number or size of creatures affected.\n\t\tHowever, how useful it is depends on the availability of convenient\n\t\tteleportation circles in your campaign. If your DM isn&#8217;t going to make such\n\t\tteleportation circles available and useful, look elsewhere.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wall of Light<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: The damage is awful,\n\t\tbut that&#8217;s not what this spell is for. The real benefit is\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#blind\">blinding<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\tstuff. Creatures are only blinded if they&#8217;re in the wall when you create it,\n\t\tand creatures can move through the wall totally unaffected. The save is\n\t\tConstitution-based and Constitution saves tend to be high, and since\n\t\tcreatures get another save every round you can&#8217;t count on the blindness to\n\t\tlast more than a round or two. Even the ability to short rays from the wall\n\t\tis disappointing, dealing the same 4d8 damage and not re-applying\n\t\tblindness.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Stone<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: While it certainly\n\t\tisn&#8217;t glamorous, it&#8217;s difficult to overstate how effective a solid stone\n\t\tbarrier can be at solving problems. Walling off some of the enemies an\n\t\tencounter can take one challenging counter and make it two very easy\n\t\tback-to-back encounters. You do need to maintain Concentration, but that\n\t\talso means that when you&#8217;re ready to deal with whatever you decided to wall\n\t\toff temporarily you can just drop Concentration rather than breaking down\n\t\tyour own wall. Outside of a life of adventure, this spell is powerful enough\n\t\tthat you could make a decent living in construction based on this spell\n\t\talone. If you ever decide to settle down, find somewhere with enough stone\n\t\tto anchor the spell and build yourself a nice stone house.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Gate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Far too situational to\n\t\tconsider.

You&#8217;ll be able to get more total damage from a normal AOE damage\n\t\tspell because you&#8217;ll likely be able to hit more targets, but that misses the\n\t\tprimary appeal of Chain Lightning. Chain Lightning is good because you can\n\t\tcast into a crowded area which might include your own allies without any\n\t\trisk of friendly fire. The spell level scaling adds additional targets\n\t\trather than additional damage, so you can easily cast this at a level that\n\t\thits exactly as many targets as you feel the need to hit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Circle of Death<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: 8d6 damage matches\n\t\tFireball, which is three spell levels lower. The big improvements are Circle\n\t\tof Death&#8217;s damage type and its absolutely massive 60-foot radius area of\n\t\teffect. With such a large area and a target-rich environment you could\n\t\teasily deal more total damage than with Fireball. The scaling is also\n\t\tunusually nice, adding 2 dice per spell level rather than 1 like most spells\n\t\tdo.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disintegrate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Among the most damaging\n\t\tsingle-target damage spells in the game, Disintegrate&#8217;s single-target damage\n\t\tis roughly equivalent to 21d6 (total average of 75). On a Dexterity save\n\t\tit&#8217;s tempting to use this against big, bulky foes who tend to have a lot of\n\t\thit points to burn though. Ideally you can save-or-suck those sorts of\n\t\tcreatures, but sometimes things like legendary resistances make that hard.\n\t\tYou can also use disintegrate to remove problematic things like walls of\n\t\tforce (or of anything else), allowing you to do things like toppling\n\t\tstructures or bursting through walls to surprise enemies on the other\n\t\tside.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eyebite<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you cast this, don&#8217;t\n\t\texpect to do anything else for the duration of the encounter. A save-or-suck\n\t\tto put targets to sleep every turn is hard to beat, and the fact that you\n\t\tcan do it every turn is spectacular. Sure, targets only remain asleep until\n\t\tthe spell ends, but that&#8217;s plenty of time for someone else in your party to\n\t\twalk over and deliver a guaranteed critical hit.

They could cast Counterspell at a spell level high enough\n\t\tto get through your globe, but they need to guess what spell level to use\n\t\tand they need to spend very high-level spell slots to do so. Even in fights\n\t\twith spellcasters who can cast 9th-level spell slots, you can cast this as a\n\t\t9th-level spell and use Counterspell against any 9th-level spells which they\n\t\tcast (though you&#8217;ll need to roll an ability check and hope for the best).\n\t\tThis spell also uniquely cripples warlocks, since their spell slots cap at\n\t\t5th level and they&#8217;re heavily reliant on cantrips. They can still use their\n\t\tMystic Arcanum unless you upcast Globe of Invulnerability, but they only get\n\t\t4 of those at most, and you&#8217;ve got plenty of spell slots for Counterspell.\n\t\tDespite all these strengths, you still need to be cautious: 1 minute is not\n\t\ta long time, and enemies can still move into the globe unimpeded and attack\n\t\tyou at point-blank range.

If you&#8217;ve\n\t\tbeen relying on minute meteors, it&#8217;s time to upgrade. Crown of Stars doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire Concentration, and with a 1-hour duration you get six times as long\n\t\tspend half as many projectiles. This may not be a go-to option for every\n\t\tspellcaster, but if you can set it up before you walk into a fight and if\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t normally have many uses for your Bonus Action, it&#8217;s a great boost\n\t\tto your damage output.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Delayed Blast Fireball<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational and\n\t\tpotentially very hard to use to its full effect, but if you can make it work\n\t\tthe maximum of 22d6 damage (avg. 77) is hard to beat. The hardest part of\n\t\tgetting this to work is charging it for a minute without enemies doing\n\t\tanything to stop you, either by breaking your Concentration or by meddling\n\t\twith the fireball. In some cases you may find that the fight is over or the\n\t\tcombatants have all relocated before you can trigger the effect. Possibly\n\t\tyour best option is for an ally who is exceptionally good at Dexterity\n\t\tsaving throws (especially if they can get Advantage and\/or some other buff\n\t\tlike Resistance or Bless) to grab the fireball and throw it the maximum of\n\t\t40 feet to trigger it somewhere more effective just before the spell&#8217;s\n\t\t1-minute duration expires.

The only problem is that you want to use this early\n\t\tin a fight where an area control spell or crowd control spell would be more\n\t\timmediately impactful.

The\n\t\tprimary appeal of Fire Storm over Fireball is that you can sculpt the AOE to\n\t\tavoid hitting your allies. But even then, Chain Lightning deals more damage\n\t\t(10d8, avg. 45) and hits four targets, so in many encounters that&#8217;s a better\n\t\toption. Fire Storm really shines against big crowds where the 10 10-foot\n\t\tcubes can catch a big number of enemies without affecting your allies.

Unfortunately, Plane Shift is very hard to use in combat\n\t\tbecause other creatures need to be holding hands in a circle. You also can&#8217;t\n\t\tgo directly to locations on the same plane, so you may need to find a\n\t\tconvenient place to stop on the way.

Targets which can&#8217;t grab onto\n\t\tsomething will be mostly helpless unless they can fly, and while flight is\n\t\tcommon at this level it&#8217;s not universal by any means.

It also has the added\n\t\tbenefit of not killing your party in small quarters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: There are several ways\n\t\tto use this spell, two of which were intended when the spell was designed.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Travel to another plane: The simplest option, you open a door and you\n\t\t\t\twalk through to another plane, leaving the gate open for up to a minute\n\t\t\t\tfor whoever else to walk through in either direction.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Summon a creature: If you know the name of a creature on another plane,\n\t\t\t\tyou can drag them (potentially against their will and without a save) to\n\t\t\t\tyour location. This is easy to abuse by going to a plane where you know\n\t\t\t\tthey aren&#8217;t (pocket dimensions work great for this, but there are so\n\t\t\t\tmany planes that it&#8217;s hard to accidentally be on the same one), then\n\t\t\t\tforcibly summon them. You could summon your biggest antagonist after\n\t\t\t\tspending a bunch of time setting up traps, buffs, and readied actions,\n\t\t\t\tthen have your party stomp them into the dirt. If you&#8217;re extra clever,\n\t\t\t\tyou can use Astral Projection to fight whatever you&#8217;re summoning while\n\t\t\t\tprojected so if something goes wrong you won&#8217;t actually die and you\n\t\t\t\tcould try again later. I think the intent of this function was to summon\n\t\t\t\tan ally to help you in a fight, but I think my idea is more useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>One-way cover: You can only enter the portal from the front, but it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tunclear what the back looks like or how it functions. It&#8217;s not described\n\t\t\t\tas solid, so it&#8217;s entirely possibly that you can fire projectiles\n\t\t\t\tthrough it from the rear, while projectiles from the front pass into the\n\t\t\t\tportal. I can&#8217;t imagine that you can see through the portal, so this may\n\t\t\t\tbe hard to do, but it may be possible. Check with your DM.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Magical drain: About to drown? About to hit by a flow of magma or\n\t\t\t\tfalling rocks? Open a gate to literally anywhere else and let the\n\t\t\t\toffending substance enjoy eternity floating in limbo or anywhere else\n\t\t\t\tthat isn&#8217;t a problem for you. The multiverse is your dumping ground.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Polymorph<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: You sacrifice the\n\t\tabsolute power of True Polymorph for the ability to affect up to 10\n\t\tcreatures. The rules for handling creatures with no CR (your party) are\n\t\twritten to make this really unappealing compared to True Polymorph. Compared\n\t\tto turning one ally into a CR 17+ dragon, turning up to 10 of your allies\n\t\tinto Tyrannosauruses (Tyrannosaurs? Tyrannosauri?) simply isn&#8217;t as\n\t\teffective, even if the phrase &#8220;I turn us and our horses into\n\t\ttyrannosauruses&#8221; is one of the coolest things I can think to say during a\n\t\tgame. Tragically, the targets assume the beast&#8217;s mental statistics, so\n\t\tturning your party of adventurers into toothy lizards may actually make them\n\t\tweaker.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can use the spell offensively and the targets don&#8217;t get saving throws\n\t\t\tbeyond the first, so turn your enemies into slugs or something and pitch\n\t\t\tthem into the plane of fire or somewhere equally unpleasant.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Meteor Swarm<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ultimate AOE damage\n\t\tspell, 40d6 is enough to level most buildings, and with a 40-foot radius and\n\t\ta staggering range of 1 mile you can lay siege to cities a safe distance.\n\t\tThe spell states that it only damages creatures, but according to Jeremy\n\t\tCrawford,\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/928007138458423296\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meteor Swarm damages objects<\/a\n\t\t>. The spell&#8217;s biggest problem is that all it does is damage. While damage\n\t\tis fantastic and it certainly does plenty of it, if you don&#8217;t outright kill\n\t\tyour targets you&#8217;ll still need to deal with them the next round. Also, keep\n\t\tin mind that targets can only be affected once, so don&#8217;t both making the\n\t\tspheres overlap.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Word Kill<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Outright kill the\n\t\ttarget, and their only way to resist is to have more than 100 hp (or\n\t\tCounterspell or something). Unfortunately, without a ton of metagaming it&#8217;s\n\t\tvery difficult to know if the target has less than 100 hit points. And, even\n\t\tif they do, Power Word Kill isn&#8217;t necessarily your best option. Meteor Swarm\n\t\tdeals an average of 140 damage, so if the target is at less than 100 hit\n\t\tpoints they&#8217;re in trouble anyway. Granted, you can&#8217;t Meteor Swarm someone\n\t\tacross a dinner table, but I think Meteor Swarm will be more reliable in\n\t\tmost situations where you need to end a life in the space of a few\n\t\tseconds.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Scream<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Up to 10 creatures\n\t\twithin 90 feet of you in any direction. Intelligence saves are the weakest\n\t\tsave on average, even for high-CR monsters, so in many cases you can Stun\n\t\tenemies and keep them stunned for an incredibly long time. There&#8217;s no\n\t\tduration on the stun effect, so enemies with poor Intelligence may be\n\t\t<em>permanently stunned<\/em>. The damage is fine, but that&#8217;s absolutely an\n\t\tafter-thought compared to the stun effect.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Time Stop<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: 1d4+1 turns in a row\n\t\tlets you do a lot to trivialize an encounter. If you want to be extra mean\n\t\tabout it, you could drop a Delayed Blast Fireball, wall off the area with\n\t\tsomething like Stone Shape, then teleport away.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wish<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The best spell in the\n\t\tgame, but also the most complicated. It&#8217;s literally so good that I won&#8217;t\n\t\trate anything else 9th-level as\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span> because nothing else can compete.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For more help with
