Many of these\n\tspells are critical to the success of an adventuring party, but the school\n\tabilities offer very little.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Energy resistance is nice,\n\tbut it can be hard to predict what you need. Since you&#8217;re an abjurer, you&#8217;re\n\tdefinitely going to have access to energy resistance spells, but this can save\n\tyou a spell. If you can&#8217;t pick an option on a given day, pick fire because\n\tit&#8217;s the most common. The immunity at level 20 is nice, but a little bit late\n\tto matter.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Protective Ward<\/span> (Su): Deflection bonuses are\n\tnice, but most characters will have a ring of protection. After very low\n\tlevels. The 10 foot range also means that you have to be right in the thick of\n\tcombat for this to have any effect.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Energy Absorption<\/span> (Su): Energy absorption\n\tallows you to resist any type of energy damage without needing to prepare for\n\tit beforehand. It&#8217;s a nice ability, but you shouldn&#8217;t ever need it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"banishment-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-red\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#banishment-school\"\n\t\t>Banishment School<\/a\n\t><\/h4\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The Banishment school is intended to handle summoned creatures. Because\n\tsummoning things is generally reserved for spellcasters and certain outsides,\n\tyour school powers will see very little use. In addition, they force you into\n\tuncomfortably close quarters with your enemies, which is never a good place\n\tfor a wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Powers: Energy Absorption and the Protective Ward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Unstable Bonds<\/span> (Su): As a melee touch attack,\n\tyou can partially disable a target creature. There is no save, which is nice,\n\tbut this is miles worse than the school power for Enchantment.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Banishment<\/span> (Su): If you are in a\n\tcampaign with a lot of summoners, this is worthwile. A fairly small portion of\n\tenemies rely on summoning multiple creatures, so this will not see frequent\n\tuse. If you need to get rid of a single creature, Banishment is a much better\n\toption.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"counterspell-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#counterspell-school\"\n\t\t>Counterspell School<\/a\n\t><\/h4\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterspelling is rarely a good option for a spellcaster, as any round that\n\tyou spend sitting around waiting to counterspell is another free round that\n\tyour enemies can do whatever they like. The Counterspell subschool offer a\n\tcouple of really good options for shutting down enemy spellcasters. If you are\n\tin a setting or game which features a large number of spellcasters, it&#8217;s very\n\teasy to find a place for the Counterspell Abjurer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Powers: Energy Absorption and the Protective Ward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disruption<\/span> (Su): If this didn&#8217;t require a\n\tmelee touch attack, it could easily be green. The concentration DC is\n\textremely high, and the duration on this effect may very well outlast a normal\n\tcombat at high levels. However, the round you use it is a round that you&#8217;re\n\tnot casting spells.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Counterspell Mastery<\/span> (Su): If you want to\n\tcounterspell things, you probably already have Improved Counterspell, so you\n\tbasically get a bonus feat. Allowing you to counterspell as an immediate\n\taction is the real ability here. The limited uses per day are dissappointing,\n\tbut if you consider spellcasters as a subset of all of the enemies you might\n\tface in a day, you probably have enough uses to change the outcome of a battle\n\tor two.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"conjuration-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-blue\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/classes\/wizard#conjuration-school\"\n\t\t>Conjuration School<\/a\n\t><\/h3\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Conjuration is one of the best schools. It features direct damage spells with\n\tno spell resistance, teleportation, summoning, and creation spells. At high\n\tlevels, summoning spells allow you to summon spellcasters to expand your\n\tspellcasting capacity, and you can even summons some creatures which have\n\tlimited healing abilities. The Conjuration school powers nicely supplement the\n\tschools abilities. With the wide range of creatures which you can summon, you\n\tcan do basically everything but hold a conversation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summoner&#8217;s Charm<\/span> (Su): One of the biggest\n\tlimitations on Summon Monster spells is their duration. Improving it by 50% is\n\thugely beneficial, especially at high level when your summons can cast\n\tspells.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Acid Dart<\/span> (Sp): This is better than the\n\tAcid Splash cantrip about 90% of the time. However, it&#8217;s a Spell-Like Ability,\n\twhich means that spell resistance applies. Acid Splash&#8217;s biggest draw is that\n\tit&#8217;s a conjuration spell so it doesn&#8217;t allow spell resistance. This is a weird\n\tirony, but rarely important. Having this ability largely supplants the need\n\tfor offensive cantrips, which opens up space for more interesting choices.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Steps<\/span> (Sp): Conjuration\n\tincludes teleportation, which gives you lots of options to get out of trouble.\n\tSince this is a standard action, it means moving instead of casting spells. In\n\tsome situations this is fine, but you will likely only use this in cases where\n\tyou are otherwise unable to cast spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"creation-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#creation-school\"\n\t\t>Creation School<\/a\n\t><\/h4\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on what your DM will let you make with creation spells, this can be\n\ta very powerful option. Theorycrafters and muchkins will generally suggest\n\tpoisons as an excellent option for creation spells, and so long as your DM\n\tallows it, poisons are a good choice. Creation effects can be very versatile\n\tin the hands of creative player, but this subschool&#8217;s effectiveness depends\n\theavily on your ability to be creative under pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Powers: Acid Dart and the Dimensional Steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Gear<\/span> (Su): The flavor on this\n\tability is cool, but the limitation on moving parts is dissappointing. If your\n\tDM is particularly flexible (read: &#8220;stupid&#8221;), you could use this to create\n\texpensive items like gold. You could also do something silly like creating\n\tpoison for your rogue, or create a bunch of oil and set it on fire. Get\n\tcreative, and see what your DM will let you get away with.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Creator&#8217;s Will<\/span> (Sp): You get the Minor\n\tCreation and Major Creation spells as spell-like abilities. You can cast the\n\tspells anyway, but the large number of uses is nice. Use creation to create\n\tpoisons, special ammunition, and other things which are expensive with limited\n\tuse. Or, create a giant ball of steel and roll it over your enemies. Again,\n\tsee what your DM will let you get away with.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"teleportation-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-blue\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#teleportation-school\"\n\t\t>Teleportation School<\/a\n\t><\/h4\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The teleportation school is a very small change from the Conjuration school.\n\tIt gives up the Acid Dart power for a swift action teleport ability. At high\n\tlevels where Acid Dart isn&#8217;t useful, Shift gets progressively more powerful,\n\tmaking this subschool a better option at higher levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Power: Acid Dart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shift<\/span> (Su): Teleport a few squares as a\n\tswift action. The range starts of at 5 feet, which is a swift action for a\n\tsecond 5 foot step. Even if I weren&#8217;t a wizard, I would be happy spending a\n\tswift action for a second 5 foot step.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"divination-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/classes\/wizard#divination-school\"\n\t\t>Divination School<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Forewarned ability is really the best part of this school. Despite how\n\tincredible it is, the rest of the school powers are highly situational, which\n\tseverely limits the school&#8217;s appeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Forewarned<\/span> (Su): Being able to act in every\n\tsurprise round means you get to cast an extra spell even if you are surprised.\n\tThe initiative bonus itself would probably make this ability blue.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Diviner&#8217;s Fortune<\/span> (Sp): The 1 round\n\tduration seems fairly limiting, so you probably won&#8217;t want to waste your time\n\tusing this in combat. Instead, use that insight bonus to buff your team for\n\timportant skill checks like disarming traps and opening locks. Insight bonuses\n\tare fairly rare, so this is easy to stack with other buffs.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scrying Adept<\/span> (Su): If you have recurring\n\tenemies, this could be bumped up to green. If you don&#8217;t have recurring\n\tenemies, it will be pretty rare for anyone to be scrying you, and you probably\n\twon&#8217;t have a lot of familiar enemies to scry on.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"foresight-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-blue\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#foresight-school\"\n\t\t>Foresight School<\/a\n\t><\/h4\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The Foresight subschool gives up the Divination school&#8217;s lousy higher level\n\tabilities in favor of two really amazing abilities. If you want to play a\n\tdiviner, this subschool is clearly the better option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Powers: Diviner&#8217;s Fortune and Scrying Adept.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prescience<\/span> (Su): The applications for this\n\tability are numerous. Roll it on turns you&#8217;re expecting to make a saving throw\n\tor a touch attack, and you can plan your turn before knowing the results. At\n\tworst, this is effectively a free reroll 3+int times per day.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Foretell<\/span> (Su): A +2 luck bonus to attacks\n\tand saving throws is absolutely incredible. Luck bonuses are among the rarest\n\tin the game, and allowing you to turn this ability on and off is like a power\n\tswitch for awesome. The 30 foot range is concerning, but for a luck bonus the\n\trisk is likely worth the reward.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"scryer-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#scryer-school\"\n\t\t>Scryer School<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sense Senses is potentially more useful than Diviner&#8217;s Fortune, but not\n\tnotably. This is really a side-step for the Diviner, but the potentially\n\tincreased awareness fits the school&#8217;s theme better than Diviner&#8217;s Fortune.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Powers: Diviner&#8217;s Fortune.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Send Senses<\/span> (Sp): Line of sight\n\tClaraudience\/Clairvoyance. With some clever use, this can be fairly helpful.\n\tHowever, you are completely shut down by something as simple as a door or a\n\tcurtain.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"enchantment-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-blue\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/classes\/wizard#enchantment-school\"\n\t\t>Enchantment School<\/a\n\t><\/h3\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enchanter is the ultimate save-or-suck caster. Every spell you cast\n\tshould have immediate and dramatic results, and will very often end a fight\n\twith a word and gesture. With some fairly simple trait and skill selections,\n\tyou can ever serve as the party&#8217;s face despite potentially terrible\n\tcharisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Enchanting Smile<\/span> (Su): A bonus to social\n\tskills is weird for a wizard. If you expend resources to be a face, this might\n\tactually be useful. But most likely, you won&#8217;t be doing a lot of Bluffing. The\n\tlevel 20 ability is fantastic, but won&#8217;t see a lot of use.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dazing Touch<\/span> (Sp): Dazed is a great status\n\tcondition and this power has no saving throws, but this is a\n\t<em>melee<\/em> touch attack, which you will be terrible at, and it only\n\taffects things with your hit dice of fewer, which is generally only going to\n\tNPCs or things with a CR lower than your level. Your familiar can&#8217;t deliver\n\tthe attack since it&#8217;s not a spell. It can be situationally useful if you get\n\tgrappled or if you ambush someone, but it&#8217;s not going to be your go-to\n\toptions.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Despair<\/span> (Su): The 30 foot range is\n\tproblematic, and the duration is fairly limited, but a -2 to saves against\n\teverything affected is brutal, The debuff matches the Shaken condition and\n\tstacks with it. If you can make a target Shaken, they&#8217;re looking at a total -4\n\tpenalty on saves against your absurd spell DCs. Sickened adds another -2.<\/p\n>\n<h5><span class=\"rating-blue\">Controller<\/span><\/h5>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Force of Will<\/span> (Su): You give up charming\n\tsmile for the ability to communicate with your charmed\/dominated targets\n\ttelepathically. This is great for communicating with subjects which don&#8217;t\n\tspeak common, and lets you boss things around without revealing that they&#8217;re\n\tcharmed\/dominated. You could even use Charm Person on your party members to\n\tset up a cheap telepathic communication system.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Irresistible Demand<\/span> (Sp): This is strictly\n\tworse than Dominate Monster, the duration is extremely limited, the save is\n\taverage, and you have to concentrate as a standard action to maintain the\n\teffect. However, it&#8217;s Dominate Monster at 8th level. With careful application,\n\tthis is a really fantastic way to mimic a 9th level spell for a few rounds.<\/p\n>\n<h5><span class=\"rating-red\">Manipulator<\/span><\/h5>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Beguiling Touch<\/span> (Sp): You trade in the\n\tmediocre Dazing Touch for the considerably worse Beguiling Touch. Beguiling\n\ttouch allows a save, has a very short duration, and doesn&#8217;t work in combat or\n\ton hostile creatures. If you really need to charm something, cast Charm Person\n\tor Charm Monster. You&#8217;re an enchanter, so you&#8217;re really good at those.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Shape Emotions<\/span> (Sp): You can now use your\n\taura to give your party a +4 bonus on saves against fear, or your can give\n\tenemies a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. The\n\tbonus against feat can be replaced with Remove Fear, the -2 penalty is worse\n\tthan the save penalty from Aura of Despair, <em>and<\/em> Aura of Despair\n\tapplies penalties to attacks, ability checks, and skill checks.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"evocation-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/classes\/wizard#evocation-school\"\n\t\t>Evocation School<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Evocation is the blunt hammer of magic. Straight damage lacks the elegance of\n\tless direct schools, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with the effectiveness of\n\tFireball. Most theorycrafters will decry that dealing damage is the less\n\teffective than save-or-suck spells, but evocation spells like fireball are\n\tbetter at handling crowds of enemies which save-or-suck spells typically have\n\ttrouble with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Intense Spells<\/span> (Su): If all you want is to\n\tdo damage, this ability is pretty fantastic. The ability notes that the damage\n\tonly applies once per spell, but fails to mention area of effect spells. Your\n\tDM may choose to apply the damage to everyone in an AOE (it&#8217;s only one damage\n\troll), or he may make you pick the recipient.

The effects are highly subjective, so your\n\teffectiveness is almost entirely dependant on how creative you and your DM\n\tare. Your DM needs to be very good at ignoring metagame knowledge in order to\n\tplay enemies correctly while illusions are in effect. Discuss this school with\n\tyour DM before you play, or you may find that your DM is unintentionally\n\truining your attempts at illusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extended Illusions<\/span> (Su): A lot of\n\tillusions have a duration of concentration, especially low levels ones. You\n\tmay not need this ability often, but it&#8217;s good for covering a getaway or\n\tmaintaining a distraction while you cast other spells.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Blinding Ray<\/span> (Sp): Blinding a target is\n\tpotentially crippling. If you have a rogue in your party, this is will get a\n\tlot of use. Keep in mind that it only meaningfully affects creatures with HD\n\tequal to or less than your wizard level, so you will need a fairly good\n\tknowledge of monster stats to use this reliably.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility Field<\/span> (Sp): Absolutely\n\tfantastic. In addition to the obvious stealth benefits, invisibility is great\n\tfor escaping melee, and for attacking creatures with high dexterity. Creatures\n\twhich are flat-footed to you will often have a touch AC of 10 (adjusted for\n\tsize and deflection), which can make them a great target for touch attacks\n\tlike your blinding ray or disintegrate.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"phantasm-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#phantasm-school\"\n\t\t>Phantasm School<\/a\n\t><\/h4\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The Phantasm subschool can be a lot of fun with a good rogue in your party,\n\tbut it doesn&#8217;t do much for you as a caster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Powers: Blinding Ray and Invisibility Field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Terror<\/span> (Su): This makes you weirdly good\n\tat flanking with a rogue, but you generally shouldn&#8217;t be in melee enough to\n\tmake use of this.

The ability to command additional undead is nice if you\n\tinvest in charisma, but your existing spellcasting ability should be more than\n\tenough without needing to invest in a dump stat.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Grave Touch<\/span> (Sp): If you are getting close\n\tenough to make a melee touch attack, you need a much better effect than\n\tShaken.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Life Sight<\/span> (Su): Life Sight is a really\n\tcool ability, but with such a short range and duration, it&#8217;s not going to help\n\tyou very much.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"life-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#life-school\"\n\t\t>Life School<\/a\n\t><\/h4\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is a very odd subschool. It forgoes all of the normal evilness\n\tassociated with Necromancy, and gives you some fairly fantastic healing\n\tpowers. If your party is short on healing, this is a really great option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Powers: Power Over Undead and Grave Touch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Healing Grace<\/span> (Su): A fairly limited amount\n\tof healing, but real healing effects are incredibly rare for wizards. Note\n\tthat this applies to <em>all<\/em> of your spells, so you can heal people while\n\tcasting buff spells, or you can heal them if they get caught in one of your\n\tattack spells. You can even target yourself, which plays nicely into Share\n\tEssence.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Share Essence<\/span> (Sp): You can take nonlethal\n\tdamage to give your team temporary hit points, potentially preventing real\n\tdamage. I would use this before every fight. Keep in mind that healing damage\n\theals an equal amount of nonlethal damage, so if you take a little damage\n\tduring the fight, you can remove the whole deal with fairly little effort.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"undead-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#undead-school\"\n\t\t>Undead School<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Replacing Grave Touch makes the Necromancy school a bit more playable. The\n\tUndead subschool still isn&#8217;t fantastic, but if your DM lets you have undead\n\tpets in the party, bolster makes them considerably more powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Power: Grave Touch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bolster<\/span> (Sp): This provides some pretty nice\n\tbenefits to an undead. If you use Create Undead (and you probably should as a\n\tnecromancer) or anything of the sort, this is miles better than Grave Touch.\n\tThe uses are still limited, so save it for your favorite pet instead of trying\n\tto spam it on every skeleton you&#8217;re dragging around.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"transmutation-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/classes\/wizard#transmutation-school\"\n\t\t>Transmutation School<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The transmutation school is complex to play. Transmutation includes many\n\texcellent buff and debuff spells, and also includes the iconic Polymorph\n\tspells. If you&#8217;re planning to play a Transmuter, you are likely looking to\n\tplay a Polymorpher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards only have d6 hit points, and you will need good scores in all of your\n\tphysical abilities to do anything useful while shapeshifted. At low levels\n\tbefore you get Beast Shape, you&#8217;re going to be fairly useless since you&#8217;ll\n\thave to rely on non-transmutation spells or (gods forbid) using a weapon in\n\tcombat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Physical Enhancement<\/span> (Su): The bonus is\n\tcertainly nice, and it greatly reduces the amount of money you need to spend\n\ton a belt. I would recommend constitution since your hit points are terrible,\n\tand transmuters spend a lot of time pretending to be a melee monster.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Fist<\/span> (Sp): Not spectacular\n\tcompared to similar school powers, but it&#8217;s bludgeoning damage so you don&#8217;t\n\thave to worry about energy resistance. It also provides you with a combat\n\toption at low levels before you can Polymorph.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Change Shape<\/span> (Sp): Some extra free\n\tshapeshifting. The duration is pretty short, so you&#8217;ll probably want to save\n\tthis for moving about as something with a special movement type, like flying\n\tacross a chasm or digging through the wall of a tunnel.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h4><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enhancement School<\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enhancement subschool suffers from duration issues.

At those times, buff your strength a\n\twhole bunch and stomp on someone. This couples well with Polymorphing into\n\tsomething with Pounce.<\/p\n>\n<h4><span class=\"rating-green\">Shapechange School<\/span><\/h4>\n<p\n\t>The Shapechange subschool trades your low level attack option for the ability\n\tto gain additional natural attacks.

Turn into a Dire Tiger and get a gore attack.\n\tLosing telekinetic fist hurts at low levels, especially due to your limited\n\tcombat options at low level, but this can do some great things for you once\n\tyou can Polymorph.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"universalist-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/classes\/wizard#universalist-school\"\n\t\t>Universalist School<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite fairly unexciting powers, the Universalist school is still a\n\tfantastic go-to option. The simple utility of having every wizard spell easily\n\tavailable makes the universalist a solid option in any situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hand of the Apprentice<\/span> (Su): For a\n\tstraight wizard, this is the worst of the comparable school attack powers. The\n\tdamage is comparable if you use a staff or club, but you have to hit their\n\tnormal AC. At low levels you can potentially rely on your high intelligence to\n\tovercome their AC, but your garbage BAB is going to cause this ability to fall\n\toff sharply. If you&#8217;re going for Eldritch Knight, this may retain some\n\tusefulness, especially if you get a decent weapon to throw around.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Metamagic Mastery<\/span> (Su): Using more powerful\n\tmetamagic feats requires addiitonal daily uses, so Quicken and Maximize\n\trequire 4 daily uses, which you won&#8217;t get until level 14. However, the amount\n\tof versatility offer by the power is certainly impressive.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"air-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#air-school\"\n\t\t>Air School<\/a\n\t><\/h3\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The mobility provided by Air Supremecy is incredibly useful at high level,\n\tespecially since it can&#8217;t be dispelled.

The cyclone power also gives you\n\tan excellent air supremacy option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Air Supremacy<\/span> (Su): Levitate at 5th level\n\tis cool if you want to be a motionless floating target, but permanent fly at\n\tlevel 10 is fantastic. Overland flight is fine for most people, but this saves\n\tyou a mid level spell slot and gives you much better speed.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Lightning Flash<\/span> (Su): This is a panic option.\n\tIf you&#8217;re ever surrounded and can&#8217;t get away, this may deter some low level\n\tfoes. The dazzled effect is totally negligible, and the damage is small, so\n\tdon&#8217;t go looking to use this.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cyclone<\/span> (Su): Shot down anything that flies.\n\tVery few flying creatures (except dragons) will have enough strength to\n\treliably pass the DC here, and you can do a ridiculous amount of falling\n\tdamage with this power.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"earth-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-orange\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#earth-school\"\n\t\t>Earth School<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Earth school doesn&#8217;t have a lot of cool spells to draw on, and its\n\tabilities are fairly bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Supremacy<\/span> (Su): You should never be the\n\ttarget of any of these combat maneuvers. That&#8217;s the fighter&#8217;s job. The 20th\n\tlevel ability is pretty cool, and lets you do fun things like stone shape\n\tpeople into a box, then throw fireballs into it.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Acid Cloud<\/span> (Su): The only real nice thing\n\tabout this power is that it lasts for a round, which provides a small area\n\tcontrol effect. The damage is what you would expect from a school power, and\n\tsickened is a decent status condition, but the ability only affecs adjacent\n\tsqures so you don&#8217;t want to use this directly.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth Glide<\/span> (Su): A lousy version of\n\tpasswall.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fire-school\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/coreClasses\/wizard#fire-school\"\n\t\t>Fire School<\/a\n\t><\/h3\n>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be a blaster spellcaster, but don&#8217;t want to give up schools to\n\tbe an evoker, this is the way to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire Supremacy<\/span> (Su): This is basically the\n\tAbjuration school&#8217;s energy resistance ability, but it only applies to fire.
