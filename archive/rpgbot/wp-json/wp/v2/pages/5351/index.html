In the core rulebook, the Rogue was the unmatched master of stealth, skill, and surprise attacks. Over time these masteries have been eclipsed by other classes which overcame a lot of the issues which Rogues faces in core. The Unchained Rogue addresses many of Rogue&#8217;s biggest pain points, and gives the Rogue enough new and unique abilities to make it interesting in the face of all of the other exciting base classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the Unchained Rogue.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-new\">What&#8217;s New?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Unchained Rogue has some shiny new abilities added or reworked from the vanilla Rogue. Here&#8217;s a quick list of the new\/updated features, but see &#8220;Unchained Rogue Class Features&#8221; below for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Finesse Training<\/strong>: Removes the Weapon Finesse feat tax.<\/li><li><strong>Updated Talents<\/strong>: Many Rogue Talents have gotten an update.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Danger Sense<\/strong>: An improved version of Trap Sense, which has always been a throw-away ability.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Debilitating Injury<\/strong>: A fun rider effect on top of Sneak Attack which gives the rogue some tactical options beyond &#8220;do damage&#8221;.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Rogue&#8217;s Edge<\/strong>: Allows the Rogue to take advantage of the new &#8220;Skill Unlocks&#8221;.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Rogue Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: At d8 hit points, the Rogue is\n\tfairly squishy. Because many Rogues work best in melee, hit points are a\n\tserious concern and Rogues need to be sure to keep their AC high.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB is difficult\n\tbecause many Rogues depend on two-weapon fighting, but flanking and high\n\tDexterity can make up the deficit. Debilitating Injury also allow you debuff\n\tand enemy&#8217;s AC, which can go a long way to compensate for your relatively low\n\tBAB.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Good Reflex saves, high Dexterity,\n\tand Evasion make the Rogue exceptionally good at Reflex saves, but they often\n\thave issues with Fortitude and Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Limited to simple weapons,\n\thand crossbows, and a handful of martial weapons, Rogues have very few\n\toptions. Fortunately, they get all of the ones that they really need to get\n\tby.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: 8+ skill ranks and the longest class\n\tskill list in the game. Rogues can do a lot of things, but even with 8+ skill\n\tranks it can still be difficult to cover all of the essentials. Be sure to\n\tcoordinate with your party to know you&#8217;re going to need to invest your skill\n\tranks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span>: A pile of d6&#8217;s to drop on your\n\tfoes. Sneak Attack is the Rogue&#8217;s primary source of damage, but because it can\n\tbe hard to bring into play, Rogues occasionally find themselves useless in\n\tcombat. Unchained Rogue&#8217;s version of Sneak Attack notably allows you to Sneak\n\tAttack targets with concealment, though you still can&#8217;t Sneak Attack creatures\n\twith total concealment.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trapfinding<\/span>: The bonus to disarming traps\n\tis good, but the ability to disarm magical traps is the key component of this\n\tfeature.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Finesse Training<\/span> (Ex): One of the most\n\timportant additions to the Unchained Rogue, Finesse Training give you Weapon\n\tFinesse for free at first level, and an effect similar to Slashing Grace at\n\t3rd level. Ranged Rogues will mostly only see this as a fun backup ability\n\twhen they&#8217;re forced into melee, but melee Rogues will save themselves a\n\trequired feat, and the 3rd-level ability nets them a massive boost to\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): With your high reflex saves,\n\tEvasion will save you from a lot of damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue Talents<\/span>: Basically Rogue-only feats,\n\tRogue Talents offer a huge number of excellent ways to customize and improve\n\tyour Rogue. For help picking talents, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/unchained_rogue\/talents\">Unchained Rogue Talents Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Danger Sense<\/span> (Ex): A minor improvement\n\tover Trap Sense, but the bonus is small and scales very slowly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Debilitating Injury<\/span> (Ex): A fantastic rider\n\teffect which you add to your Sneak Attacks. Remember that you can only apply\n\tone penalty to a target at a time, but your successive attacks will each add\n\tan additional round to the duration, which gives you some nice padding if you\n\tcan&#8217;t hit the target for a round or two for some reason, or if you change\n\ttargets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bewildered<\/span>: This will be the lion&#8217;s share\n\t\tof your Debilitating Injuries. TWF Rogues will find this especially helpful\n\t\tbecause the AC penalty offsets the TWF attack penalty. At high levels when\n\t\tyou get iterative attacks, the scaling penalty will offset the relative -5\n\t\tbonus on your iterative attacks. Your allies only benefit from -2 to the\n\t\ttargets AC, but that&#8217;s a nice bonus, especially when combined with\n\t\tflanking.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disoriented<\/span>: If you&#8217;re fighting an enemy\n\t\tby yourself, or if the enemy isn&#8217;t focusing on your flanking partner, this\n\t\tis a great way to keep yourself alive. If you&#8217;re not having any issues\n\t\thitting, this is a good option when Bewildered isn&#8217;t doing anything\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hampered<\/span>: Because combat is very static\n\t\tin Pathfinder, this will rarely be important, but it&#8217;s a great option when\n\t\tyou need to run away or keep an enemy from charging your squishy allies or\n\t\trunning away from you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: The ability to never be\n\tcaught flat-footed is nice, but somewhat situational. If you are expecting to\n\tbe attacked, you can do silly things like using Full Defense every round until\n\tyou get attacked.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: This will basically\n\tnever come up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Talents<\/span>: Add an extra list of\n\tconsiderably better Rogue Talents.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Master Strike<\/span>: Basically the Assassin&#8217;s\n\tDeath Strike ability. This ability is fine, but Ninjas and Slayers can take it\n\tas a talent at level 11.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compatible-archetypes\">Compatible Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Because the Unchained Rogue&#8217;s abilities are mostly the same as the vanilla Rogue&#8217;s, most Rogue archetypes are compatible. The only questionable part is the change from Trap Sense to Danger Sense. Because Danger Sense is strictly better than Trap Sense (it&#8217;s Trap Sense with an additional Perception bonus), any reasonable GM should allow you to use Danger Sense in place of Trap Sense because you&#8217;re giving up more for the same benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Rogue Archetypes, see my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/archetypes\">Rogue Archetypes Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Rogue is very frequently MAD, especially if the party has very few other skills and no Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Only useful for a bit of damage until\n\tyou hit level 3. Dump to 8, but don&#8217;t dump to 7 unless you really need the\n\textra points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: In light armor, Dexterity is absolutely\n\tcrucial. All but the strangest Rogue builds depend on Weapon Finesse or ranged\n\tweapons, so make sure to put a lot of resources into dexterity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential for Fortitude saves and hit\n\tpoints, especially if you&#8217;re in melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Essential for skill ranks. 8+ seems\n\tlike a lot, but it&#8217;s nowhere near enough.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Essential for Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: A little bit of Charisma is great if\n\tyou plan to play a Face, but otherwise you can dump Charisma to 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 18<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 11<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 17<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 11<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 10<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 13<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Dexterity are essential, and bonuses to Intelligence or skills are nice too. Darkvision is especially nice at low levels before you can get Darkvision from spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarf<\/span>: Not particularly well-suited to the\n\tRogue, but Darkvision is certainly tempting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Bonuses to Dexterity and Intelligence\n\tare fantastic, and some of the Elf&#8217;s other racial abilities are helpful. The\n\tElf favored class bonus adds additional uses to the minor magic and major\n\tmagic talents, but unless you really plan to use those talents it won&#8217;t\n\tmatter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: The penalty to strength hurts our\n\tdamage a little bit, but small size doesn&#8217;t hurt rogues much, and provides\n\tnice bonuses to Stealth, attacks, and AC. The bonus Charisma helps a bit,\n\tthough not as much as a bonus to dexterity. The slow speed also hurts a bit,\n\tbut can be overcome with items, and careful positioning.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability score bonus\n\tgoes into Dexterity, but many of the other racial traits can be swapped out\n\tfor more useful options. The Half-Elf favored class bonus is garbage, so take\n\tthe Elf or Human favored class bonuses instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The flexible ability score bonus\n\tgoes into Dexterity, the bonus to Intimidate is a nice perk, and you get\n\tDarkvision. The favored class bonus is garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: Bonuses to Dexterity and Charisma\n\tmake the Halfling a natural Rogue. The Fleet of Foot alternate racial trait\n\tallows you to overcome the slow speed, and the bonus to Perception is welcome\n\ton any character. The bonus to saves also helps improve the Rogue&#8217;s weak\n\tdefenses. Unfortunately, the favored class bonus is terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: As usual, the Human is a great\n\toption. A bonus feat and an extra skill rank per level open up a ton of great\n\toptions, and the flexible ability score bonus can go right into Dexterity. The\n\tfavored class bonus grants additional Rogue Talents, which adds a lot of great\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hidden Hand<\/span> (Combat): Especially useful\n\t\tif you multiclass into Assassin or otherwise gain a Death Attack ability\n\t\twhich is typically used during a surprise round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): Initiative bonuses\n\t\tare great for Rogues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient<\/span> (Combat): Bonus to a bad\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Indomitable Faith<\/span> (Faith): Bonus to a bad\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspired<\/span> (Faith): Since Rogues spend so\n\t\tmuch time using skills, you have a lot of opportunities to use this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magical Talent<\/span> (Magic): If you plan to\n\t\tpick up the Minor\/Major Magic talents, this fits very well thematically.\n\t\tPick up a utility option like Mage Hand or Prestidigitation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pragmatic Activator<\/span> (Magic): If you&#8217;re not\n\t\ta Face, but you still want to use UMD, this can get a you a huge bonus by\n\t\tignoring your 7 Charisma in favor of your high Intelligence.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Life of Toil<\/span> (Social): Bonus to a bad\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Forlorn<\/span> (Elf Racial): Bonus to a bad\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elven Reflexes<\/span> (Half-Elf Racial): The same\n\t\teffect as Reactionary, but doesn&#8217;t take up your Combat trait.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Great to move around in\n\t\tcombat without getting killed.

If you combine this\n\t\twith Agile maneuvers and Surprise Maneuver, you might be able to make this\n\t\twork.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: TWF Rogues have been a\n\t\tstaple for a long time, and for good reason. Rogues have little use for\n\t\tshields, and two attacks means two piles of Sneak Attack damage.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-red\">Double Slice<\/span>: Worthless.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Two-Weapon Rend<\/span>: Your damage from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSneak Attack will completely eclipse this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: 4 total\n\t\t\t\tattacks can mean a huge amount of damage.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith 2\/3 BAB and TWF penalties, it&#8217;s very difficult for a Rogue to\n\t\t\t\t\t\thit with their third iterative attacks, so it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto skip this feat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Two-Weapon Defense<\/span>: Dodge is strictly\n\t\t\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: You get it for free!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dagger<\/span>: A good choice for two-weapon\n\t\tfighting and for throwing. Finesse Training can only give you dexterity\n\t\tdamage to melee damage, but that makes the dagger an excellent option for\n\t\tranged or melee builds because it&#8217;s so easy to switch from melee to\n\t\tranged.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hand Crossbow<\/span>: Cool, but not very\n\t\teffective. You can dual-wield hand crossbows, but you will need to class dip\n\t\tinto Alchemist or Witch to get something which allows you reload while\n\t\tdual-wielding.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Crossbow<\/span>: A good ranged option, and\n\t\tit doesn&#8217;t care about your Halfling Rogue&#8217;s 5 Strength.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rapier<\/span>: Critical threats aren&#8217;t very\n\t\timportant to Rogues, but the rapier is the biggest melee weapon available to\n\t\tthe Rogue. If you plan to use two-weapon fighting, skip this so that you can\n\t\tuse Finesse Training&#8217;s damage bonus on both weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shortsword<\/span>: The dagger&#8217;s damage is only\n\t\tslightly lower, and daggers are considerably more versatile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shortbow<\/span>: The obvious choice for archery\n\t\tRogues, but remember that Strength penalties apply to bow damage, so a\n\t\tcrossbow may be a good choice instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Studded Leather<\/span>: Your starting point.\n\t\tThis should last through early levels. Don&#8217;t bother enhancing because you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing to get a Mithral Shirt pretty quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Masterwork Buckler<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using a\n\t\tranged weapon or doing two-weapon fighting, a masterwork buckler offers a\n\t\tcheap way to boost your AC if you&#8217;re willing to pay the -1 penalty to\n\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Darkwood Heavy Shield<\/span>: If you&#8217;re in\n\t\tmelee using a single weapon, a Darkwood Heavy Shield has no armor check\n\t\tpenalty, so it&#8217;s a cheap and easy way to boost your AC without cutting into\n\t\tyour damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Shirt<\/span>: Mithral Shirt will be your\n\t\tbest bet for AC until your Dexterity bonus hits +10, which will be extremely\n\t\thigh level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haramaki<\/span>: Strictly better than padded\n\t\tarmor. With no maximum dexterity bonus, you can afford to make your\n\t\tDexterity absurdly high without restriction, and can still keep enhancing\n\t\tyour armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Armor<\/span>: A wand of Mage Armor gets you\n\t\t+4 AC for an hour at a time. For the same 9150gp for +3 Haramaki, you can\n\t\tbuy 12 wands, netting you a total of 600 hours of mage armor. If you have a\n\t\twizard in the party, buy them a pearl of power 1 for 1000gp, and they can\n\t\tget you hours\/level of mage armor for essentially nothing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\">Dagger of Doubling<\/a> (10,302 gp): If you&#8217;re going\n\t\tfor a thrown weapon build, this is your best bet. Pick up Quick Draw and\n\t\tduplicate the daggers after each attack. Unfortunately you won&#8217;t be able to\n\t\tgo past +1 without your DM allowing you enhance the weapon beyond its\n\t\tdefault stats, but without this your best bet is buying dozens of +1 daggers\n\t\tanyway, so you come out ahead either way.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\">Sword of Subtlety<\/a> (22,310 gp): Very pricey,\n\t\tbut a +4 to attacks and damage makes this effectively a +5 weapon for\n\t\tslightly more than the price of a +3. Certainly not a go-to option, but nice\n\t\tif you have someone in the party to craft one for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armorshields\">Armor\/Shields<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animated Shield<\/span> (+2): It may be\n\t\tdifficult to find time to activate your animated shield because rogues lean\n\t\tso heavily on full attack actions. Still, it can be a very welcome AC boost\n\t\tfor melee rogues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Armor<\/span> (22,400 gp): Unless you\n\t\thave heavy armor proficiency <em>and<\/em> a Dexterity modifier of at most\n\t\t+5, Celestial Armor is the best armor in the game if all you need from your\n\t\tarmor is AC.
