There are a few spells\n\t\tthat are only on the Cleric&#8217;s spell list if you use the expanded spell list\n\t\tOptional Class Feature, but they aren&#8217;t nearly good enough to justify\n\t\tcomitting your subrace to get them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Hospitality<\/span>: A handful of useful\n\t\toptions from the Druid and the Wizard&#8217;s spell lists, but the skills and\n\t\tinnate spellcasting aren&#8217;t great, and there aren&#8217;t enough new spells to make\n\t\tthis a good option.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-default\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Default Rules<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Healing<\/span>: Thematically it makes\n\t\tsense, and an extra free use of both Cure Wounds and Lesser Restoration are\n\t\tnice, but with the exception of the three aura spells everything is taken\n\t\tfrom the Cleric&#8217;s spell list. If you just want a healbot this is a fine\n\t\toption, but it doesn&#8217;t actually expand your capabilities beyond what you\n\t\tcould already do.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Hospitality<\/span>: Bad ability\n\t\tspread.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"races-dragonmarked-human\">Dragonmarked Human<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW<\/a><\/sup><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Dragonmark traits replace ALL of your normal racial traits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-custom\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Customized Origin<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Mark of Finding<\/span>: See Mark of Finding under\n\t\tDragonmarked Half-Orc, above. Mechanically, the final racial traits are\n\t\tidentical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Handling<\/span>: You get several\n\t\toptions from the Druid and Ranger&#8217;s spell lists, but the over-emphasis on\n\t\tbeasts can be a problem if you get past level 10 where beasts generally stop\n\t\tappearing as threats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Making<\/span>: Several useful options\n\t\tfrom the Wizard&#8217;s spell list. This combines will both thematically and\n\t\tmechanically with the Arcana Domain and the Knowledge Domain.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: Significantly improve\n\t\taccess to teleportation option which the Cleric normally doesn&#8217;t get. Misty\n\t\tStep is obviously a big gain, but if that&#8217;s all you want you can get that\n\t\tfrom the Eladrin or the Shadar-Kai.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mark of Sentinel<\/span>: There&#8217;s a lot to like\n\t\there. Bonuses on two excellent Wisdom-based skills, great options for\n\t\tdefending both yourself and your allies from attacks, and some new spells\n\t\twhich will help you protect allies in combat. Compelled Duel will force\n\t\tenemies to attack you, and Counterspell will allow you to respond to enemy\n\t\tspellcasters. There are some dragonmark spells already available to the\n\t\tCleric, but the rest of the benefits are still good enough to make this a\n\t\tgreat choice.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-default\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Default Rules<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Mark of Finding<\/span>: See Mark of Finding under\n\t\tDragonmarked Half-Orc, above.

Unfortunately, many of\n\t\tthe dragonmark spells are already on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Making<\/span>: The ability score\n\t\tincreases aren&#8217;t great, but the spellcasting offers several new ways to buff\n\t\tyour allies. Thematically this is a great combination with the Forge\n\t\tDomain.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: Dexterity and Wisdom can\n\t\tbe a difficult combination for clerics, but if you&#8217;re building a\n\t\tDexterity-based cleric Mark of Passage has a lot to offer. Nearly every one\n\t\tof the dragonmark spells is new to the Cleric&#8217;s spell list, and the spells\n\t\tare mostly teleportation and movement spells which will help you address\n\t\tchallenges which most clerics can&#8217;t solve with magic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Sentinel<\/span>: Great ability scores,\n\t\tand some really great abilities for a protective, tanky cleric.\n\t\tUnfortunately you don&#8217;t get an increase to Strength or Dexterity, so expect\n\t\tto rely on cantrips in combat even if you&#8217;re in melee, but with options like\n\t\tCompelled Duel you can draw a lot of attention away from your allies.\n\t\tUnfortunately, many of the dragonmark spells are already on the Cleric&#8217;s\n\t\tspell list, so you don&#8217;t gain as much from Mark of Sentinel as other\n\t\tspellcasters do.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lineages\">Lineages<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Published in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything and beyond, no Lineage exists prior to the introduction of the Customizing Your Origin rules, and as such each lineage has flexible ability score increases.

While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait. Despite selecting a base race, you do not count as a member of your race for the purposes of any other effect, such as qualifying for feats or using magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-custom-lineage\" class=\"rating-blue\">Custom Lineage<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A +2 increase, a feat, and either Darkvision or a skill.

Of course, if you take\n\tflight, Spider Climb barely matters, so the Dhampir is Basically just a worse\n\tversion of the Winged Tiefling for the Cleric&#8217;s purposes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Vampiric Bite offers a weapon option without requiring you invest in Strength\n\tor Dexterity, but even with that benefit the Cleric still isn&#8217;t very good with\n\tweapons. The math still dramatically favors using cantrips. Vampiric Bite&#8217;s\n\tability to empower your ability checks and attack roles only cares about the\n\tpiercing damage dealt, so Divine Strike doesn&#8217;t add to the effect.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-hexblood\" class=\"rating-orange\">Hexblood<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>Ancestral Legacy (two skills or a movement speed), Darkvision, and some magical utility options which could be useful.
