The Ranger thrives as a Scout and Striker, and can provide some Support capabilities depending on their choice of class feats. The Ranger has ample skills, gaining more base skill proficiencies at 1st level than any class except the Rogue, which leaves ample room to fill other roles in the party based solely on your skills. With the right skills and ability scores, the Ranger can serve as a Librarian or as a Face, though you won&#8217;t be able to compete with classes which provide Class Feats for those skillsets or which use Intelligence or Charisma as their Key Ability Score.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you are familiar with the Ranger from 1st edition Pathfinder or from any edition of DnD, there is a lot here that is different. While the core concept of the Ranger is still the same, a lot has changed here. You can still have an animal companion, and two-weapon fighting and archery builds are still great, but PF2&#8217;s rangers don&#8217;t have spellcasting, and core features like Favored Enemy and Favored Terrain have been made into class feats so you&#8217;re no longer locked into them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more novel changes which Paizo has made to the ranger between editions of Pathfinder is granting the Ranger a number of support features, allowing them to share the benefits of their signature Hunt Prey and Hunter&#8217;s Edge features with their allies. You can do this with your Animal Companion, but the Ranger Class Feats which grant these support options can apply to any of your allies, so if you have another capable martial ally in the party like a fighter or a rogue you can act as a significant force multiplier, boosting their effectiveness considerably by sharing your own capabilities temporarily. That should by no means discourage you from investing in an Animal Companion, because the Ranger has several great and unique ways to do so, but it&#8217;s an interesting and refreshing concept to let the ranger play a supporting role without relying on magic or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>One of the stranger things about Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s Ranger is the use of the word &#8220;warden&#8221;. In the Core Rulebook, there&#8217;s a Warden feat chain starting with Monster Hunter and Monster Warden. Confusingly, the new feats published in the Advanced Player&#8217;s Guide introduced the Ranger&#8217;s first Focus Spells, which are called &#8220;Warden Spells&#8221; for reasons that I can&#8217;t divine. That confusing reuse of terminology will undoubtedly lead to growing confusion in online discussions, so I recommend referring to the warden feats and builds using the term &#8220;Monster Warden&#8221; and the feats and builds related to Focus Spells using the tern &#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;. If we safely use the word &#8220;Warden&#8221; without confusion, we shouldn&#8217;t use it at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Ranger Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-skill-feats\">General Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ranger-feats\">Ranger Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ranger-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#weapons-archery\">Archery Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-crossbow\">Crossbow Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-two-handed\">Two-Handed Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-two-weapon\">Two-Weapon Fighting Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-other\">Other Weapon Options<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells\">Ranger Focus Spells &#8211; Warden Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Ranger Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Strength or Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: 10+ hit points matches martial\n\tclasses like the Champion and the Fighter, but without heavy armor and Armor\n\tSpecialization Effects, you&#8217;re not quite as durable as those classes but the\n\tRanger is still perfectly capable of standing on the front lines, especially\n\twith an Animal Companion to support them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Ranger isn&#8217;t the\n\tbest at anything (though they get the best Class DC progression and use it for\n\tnearly nothing), but they&#8217;re good at <em>everything<\/em>. They&#8217;re a\n\tspectacularly versatile class capable of a wide variety of builds and roles,\n\tand their initial proficiencies do a lot to support that.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span>: The Ranger starts at Expert\n\t\tin Perception, and advances nearly as quickly as the Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: The Ranger&#8217;s Fortitude and\n\t\tReflex saves are fine, but their Will saves are among the worst, and without\n\t\ta class dependency on Wisdom it&#8217;s easy to accidently dump your Will\n\t\tsaves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 6+ skills, so the\n\t\tRanger matches the Swashbuckler and has more base skills than any class\n\t\texcept the Rogue, though the Ranger gets skill increases and skill feats at\n\t\tthe same speed as everyone else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attacks<\/span>: Your weapon proficiencies\n\t\tadvance as quickly as other martial classes like the Barbarian and the\n\t\tChampion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defenses<\/span>: Light and Medium armor, and\n\t\tyour proficiency advances as quickly as the Fighter&#8217;s. You never get access\n\t\tto Armor Specialization Effects, so there&#8217;s nothing compelling you to wear\n\t\theavier armor than you need.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: The Ranger matches the best Class DC progression\n\t\tin the game, but they use it for nearly nothing. It applies to Critical\n\t\tSpecialization Effects, and you can use it for Snare DC&#8217;s if you take Ranger\n\t\tExpertise, but without taking an archetype there&#8217;s nothing else.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunt Prey<\/span>: On its own, Hunt Prey doesn&#8217;t do\n\tmuch. However, it allows you to use Hunter&#8217;s Edge and many Ranger Class Feats\n\tagainst your Hunted Prey. As you gain levels, you&#8217;ll gain access to Class\n\tFeats which add to the effects and which allow you to target multiple foes\n\tand\/or share the benefits of Hunt Prey with your allies. Hunt Prey is a\n\tcentral mechanic of the Ranger, both in and out of combat, so understanding\n\thow it works is crucial to playing the Ranger well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of your career, Hunt Prey takes 1 Action and targets a single creature. The bonuses you get from Hunt Prey, including things like Hunter&#8217;s Edge, are significant and can improve as you add class feats. If you can, try to use it outside of combat to save yourself the Action when a fight breaks out, but remember that you&#8217;ll likely want to pick new prey as soon as your existing prey is dealt with. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to kill your target before changing prey: incapacitating them, causing them to flee, or any other means of making them no longer a threat is sufficient that you can justify changing targets in many cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Hunter&#8217;s Edge<\/span>: Hunter&#8217;s Edge defines your\n\tviable build options in much the same way that other classes&#8217; subclasses do.\n\tFlurry and Precision emphasize very different ways to fight, and therefore\n\tdifferent ways to build your character. Outwit takes much of the emphasis off\n\tof offense, and places it on skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that if you take an Animal Companion, your Animal Companion also gains the benefit of your Hunter&#8217;s Edge, so it&#8217;s often helpful to plan your companion and your Hunter&#8217;s Edge at the same time to ensure that they work well together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry<\/span>: Generally your go-to option. PF2\n\t\trelies heavily on characters making multiple Strikes in a turn, and Ranger\n\t\tClass Feats like Hunted Shot and Twin Takedown allow you to make as many as\n\t\tfour Strikes in a turn, so reducing your Multiple Attack Penalty pays off\n\t\tvery quickly. This is the go-to option for most rangers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Precision<\/span>: A good option for builds which\n\t\taren&#8217;t making huge numbers of attacks per turn, like two-handed weapon\n\t\tbuilds, crossbow builds, and sword-and-board builds. This is also a good\n\t\toption for Animal Companion builds because your Animal Companion only gets\n\t\ttwo Actions per turn (unless you use Companion&#8217;s Cry), so they won&#8217;t get\n\t\tmuch out of Flurry. The damage is significant, especially at low levels, and\n\t\tthe scaling is decent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Outwit<\/span>: The best option for a skill-based\n\t\tranger, the bonuses to skills are easy to apply even in social situations\n\t\tbecause Hunt Prey doesn&#8217;t have visual or audio components, so targets won&#8217;t\n\t\tknow that you&#8217;re using it. You can use it on your friends, and they&#8217;ll never\n\t\tknow unless you tell them. The AC bonus is a Circumstance bonus, so it won&#8217;t\n\t\tstack with weapons with the Parry trait or with the bonus from Raise a\n\t\tShield. Even so, an AC bonus is <em>always<\/em> useful, and if you have an\n\t\tAnimal Companion they get the bonus too. The bonus to Recall Knowledge may\n\t\tnot seem important, but if you take Monster Hunter the +2 bonus will make it\n\t\tmuch easier to gain the additional bonuses from a Critical Success when you\n\t\tRecall Knowledge on your Prey.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ranger Feats<\/strong>: See Ranger feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Iron Will<\/span>: Will saves are your worst save,\n\tso any bonus is welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trackless Step<\/span>: Very situational.\n\tFortunately, it doesn&#8217;t cost you annything to use and the Ranger is Trained in\n\tSurvival at first level so even if you totally disregard this ability it&#8217;ll\n\tcontinue to work in the background until the one time your DM decides that\n\tyou&#8217;ve been tracked. Unfortunately, the the &#8220;Cover Tracks&#8221; action doesn&#8217;t\n\tmention allies or other creatures, so it appears to only apply to your own\n\ttracks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Expertise<\/span>: Your proficiency with\n\tweapons advances at the same rate as other martial classes like the Barbarian\n\tand the Rogue. You also gain access to Critical Specialization effects, but\n\tonly against your Hunted Prey.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Rangers get the second-best Reflex\n\tsave progression in the game, behind only the Rogue. This helps reinforce the\n\tRanger&#8217;s ability to replace the Rogue as a Scout, allowing you to survive\n\tthings like disarming traps.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilant Senses<\/span>: Rangers get the second-best\n\tPerception progression in the game, behind only the Rogue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage is always\n\tgreat, and with options like Hunted Shot and Twin Takedown, small damage\n\tbonuses can add up quickly over multiple attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nature&#8217;s Edge<\/span>: Situational. Fun when it\n\tcomes up, but since the terrain needs to be natural difficult terrain it&#8217;s\n\thard to count on unless you&#8217;ve drawn your foes into an ambush or something.\n\tYou can also trigger this effect with a Snare, but the only Snare which\n\tcreates difficult terrain is the Hampering Snare. If you&#8217;re investing in\n\tSnares, using Hampering Snare to trigger Nature&#8217;s Edge is a great way to get a\n\tlot out of a cheap, low-level Snare, but it&#8217;s not going to kill your enemies\n\ton its own.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ranger Expertise<\/span>: Rangers follow the best\n\tClass DC progression and get access to Critical Specialization Effects, so if\n\tyou&#8217;re not already using a weapon with a good effect, you should strongly\n\tconsider it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Juggernaut<\/span>: Between Evasion and Juggernaut,\n\tyou&#8217;re well-protected against both Fortitude and Reflex saves, but you&#8217;re\n\tstill vulnerable to Will saves so be cautious around enemy spellcasters and\n\tother such enemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Medium Armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC is always\n\twelcome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wild Stride<\/span>: This is great for melee\n\tbuilds, and if you rely on Snares and use the Hampering Snare to create\n\tdifficult terrain you can move through its effect unimpeded while your Hunted\n\tPrey suddenly suffers the effects of your Nature&#8217;s Edge feature.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: More attack bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Evasion<\/span>: No more fear of\n\tfireballs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Senses<\/span>: Legendary in Perception\n\tfeels really good, and you&#8217;ll use it almost constantly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Masterful Hunter<\/span>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry<\/span>: Further reduce the Multiple Attack\n\t\tPenalty. Your Multiple Attack Penalty with your third and subsequent attacks\n\t\tis just -4, which is the same penalty that most characters suffer for using\n\t\tan Agile weapon on their <em>second<\/em> attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Precision<\/span>: This is a frustrating option.\n\t\tYou spent 16 levels putting a ton of damage into a single Strike, now\n\t\tsuddenly you&#8217;re being tempted by multiple Strikes per turn. You get\n\t\tdiminishing extra damage, but it&#8217;s still enough damage that a second Strike\n\t\twill feel nice despite not getting quite as much extra damage.\n\t\t<p>Because it&#8217;s explained terribly, I&#8217;ll summarize the effects: At level 17\n\t\t\twhen you gain Masterful Hunter, you add 2d8 with your first attack and 1d8\n\t\t\twith your second. At level 19, you add 3d8 with your first attack, 2d8\n\t\t\twith your second, and 1d8 with your third.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Outwit<\/span>: Unless you invested enough Skill\n\t\tIncreases to get the affected skills up to Master, you might get nothing\n\t\tfrom this. That seems unlikely, but it&#8217;s technically possible if you\n\t\tintentionally make a terrible character. You don&#8217;t get the AC bonus\n\t\timprovement until level 19, either. Really, this whole feature is incredibly\n\t\tfrustrating. Still, a +4 bonus on a skill is really good.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Second Skin<\/span>: More AC is always nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swift Prey<\/span>: This a massive game changer for\n\tthe Ranger. The 1-Action cost to use Hunt Prey has been a frustrating tax on\n\tyour action economy for your whole career, and suddenly it&#8217;s mostly gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Ranger&#8217;s ability to capitalize on nearly any ability score is vexxing. It&#8217;s hard to recommend specific ability score spreads because there&#8217;s so much room to customize. Honestly, from a class design perspective it&#8217;s impressive, but from the perspective of someone trying to write a character optimization handbook it&#8217;s confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ranger allows you to select either Strength or Dexterity as your key Ability Score, and either can work depending on what capabilities you want to emphasize. Beyond that, rangers can be incredibly diverse so it&#8217;s difficult to recommend specific ability socres. Rangers get more skills than most classes, and with the additional skills at first level you can easily fill a variety of skill-based roles in the party. So long as either your Strength or Dexterity is high and you have enough Constitution you can make everything else work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice of ability scores is going to vary wildly depending on your build. In most cases you&#8217;ll pick your Key Ability Score (Strength or Dexterity), then raise the other option to 12 or 14 at first level, and you might never boost it again. From there, Constitution will typically be your second-highest Ability Score. Then, pick two of the mental ability scores which complement your build, and boost those with any remaining ability boosts. If you&#8217;re every unsure, go for Intelligence and Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Crucial for Strength-based builds. Even\n\tin a Dexterity-based build, Strength can still offer some helpful extra\n\tdamage, especially at low levels. Dexterity-based melee builds still add\n\tStrength to weapon damage even while using Finesse weapons, and archers can\n\tuse compostite bows with the Propulsive property get a little bit of extra\n\tdamage. But if you need to dump Strength to focus on other ability scores, you\n\tcan dump Strength and avoid Propulsive weapons and you&#8217;ll do just fine. You\n\tmay need a bit of Strength to meet the Strength Threshold for your armor, but\n\ta Dexterity-based build won&#8217;t need more than 14 Strength (though more may add\n\tsome extra damage if you need it).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Crucial for Dexterity-based builds, but\n\teven Strength-based builds will want at least 12 to fill out the Dexterity cap\n\tfor your armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Con<\/span>: Hit points and Fortitude Saves. In most\n\tbuilds, this will be your second-highest Ability Score. Rangers are still a\n\tmartial class, so you&#8217;re expected to draw fire away from your squishier allies\n\tlike wizards and rogues.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Rangers get more initial Trained\n\tskills than most classes, and monster warden builds can benefit from the extra\n\tbonus to knowledge skills like Arcana and Occultism.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Perception and Will Saves. Will Saves\n\tare the Ranger&#8217;s biggest weakness, so dumping Wisdom is a terrible idea<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: The closest thing that the Ranger\n\tgets to a dump stat. While none of the Ranger&#8217;s class features rely on\n\tCharisma, they get enough skills that you could easily be your party&#8217;s\n\tFace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because rangers can thrive on so many different combinations of ability scores, there is a ton of flexibility in your Ancestry options. Look for other benefits which complement your build like Darkvision for stealthy rangers, new weapons for more directly offensive builds, and interesting Ancestry Feats which might complement your combat tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Without resorting to the Optional\n\tFlaw rules, the Dwarf is a great basis for any ranger. Constitution and Wisdom\n\tboosts will pad your hit points and raise your saving throws, and you can put\n\tthe Flexible Ability Boost into your choice of Strength or Dexterity.\n\tDarkvision and high hit points from your Ancestry are a great benefit for\n\tstealth builds and for front-line melee builds, and the Clan Dagger is a\n\tdecent off-hand weapon for two-weapon builds (though the Main-Gauche is\n\tbetter). The Heritages Ancient-Blooded Dwarf and Death Warden Dwarf offer\n\tdefenses which way be helpful against effects which target the Ranger&#8217;s poor\n\tWill Saves. The Dwarf Lore feat is tempting for both Monster Warden builds and\n\tSnare builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: Dexterity and Intelligence are great\n\tfor a highly-skilled ranged build. With a Constitution flaw I&#8217;m always\n\thesitant to recommend melee, but with Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Flurry) the Elven Curve\n\tBlade looks tempting. Elf Ancestry Feats offer ways to improve your mobility\n\tlike Nimble Elf and Elf Step, and the Ancestral Longevity feat chain is a nice\n\tcomplement to the Ranger&#8217;s already excellent capabilities with skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: The ability scores work well for a\n\tFace build, which the Ranger has plenty of skills to do. If you don&#8217;t want to\n\tbe a Face, use the Optional Flaw rules. Gnome Ancestry Feats offer fun options\n\tlike access to an animal familiar and some limited spellcasting, both of which\n\tcan be exciting ways to expand the Ranger&#8217;s capabilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Goblin<\/span>: A Wisdom Flaw is hard since Will\n\tSaves are the Ranger&#8217;s biggest weakness, but you can survive a -1 penalty. The\n\tRazortooth Goblin&#8217;s bite attack offers an interesting combination with\n\tHunter&#8217;s Edge (Flurry), allowing you to switch to an Agile weapon held in hand\n\twhile still using a shield. Goblin Weapon Familiarity offers access to the\n\tDogslicer, which is a powerful option for finesse builds. Junk Tinker\n\t<em>might<\/em> work with Snares without using the normal crafting rules\n\t(Snares normally take 1 minute to craft, but you can do the normal 4-day\n\tcrafting to then spend more time to save money), but check with your GM to see\n\thow they&#8217;d like to handle it. Rough Rider works great for Animal Companion\n\tbuilds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: The ability boosts are perfect for\n\tany Dexterity-based build, and the Strength Flaw is easy to either offset or\n\tignore. Keen Eyes overlaps with Hunt Prey somewhat since they both provide\n\tCircumstance Bonuses, but that&#8217;s fine. Several Heritage options look\n\tinteresting for a variety of use cases. The Halfling Luck feat tree is\n\tspectacular, and can help protect your from the Ranger&#8217;s poor Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Two Free Ability Boosts is plenty for\n\tmost builds, and the Human is exceptionally customizable which fits the Ranger\n\tvery well. The Natural Ambition Ancestry Feat can make you very powerful at\n\tfirst level, and makes it easier to combine aspects of different Ranger build\n\tconcepts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re built for melee, look for a Constitution Boost. Otherwise, you just need a Boost to your Primary Ability Score. Ranged builds tend to suffer less damage, so you&#8217;re free to spread your Ability Boosts around rather than pouring all of your resources into a straight Str\/Con or Dex\/Con build, so you might boost Intelligence for extra skills or Wisdom to compensate for your low Will saves and to improve your Perception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble deciding, here are some suggestions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Animal Whisperer: Boost Dexterity and Wisdom, and go for a ranged build\n\t\twith an Animal Companion.<\/li>\n\t<li>Artisan \/ Artist: Snares!<\/li>\n\t<li>Bounty Hunter: Tracking doesn&#8217;t come up much, but thematically this makes a\n\t\tlot of sense.<\/li>\n\t<li>Hermit: Great for Librarian\/Support build.<\/li>\n\t<li>Hunter \/ Nomad \/ Scout: Probably the most obvious and generic ranger\n\t\tbackground options, these three are nearly identical, mostly differing only\n\t\tin the Skll Feat which you gain from the Background.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Increases at 3rd and 5th level to raise skills to Expert, increases at 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th level to raise skills to Master, and increases at 15th, 17th, and 19th level to raise skills to Legendary.

It might not be a good option if you&#8217;re hiding, but\n\t\t\t\totherwise it&#8217;s a free debuff at the beginning of every fight.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Terrified Retreat<\/span>: Counting on a\n\t\t\t\tcritical success is hard, but if your Charisma is very high it might\n\t\t\t\twork.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scare to Death<\/span>: Spend one Action to\n\t\t\t\tpick out the creature in the room the lowest Will save and kill them or\n\t\t\t\tsend them fleeing. Repeat until the room is cleared. At this point you\n\t\t\t\tonly need weapons for things that are strong enough to threaten your\n\t\t\t\twhole party on their own, and even then this can still replace the\n\t\t\t\tDemoralize action almost entirely.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lore<\/span> (Int): Versatile, but vaguely\n\t\tdefined and hard to rely upon. If you have high Intelligence at 1st level\n\t\tand your party can cover essential knowledge skills like Arcana and\n\t\tReligion, consider picking up a few types of Lore.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Medicine<\/span> (Wis): Not crucial, but you\n\t\tshould have enough\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature<\/span> (Wis): You&#8217;re Trained in nature for\n\t\tfree.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonded Animal<\/span>: Basically &#8220;Diet\n\t\t\t\tAnimal Companion&#8221;. While the animal is helpful to you, it&#8217;s not any more\n\t\t\t\tpowerful than a normal animal. You could get a horse to serve as a\n\t\t\t\tmount, or a bird to fetch items and deliver messages, but don&#8217;t look for\n\t\t\t\tanything to fight with.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Natural Medicine<\/span>: This is a bad feat.\n\t\t\t\tIt only applies to Treat Wounds, and if you&#8217;re good at Nature you have\n\t\t\t\teverything that you need to be good at Medicine, too. Instead of wasting\n\t\t\t\ta Skill Feat on this, spend that same Skill Feat to improve your options\n\t\t\t\twith Medicine.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Train Animal<\/span>: A nice way to add some\n\t\t\t\textra tricks to your Animal Companion so that it can do more than fight\n\t\t\t\tthings.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Occultism<\/span> (Int): Essential for Monster\n\t\tWarden builds, but still helpful for other builds to identify monsters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Performance<\/span> (Cha): Not particularly\n\t\tuseful<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Religion<\/span> (Wis): Essential for Monster\n\t\tWarden builds, but still helpful for other builds to identify monsters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Society<\/span> (Int): Useful for Face builds,\n\t\tand feats like Read Lips and Sign Language are helpful for scouting.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Read Lips<\/span>: Occasionally Helpful in\n\t\t\t\tcampaigns with humanoid enemies which you can spy on.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sign Language<\/span>: Great for\n\t\t\t\tcommunicating stealthily, provided that someone else your party also\n\t\t\t\ttakes this.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): In most parties, you&#8217;re the\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Rogue equivalent, so you&#8217;ll be expected to do some sneaking and\n\t\texploring.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Assurance<\/span>: Get a consistently high\n\t\t\t\tresult on Initiative, and never worry about being spotted because you\n\t\t\t\trolled terribly.

This feat removes that annoyance.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Quiet Allies<\/span>: The phrase &#8220;using the\n\t\t\t\tlowest modifier&#8221; means that your allies add the +2 Circumstance Bonus,\n\t\t\t\trather than using whichever Circumstance Bonus you would normally get\n\t\t\t\tbased on your Proficiency.

You only get the benefits from Monster Hunter feats when you\n\t\tuse the Hunt Prey Action and then Recall Knowledge, but if you&#8217;re already\n\t\theavily invested in knowledge skills to support Monster Hunter, you may find\n\t\tthat using Automatic Knowledge to learn more about your enemies will give\n\t\tyou additional tactical insight at no Action cost. However, you also need\n\t\tAssurance in the same skill, and 8 total Skill Feats to cover all four\n\t\tknowledge skills is a big investment.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dubious Knowledge<\/span>: This feat is silly\n\t\tand it&#8217;s hard to seriously recommend it, but I would absolutely love to see\n\t\tthis on a Monster Warden build because I want to watch a party stumble\n\t\tthrough fights, sometimes making life-or-death tactical decisions based on\n\t\tinformation which might be wildly inaccurate. I don&#8217;t want to do it myself\n\t\tbecause that would likely lead to the untimely death by myself or a party\n\t\tmember, but I wan&#8217;t to see it happen purely for the comedic value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats\">Ranger Feats<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-1\">1st Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Companion<\/span>: Animal Companions are\n\t\tpowerful, but also complicated. For help with your Animal Companion, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/animal-companions\">Practical Guide to Animal Companions<\/a>. The Ranger notably gets to grant their Hunter&#8217;s Edge to their Animal\n\t\tCompanion, offer a significant buff against your hunted prey. However, it\n\t\talso means that your choice of Hunter&#8217;s Edge is an important consideration\n\t\twhen selecting your Animal Companion.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crossbow Ace<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to use\n\t\tcrossbows, this is essential. But crossbows aren&#8217;t a great option, and there\n\t\taren&#8217;t enough feats to overcome the fact that you need to spend 1 or more\n\t\tActions to reload them. The damage bonus is a Circumstance bonus, so it\n\t\twon&#8217;t stack with other options like Deadly Aim.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gravity Weapon<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal Companion<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunted Shot<\/span>: Two attacks in one Action,\n\t\tand you get to combine their damage for the purposes of damage resistances\n\t\tand weaknesses. Two attacks is usually enough in a turn, but if you don&#8217;t\n\t\tneed to move you can make 4 attacks in 1 turn right from level 1. This only\n\t\tworks with Reload 0 weapons like bows and you need to use Hunt Prey on the\n\t\ttarget before you can use this, but if you&#8217;re going to use a bow this is\n\t\tsimply too good to pass up. Bow users from other classes should absolutely\n\t\tmulticlass into ranger just for this feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monster Hunter<\/span>: Taken in a vaccuum, this\n\t\tis a good feat for a high-Intelligence ranger. Hunt Prey is a constant tax\n\t\ton your action economy, and Monster Hunter allows you to make a Recall\n\t\tKnowledge check as part of that same Action, allowing you to easily learn\n\t\tabout the target without spending another Action and without relying on\n\t\tmetagame knowledge. The +1 Circumstance is frustrating because it requires a\n\t\tCritical Success on your Recall Knowledge check, and even then it only\n\t\tapplies to one attack each for you and each of your allies. Don&#8217;t rely on\n\t\tthat bonus; instead, consider it a fun extra perk that you get once in a\n\t\twhile. If you do plan to pursue the whole Monster Hunter feat chain,\n\t\tconsider Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Outwit) for the +2 bonus on checks to Recall\n\t\tKnowledge.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Twin Takedown<\/span>: Two attacks in one action.\n\t\tEssential for two-weapon fighting builds. You do need to use Hunt Prey\n\t\tfirst, but this will offset the Action cost for doing so.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Favored Terrain<\/span>: Ignoring nonmagical\n\t\tdifficult terrain in a single terrain is not enough for a feat, and while\n\t\tthe secondary benefits are tempting they don&#8217;t come into effect until 11th\n\t\tlevel, at which point you have much more interesting feats available and you\n\t\tcan use spells or magic items to replace the effects in most cases. You can\n\t\tpick up Terrain Master at 8th level to change your Favored Terrain, but that\n\t\tstill seems like a high cost when you could just buy a scroll or\n\t\tsomething.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hunter&#8217;s Aim<\/span>: Situational, and the Action\n\t\tcost is high. Concealed is a 20% miss chance, and in most cases you&#8217;ll have\n\t\ta better chance of hitting if you make two Strikes instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Hide<\/span>: See Focus Spells, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monster Warden<\/span>: If you&#8217;re already going\n\t\tto use Hunt Prey with the added benefit of Monster Hunter, this adds some\n\t\textra benefits to a critical success. However, this feat adds a bunch of\n\t\tadditional tracking that you and your entire party need to do in combat.\n\t\tThis feat isn&#8217;t essential by any means, so if you need to spend feats to\n\t\tfocus on other aspects of your build you&#8217;ll do fine without this. You might\n\t\talso consider retraining something into this around level 10 when you get\n\t\tMaster Monster Hunter and you can count on the effects much more\n\t\tconsistently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Draw<\/span>: In most case where you&#8217;re\n\t\tsomewhere dangerous, you&#8217;ll know with enough warning to draw a weapon. This\n\t\tlooks helpful for thrown weapon builds, but you&#8217;ll want to retrain this as\n\t\tsoon as you can get a Returning rune on your weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snare Hopping<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Empathy<\/span>: While animals seem like\n\t\tthey won&#8217;t be a problem, the Animal creature type includes high-CR creatures\n\t\tlike purple worms. The Ranger has the skills to be a Face, and with decent\n\t\tDiplomacy and Wild Empathy you can trivialize encounters with an entire\n\t\tcreature type. But, while that capability is nice, it&#8217;s also replicated by\n\t\tthe 2nd-level spell Speak With Animals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Feature<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Companion&#8217;s Cry<\/span>: If you&#8217;re built around\n\t\tyour Animal Companion, spending another Action to give you companion another\n\t\tAction may be more effective than using your Action to do something like\n\t\tmake a Strike. This is by no means essential, even in an Animal Companion\n\t\tbuild, but in some builds it&#8217;s a good option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disrupt Prey<\/span>: Spectacular for a melee\n\t\tbuild, this is very similar Attack of Opportunity, but it only applies to\n\t\tyour Hunted Prey.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Far Shot<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re using thrown\n\t\tweapons, range increments are rarely a problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Favored Enemy<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re in a campaign\n\t\tdominated by creatures of the chosen type, this will be a wasted feat in the\n\t\tvast majority of encounters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter&#8217;s Luck<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Running Reload<\/span>: Spectacular in a crossbow\n\t\tbuild.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scout&#8217;s Warning<\/span>: Perception bonuses are\n\t\tthe default for Initiative, so you can reliably grant the bonus to your\n\t\tallies in most encounters. But if you&#8217;re being sneaky, you&#8217;re likely going\n\t\tto roll Stealth for Initiative, so this is a bad option for sneaky rangers.\n\t\tThe bonus is only +1, and while PF2 really likes +1 bonuses, mathematically\n\t\tit&#8217;s only significant because your whole party gets it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Snare Specialist<\/span>: This requires the Snare\n\t\tCrafting General Feat. You gain free forumlas based on your proficiency in\n\t\tCrafting, but it doesn&#8217;t appear that you get more free formulas if you later\n\t\tincrease your proficiency. Annoying, but not a deal breaker. The real appeal\n\t\tis that you get a number of snares per day without paying for materials, and\n\t\tyou can craft and place those snares in 3 Actions so you can place them\n\t\tduring combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Soothing Mist<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Twin Parry<\/span>: Even with Hunter&#8217;s Edge\n\t\t(Flurry), Multiple Attack Penalties are still significant, so making three\n\t\tor more attacks in a turn isn&#8217;t always worthwhile. Spending an Action to\n\t\tboost your AC for the turn can make a difference, especially if you have a\n\t\tweapon with the Parry trait like a Main-Gauche to raise the bonus to +2.\n\t\tStill, the +1 isn&#8217;t always mathematically significant, so you don&#8217;t\n\t\tabsolutely need this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-6\">6th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Additional Recollection<\/span>: Dramatically\n\t\timproves the action economy for Monster Warden builds in encounters with\n\t\tmore than one type of enemy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ephemeral Tracking<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mature Animal Companion<\/span>: Crucial for\n\t\tAnimal Companion builds. The secondary benefit gives your companion an\n\t\tAction even if you don&#8217;t command them, allowing them to move (great for\n\t\tmount companions) or make a single Strike (great if you have Hunter&#8217;s Edge\n\t\t(Precision).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Snares<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to use\n\t\tsnares in combat beyond the few you get from Snare Specialist, you&#8217;ll need\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ranger&#8217;s Bramble<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skirmish Strike<\/span>: A free step is almost\n\t\talways useful. Use this to get into position to flank, to Step away before\n\t\tmaking a ranged attack, or just to inch closer to wherever else you want to\n\t\tbe without Striding. Crossbow builds will get more use out of Running\n\t\tReload, but you could use both in the same turn if you need to.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Snap Shot<\/span>: By combining this with\n\t\tSkirmish Strike and Disrupt Prey, any ranged build can pin down their Hunted\n\t\tPrey in melee range. If you&#8217;re built for range but tend to find yourself in\n\t\tclose quarters like dungeons, this is a must. Otherwise it&#8217;s a good option\n\t\tbut if your party has plenty of melee threats it may not be useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swift Tracker<\/span>: Tracking almost never comes\n\t\tup in a typically campaign, and unless you&#8217;re tracking foes almost constantly\n\t\tit&#8217;s not worth two feats to get this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blind-Fight<\/span>: For a class with no magical\n\t\tway to handle invisible creatures, this is a powerful option. Usually\n\t\toptions like Seek are sufficient, but if your DM likes to use hidden\n\t\tenemies, invisible enemies, or ambushes this can be very beneficial both\n\t\toffensively and defensively.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deadly Aim<\/span>: -2 isn&#8217;t a massive penalty,\n\t\tespecially on your first Strike of the turn, and the damage bonus is both\n\t\tgood and scales as you gain level. Keep in mind that this feat has the Open\n\t\ttrait, so you can only use it on your first Action per turn, which means\n\t\tthat even if you really like this feat you only get to use it once per\n\t\tturn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enlarge Companion<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hazard Finder<\/span>: The bonus is small and\n\t\tsituational, but that&#8217;s not why you want this. Being able to find hazards\n\t\twhich normally require searching means that you won&#8217;t accidently step into\n\t\ttraps or something just because you forgot to search.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Powerful Snares<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using snares in\n\t\tany significant quantity, this is absolutely crucial. Snare DC&#8217;s are\n\t\tnormally fixed, so low-level snares become obsolete solely because their DC\n\t\tbecomes too low to remain useful. Raising the DC of all of your Snares means\n\t\tthat you can continue to use low-level Snares effectively at any level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Terrain Master<\/span>: If you took Favored\n\t\tTerrain and your GM isn&#8217;t going to let you spend the whole campaign in your\n\t\tfavorite biome, you need this or Favored Terrain is a wasted feat most of\n\t\tthe time. Of course, that means that you&#8217;re spending two feats to make a\n\t\tsingle feat worthwhile, which is a terrible way to spend limited resources.\n\t\tGo spend some gold on scrolls or something.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Warden&#8217;s Boon<\/span>: An interesting support\n\t\toption, but how useful it is depends on how well your allies&#8217; builds line up\n\t\twith your own. Other allies using Agile weapons will enjoy Flurry, while\n\t\tother allies who rely on large single Strikes will enjoy Precision. Anyone\n\t\twill enjoy Outwit, but spending an Action to grant one ally +1 AC doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tfeel like enough to spend an Action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Camouflage<\/span>: With the exception of dungeons\n\t\tand cities, most adventuring takes place in natural terrain. Hiding while\n\t\tobserved means that you can hide in the middle of combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter&#8217;s Vision<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Companion<\/span>: Crucial for Animal\n\t\tCompanion builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Monster Hunter<\/span>: Nature is probably\n\t\tyour best knowledge skill, so this will make Recall Knowledge more reliable\n\t\tand will reduce your need to spen Skill Increases on other knowledge skills.\n\t\tOn top of that convenience, you gain the benefits of Monster Hunter\n\t\t(including Monster Warden if you have it) on a Success rather than a\n\t\tCritical Success. That means that you need to roll 10 lower than you did\n\t\tpreviously, making the likelyhood of benefiting from Monster Warden\n\t\tdramatically more reliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Penetrating Shot<\/span>: Situational, but if\n\t\tyou move around to position yourself for this, it bould be really effective\n\t\tfor crossbow builds. For other ranged builds it makes more sense to use\n\t\tHunted Shot and focus on bringing down a single foe before moving on.\n\t\tHunter&#8217;s Edge (Precision) might apply damage to both creatures provided that\n\t\tthe second target is your Hunted Prey, but it&#8217;s not clear if that&#8217;s the\n\t\tcase.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Terrain Transposition<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Twin Riposte<\/span>: Choosing to use Twin Parry\n\t\tto boost your AC means giving up an Action that could be used to make a\n\t\tStrike. Not only does this replace the Strike you gave up, you get to make\n\t\tit with no Multiple Attack Penalty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warden&#8217;s Step<\/span>: This allows your whole\n\t\tparty to take the Sneak activity while in Exploration Mode without taking\n\t\tactions on their own. Since they&#8217;re not taking actions to Sneak, they can\n\t\tchoose to perform other Exploration Mode Activities like Defend or Scout. If\n\t\tyour party is well-equipped to Sneak, this can dramatically improve your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s ability to ambush your foes. However, this only works in &#8220;natural\n\t\tterrain&#8221;, so in dungeons, cities, or large structures like castles it&#8217;s\n\t\ttotally useless.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Distracting Shot<\/span>: Good on almost every\n\t\tbuild, but I wouldn&#8217;t take this with Deadly Aim because attack penalties\n\t\treduce your chance of both scoring critical hits and hitting twice in a\n\t\tsingle turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Double Prey<\/span>: Most of the time you&#8217;ll use\n\t\tHunt Prey before you attack anything, which gets really annoying in fights\n\t\twith multiple foes. This saves you at least one Action in every encounter\n\t\twith multiple enemies, and Actions are expensive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lightning Snares<\/span>: Craft and place a snare\n\t\tin one Action. Be careful about which snares you use or you&#8217;ll dump money\n\t\tinto high-level snares multiple times per turn. But if you want to litter\n\t\tthe area with low-level snares like Hampering Snares or Spike Snares. For\n\t\tsome reason Quick Snares isn&#8217;t a prerequisite for Lightning Snares in the\n\t\tCore Rulebook or in the first round of CRB Errata, but I assume that&#8217;s an\n\t\terror and I expect that to be corrected in the next round of errata.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Second Sting<\/span>: Second Sting has the Press\n\t\tTrait, so it needs to follow a Strike. You&#8217;re likely to use this after using\n\t\tTwin Takedown, so that&#8217;s easy to satisfy, and since you&#8217;ll have made two\n\t\tStrikes your Multiple Attack Penalty will be at the maximum so missing is\n\t\tlikely. The extra damage is a nice consolation, but likely won&#8217;t be\n\t\tsignificant because there are so few numerical damage bonuses in PF2. Runes\n\t\tof Striking and other runes which boost damage typically add damage dice, so\n\t\tthis will probably only aply your Strength bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Side By Side<\/span>: Flanking a target makes them\n\t\tFlat-Footed, which gives them a -2 AC penalty. Spending the Actions to Step\n\t\tto get into position to flank is expensive. This is especially appealing if\n\t\tyou take the Rogue Dedication and Sneak Attacker, and\/or if you have a Cat\n\t\tfor your Animal Companion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warden&#8217;s Focus<\/span>: Essential for Focus Spell\n\t\tbuilds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense The Unseen<\/span>: If your party doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thave magical options for revealing invisible foes this is fantastic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shared Prey<\/span>: Pick one prey, focus on them\n\t\tuntil they&#8217;re gone, then repeat. Your allies will be more powerful than an\n\t\tAnimal Companion so sharing your Hunt Prey and Hunter&#8217;s Edge benefits is\n\t\tboth generous and very effective, and Shared Prety reduces the problematic\n\t\tAction cost of Warden&#8217;s Boon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealthy Companion<\/span>: Not essential unless\n\t\tyou have an ambusher companion, but it&#8217;s still really good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Targeting Shot<\/span>: Cover and concealment\n\t\tcome up frequently, but Targeting Shot has the Press Trait so you can only\n\t\tuse it after you&#8217;ve made at least one Strike already. This is situationally\n\t\tuseful, but the situation does come up frequently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Warden&#8217;s Guidance<\/span>: A great non-magical\n\t\tcounter to hidden and invisible foes, but your allies do still need to spend\n\t\tan Action to Seek.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Distracting Shot<\/span>: Making the\n\t\ttarget Flat-Footed reduces their AC, at least partially offsetting the\n\t\tMultuple Attack Penalty so that you can easily continue to shoot them. I\n\t\twould avoid this on crossbow builds because you won&#8217;t get the full benefits\n\t\tof the feat, but other ranged builds should strongly consider this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Twin Riposte<\/span>: Another possible\n\t\tattack outside of your own turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Legendary Monster Hunter<\/span>: If you&#8217;re taking\n\t\tthis feat, you&#8217;ve likely taken Monster Hunter, Monster Warden, and Master\n\t\tMonster Hunter. That&#8217;s 4 class feats (including this one), and a bunch of\n\t\tSkill Increases, so the cost is very high. But the combined feat chain\n\t\tallows you to grant yourself and your allies +2 bonuses to an attack, to a\n\t\tsave, and to AC against one attack after you roll a success on Nature, which\n\t\tyou should be very good at by this level. +2 is mathematically significant,\n\t\tand applying the bonus to your whole party every time you switch targets\n\t\twill pay off very well.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Specialized Companion<\/span>: Essential for\n\t\tAnimal Companion builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ubiquitous Snares<\/span>: At this level you have\n\t\taccess to snares which cost as much as 1,500gp, and you can prepare as many\n\t\tas 16 of them at no cost. If you have Lightning Snares, you can craft and\n\t\tplace those prepared snares with a single Action. Drop a few Hail of Arrows\n\t\tsnares and retreat to a safe distance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Impossible Flurry<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using two\n\t\tAgile melee weapons and you have Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Flurry), this is great\n\t\tbecause you&#8217;re only taking -4 penalties on each attack but you&#8217;re making an\n\t\timpressive 6 attacks in one turn. The biggest limitation of this feat is\n\t\tthat it takes 3 Actions so you&#8217;re likely unable to move in the same turn\n\t\tunless you&#8217;re Quickened. However, melee weapons doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t\n\t\tuse this at range: you can still throw starknives or whatever else you like.\n\t\tGrab some Returning Runes and you can throw this around almost\n\t\tconstantly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Impossible Volley<\/span>: A 10-foot radius is\n\t\tfairly small, but if you can hit three or more targets it&#8217;ll be more\n\t\teffective than using Hunted Shot and making to other Strikes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Manifold Edge<\/span>: Hunter&#8217;s Edge is a central\n\t\tpart of your class which you build your character around. Changing your Edge\n\t\tis a hard choice, and probably a bad one.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Masterful Companion<\/span>: Crucial for Animal\n\t\tCompanion builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perfect Shot<\/span>: Designed specifically for\n\t\tcrossbow builds, dealing maximum damage is really appealing, but the set up\n\t\tis hard and if you miss the attack you waste your entire turn. Of course,\n\t\tcrossbow builds are all about gambling on a few high-damage attacks, so this\n\t\tis in line with htat theme.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Hunter<\/span>: A flat 20% miss chance on\n\t\tattacks against you at all times.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warden&#8217;s Wellspring<\/span>: Essential for Focus\n\t\tSpell builds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Accurate Flurry<\/span>: This is disappointing.\n\t\tImpossible Flurry is good, and the Multiple Attack Penalties are obviously a\n\t\thuge problem, but this doesn&#8217;t do enough for a 20th-level feat. Accurate\n\t\tFlurry effectively reduces your attack penalties on two of the six attacks\n\t\tmade with Impossible Flurry from -4 to -2. It&#8217;s a tiny mathematical\n\t\tboost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impossible Snares<\/span>: Keep one of your\n\t\thighest-level snares on hand, and you can create a free copy of it every\n\t\tminute. The free snares expire 10 minutes after being set, but you could\n\t\ttheoretically place 10 20th-level Snares for free (though one would expire\n\t\tin the round after doing so). This immediately becomes your signature combat\n\t\toption, allowing you to use snares with nearly every one of your Actions in\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Legendary Shot<\/span>: Situational, but you can\n\t\tmake the situation happen by choosing to engage foes at extreme range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">To The Ends of the Earth<\/span>: Very\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Triple Threat<\/span>: An easy option for nearly\n\t\tany ranger, provided that you&#8217;re in a party of at least three players.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ultimate Skirmisher<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\tbroadly useful, but not nearly as good as Triple Threat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Feather Step<\/span>: If you use Snares, the\n\t\tHampering Snare is an easy way to create difficult terrain. Of course, once\n\t\tyou get Wild Stride you should retrain this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Incredible Initiative<\/span>: Going early in\n\t\tcombat is great for Snare builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ride<\/span>: Rangers are probably the best\n\t\toption for a mounted build without taking a multiclass archetype.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You choice of weapons reflects your build very heavily. In most cases there&#8217;s no perfect option, and you&#8217;ll need to pick a weapon (or weapons) which reflect your build priorities. Even if you&#8217;re building an Animal Companion build or a Monster Warden, you&#8217;ll still want a decent weapon to fill the Actions which you&#8217;re not spending commanding and buffing your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because rangers depend so heavily on Hunt Prey, weapons with the Sweep trait should typically be avoided, and Forceful weapons can be very appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical Specialization effects are also important to consider since starting at 5th level rangers can apply them to their Hunted Prey. Rangers get the best Class DC progression in the game, so Critical Specialization effects with save DCs are a great way to capitalize on the Ranger&#8217;s core features.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-archery\">Archery Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most ranged builds will be built around using a bow. Use a composite bow if you have 14 or more Strength, otherwise a regular bow will do. If you&#8217;re going to be fighting in dungeons (most adventurers will), strongly consider sticking to shortbows despite their reduced damage die. The -2 penalty from the Volley trait on longbows will prove to be a persistent source of frustration, and it&#8217;s too costly to maintain two bows and switch between them. You can mitigate that by taking the Fighter multiclass archetype and taking the Point-Blank Shot feat, but between Hunt Prey and a Stance feat that&#8217;s two Actions before you start attacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bows and crossbows have a unique Critical Specialization effect which pins the target in place and requires them to waste an Action to free themselves. The check DC is low enough that you should expects enemies to succeed, but that&#8217;s an Action which your enemies aren&#8217;t attacking you and your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-crossbow\">Crossbow Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Crossbows are a great go-to weapon if you like Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Precision), but they require a significant investment of Class Feats (Crossbow Ace, Running Reload, and possible Deadly Aim) to make them work well compared to regular bows. The big damage die and range are tempting, but the Action cost to reload a crossbow means that you need to pile a whole bunch of damage into one attack to match the damage output of a bow being fired repeatedly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crossbows share a Critical Specialization Effect with bows (see above).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crossbow<\/span>: The best compromise between\n\t\treload time and damage output. If you start a turn with your crossbow loaded\n\t\tand nothing better to do, you can manage two shots in a turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hand Crossbow<\/span>: Fine as a secondary\n\t\tweapon, but there&#8217;s little reason to give up the additional damage of a\n\t\treguler Crossbow for the novelty of being able to fire it one-handed. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re stressing over Bulk due to having terrible Strength, you may need to\n\t\tresort to hand crossbows until can find a Lifting Belt.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavy Crossbow<\/span>: Two actions is\n\t\t<em>not<\/em> worth the difference in damage between 1d8 and 1d10 (crossbow\n\t\tvs. heavy crossbow), even once you start applying Runes of Striking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-two-handed\">Two-Handed Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While two-handed weapon builds aren&#8217;t an obvious option for the Ranger, they absolutely work. Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Flurry) is especially tempting with Forceful weapons, though there isn&#8217;t a Hunted Short\/Twin Takedown equivalent which allows you to make extra attacks. Still, Flurry and three attacks with a greatsword feels really good, and you could multiclass into Fighter to get Power Attack and combine it with Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Precision) to deal 2d12+1d8+Strength damage on a single attack..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elven Curve Blade<\/span>: Two-handed, Finesse,\n\t\tand Forceful. The relatively low damage die hurts, but with Hunter&#8217;s Edge\n\t\t(Flurry) and enough attacks, Forceful can make up the damage difference. In\n\t\taddition, the Critical Specialization Effect makes the target flat-footed,\n\t\twhich makes your successive attacks more likely to hit. However, the setup\n\t\tcost of Hunt Prey can make it hard to capitalize on Forceful unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tfacing single foes with big piles of hit points to cut through.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glaive<\/span>: Easier to access than the Elven\n\t\tCurve Blade with similar benefits (though no Finesse), and the addition of\n\t\tboth Deadly and Reach are likely worth the lose of Finesse, especially since\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t need an Ancestry Feat to gain access.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greatsword<\/span>: Nothing fancy, but a great\n\t\tstaple option with a big damage die and Versatile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-two-weapon\">Two-Weapon Fighting Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Since you get to use two weapons, there&#8217;s more room for variance and experimentation than most fighting styles. Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Flurry) is a must, and since Flurry will reduce the Multiple Attack Penalty, Agile weapons are less essential (though they&#8217;re still fantastic).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to pick up a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=1221\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=1221\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blazons of Shared Power<\/a><sup>GaG<\/sup> to dramatically reduce the cost of putting magic on both of your weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Clan Dagger<\/span>: The Main-Gauche is better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dagger<\/span>: The Starknife is strictly\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dogslicer<\/span>: Trade the shortsword&#8217;s\n\t\tVersatile for Backstabber.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Filcher&#8217;s Fork<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\tthe Starknife, but with the addition of Backstabber and a different weapon\n\t\tgroup. The Spear weapon group&#8217;s Critical Specialization effect applies\n\t\tClumsy 1, which is a minor but helpful debuff, and Backstabber adds a small\n\t\tbut easily-accessible damage bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gauntlet \/ Spiked Gauntlet<\/span>: The biggest\n\t\tappeal here is the Critical Specialization effect of the Brawling group. The\n\t\tdamage die matches a dagger so you won&#8217;t get much damage, but if you can\n\t\tapply Slow 1 that&#8217;s easily worth the Strike, and with your high Class DC you\n\t\tcan expect enemies to fail the save reliably.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Hammer<\/span>: Agile and throwable, so it\n\t\tshares a similar niche to the Starknife. The Hammer weapon groups&#8217; Critical\n\t\tSpecialization Effect knocks foes Prone, which makes targets Flat-Footed and\n\t\tforces them to spend an Action on their turn to stand.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Main-Gauche<\/span>: A spectacular off-hand weapon\n\t\tfor two-weapon fighting builds. Parry offers a great way to boost your AC,\n\t\tespecially if you take Twin Parry, and the Main-Gauche has Agile, Finesse,\n\t\tand Versatile (Piercing and Slashing) so it&#8217;s useful offensively by any\n\t\tbuild and in any situation. The damage die is small, though so you want to\n\t\tattack with it as little as possible. The Critical Specialization effect\n\t\tapplies Persistent Bleed, but since the effect doesn&#8217;t stack with itself you\n\t\tstill don&#8217;t want to spend all of your time attacking with your\n\t\tMain-Gauche.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapier<\/span>: A good option for your primary\n\t\tweapon in Dexterity-based melee builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sawtooth Sabre<\/span>: If anyone were going to\n\t\tuse the Sawtooth Sabre to its full effect, it would be the Ranger.\n\t\tTragically, it&#8217;s very difficult to get decent proficiency with them. The\n\t\tbest option is to take the Fighter multiclass archetype, and take the\n\t\tAdvanced Weapon Training feat, which you can&#8217;t do until 12th level. Still,\n\t\tif you don&#8217;t mind the Class Feat investment to do that, the damage bonus\n\t\tfrom Twin will pay off nicely when combined with Twin Takedown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortsword<\/span>: Nothing fancy. Agile and\n\t\tVersatile with a decent damage die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Starknife<\/span>: Despite the low damage die, the\n\t\tStarknife is a great weapon choice. It can be thrown, allowing you to easily\n\t\ttransition from melee to ranged combat, and with Deadly and the Knife weapon\n\t\tgroup, critical hits deal a bunch of damage up front <em>and<\/em> Persistent\n\t\tBleed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-other\">Other Weapon Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While they don&#8217;t all fit neatly into obvious build options, there is a wide array of other weapon options which can work very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling Sling Staff<\/span>: The base damage of a\n\t\theavy crossbow with the same reload time and Propulsive, so with a bit of\n\t\tStrength you can match the same damage as a Heavy Crossbow with Crossbow\n\t\tAce, but without spending a Class Feat. The Sling Critical Specialization\n\t\teffect makes targets Stunned 1, robbing them of an Action on their next turn\n\t\tif they fail a save against your Class DC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sling<\/span>: Hard to justify. It&#8217;s basically a\n\t\thand crossbow with Propulsive, but you can&#8217;t boost the damage with Crossbow\n\t\tAce. If you like slings, upgrade to the Halfling Sling Staff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity-based rangers will wear light armor, while Strength-based Rangers will typically wear medium armor. Rangers never get Armor Specialization effects, so the materials don&#8217;t matter, which means that as long as you&#8217;re filling out the Dexterity cap and you meet the Strength Threshold you&#8217;re probably fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explorer&#8217;s Clothing<\/span>: Once you reach 10th\n\t\tlevel, your Dexterity could reach 20. At that point, Explorer&#8217;s Clothing\n\t\tprovides the same AC as Leather Armor, but without a check penalty and with\n\t\tless Bulk. You&#8217;ll still want to put runes on it to boost your AC, bu\n\t\ttransferring runes from your previous armor is easy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leather<\/span>: Most Dexterity-based rangers will\n\t\tlive in Leather armor until they raise their Dexterity to 20, and even then\n\t\tyou only need to change to Explorer&#8217;s Clothing if you don&#8217;t have 10\n\t\tStrength.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Studded Leather<\/span>: If you start with 16\n\t\tDexterity, this may be the right choice. You&#8217;ll get the same AC as Leather\n\t\tarmor with 18 Dexterity, and since the Dex cap doesn&#8217;t matter beyond your\n\t\tAC, raising your Dexterity doesn&#8217;t mandate changing armor. However, the\n\t\tStrength Threshold is higher than Leather, so if you don&#8217;t have 12 Strength\n\t\tyou might change to Leather once you have 18 Dexterity, provided that you\n\t\thave 10 Strength to meet Leather&#8217;s Strength Threshold.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chain Shirt<\/span>: Noisy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hide \/ Scale Mail<\/span>: Fine options if you\n\t\twant to stop at 14 Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chain Mail<\/span>: Noisy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half Plate<\/span>: You can meet the Strength\n\t\tThreshold at first level, so the only hurdle is the cost. You likely can&#8217;t\n\t\tafford this at first level unless it&#8217;s the only thing you buy, but you\n\t\tshould get enough gold to afford it quickly so it&#8217;s perfectly fine to sart\n\t\twith 12 Dexterity and not goo any further, provided that you&#8217;re not\n\t\tparticularly concerned with Stealth. If you&#8217;re planning to be good at\n\t\tstealth, you might stick to Hide or Scale Mail to save money and put more\n\t\tinto your Dexterity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells\">Ranger Focus Spells &#8211; Warden Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gravity Weapon<\/span>: Not a huge amount of\n\t\tdamage, but with only Somatic components you can easily cast this before\n\t\tcombat starts without revealing your position, so this is a great option if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re able to ambush or otherwise surprise your enemies. In combats against\n\t\tpowerful enemies you might still use this in the first round of combat so\n\t\tthat the damage bonus can add up over time, but if combat is going to be\n\t\tquick that same Action may be better used on making an additional\n\t\tStrike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal Companion<\/span>: The Ranger has no built-in\n\t\thealing options of any kind, so short of the Medicine skill you have no way\n\t\tto heal your Animal Companion. 1d10 or 1d10+8 per spell level is an\n\t\timpressive amount of healing, outdoing both Lay on Hands and Heal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Hide<\/span>: Not especially exciting, but\n\t\talways useful. The 1-Action casting time and 1-minute duration make it easy\n\t\tto use at a moment&#8217;s notice, and with only Somatic components you can cast\n\t\tthis while hidden without giving away your position.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snare Hopping<\/span>: The only way to move a\n\t\tplaced Snare. Hopefully you&#8217;ll never need this, but at low levels when you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t afford to place a Snare every round this can keep you from wasting a\n\t\tSnare because its current position isn&#8217;t working out like you hoped.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Feature<\/span>: Admittedly awful when you\n\t\tfirst get it, but when you reach 7th level and can cast this as a 4th-level\n\t\tspell you can give yourself a swim speed or a fly speed, allowing you to\n\t\tmove and fight more effectively almost anywhere. The 4th-level version of\n\t\tthe spell also allows Darkvision, but Darkvision is a 2nd-level spell with a\n\t\tone-hour duration available on every spell list, so getting it for one\n\t\tminute feels pointless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter&#8217;s Luck<\/span>: This isn&#8217;t worth the feat\n\t\tat low levels, but if you&#8217;re going for a Monster Warden build, it&#8217;ll become\n\t\tincreasing useful as you invest more feats. Failing on your Recall Knowledge\n\t\tchecks against powerful foes will make huge parts of your built totally\n\t\tuseless, so the added insurance of rolling twice will make you dramatically\n\t\tmore effective. You won&#8217;t need to use this for every zombie you stumble\n\t\tacross, but if you&#8217;re facing a single monster in an encounter you really\n\t\tdon&#8217;t want to fail your check.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Soothing Mist<\/span>: The healing isn&#8217;t great,\n\t\tbut the ability to end a large number of persistent damage can prevent a ton\n\t\tof damage. The option to damage undead is neat, but I would only use it if\n\t\tthe target has vulnerability to Positive damage. Fortunately, that&#8217;s common\n\t\tamong undead. In total, this spell has two situational uses. Both are\n\t\treasonably common, but I wouldn&#8217;t expect to use this often.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ephemeral Tracking<\/span>: Exceptionally\n\t\tsituational. If you need this, go find a wizard and use some divination\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ranger&#8217;s Bramble<\/span>: Entangle is a fine\n\t\tarea control spell, and adding Persistent Bleed damage to it is really\n\t\tappealing, especially since you add an additiona 1d4 for every spell level.\n\t\tHowever, the Ranger&#8217;s proficiency with spells never improves past Trained\n\t\tunless you multiclass. This spell is fantastic for anyone who&#8217;s better at\n\t\tcasting Primal spells than the Ranger.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enlarge Companion<\/span>: Huge size, Clumsy 1,\n\t\t+4 Status Bonus to damage, and add 10 ft. of reach. If youre relying on your\n\t\tAnimal Companion as your primary source of damage output, that&#8217;s pretty\n\t\tgood. Not totally indispensible, and Clumsy 1 and the bigger size will make\n\t\tit a big target, but the damage bonus and additional reach can make your\n\t\tcompanion a huge target so if your Animal Companion is frail or at low HP\n\t\tyou should avoid using this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter&#8217;s Vision<\/span>: Counter darkness,\n\t\tinvisibility, concealment, disguises, some illusions, and basically anything\n\t\texcept cover or blindness which would prevent you from seeing your prey.\n\t\tEven betterm you can share the benefit with your party (&#8220;those who follow\n\t\tyour lead&#8221;), and with a 10 minute duration this works both in and out of\n\t\tcombat for a variety of purposes. The only problems are that it&#8217;s blocked by\n\t\tcover, has a short range, and you need to hit the target with your Hunt Prey\n\t\tAction before you use this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Terrain Transposition<\/span>: Teleportation is a\n\t\tmassive tactival advantage, even with limited range like this, and the\n\t\tability to bring your Animal Companion along means that you can easily get\n\t\tthem into melee with an enemy and either move yourself away or join\n\t\tthem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Alchemist<\/span>: Snare builds can double-down\n\t\ton crafting by adding alchemy. Free bombs for the Bomb Snare are nice, but\n\t\tdon&#8217;t overlook the utility of other options like mutagens. If you like\n\t\tthrowing bombs, be sure to take Quick Draw.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bard<\/span>: Monster Wander users should\n\t\tconsider Loremaster&#8217;s Etude to help with Recall Knowledge.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Champion<\/span>: Rangers have few built-in uses\n\t\tfor their Reaction, so Champion&#8217;s Reaction is a great option for melee\n\t\trangers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: The Cleric&#8217;s Focus Spells are\n\t\texcellent, but I&#8217;m not sure that they have any specific appeal for the\n\t\tRanger.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Druid<\/span>: Wild Shape would be a really cool\n\t\toption if it worked well for multiclass builds. You might be able to make\n\t\tWild Morph worthwhile, but I wouldn&#8217;t try it until you&#8217;re able to cast Focus\n\t\tSpells at 6th level so that the claws from Wild Morph deal the Persistent\n\t\tBleed damage. Otherwise they&#8217;re basically short swords. Animal Companion\n\t\tbuilds may expect something from the Druid, but the Ranger gets all of the\n\t\tsame feats that druids get below 10th level, so there&#8217;s nothing new to be\n\t\tgained here.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter<\/span>: Fighters get a lot of useful\n\t\tfeats at low levels which can complement your favorite fighting style, and\n\t\tFighter Class Feats make shields considerably more viable for the Ranger.\n\t\tAny melee build will benefit greatly from Opportunist and the Attack of\n\t\tOpportunity reaction.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk<\/span>: Flurry of Blows has the Flourish\n\t\ttrait, so you can&#8217;t use it in the same turn as Hunted Shot or Twin Takedown.\n\t\tI know, I&#8217;m disappointed too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue<\/span>: A great combination for stealthy\n\t\trangers. Sneak Attack combines well with Hunter&#8217;s Edge (Flurry), especially\n\t\tif you can easily make a foe Flat-Footed, such as by flanking with an Animal\n\t\tCompanion. The damage die is small, but applied over up to 4 attacks it can\n\t\tadd up very quickly. Despite lack of access to a Racket, you can still\n\t\tbenefit from low-level feats like Twin Feint, You&#8217;re Next, and Mobility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Ranger is skilled martial character sharing elements of the Fighter and the Rogue with some nature elements, capable of filling several roles within the party.
