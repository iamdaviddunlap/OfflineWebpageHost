Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Bard Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Charisma. This makes the bard a natural Face,\n\tand makes it easy to capitalize on things like innate spellcasting from your\n\tAncestry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+ hit points is typical for\n\tclasses not built to be a front-line martial character. You&#8217;ll be fine if\n\tyou&#8217;re built to fight at range, but if you want to get into melee be sure to\n\tinvest in Constitution to pad your hit points.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Bard&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are limited. You get few weapons and you&#8217;re not very good at\n\tusing them, and defensively you&#8217;re very vulnerable. Expect to invest in\n\tDexterity and Constitution just to stay alive.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span>: Starts at Expert, and remains\n\t\tabove average as you gain levels.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saving Throws<\/span>: The worst Fortitude saves\n\t\tin the game, and only middling Reflex saves. The Bard&#8217;s proficency in Will\n\t\tsaves is among the best available, which is great because you may not be\n\t\table to afford to invest in Wisdom. You&#8217;ll need to invest in Dexterity and\n\t\tConstitution to compensate for your other saves.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 6+ skills is above\n\t\taverage, but you&#8217;re locked into Occultism and Performance, and most bards\n\t\twill take Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation to capitalize on their high\n\t\tCharisma, so you may find yourself with less flexibility than you&#8217;d like\n\t\tunless you invest in Intelligence for extra skills.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attacks<\/span>: Simple weapons and a handful of\n\t\tmartial weapons. Your proficiency advances at the same rate as the Wizard,\n\t\twhich should tell you how infrequently bards are expected to use weapons.\n\t\tDon&#8217;t expect to use weapons extensively, but you might make a Strike every\n\t\tfew turns when you have a spare Action, so a shortbow can be a useful\n\t\toption, especially at low levels where your comparably poor proficiency is\n\t\tless significant and you have fewer spells to throw around.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Light armor, and your\n\t\tproficiency advances at the slowest rate. Your AC is going to be bad, which\n\t\tis a problem on top of your 8+ hit points.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: Bard don&#8217;t get a class DC. That&#8217;s not much of a\n\t\tproblem unless you&#8217;re trying to capitalize on Critical Specialization\n\t\tEffects, but even then many of them don&#8217;t care about your Class DC, and you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get access to them from the Bard until level 11.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Occult Spellcasting<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Spells<\/span>: Heightening spells is\n\t\tan important mechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many spells scale with spell level,\n\t\tremaining effective long past their base spell level. Since bards use a\n\t\tSpell Repertoire, you need to learn spells at multiple levels to heighten\n\t\tthem in most cases, though Signature Spells are an exception.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Fantastic every time, on any\n\t\tcharacter, in any amount. Bards learn 5 cantrips at level 1 and never get\n\t\tmore, but you can replace them by retraining or when you gain a level so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not locked into whatever you pick at first level.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Repertoire<\/span>: Spell Repertoires are\n\tless versatile than spellcasting like the Cleric&#8217;s or the Druid&#8217;s. You know a\n\tfixed number of spells which grows as you gain levels, and while you don&#8217;t\n\tneed to prepare your spells ahead of time you also lose the flexibility of\n\tchanging your spells every day. You also need to learn the same spells as\n\tmultiple levels if you plan to heighten them, which is a difficult cost to\n\tpay. Fortunately, the Bard&#8217;s Signature Spells feature (see below) allows you\n\tto heighten some of your spells without learning them multiple times.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Composition Spells<\/span>: Composition Spells are\n\tan important part of the Bard&#8217;s capabilities, and the Bard is one of few\n\tclasses which start with a Focus Pool by default. You get the Counter\n\tPerformance Focus Spell for free at 1st level, but characters multiclassing\n\tinto the Bard would need to take the Counter Performance feat to get it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Bards also have Focus Cantrips. These are a separate pool of cantrips from\n\tyour regular cantrips, but they work roughly the same way. The Bard&#8217;s Focus\n\tCantrips include numerous excellet buff\/debuff effects, including Inspire\n\tCourage which you get for free at first level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Composition Spells all have the Composition trait. You can only have one\n\tComposition in effect at the same time, so despite the often low Action cost\n\tto cast a Composition Spell, casting more than one in the same turn is\n\tgenerally a bad idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For details on specific Composition Spells, see Focus Spells, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Muse<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Muses&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bard Feats<\/strong>: See Bard feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: Better saves never\n\thurts, but you never go beyond Expert. You might consider Canny Acumen at high\n\tlevel to raise your Reflex Saves to Master.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Signature Spells<\/span>: A powerful and important\n\tfeature, this allows you to heighten a small set of spells without learning\n\tthem multiple times. As their name suggests, these spells will be your go-to\n\toptions in most situations, and choosing good spells will be absoutely\n\tcrucial.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Spellcaster<\/span>: Better spell attacks and\n\tspell DCs.

You do get access to Critical Specialization Effects,\n\tbut scoring a critical hit with a weapon will be a rarity.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilant Senses<\/span>: The Bard&#8217;s Perception\n\tprogression is above average. More is always great.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat, but you get this very late.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: This will rarely\n\tmatter. If you&#8217;re attacking with a weapon, it&#8217;s because you have nothing\n\tbetter to do.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Spellcaster<\/span>: Better spell attacks and\n\tspell DCs. Standard for full spellcasters.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Resolve<\/span>: Very powerful. Preventing\n\tCritical Failures on Will saves can protect from numerous very harmful\n\teffects.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Legendary Spellcaster<\/span>: Better spell attacks\n\tand spell DCs. Standard for full spellcasters.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magnum Opus<\/span>: 10th-level spells are crazy.\n\tYou can spend a class feat to get another, but it&#8217;s unlikley that you&#8217;ll ever\n\tcast more than 2 10th-level spells in a day.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Muses<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Each Muse emphasizes a specific part of the Bard&#8217;s capabilities, offering new\n\tfeats to support that part of the class. While technically you&#8217;re not\n\tobligated to take any of those feats (beyond the one which you recieve at 1st\n\tlevel), many of the Bard&#8217;s best class feats are Muse-specific.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can gain access to feats from other Muses with the Multifarious Muse\n\tfeat, broadening your class feat options. However, adding more Muse types will\n\thave diminishing returns because you have a limited number of class feat\n\tslots.

This allows you to Heighten the spell without\n\t\t\tknowing the spell multiple times at different spell levels. For example:\n\t\t\tIf you has False Life in your Spell Repertoire as a 1st-level spell, you\n\t\t\tcould select it from your spellbook and it would become a Signature Spell.\n\t\t\tThis would then allow you to Heighten it to any level of spell which you\n\t\t\tcan cast.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you instead choose a spell which is in your spellbook but not in your\n\t\t\tSpell Repertoire, you add the spell to your Spell Repertoire for the day,\n\t\t\teffectively learning one extra spell.
