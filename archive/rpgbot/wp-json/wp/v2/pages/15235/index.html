This puts it in an interesting position, standing with the Paladin and Ranger as a weapon-using half-caster. Lacking damage ramping features like Hunter\u2019s Mark or Divine Smite, the Battle Smith must instead leverage the Artificer\u2019s spell list and Infusions to turn up the heat. Oh and I guess the super fighting robot, Steel Defender. They leverage that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Part of what makes Artificers in general a good candidate for this gish-like combat style is Tools Required. This is a part of their spellcasting feature that adds a Material component to every spell as well as counting any Infused item as a valid spell focus, bypassing the need for a feat like Warcaster. The Battle Smith takes this and adds the additional synergy of using Intelligence for attacks with Magical Weapons, something Infusions are very capable of doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This together means the Battle Smith is easily capable of wading into the fray with a weapon in one hand, a shield in the other equally ready to make attacks and sling spells without sacrificing Attack rolls or Spell Save DCs. Or maybe stand back and fire a magically-reloading pistol while still holding a shield. Who\u2019s going to stop you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>For our example build, we\u2019ve gone with a mounted combat style by riding our Steel Defender as a small race.

Many of the options are\n\t\texcellent, and the smite spells from the Paladin&#8217;s spell list work on ranged\n\t\tweapons so you&#8217;re not locked into melee if that&#8217;s not where you want to be.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: Spectacular defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuffs. Shield easily makes up the durability gap between the Battle\n\t\t\t\tSmith and the Armorer in heavy armor.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th Level<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\t\t\tsituational. Warding Bond is hard due to the Artificer&#8217;s d8 hit die.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">9th Level<\/span>: Both spells are fine, but\n\t\t\t\tnot especially good for a 3rd-level spell.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th Level<\/span>: More great defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuffs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">17th Level<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\t\t\tsituational, but you don&#8217;t have another good way to deal with\n\t\t\t\textraplanar creatures and your best group healing is Aura of Vitality,\n\t\t\t\twhich can&#8217;t get a whole party back on their feat in one turn..<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battle Ready<\/span>: Finally a way to use\n\t\tIntelligence for your weapon attacks! You also get martial weapons, which\n\t\toffers a small improvement to your existing weapon options. Be sure to take\n\t\t14 Dexterity to max out medium armor, but otherwise go all-in on\n\t\tIntelligence.\n\t\t<p>You have a variety of good options for how to jump into combat with a\n\t\t\tweapon. Grab a longsword (or an equivalent weapon) and a shield, and\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re nearly as durable as a fighter (arguably more durable if you have\n\t\t\tthe right infusions), especially with your Steel Defender&#8217;s Deflect\n\t\t\tAttack. Deflect Attack may even be enough to justify using a two-handed\n\t\t\tmelee weapon so that you can focus on offense, but if you&#8217;re going to use\n\t\t\tBooming Blade or Green-Flame Blade, the bigger damage dice will be less\n\t\t\timpactful than the AC bonus from a shield.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be extra\n\t\t\tdefensive but still in melee, grab a whip and keep your Steel Defender\n\t\t\tbetween you and your enemies. If that&#8217;s still not safe enough, grab a\n\t\t\tranged weapon and send your Steel Defender into melee on its own.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Steel Defender<\/span>: The Steel Defender is\n\t\tprimarily a Defender, rather than a Striker. It has a decent pile of hit\n\t\tpoints and what amounts to Fighting Style (Protection). It deals damage\n\t\tequivalent to a longsword and since it&#8217;s force damage almost nothing will\n\t\tresist it, but its primary function is to protect you while you do the real\n\t\tdamage. It has a poor AC at just 15, so expect to spend a lot of time\n\t\trepairing it between fights. The Steel Defender&#8217;s Repair action allows it to\n\t\trepair itself, but at 3 uses per day you&#8217;ll get a lot more healing out of\n\t\tMending.\n\t\t<p>The Steel Defender notably doesn&#8217;t gain any ability to fly, which is a\n\t\t\tproblematic limitation once you reach high enough level that flying\n\t\t\tenemies become common. You&#8217;ll need a way to either get enemies down into\n\t\t\trange of your Steel Defender or you&#8217;ll need to find a way to make your\n\t\t\tSteel Defender fly. Infusing a pair of Winged Boots is probably your best\n\t\t\toption.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Helpful since the Battle\n\t\tSmith typically relies on weapons for damage output, but without an on-hit\n\t\tdamage boost you&#8217;ll get considerably more damage output out of cantrips like\n\t\tBooming Blade and Sword Burst, so Extra Attack may only be consistently\n\t\tuseful if you&#8217;re using a reach weapon or a ranged weapon. See my article on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Jolt<\/span>: 2d6 damage\/healing up to 5\n\t\ttimes per day isn&#8217;t much, but fortunately it doubles at 15th level, and the\n\t\thealing is as useful as Healing Word, allowing you to heal dying allies and\n\t\tget them back into the fight. Personally I would reserve this exclusively\n\t\tfor healing and critical hits. The damage isn&#8217;t enough to make a big difference\n\t\tnormally unless you know that it&#8217;ll kill the target, but the damage is\n\t\t&#8220;extra damage&#8221; rather than a separate damage source, so it&#8217;s multiplied on a\n\t\tcritical hit like Divine Smite or Hex.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Defender<\/span>: 2d6 more damage\/healing\n\t\ton Arcane Jolt makes it a little more impactful, but still not significant.\n\t\tThe AC boost is significant, especially since your pet has been sitting at\n\t\t15 AC for 11 levels while attack bonuses gradually increase. The tiny bit of\n\t\tdamage on Deflect Attack is nice, too. At this level 1d4+5 (I&#8217;m assuming\n\t\tthat you have 20 Intelligence by now) isn&#8217;t much at this level, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tstill a nice little buff to something which you were going to do anyway, and\n\t\tif you&#8217;re using it every round (which you really should) it will add up\n\t\tquickly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"steel-defender-as-a-mount\">Steel Defender as a Mount<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>As a medium sized creature, the Steel Defender can serve as a mount for small Battle Smiths, which can be fun but also introduces rules complications. The first thing to understand is that yes, even though the Steel Defender does follow the Battle Smith in Initiative, when ridden as a Controlled Mount it just moves on the Battle Smith\u2019s turn like any other mount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, when ridden in this controlled manner, we must obey two sets of restrictions on our Steel Defender\u2019s actions. As a controlled mount, the only Actions it may take are Dodge, Dash, and Disengage. As a Steel Defender, unless we spend a Bonus Action, the only Action it may take is Dodge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simpler terms this means that in exchange for our mount having actual scaling hit points, we can Dash and Disengage at the cost of Bonus Actions. Fair trade in my opinion. Riding in this way does prevent it from making Attacks, but the increased mobility in combat is well worth that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on mounted combat, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/mounted_combat\/\">Practical Guide to Mounted Combat<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-smith-ability-scores\">Battle Smith Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Battle Smith wants a high Intelligence for attacks and Spell DCs, high Constitution for Concentration and at least 14 Dexterity for Medium Armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: We can leave this low, even if we want to use a Greatsword with Great Weapon Master, we can use Intelligence for that kind of stuff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Just get 14 for the Medium Armor cap.

Our AC can be much higher than the Defender\u2019s thanks to things like half-plate, a shield, and the Shield spell, so redirecting attacks to our better AC is smart and free advantage vs. small or smaller targets is nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, we take +2 Intelligence to cap it at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we take +2 Constitution for a score of 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At nineteenth level, we take +2 Constitution to cap our score at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infusions\">Infusions<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll actually have a lot of leeway for preferences with a lot of these Infusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our first batch of Infusions at 2nd level, we have our choice of weapon Infusions. For a standard melee option such as a Battleaxe or a Lance, <strong>Enhanced Weapon<\/strong> works great. If we\u2019re looking to ride around with a ranged weapon, <strong>Repeating Shot<\/strong> is the way to go just for simplifying ammunition. For a great hybrid of the two options, <strong>Returning Weapon<\/strong> on a thrown weapon like a Spear or Handaxe will work for both melee and ranged attacks, albeit at shorter ranges than the other Ranged options. Maybe take two of these so that we can share with a party member.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from a magical weapon, <strong>Enhanced Defense<\/strong> for better AC is always welcome. I suggest taking the <strong>Mind Sharpener<\/strong> as well to have on our list for something later when we have the Spell Storing item.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll gain more options at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, getting two more options each time, but only getting one more active Infusion each time as well, capping out at 6 simultaneously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixth level, we\u2019ll take the <strong>Pipes of Haunting<\/strong> with the <strong>Replicate Magic Item<\/strong> Infusion for three uses of Concentration-free Frightened per day. This is why we need at least one wind instrument proficiency. More importantly, instead of rolling to recharge it every day, we can just Replicate a brand new one with full charge. Especially compare this to the <strong>Spell-Refueling Ring<\/strong> which would only give one extra spell per day instead of the three haunting melodies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some parties, putting that ring on a full caster at this level is really strong, such as one more Spirit Guardians every day from the Cleric. Another good option is to take the <strong>Repulsion Shield<\/strong>, because that\u2019s additional AC on top of the <strong>Enhanced Defense<\/strong> on our body armor from earlier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tenth level it\u2019s the <strong>Winged Boots<\/strong> with another use of <strong>Replicate Magic Item<\/strong>. These can be put on the Steel Defender we\u2019re riding. Another good choice for now is the <strong>Cloak of Protection<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have four Infusion slots at this level, so a good setup with no sharing would be the weapon Infusion of your choice (keeping in mind that <strong>Repeating<\/strong> and <strong>Returning<\/strong> stay +1s while <strong>Enhanced Weapon<\/strong> grows to +2 at this level), <strong>Enhanced Defense<\/strong> which becomes a +2, <strong>Pipes of Haunting<\/strong>, and <strong>Cloak of Protection<\/strong>. If we find the <strong>Pipes<\/strong> not being useful, <strong>Winged Boots<\/strong> or <strong>Repulsion Shield<\/strong> are fine alternatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An important aside here is that tenth level Artificers gain the ability to craft Uncommon or lower Magic Items in \u00bc the time for half the gold. Winged Boots and Cloak of Protection are both Uncommon. That means in a single week you can make two at a cost of 100 GP each, not only freeing up your Infusion slots but also producing extra copies for the whole gang. (As per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/downtime-revisited#MagicItemCraftingTimeAndCost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xanathar\u2019s Guide<\/a> page 129.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might then ask why we\u2019re taking them as Infusions if we can make them? <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/crafting-rpgbot-podcast-s2e66\/\">5e\u2019s crafting rules<\/a> are frustrating. Magic Items require both a formula and special ingredients. Knowing the Infusion should in theory bypass the formula part, leaving you with just having to take down a CR 4-8 challenge for each craft. Also depending on the time crunch of the game, you might not have time to hunt down the materials so having at least the Infusion version for personal use is great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fourteenth level, we\u2019re eyeing that <strong>Ring of Protection<\/strong> from <strong>Replicate<\/strong>. Yeah I know we\u2019re kinda stacking AC hard but really we enjoy the additional +1 to all saves on top of the cloak. There is one more cool thing at this level, <strong>Arcane Propulsion Armor<\/strong>. This is an alternative to the weapon Infusions that grants force damage attacks. It might be worth using if you\u2019re using the <strong>Returning Weapon<\/strong> infusion as it becomes a straight upgrade to the other thrown weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Magical Tinkering<br><br>Spellcasting<br>Cantrips:<br>&#8211; Mending<br>&#8211; Firebolt<br>1st-level spells: <br>&#8211; Absorb Elements<br>&#8211; Cure Wounds<br>&#8211; Faerie Fire<br>&#8211; Grease<br><br>Skills<br>-Arcana<br>-Insight<br>-Investigation<br>-Perception<\/td><td>We don\u2019t have much at first level.

It\u2019s good to take if we intend to later hand a Concentration spell to a non-caster with the Spell-Storing Item, especially a class without Constitution proficiency like a Rogue.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Battle Smith<br>-Battle Ready<br>-Steel Defender<br>-Spells<br>-Smith\u2019s Tools<br><br>-Cantrip<br>&#8211; Maybe Switch Firebolt for Sword Burst<\/td><td>We finally get to be a Battle Smith.<br><br>Now we can use that nice Intelligence score for weapon attacks. With this change we might switch one of our Cantrips around, dropping Firebolt for Sword Burst, depending on our weapon of choice.<br><br>If we\u2019re going for a Lance or a Crossbow, then yes, switch it up to give us something to use against foes within 5 feet. If we\u2019re going for another melee option or the Returning weapon, then we may be better off keeping Firebolt for foes at longer ranges to avoid firing a weapon at long range.<br><br>We also get a robot pet, the Steel Defender, which can be whatever general shape we want as long as it\u2019s medium. One of the classical shapes is a dog for example, as seen in <a href=\"https:\/\/ddowiki.com\/page\/Iron_Defender_race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dungeons and Dragons: Online<\/a>.<br><br>We can ride the Steel Defender into battle as well now which is almost mandatory to use a Lance, but useful for every other option as well.<br><br>Heroism and Shield are now always prepared for us, too.

Also fun is putting Grease under the Web since Grease doesn\u2019t use Concentration. Restrained and Prone is hilarious.<br><br>Warding Bond can let us absorb some of the damage for an ally.

These fine options are better explained above.<br><br>We also get a 3rd cantrip, and Mage Hand offers some great utility.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spell-Storing Item<\/td><td>The Spell-Storing Item is one of the strongest features in the game. We can stuff a 1st or 2nd-level spell into a weapon to get extra casts out the other end.<br><br>We have some good options for this. The first option is to hand a Concentration spell to a non-caster to get an extra Concentration on the field. For this I recommend Web so that your Fighter-Man can be Spider-Man.<br><br>Another option is to put some normally self-targeting spell or other utility into the item. For Battle Smiths, the real trick here is to stuff Warding Bond into a Barbarian\u2019s axe or a Fighter\u2019s greatsword or something.<br><br>As an example, if the Barbarian targets the Fighter and then Rages, damage taken by the Fighter is halved, and then that halved damage is shared with the Barbarian. If the shared damage is a type (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/is-the-damage-type-of-hunters-mark-the-same-as-the-damage-type-of-the-weapon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all damage has a type in 5e<\/a>) and the Barbarian is resistant to that type via Rage, then the shared half would be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/warding-bond\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">halved again because it is a new instance of damage<\/a>.<br><br>Also keep in mind that, while the damage inherits the type from the original attack or spell, it also inherits being magical as the new damage is done by the Warding Bond spell. This means it bypasses resistance to non-magical BPS but it also gets universally halved if you hand this to an Oath of the Ancients Paladin because of their Aura of Warding.<br><br>If everyone else already has Concentration spells or is a Barbarian with Rage instead, then just stick Web in here and use it yourself as 10 extra casts of Web per day.
