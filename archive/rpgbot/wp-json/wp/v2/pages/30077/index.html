Darkvision is convenient. Healing Hands is a small heal once per day. Limited Flight or combat buffs at 3rd level is where most of this Species\u2019 power budget went. We won&#8217;t have the Charisma for Necrotic Shroud\u2019s save and the Inner Radiance is unfriendly to allies, so if we\u2019re stuck in close quarters it\u2019s going to be used as one minute of Flight per day. Not terrible.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragonborn<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Breath Attack for AoE damage, some resistance, Darkvision, and 10 minutes of Flight each day. The breath replaces one of our attacks, and we have a bonus that applies if we hit with at least one attack, so we have to weigh trading that attack away by making sure to get as many targets in the area as possible.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Resistance to Poison is decent, and having more HP goes great with Barbarian resistance.

We can\u2019t cast any of the spells Gnomes get during rage, but these spells are all out of combat utility spells so that\u2019s not really an issue.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Goliath<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fast, big, and has good options.

Nimbleness prevents foes from body-blocking us, which is great if we really need to be over there instead of over here. Lucky actually combines really well with Advantage (such as from Reckless Attack) because even if we\u2019ve already succeeded with one of our dice, we can reroll a 1 to fish for a 20. Naturally stealthy might seem like we can\u2019t use it, but remember that Primal Knowledge turns Stealth into a Strength check while we\u2019re Raging, and we have Advantage on those checks. What\u2019s more terrifying in the middle of a fight than losing track of the small ball of Rage that hits like a truck?\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Human<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>:: Yeah, it\u2019s ok. The Human\u2019s bonus feat is no longer as powerful as it was in the 2014 rules because of the limitation to Origin feats. Free Inspiration every morning is good and a bonus skill is good too. If you do want two different Origin Feats (or one that\u2019s incompatible with the backgrounds that fit with your stat requirements) then of course choose Human.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Orc<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Bonus action Dash and Once Per Day choose to not go down.

The Path of the Berserker doesn\u2019t change that fact. Dexterity and Constitution are also useful to increase our Armor Class and Hit Points. The only benefits we get from Mental scores are related to skills and saves, which isn\u2019t nothing, but it shouldn\u2019t be more important than our physical attributes. Remember to choose a background that includes at least Strength and either Dexterity or Constitution.

Additionally, this also doesn\u2019t work with Retaliation because the ability to do damage and grapple or shove at the same time is only during our own turn.

Luckily, we care more about the special options like Forceful Blow, which allows us to push a target up to 15 feet (with no size restrictions or anything) and then move up to half our speed directly toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

If we\u2019re choosing to make a Brutal swing the DPR is instead 34.68, a very small dip to add some useful rider effects. On top of that, with Retaliation and Sentinel, I would estimate that we can get a Reaction attack 75% of the time to account for the enemy missing and therefore failing to trigger the Reaction.<br>If we apply that to the raw DPR of 11.41 for the Reaction attack our total becomes 43.3075 DPR, or 43.2375 with Brutal Strike.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>4\/+3<\/td><td>Relentless Rage<\/td><td>Since we\u2019ll be drawing in so many attacks with Advantage from foes, having a little insurance to keep us on our feet when we get to 0 is very helpful.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>5\/+3<\/td><td>Crusher<br>+1 Strength (19=&gt;20)<\/td><td>We\u2019re taking Crusher because of our Hammer theme.

Crusher only allows moving a target up to one size larger than us.<br><br>As an alternative, using a Longsword and taking Slasher here will allow us to Hamstring our target and lower their speed. Where this can really come in handy is on Retaliation attacks.<br>Sentinel causes Opportunity Attacks to set the target to 0 speed, but Retaliation is not an Opportunity Attack. Having a chance to drop their speed by a little bit can still be enough to protect our allies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>5\/+3<\/td><td>Improved Brutal Strike<\/td><td>We gain additional toys to use with Brutal Strike. Staggering Blow can help set up an enemy with Disadvantage on a save. This might be the save vs Shield Master or the save vs Intimidating Presence when we acquire it next level. Alternatively the save might be vs something one of our allies does. Plenty of possibilities.<br><br>Sundering Blow can instead set one of our allies up for a solid hit on their next turn.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>5\/+3<\/td><td>Intimidating Presence<\/td><td>We can be really scary as a Bonus Action, forcing creatures within 30 feet to save or become Frightened.

It\u2019s a nice little bump and helps make up for the loss of Advantage, but remember that Brutal Strikes are more useful for the extra effects than for adding damage.<br><br>Checking in again with DPR now that we have changes to Rage Damage and Brutal Strike, we get a DPR of 40.49 when using Reckless Attacks to activate Frenzy. With the doubling of Brutal Strike dice, Brutal is now a DPR increase, hitting 43.75 DPR.<br>We\u2019ll continue to assume a 75% Reaction chance and apply it to the raw 12.29 DPR.

If we miss, use this on Brutal Strike to stack on the extra damage and special effects. If we hit, then save this for a Sentinel or Retaliation even if our second attack misses somehow.<br><br>If you expect your campaign to continue for a while once you hit level 20 so that we might get additional Epic Boons, we might instead use Boon of Combat Prowess to increase our Strength to 19, then allowing Primal Champion to raise it to 25. If you do this, replace Resilient at level 16 with a +2 Constitution increase or a feat that increase your Constitution by 1.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>6\/+4<\/td><td>Primal Champion<br>+4 Strength (20=&gt;24)<br>+4 Constitution (14=&gt;18)<\/td><td>24 Strength and 18 Constitution.

That increases a bit to 48.07 with Brutal Strike. The raw DPR of our Reaction by itself is 14.97, which we adjust to 75% and apply to the rest for our total of 57.4075 DPR or 59.2975 when we use Brutal Strikes.<br><br>As a point of comparison, if we had instead of Shield Master and Crusher, taken Polearm Master and Piercer with a Spear and Shield, our Reckless Frenzy DPR would be 58.27 increasing to 62.18 with Brutal Strikes. Our Reaction is then 14.28 raw DPR.<br><br>Using our 75% assumption from earlier, that puts the alternative DPR totals at 68.98 DPR or 72.89 with Brutal Strikes.
