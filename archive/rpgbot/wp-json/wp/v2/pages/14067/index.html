To that end, this oath gives a Paladin tools to put out plenty of damage on the battlefield.&nbsp; Pressure your foes with spells like Hunter\u2019s Mark and Haste while remaining incredibly mobile with access to spells like Misty Step and Dimension Door. Strike down your foes with the Vow of Enmity, which grants one minute of Advantage against one target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With all this offense, the Oath of Vengeance doesn\u2019t bring any party support or defense beyond the standard Paladin kit. Luckily, the standard Paladin has a lot of that already, so as long as you don\u2019t rush in with tunnel vision and blinders on you can easily be the party frontline. Just keep stock of your situation and only go ham when the moment is right. Or not, it\u2019s your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>For an example build, we\u2019ve got a striker who can stand toe-to-toe with the enemy, but also capable of making tactical strikes on the backline.

Hunter&#8217;s Mark is a nice damage boost\n\t\t\t\tagainst a single high-priority target, but its usefulness is limited by\n\t\t\t\tthe Paladin&#8217;s low number of attacks per round. It can still yield\n\t\t\t\tconsiderably more damage than spending the same spell slot on Divine\n\t\t\t\tSmite, but only if you can maintain Concentration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-Level<\/span>: Paralysis is an off-switch\n\t\t\t\tfor an enemy, but since your spell DC is low compared to a full\n\t\t\t\tspellcaster Hold Person is unrealiable. Misty Step is a great way to get\n\t\t\t\taround the battlefield, especially since it&#8217;s a Bonus Action to\n\t\t\t\tcast.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th-Level<\/span>: Haste and Protection From\n\t\t\t\tEnergy are two of the most important buffs in the game.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: Both situational\n\t\t\t\toptions, and the appeal of Dimension Door is reduced because you already\n\t\t\t\thave Misty Step.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th-Level<\/span>: Hold Monster makes Hold\n\t\t\t\tPerson redundant, but it&#8217;s a significant improvement. Unfortunately,\n\t\t\t\tyour spell save DC is likely still behind full spellcasters. Scrying is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational, and your full caster allies have had it for a very\n\t\t\t\tlong time by this level.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Channel Divinity<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Abjure Enemy<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\t\t\tthe spell Cause Feat, but the target doesn&#8217;t get additional saves and\n\t\t\t\ttheir speed is halved for the duration. This is especially useful\n\t\t\t\tagainst fiends and undead, but it works on anything that isn&#8217;t immune to\n\t\t\t\tfear.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vow of Enmity<\/span>: One minute of\n\t\t\t\tguaranteed Advantage against one target. Very helpful against powerful\n\t\t\t\tsingle foes. Use it early, use it often.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless Avenger<\/span>: Absolutely fantastic\n\t\tfor a Defender build, especially if you also have Polearm Master. Look for\n\t\tways to boost you speed like magic items or spells like Haste and\n\t\tLongstrider so that moving half your speed may be enough to keep the target\n\t\twithin your reach.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul of Vengeance<\/span>: An extra attack\n\t\tpresents a 50% boost to your damage output (provided that you&#8217;re not using\n\t\tsomething like two-weapon fighting or Polearm Master).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"20\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Avenging Angel<\/span>: For one hour a day you can\n\t\tchase your terrified foes around and murder them. The move speed is great,\n\t\tallowing you to quickly close to melee and get enemies within the aura. Most\n\t\tpaladin subclass capstone features only last one minute, so the fact that\n\t\tthis lasts for a full hour is incredible.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-vengeance-ability-scores\">Oath of Vengeance Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re a frontliner in Heavy Armor, so we need Strength and Constitution, as well as Charisma for many of our Paladin features as well as Spell DCs.

Because we\u2019re a prepared Divine caster and can change our spells on a daily basis, don\u2019t forget to refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/spells\/\">Paladin Spell List Breakdown<\/a> as well.<br><br>A great option for a spell to prepare is Shield of Faith. Cast as a bonus action with 60 ft of range to grant +2 AC to whoever needs it.<br><br>Dueling is a great fighting style when using Polearm Master with 1-handed options like Spear and Quarterstaff because the +2 damage applies to the bonus action attack as well.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Divine Health<br><br>Sacred Oath<br>-Oath of Vengeance<br><br>Channel Divinity<br>-Abjure Enemy<br>-Vow of Enmity<br><br>Oath Spells<\/td><td>Divine Health is just nice to have, even if it rarely comes up.<br>We take our Sacred Oath of Vengeance, gaining our Channel Divinity features and our Oath Spells.<br><br>Most of the time, we\u2019ll be spending Channel Divinity on Vow of Enmity to get Advantage for a minute against one target.<br><br>For spells, we gain access to Bane and Hunter\u2019s Mark. Of the two, Hunter\u2019s Mark is more likely to be useful to us. Adding +1d6 to all weapon attacks is great, but having to spend that bonus action to move the mark when changing targets is a Polearm Master swing we can\u2019t take, so we\u2019ll have to be aware of that. If we can get the mark on a target before it triggers our Polearm Master opportunity attack, then we can offset this problem.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>ASI: Strength +2 (16=&gt;18)<\/td><td>Get stronger for better attacks and more damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-2nd-level spells<\/td><td>Swing twice for even more damage.<br><br>Find Steed becomes an option for Paladins with 2nd-level spells, but more importantly our Oath Spells include Hold Person and Misty Step. Because any spell we cast that targets only us, also targets our Find Steed, Misty Step will bring a Find Steed mount along for the ride.<br><br>Hold Person is ok, but our DC is probably lower than would make Hold Person a great choice. Misty Step on the other hand is an excellent way to move around the battlefield. Is there an enemy caster in the backline that you need to drop? Misty Step and double Smite with Extra Attack.<br><br>If it starts to be a bit annoying to juggle Hunter\u2019s Mark, Magic Weapon is a fine alternative, making our weapon act as a +1 weapon.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Aura of Protection<\/td><td>Our Charisma modifier is added to saves now. This helps us out because we do have a few nice Concentration spells we don\u2019t want to drop and it will be a few levels before we pick up proficiency in Con saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Relentless Avenger<\/td><td>This triggers on Opportunity Attacks, and the reaction attack from Polearm Master is an Opportunity Attack. We can use this to reposition more freely in combat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient (Constitution)<\/td><td>We\u2019re getting Constitution proficiency to make it even harder for foes to break our Concentration. We can make up for not bumping Strength with either Magic Weapon or Elemental Weapon when we get 3rd-level spells since both of those spells will give us a +1 to attack rolls so that we\u2019re not falling behind the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math<\/a>.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-3rd-Level Spells<\/td><td>Great spells at this level include Elemental Weapon, Haste, and Protection from Energy.<br><br>Elemental Weapon is a great replacement for Hunter\u2019s Mark. The 1d4 damage is smaller, but no longer requires juggling, and the +1 to attacks is very useful.<br><br>Haste is also nice, but be careful as the penalty for dropping Concentration is steep.<br><br>Protection from Energy is a great option when riding our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/summoning\/#find-steed\">Find Steed<\/a> in situations where our mount might take damage, since we can share the spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Aura of Courage<\/td><td>You, your horse, and all allies within 10 feet of you are immune to fear. Good thing because being scared is really penalizing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Improved Divine Smite<\/td><td>More damage on every attack. Both of our attacks with Extra Attack, our Bonus bonk, our reaction attacks, and if we\u2019re Hasted, one more swing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Strength (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>More strength for better attack rolls and more damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-4th-Level Spells<\/td><td><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/summoning\/#find-greater-steed\">Find Greater Steed<\/a> for super horse.<br>Dimension Door gives us even more mobility, opening up an option to bring along an ally.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Cleansing Touch<\/td><td>Get rid of bad magic. Boring but practical.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Soul of Vengeance<\/td><td>Now when we use the Vow of Enmity, we get free reaction attacks whenever our target makes an attack.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Charisma (16=&gt;18)<\/td><td>Improve our Aura of Protection, and our Spell DCs.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-5th-Level Spells<\/td><td>5th-level spells are great, and Holy Weapon is one of the best buffs when swinging weapons as often as we do, but also available to us is Hold Monster.<br><br>Because our Charisma is 18, we shouldn\u2019t have much trouble using Hold Monster now and then.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Aura Improvements<\/td><td>Better range for Aura of Protection and Aura of Courage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Charisma (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>Improve our Aura of Protection and our Spell DCs again.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Avenging Angel<\/td><td>Flying and a fear aura for an hour each day. Nice capstone, but we already had access to Flying mounts from Find Greater Steed, and the fear wears off when someone takes damage.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Both their fates together in a Knot that they can never quite untie Ever since it started in that Single fateful moment there in time Sono Chi No Sadame (Eng) &#8211; Jonathan Young Introduction The Oath of Vengeance is to hound one\u2019s sworn foes in merciless pursuit and deliver swift justice.
