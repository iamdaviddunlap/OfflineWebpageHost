The Barbarian has a tendency to be a glass cannon despite their formidable hit points because they go through hit points to quickly, so be sure to bring a healer along, and invest in wands of Cure Light Wounds for cheap healing between encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of &#8220;Rage Cycling&#8221; is mentioned in many Barbarian discussions. Rage Cycling the practice of ending a rage and immediately starting a new one. This is impossible for a normal Barbarian because ending a rage makes the Barbarian fatigued, so Rage Cycling depends on immunity to fatigue. Rage Cycling is not essential by any means, but it opens up some interesting options with Rage Powers which only function once per rage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the vanilla Barbarian.
