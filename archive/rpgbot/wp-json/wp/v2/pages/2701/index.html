They&#8217;re the first entry in the Monster\n\tManual. They&#8217;re the first playable race in 5e that could be considered an\n\tanthromorph (an animal person). They&#8217;re the first playable race with flight.\n\tThey&#8217;re the first race banned from Adventurer&#8217;s League. All exciting stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, Aarakocra are frustratingly bland. They get ability score increases, flight, talons, and a disappointing innate spell that you&#8217;ll rarely use. They&#8217;re a flying stat block. You play an Aarakocra either because you want to be a flying bird person or because you want flight at first level and don&#8217;t particularly care where it comes from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this blandness, Aarakocra are extremely powerful for a variety of builds, even without the custom origin rules or the updated racial traits. Dexterity and Wisdom is an excellent combination of ability score increases, and racial flight is insanely powerful, especially at a whopping 50 ft. of fly speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Before we look at class options, I want to take a moment to explain exactly why flight is such a big deal. In many encounters, it&#8217;s a guaranteed win condition. Armed with a ranged weapon and sufficient ammunition (or a good cantrip like Eldritch Blast), a flying humanoid can eventually kill anything that can&#8217;t find a way to get full cover. The flyer can easily chase enemies around above ground and wear them down while safely well out of the defender&#8217;s range unless the defender can also fly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in enclosed spaces like a dungeon, a high ceiling can easily put the flying creature well out of their enemies&#8217; reach. Most creatures in the monster manual lack a method to counter the simple issue of an enemy being 5 feet too high for the monster to attack them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize: Aarakocra can fly directly above most of the monster manual and kill the monster regardless of CR solely because you can fly and most monsters can&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the updated version of the Aarakocra published in Monsters of the Multiverse, you should understand how Gust of Wind works. It makes it difficult for enemies to approach you, but remember that it has an Action casting time and doesn&#8217;t do anything when you cast it except push creatures in the initial area of effect.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#aarakocra-lore\">Aarakocra Lore<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#versions\">Aarakocra Versions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-custom-origin\">Aarakocra Classes (Customizable Origins and MMoM)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-classic\">Aarakocra Classes (Classic Rules)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Aarakocra Feats<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Keep in mind that the state of the meta periodically changes as new source materials are released, and the article will be updated accordingly as time allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"aarakocra-lore\">Aarakocra Lore<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Hailing primarily from the elemental plane of air, Aarakocra serve the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, serving as scouts and soldiers in their eternal war against elemental evil. On their home plane, Aarakocra often spend days or months flying, landing only to care for their young. Aarakocra raised in the plain of air might find the material plane very strange with its strict gravity and relative lack of wind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aarakocra that live on the material plane prefer to occupy high mountain peaks, especially those near portals to the plane of air. Aarakocra live in small tribes, sharing a single enormous nest. These tribes are led by their eldest member with the support of a shaman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they have spent time among other races, Aarakocra generally have no concept of ownership of property. This can bring them into conflict with societies that value property ownership and that engage in tasks like animal husbandry and agriculture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aarakocra are extremely rare in the Forgotten Realms, having only a handful of known settlements in the official lore. They are not mentioned in other official settings.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"versions\">Aarakocra Versions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There are effectively three versions of the Aarakocra. The original was published in the Elemental Evil Player&#8217;s Companion alongside genasi and goliaths, making the Aarakocra among the first non-core races to appear in 5th edition. They were later reprinted in Explorer&#8217;s Guide to Wildemount without any changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything introduced the option Customizing Your Origin rules, which gave us the second version and allowing players to reassign the Aarakocra&#8217;s ability score increases, effectively making them a blank template with flight as their only racial trait.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/motm\/fantastical-races#Aarakocra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Monsters of the Multiverse<\/a> re-published the Aarakocra, making a major change to their racial traits. In addition to the standard changes (1d6 damage from all natural weapons, everyone gets their choice of +2\/+1 or three +1 increases), the Aarakocra&#8217;s speeds were changed to 30 ft. for both land and fly speed, and they gained the ability to cast Gust of Wind as an innate spell.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-custom-origin\">Aarakocra Classes (Customizable Origins and MMoM)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The updates to the Aarakocra in Monsters of the Multiverse does change their traits, but it doesn&#8217;t change which options work well for the Aarakocra. Gust of Wind isn&#8217;t something that you can build a character around, so the Aarakocra is still basically just a generic flying race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This section assumes that you&#8217;re using the option updated versions of the race, including the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/character-options#CustomizingYourOrigin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Customizing Your Origin<\/a>&#8221; rules presented in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything and\/or the updated version published in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/motm\/fantastical-races\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monsters of the Multiverse<\/a>. Because the race changed so little between those two versions, I have decided to combine these two sections. If you&#8217;re not using those rules, scroll down to the &#8220;Classic Rules&#8221; section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"artificer\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\">Artificer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>+2 int, +1 con, and flight, but only in light or no armor.

This is less amusing if you&#8217;re using the updated version of the Aarakocra since their fly speed is only 30 feet, but Unarmored Movement does still improve your fly speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"paladin\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\">Paladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>+2 Dex, +1 Con or Cha, and flight.

Paladins, like barbarians, are mostly locked into melee. You could build a Charisma-heavy build thanks to Fighting Style (Blessed Warrior) to build around cantrips and spellcasting, but at that point why not just play a cleric or a divine soul sorcerer?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ranger\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\">Ranger<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>+2 dex, +1 con, and flight.
