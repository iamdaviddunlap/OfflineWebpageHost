Unlike many domains, the main power comes not from a feature, but from your Channel Divinity option. Path to the Grave is a powerhouse, providing an enormous boost to damage for a single attack for anyone in your party. This can feel like a class pigeon-holed into being a backline, somewhat mechanically boring upport Cleric whose main job is making everyone else feel safe and powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>You absolutely can play it that way and have a lot of fun.

As a 1st-level spell it will\n\t\t\t\t\teventually become a trivial expenditure of your daily spellcasting.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen you get to high levels, casting this before your first and after every fight\n\t\t\t\t\tis a great use of a spell slot. Oh, and you get some other spell\n\t\t\t\t\tthat&#8217;s already on your spell list that I don&#8217;t care for.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">3rd Level<\/span>: Both spells are\n\t\t\t\t\tsituational, and neither is particularly good.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Revivify is a cleric tax,\n\t\t\t\t\tand every cleric should take it because it&#8217;s too good to not do so.\n\t\t\t\t\tVampiric Touch is a great option if you get dragged into melee, but\n\t\t\t\t\ttry to avoid needing it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">7th Level<\/span>: A decent damage option\n\t\t\t\t\tthat&#8217;s not on the Cleric spell list, and a crucial buff with a nice,\n\t\t\t\t\tlong duration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Antilife Shell is a\n\t\t\t\t\tfantastic defensive option which will keep melee enemies at bay while\n\t\t\t\t\tyou kill them with ranged spells.

The\n\t\t\tdifference in the amount healed between Cure Wounds and Healing Word can\n\t\t\tbe significant, especially if you up-cast the spells. This on its own is\n\t\t\tgreat, but it only marginally improves the tactical benefit of in-combat\n\t\t\thealing. The ability to use Spare the Dying at range as a Bonus Action is\n\t\t\tintended to fill in for Healing Word so that Cure Wounds is more\n\t\t\tappealing, but personally I still think that Healing Word is a better\n\t\t\ttactical option in most cases.\n<p>You can notably choose to cast Spare the\n\t\t\tDying as either an Action or a Bonus Action, which is neat if you want to\n\t\t\tdo something like cast Sacred Flame (an Action) in the same turn. Just\nremember that if you cast any spell as a Bonus Action, including a cantrip, you can&#8217;t cast leveled\nspells that turn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Circle of Mortality can be abused by taking allies who are at very few\n\t\t\t\thit points and beating them unconscious to get extra free healing, which\n\t\t\t\tcan be cathartic, but your allies may be nervous about allowing you to\n\t\t\t\tdo so and your DM might get ideas about imposing a drawback of some\n\t\t\t\tkind.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Eyes of the Grave<\/span>: Detect Evil is on the\n\t\t\tCleric spell list, and does the same thing, but detects more creatures.\n\t\t\tSure, the area is smaller, but that doesn&#8217;t seem like enough to make this\n\t\t\tmeaningful.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave<\/span>: Use\n\t\t\tthis with a rogue or with a spellcaster with a high-damage spell that\n\t\t\trequires an attack like Inflict Wounds.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sentinel at Death&#8217;s Door<\/span>: Critical hits\n\t\t\ton your allies can turn a tough fight into a crushing defeat in a single\n\t\t\troll. Abilities which mitigate critical hits are few and far between,\n\t\t\tmaking this a rare and potent defensive option.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\t\tcan easily have 20 Wisdom, giving an excellent boost to your damage\n\t\t\toutput. Note that this only applies to Cleric cantrips, so you can&#8217;t use\n\t\t\tit in conjunction with Magic Initiate or cantrips gained by\n\t\t\tmulticlassing.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Keeper of Souls<\/span>: This probably won&#8217;t\n\t\t\tprovide a significant amount of healing, but it&#8217;s a fun passive ability\n\t\t\tand it might even allow you to rescue an ally at 0 hit points without\n\t\t\tcutting into your actions on your turn.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"grave-domain-ability-scores\">Grave Domain Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from other medium-armored Clerics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Take it to 14, ignore it forever<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Protects against the most important status effect &#8211; death.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: The Cleric\u2019s spells and class features are powered by Wisdom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"grave-domain-races\">Grave Domain Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from other Clerics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"grave-domain-feats\">Grave Domain Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on party composition, there\u2019s one feat that shines for Grave clerics more than others: Metamagic Adept.

If that\u2019s the case, you spend a lot more time coordinating your uses of Channel with your allies, particularly those with huge single attacks like Rogues.

If you\u2019d rather have this be two combat tricks, you can instead Extend the casting of Command to be two rounds. Using the Flee option on something for two rounds instead of one is nearly a kill spell because it will be gone from the fight for longer than an average fight (remember that they need to run back to the fight, which takes just as long).&nbsp;<br><br>Circle of Mortality means you can prepare Cure Wounds instead of Healing Word and get more healing out of standing someone up after a fight. At this level, with your 17 Wisdom, 11 hp will put all but the beefiest characters back to full and you can do that on a turn when you\u2019re not trying to set something on fire or remind it for whom the bell tolls.<br><br>Eyes of the Grave means we don\u2019t- just kidding, no one would ever prepare this Detect spell anyway.<br><br>We walk out with Scale Mail and a Shield for a total 18 AC, putting us on par with a standard frontliner and therefore unafraid to wade in and deliver these touch-range Inflicts.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2- Cleric 2<\/td><td>Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave<\/td><td>Now it really comes down to finding the biggest thing on the battlefield and telling it the Path to the Grave is your fist full of necrotic damage. The 33 average damage dealt by a Channel -&gt; Quickened Inflict combo is enough to oneshot fully 75% of monsters CR2 or lower; if you only count CR 2 monsters we still murder over a third of the published monsters in one turn. We can only do this once a day right now, but we\u2019ll work on fixing that in a few levels. In the meantime, when our Channel recharges during the rather-likely short rest that happens in the day, use it for a big attack from your martial friends.<br><br>Because the main feature of this build is your Channel, strongly advocate for short rests between fights. Things will start to break down pretty hard for your numbers if you don\u2019t have your Channels. This is also required for recharging your Sorcery Points later on since you will never be able to hold more than 4 at once throughout your career and the math later on assumes you use all 4 every fight.<br><br>Remember that while your Channel Divinity is on cooldown, you\u2019re still a cleric. You can still rely on cleric staples like Bless, Spiritual Weapon, and Spirit Guardians.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 &#8211; Cleric 3<\/td><td>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Gentle Repose<br>&#8211; Ray of Enfeeblement<\/td><td>You may start encountering things that resist Necrotic damage. They\u2019re basically all undead, but regardless, the number of things that resist that <em>and<\/em> Radiant damage is almost exclusively Aasimar NPCs. If you run into something that you think might be so profoundly shadowy as to resist your Inflict, hit it with Guiding Bolt instead.<br><br>Speaking of spells, you get second-level slots. You also get second-level spells, but, astonishingly, there are no spells above first level that require an attack roll and deal all of their damage at once. Acid Arrow does the largest amount of upfront damage and Scorching Ray does more total damage, but the wording on Path to the Grave is that it applies for a single Attack, not a single triggering event. What this means is that we can prepare staples like Lesser Restoration and Spiritual Weapon, but we\u2019re always going to want to save that highest-level slot for an upcast Inflict.<br>&nbsp;<br>I\u2019m going to start using DPR (meaning accuracy is included) now instead of just average damage, because low-levels are pretty dependent on dice but we need to measure ourselves against real strikers here and see how we\u2019re doing. One-round DPR for a Channel into Quickened Inflict goes from 23 to 30 at this level with a 2nd-level Inflict Wounds.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 &#8211; Cleric 4<\/td><td>Fey-Touched (+1 Wis):<br>&#8211; Hex<\/td><td>Remember how we need to take one attack and make it huge? Hex is the way to do it right now. Turn one, Hex something and Sacred Flame something else (since Sacred Flame won\u2019t apply the Hex damage anyway and we\u2019re honor-bound to only attack something once), next turn big punch it. That takes the one-turn DPR up to 35.5.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 &#8211; Cleric 5<\/td><td>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Revivify<br>&#8211; Vampiric touch<\/td><td>I can\u2019t physically stop you from preparing Spirit Guardians and turning a fight into a slowed blender, but I would like to try.<br><br>One neat trick is that, thanks to the wording on Vampiric Touch, if you quicken it, you can use your action on the turn you cast it to attack with it again, getting 6d6 of possible damage (average 21) and therefore 10 points of healing back.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 &#8211; Cleric 6<\/td><td>Destroy Undead (CR \u00bd)<br><br>Channel Divinity (2\/rest)<br><br>Sentinel at Death\u2019s Door<\/td><td>Sentinel at Death\u2019s Door is an incredible feature until <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/one-dd-playtest-unearthed-arcana-character-origins\/\">OneD&amp;D<\/a> happens and maybe makes it do literally nothing. At least for now, you can protect your party from stray crits. The fact that you get a scaling number of these per day is going to be almost irrelevant, but it can certainly feel good to shut down your DM when they\u2019re on a hot streak or when the Assassin NPC comes a-knockin.<br><br>The bigger deal here is that we get a second Channel per short rest. This means that we can apply vulnerability twice in a fight, potentially vastly increasing the damage we can deal. We can still only Quicken once per day, though. How do we fix that?<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 &#8211; Sorcerer 1<\/td><td>Cantrips:<br>&#8211; Prestidigitation<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/mage-hand\/\">Mage Hand<\/a><br>&#8211; True Strike<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/shape-water\/\">Shape Water<\/a><br><br>Spells:<br>&#8211; Bless<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\">Silvery Barbs<\/a><br>&#8211; Cure Wounds (Affinity)<br><br>Favored by the Gods<\/td><td>Did I really just write True Strike into a serious optimization guide? Yes, I did. The turn before we want to do our big punch, action True Strike and bonus action Hex (either casting or moving) sets us up. Then we follow up with a Channel -&gt; Quickened 4th-level Inflict for a staggering 62 average damage (which is only barely over the actual DPR of 61.38 thanks to the advantage massively increasing the hit and crit chance).<br><br>It was pointed out to me by a member of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/rpgbot\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/rpgbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patron Discord<\/a> that this doesn&#8217;t actually work because True Strike is, for some reason, a Concentration spell, as if it wasn&#8217;t already bad enough. On the one hand, since Hex only accounts for 2d6 damage across the 3-turn fight, you probably get more damage out of the True Strike because advantage on a huge number is much more impactful. On the other hand, you might be able to convince your DM to just let you have both because it&#8217;s not like this is going to be game-breaking, especially when you&#8217;re doing this instead of being a bugbear shooting a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/bugbear-y-me-in-damage\/#example-build-1-ambush-caster\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/bugbear-y-me-in-damage\/#example-build-1-ambush-caster\">million lasers<\/a>.<br><br>You may rightly call out that this only averages out to 30 DPR over the first two rounds, and we can <em>still<\/em> only do it once per day. You\u2019re right, but bear with me. Favored by the Gods is going to mean it basically never misses (the DPR is actually higher than the average damage if we assume we\u2019ll use it when needed), and even 30 DPR gets us into \u201cHigh DPR\u201d range at this level. That then leaves us a turn to be supportive at the end of the average fight, using our bonus action to stabilize someone and Toll the Dead to finish off something wounded (not by us, we killed our target).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 &#8211; Sorcerer 2<\/td><td>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Absorb Elements<br><br>Font of Magic<\/td><td><em>Oh boy.<\/em><br><br>So, we now have 4 Sorcery points per day natively and can convert spell slots into more of them. Like I talked about in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/sorcadin-handbook\/\">Sorcadin Handbook<\/a>, we\u2019re going to assume there are nine rounds of combat a day. Burning all but one 1st-level slot and one 2nd-level slot for points gets us up to 13, allowing us to quicken 6 times a day with a point left over in case something needs to be Extended. We, conveniently, have 8 slots of various levels left over. Spend a 3rd-level for an all-day Hex and then use the rest as follows.<br><br>Rounds one and two look like I described above. Round three is now Channel at a different target, followed up with another Quickened Inflict, this time backed by Favored by the Gods since you don\u2019t have advantage from True Strike. The slots we have for that are two 4th-level, two 3rd-level, and two 2nd-level.<br><br>The math works out to just shy of 40 DPR in the first two fights (taking into account the 0-damage setup turn) and a bit over 32 in the last fight, for a total over 37. Why is that number important? Because it means we\u2019re 20% ahead of \u201cHigh DPR\u201d according to the chart in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math<\/a> page while both behind on our fundamental math and doing it to a single target, something that\u2019s much more valuable since it means we can do boring Spirit Guardians <em>or<\/em> murder things like a Rogue.<br><br>I do unfortunately have to point out that casting Spirit Guardians and then using subsequent turns to Channel for a real Rogue is substantially more DPR than this if that Rogue is even remotely optimized, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019re here for a five-finger death punch.<br><br>Special callout: If you can use your remaining slot in the last fight on a Silvery Barbs between your second and third turn, you can up the DPR a bit by giving yourself a higher crit chance.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 &#8211; Cleric 7<\/td><td>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Blight<br>&#8211; Death Ward<\/td><td>If only Blight was an attack roll. Anyway, we get an extra 4th-level and a 5th-level slot. That increases our total DPR by 27%, bringing us over the baseline. Also, as a reminder, we do it by doing an average of over 80 damage on turn two. Sadly, this is an exponential game and you\u2019re trying to compete with linear progression. Fortunately, we just learned last level that we can do consecutive normal punches.<br><br>There are still 5 entries in the DnDBeyond monster search which you can kill in one shot with that average damage at CR 9, but one of them is immune to necrotic (although conveniently already vulnerable to Radiant, removing the need to Channel since it can\u2019t be vulnerable twice), and the other three you\u2019d actually fight are all NPC wizards.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; Cleric 8<\/td><td>Wis 18 -&gt; 20<br><br>Destroy Undead (CR 1)<br><br>Potent Spellcasting<\/td><td>The 4.3% DPR increase from capping Wisdom and the 8.7% DPR increase from spell slots combine to slightly more than 13% (because math), enough to keep us over baseline for the next 3 levels.

Alternatively, you can pour alchemist\u2019s fire on yourself, spend combat on fire, then extinguish yourself when everything is dead (except hopefully you). The only issue with that is that Fire is a very commonly resisted damage type while Acid is much less so. Just something to keep in mind.<br><br>I didn\u2019t call this out earlier because of spell slot constrictions.
