If you consider innate spells, avoid anything that requires an attack roll or a saving throw.

These resistances will often match your level, which exceeds the damage resistances you might get from your Ancestry or Heritage. That said, your access to these resistances is determined in part by your choices within the class, so using your Ancestry and Heritage is a great way to get resistances that you won&#8217;t be able to get from your class options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\"><h2>Table of Contents<\/h2><nav><ul><li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a><ul><li><a href=\"#anadi-me-rare\">Anadi<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#android-ag-rare\">Android<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#automaton-gg-rare\">Automaton<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#azarketi-aclo-ag-uncommon\">Azarketi<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#catfolk-apg-uncommon\">Catfolk<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#conrasu-me-rare\">Conrasu<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#dwarf-crb\">Dwarf<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#elf-crb\">Elf<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#fetchling-ag-uncommon\">Fetchling<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#fleshwarp-ag-rare\">Fleshwarp<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#ghoran-il-rare\">Ghoran<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#gnoll-me-uncommon\">Gnoll<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#gnome-crb\">Gnome<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#goloma-me-rare\">Goloma<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#grippli-me-uncommon\">Grippli<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#halfling-crb\">Halfling<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#hobgoblin-cg-uncommon\">Hobgoblin<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#human-crb\">Human<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#kashrishi-il-rare\">Kashrishi<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#kitsune-ag-uncommon\">Kitsune<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#kobold-apg-uncommon\">Kobold<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#leshy-cg-uncommon\">Leshy<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#lizardfolk-cg-uncommon\">Lizardfolk<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#nagaji-il-uncommon\">Nagaji<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#orc-apg-uncommon\">Orc<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#poppet-gb-rare\">Poppet<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#ratfolk-apg-uncommon\">Ratfolk<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#shisk-me-rare\">Shisk<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#shoony-pf-153-rare\">Shoony<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#skeleton-bot-d-rare\">Skeleton<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#sprite-ag-rare\">Sprite<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#strix-ag-rare\">Strix<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#tengu-apg-uncommon\">Tengu<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#vanara-il-uncommon\">Vanara<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#vishkanya-il-rare\">Vishkanya<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><a href=\"#versatile-heritages\">Versatile Heritages<\/a><ul><li><a href=\"#aasimar-apg-uncommon\">Aasimar<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#aphorite-ag-uncommon\">Aphorite<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#ardande-geniekin-ro-e-uncommon\">Ardande Geniekin<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#beastkin-ag-rare\">Beastkin<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#changeling-apg-uncommon\">Changeling<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#dhampir-apg-uncommon\">Dhampir<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#duskwalker-apg-uncommon\">Duskwalker<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#ganzi-ag-uncommon\">Ganzi<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#ifrit-ag-uncommon\">Ifrit<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#oread-ag-uncommon\">Oread<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#reflection-da-rare\">Reflection<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#suli-ag-uncommon\">Suli<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#sylph-ag-uncommon\">Sylph<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#talos-geniekin-ro-e-uncommon\">Talos Geniekin<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#tiefling-apg-uncommon\">Tiefling<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"#undine-ag-uncommon\">UndineAG (Uncommon)<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.
