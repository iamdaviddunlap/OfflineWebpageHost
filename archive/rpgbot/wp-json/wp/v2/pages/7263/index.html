It appears that you\n\t\t\t\tcan get more temporary hit points than the target&#8217;s current hit points\n\t\t\t\t(other spell&#8217;s like the Undead Bloodline&#8217;s Drain Life specify how they\n\t\t\t\twork in this case), so you may be able to use your bag of rats and\n\t\t\t\tVampiric Touch a rat right before jumping into combat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"4\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=48\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Confusion<\/a>: I am extremely nervous about the Confused condition because it leaves\n\t\t\t\troom for the GM to interpret it in a way that&#8217;s deliberately unhelpful.\n\t\t\t\tYour best-case scenario for this is to cast Confusion on an enemy who is\n\t\t\t\tin a crowd of other enemies so that they have numerous targets to attack\n\t\t\t\twho aren&#8217;t you or your allies.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Tentacles<\/a>: Excellent area control with a duration long enough to get through a\n\t\t\t\tfight, and you don&#8217;t need to Sustain it. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t work\n\t\t\t\tin mid-air, and after the initial casting targets need to end their turn\n\t\t\t\tin the effect to be affected, so it&#8217;s very difficult to hit additional\n\t\t\t\ttargets.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"6\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feeblemind<\/a>: Save-or-suck for spellcasters. This is situaitonal by design, but\n\t\t\t\tspellcasters are common enough and powerful enough that this might still\n\t\t\t\tsee some use. The effects are excellent, and despite having the\n\t\t\t\tIncapacitation trait, hoping for a standard Failure is enough to\n\t\t\t\tmassively inhibit powerful enemy spellcasters. Against non-spellcasters,\n\t\t\t\tthe critical failure effect is still a significant debuff, but it&#8217;s hard\n\t\t\t\tto gamble on a critical failure.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warp Mind<\/a>: I already don&#8217;t trust the\n\t\tConfused condition, and this is the Confusion spell but 3 levels higher and\n\t\twith the option of a permanent duration and it has the Incapacitation trait,\n\t\tso against major enemies which you would actually care about making\n\t\tpermanently confused it&#8217;s actually less effective than Confusion.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"8\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=347\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uncontrollable Dance<\/a>: Forcing the target to spend several of their Actions to &#8220;dance&#8221; means\n\t\t\t\tthat they&#8217;re not spending those Actions hurting you, and spending 2\n\t\t\t\tActions to cost your target 3 or more is a decent trait. The target also\n\t\t\t\tloses the ability to Step, which may be as impactful as the Actions\n\t\t\t\twhich they must spend dancing. Where this spell struggles is finding a\n\t\t\t\tsuitable target on which to use it. This is single-target with the\n\t\t\t\tIncapacitation trait, which makes it hard to find targets who are both\n\t\t\t\tpowerful enough to justify the spell slot and who are going to fail the\n\t\t\t\tsave often enough to risk this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=349\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unathomable Song<\/a>: The effects are unpredictable, which makes me very nervous, but\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;re still good enough that you should be able to seriously inhibit\n\t\t\t\tthe targets. Since this can target five creatures and has the\n\t\t\t\tIncapacitation trait, your best bet is to use this in encounters with\n\t\t\t\tnumerous relatively weak foes (ideally 5, but I would be happy with 4\n\t\t\t\ttargets), and keep this running as long as you have enough targets\n\t\t\t\taffected to justify it. Keep in mind that a Critical Success on the\n\t\t\t\tsubsequent saves still makes the target immune to the spell so they&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tno longer in your pool of affected targets, so you <em>really<\/em> don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\twant t use this on targets that are high enough level that the\n\t\t\t\tIncapacitation trait applies<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Bloodline Spells<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=517\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Initial: Tentacular Limbs<\/a>: Extending the reach of touch spells beyond 5 feet allows you to use\n\t\t\t\tthem without getting into melee and potentially provoking Reactions, not\n\t\t\t\tto mention the Actions you don&#8217;t spend to Stride in and out of reach.\n\t\t\t\tTouch spells don&#8217;t make up a huge proportion of your spell list, but the\n\t\t\t\tAberrant Bloodline&#8217;s spell list includes touch spells at levels 1, 2,\n\t\t\t\tand 3, so you&#8217;re going to get some use out of this at low levels even if\n\t\t\t\tit falls out of favor at higher levels when your options are more\n\t\t\t\tdiverse.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=491\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced: Aberrant Whispers<\/a>: I love the concept and the mechanics of this spell, but the effects\n\t\t\t\taren&#8217;t good enough. Stupefied is a nice bebuff if you can follow this\n\t\t\t\twith another spell that targets Will saves, but it&#8217;s difficult to fit\n\t\t\t\tthe Actions for Aberrant Whispers and the Actions for another spell into\n\t\t\t\tthe same turn. There&#8217;s also no more than a 50% chance that targets will\n\t\t\t\tbe stupified simply due to the d20 scale and PF2&#8217;s mechanics for degrees\n\t\t\t\tof success. Creatures which critically fail are Confused, which is a\n\t\t\t\tvery different outcome, and might leave you surrounded by enemies\n\t\t\t\tattacking targets (including you) at random. Your best-case scenario for\n\t\t\t\tthis spell is to cast it when you&#8217;re surrounded by a mob of enemies,\n\t\t\t\tthen either follow it with an AOE spell which targets Will saves or flee\n\t\t\t\tthe area depending on the results of your targets&#8217; saves.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Unusual Anatomy<\/a>: A decent defensive buff, especially for a 1-Action casting cost.

The majority of\n\t\tencounters won&#8217;t involve Will saves, and even against foes who target Will\n\t\tsaves your enemies may be able to pivot to other options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"angelic\" class=\"rating-blue\">Angelic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The go-to option for a sorcerer seeking to fill the role in a party typically filled by a cleric. The Granted Spells offer a good selection of iconic spells from the Divine Spell List, and while they&#8217;re not all amazing options, you get a lot of staples, leaving you plenty of room to diversify the rest of your Spell Repertoire. The Angelic Bloodline&#8217;s Focus Spells complement the rest on the subclass nicely, and provide some powerful tactical options that you can expect to use frequently and to great effect. Even the skills are good, and fit the theme and the role very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken as a whole, this is an excellent bloodline with a lot to offer. It does exactly what you want in a way that&#8217;s both effective and easy to play. You could drop an angelic bloodline sorcerer into a party in place of a back-line cleric with little difficulty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several of the Angelic Bloodline&#8217;s spells rely on your deity&#8217;s alignment,\n\tyour party members&#8217; alignments, and your enemies&#8217; alignments. For the maximum\n\tbenefits, choose a deity that&#8217;s at one of the extremes (lawful-good,\n\tchaotic-good, lawful-evil, chaotic-evil), play in a party that shares your\n\tdeity&#8217;s alignment, and face enemies that oppose your deity&#8217;s alignment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Spell List<\/strong>: Divine<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Bloodline Skills<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diplomacy<\/span>: The king of Face skills.

This doesn&#8217;t have the Incapacitation trait, so\n\t\t\t\tagainst enemies with poor Fortitude saves it&#8217;s a great way to rob them\n\t\t\t\tof some Actions if you get lucky and they roll a Critical Failure.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flame Strike<\/a>: 2d6 less damage than Fireball cast the same level and a smaller AOE,\n\t\t\t\tbut ignoring resistance and bypassing Immunity can easily make up the\n\t\t\t\tdifference in base damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"6\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blade Barrier<\/a>: Good area control, good damage of a good type, and a good duration\n\t\t\t\twithout needing to Sustain the spell. The 3-Acton casting time is hard,\n\t\t\t\tbut if you can get this in place it can quickly define the outcome of a\n\t\t\t\tfight.

The 1-Action casting time is easy to fit into a turn in which\n\t\t\t\tyou cast a 1-Action or 2-Action Heal. You&#8217;ll get the most benefit from\n\t\t\t\tAngelic Halo if you use the 3-Action version of Heal, but it may be\n\t\t\t\tdifficult to set up Angelic Halo ahead of time to do this.\n\t\t\t\t<p>Because the benefits of Angelic Halo scale with spell level, it does\n\t\t\t\t\ta lot to keep low-level versions of Heal effective as you gain levels.\n\t\t\t\t\tA 1st-level 3-Action Heal can heal as much as 1d8+20, which is\n\t\t\t\t\timpressive for such a low-level spell slot.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Despite these benefits, you still want to minimize healing during\n\t\t\t\t\tcombat as much as possible.

Throw this on your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tfront-line characters and prepare to target anything that becomes\n\t\t\t\tFrightened with a save-or-suck on later rounds.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"8\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prismatic Wall<\/a>: Very effective area control.

The AOE is\n\t\t\t\treasonably large and you get to pick targets, so you can omit your\n\t\t\t\tallies. The Success effect still forces targets to pay tribute twice\n\t\t\t\t(likely once on each of their next two turns), and the Critical Failure\n\t\t\t\teffect forces targets to spend all of their actions paying tribute until\n\t\t\t\tthey do it 6 times in total, so if you can Slow or Stun them you can\n\t\t\t\tstretch out the number of turns that they spend doing nothing\n\t\t\t\tthreatening.

Many of your spells deal fire damage by default\n\t(Produce Flame, Fireball, etc.), but picking any element except fire changes\n\tthat damage type to bludgeoning. Resistance to fire damage is extremely\n\tcommon, so picking anything except fire will make your damage spells more\n\tpowerful. You also get varying benefits from Elemental Motion.

First, it never misses, so it&#8217;s a great option when facing foes\n\t\t\t\twith high defenses. Magic Missile deals Force damage, which very few\n\t\t\t\tcreatures are resistant to. 120 ft. range is plenty to keep you well out\n\t\t\t\tof harm&#8217;s way.

Spending\n\t\t\t\tmore Actions will get more effect out of the spell, so it&#8217;s a more\n\t\t\t\tefficient use of your spell slots, but if you need to move or cast\n\t\t\t\tanother spell in the same turn you can still get some damage out of\n\t\t\t\tMagic Missile.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/spell\/Dispel-Magic\" class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic<\/span>: An absolutely essential option. While it&#8217;s not spelled out in the\n\t\t\t\tspell&#8217;s description, the Counteract rules make the level at which you\n\t\t\t\tcast this very important. On a Critical Success you can dispel effects\n\t\t\t\tup to three levels higher than the level at which you cast Dispel Magic\n\t\t\t\tand on a Success up to one level higher. On a failure you can still\n\t\t\t\tdispel effects of a lower level, so upcasting Dispel Magic can be a\n\t\t\t\tpowerful way to strip enemeies of problematic buffs or to disarm them of\n\t\t\t\tmagic items like weapons which might dramatically boost their damage\n\t\t\t\toutput.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=147\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haste<\/a>: Very powerful for martial characters, especially if they&#8217;re good at\n\t\t\t\tmanaging Multiple Attack Penalties.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"4\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dimension Door<\/a>: An essential tactical option for many spellcasters.

The duration doesn&#8217;t expire until you fail to Sustain\n\t\t\t\tthe spell, so given enough time you can send the eye great distances and\n\t\t\t\tscout huge areas. The biggest limitation is that the eye uses your\n\t\t\t\tnormal senses, so be sure that you have Low-Light Vision and\/or\n\t\t\t\tDarkvision so that you can send the eye into dark places and still\n\t\t\t\tsee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"6\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disintegrate<\/a>: Good single-target damage with good scaling, but it has two points of\n\t\t\t\tfailure, so even if you hit your target may still only take partial\n\t\t\t\tdamage. Of course, it&#8217;s a Basic Save so it&#8217;s equally likely that you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tscore a regular hit and still deal double normal damage. This also\n\t\t\t\tdoubles as a utility option, allowing you to disintegrate problematic\n\t\t\t\tobjects like walls or strucurally-important columns.

Once creatures are in the maze, they need to\n\t\t\t\troll a Critical Success or roll two or more Successes in order to\n\t\t\t\tescape. You may not be able to predict when a creature will escape, so\n\t\t\t\tyou and your allies should work quickly to set up an ambush for when the\n\t\t\t\ttarget does escape. Once you&#8217;re ready, end the spell early and let your\n\t\t\t\tparty hit the target with a bunch of readied actions so that the\n\t\t\t\tcreature doesn&#8217;t pop out of the maze with two Actions to spend.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prismatic Sphere<\/a>: Conceptually great, but very difficult to place.

Your best option is to entrap flying\n\t\t\t\tcreatures inside the sphere. If you need to protect yourself, you can\n\t\t\t\tcast this around yourself to buy yourself some time to buff yourself, to\n\t\t\t\tteleport to safety, or to do whatever else you might need.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Bloodline Spells<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=493\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Initial: Ancestral Memories<\/a>: You are now effectively Trained in every non-Lore skill, allowing you\n\t\t\t\tto approach a dizzying variety of challenges with nothing more to\n\t\t\t\tsupport you than a Focus Point.

The limitation to\n\t\t\t\tspell slots below your highest-level spell slots means that you can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tuse this with Cantrips or with Focus Spells. To master this, search your\n\t\t\t\tspell list for qualifying spells and try to think of ways to justify\n\t\t\t\textending the duration from 1 minute (usually long enough for one\n\t\t\t\tcombat) to 10 minutes (possibly enough for two if your party doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tneed to stop to Refocus, etc.).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Arcane Countermeasure<\/a>: Reducing a spells level by one can be massively impactful, reducing\n\t\t\t\tdamage, reducing the number of targets, or otherwise reducing the\n\t\t\t\teffects.

Sending a mouse, a small\n\t\t\t\tbird, or a bat to explore an area is a great way to gather information\n\t\t\t\twith minimal risk to yourself and your party, and small, mundane animals\n\t\t\t\tcan often evade notice simply because their presence isn&#8217;t especially\n\t\t\t\tnoteworthy.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"4\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=359\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vital Beacon<\/a>: In terms of spell slots, a 3-Action Heal cast at the same level will\n\t\t\t\tbe more efficient at restoring hit points. The benefit of Vital Beacon\n\t\t\t\tis that it is a persistent, readily-accessible source of healing. The\n\t\t\t\tspell lasts until it expires or until your next daily preparations, and\n\t\t\t\tyour allies can spends their own Actions to heal themselves as-needed.\n\t\t\t\tVital Beacon provides a decent amount of healing for a single Action,\n\t\t\t\tbut remember that those Actions are often better spent harming your\n\t\t\t\tallies to prevent them from damaging you and your allies, so you still\n\t\t\t\twant to avoid healing in combat as much as you can.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crushing Despair<\/a>: Similar in many ways to casting Slow on multiple creatures.

Even on a success, targets can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tmake Reactions for one turn, allowing you to cast this and safely Stride\n\t\t\t\tout of melee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"6\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Repulsion<\/a>: A great way to keep enemies away from you and your other squishy\n\t\t\t\tallies, especially since many creatures are wholly unable to fight at\n\t\t\t\trange.

To get the most\n\t\t\t\tout of this, you want to add spells like Entangle to your Spell\n\t\t\t\tRepertoire and use them to give your party unfair mobility\n\t\t\t\tadvantages.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"8\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=201\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moment of Renewal<\/a>: Very situational.

The AOE is\n\t\t\t\treasonably large and you get to pick targets, so you can omit your\n\t\t\t\tallies. The Success effect still forces targets to pay tribute twice\n\t\t\t\t(likely once on each of their next two turns), and the Critical Failure\n\t\t\t\teffect forces targets to spend all of their actions paying tribute until\n\t\t\t\tthey do it 6 times in total, so if you can Slow or Stun them you can\n\t\t\t\tstretch out the number of turns that they spend doing nothing\n\t\t\t\tthreatening.

The spell doesn&#8217;t specify that the spaces need to be safe or\n\t\t\t\thospitable, so you may be able to place enemies in mid-air or\n\t\t\t\tunderwater, causing them additional inconvenience beyond simply putting\n\t\t\t\tthem somewhere that they don&#8217;t want to be.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=93\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Duplicate Foe<\/a>: Powerful but frustrating in many ways.

Since the duplicate can\n\t\t\t\tonly Stride and Strike, you want to target enemies that rely on Strikes,\n\t\t\t\tbut those creatures also tend to have high Fortitude saves, which may\n\t\t\t\tmake this unreliable.\n\t\t\t\t<p>If the spell does work, the level cap is generously high so you can\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget the vast majority of creatures that you face in combat. The\n\t\t\t\t\tduplicate&#8217;s stats are good enough that it&#8217;s a serious threat in\n\t\t\t\t\tcombat, and since it&#8217;s not limited to attacking the target of the\n\t\t\t\t\tspell you can command it to attack the target&#8217;s allies if the target\n\t\t\t\t\tof Duplicate Foe wanders away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Ideally you want the duplicate to both deal a bunch of damage and to\n\t\t\t\t\tdraw a bunch of attacks which would otherwise be directed at you and\n\t\t\t\t\tyour allies, so your best bet is to cast this early in a fight so that\n\t\t\t\t\tit has as much time as possible to work. Even if the target of\n\t\t\t\t\tDuplicate Foe succeeds on its saving throw, you still get the\n\t\t\t\t\tduplicate for two rounds, which may be enough to cause a lot of\n\t\t\t\t\ttrouble for your enemies despite the duplicate dealing half damage\n\t\t\t\t\twith its strikes.\n\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"8\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=73\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disappearance<\/a>: Extremely durable invisibility with a 10-minute duration.

This also has the Shadow trait, so\n\t\t\t\tyou can use it with Dim the Light. The biggest problem is that it&#8217;s on a\n\t\t\t\tFortitude save and applies Enfeebled, but creatures most likely to care\n\t\t\t\tabout Enfeebled tend to also have high Fortitude saves.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Consuming Darkness<\/a>: The AOE starts really small, and the damage isn&#8217;t great until you&#8217;ve\n\t\t\t\tadded a few more spell levels.

The damage\n\t\t\t\tis good, and resistance to negative damage is rare.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=361\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wail of the Banshee<\/a>: Targets take full damage on a Success, but the 8d10 damage isn&#8217;t the\n\t\t\t\tbig appeal here: it&#8217;s the Drained effect. Drained imposes a penalty on\n\t\t\t\tConstitution-based stuff like Fortitude saves and reduces the target&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\thit point maximum, so on top of the 8d10 damage your targets will lose a\n\t\t\t\tflat number of hp based on their level. In a way this is actually\n\t\t\t\t<em>more<\/em> powerful against high-level targets because they&#8217;ll lose\n\t\t\t\tmore hit points. Unfortunately it will also affect your allies, so be\n\t\t\t\tcareful about using this in close quarters.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Bloodline Spells<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Initial: Touch of Undeath<\/a>: Similar in many ways to the Angelic Bloodline&#8217;s Angelic Halo, but\n\t\t\t\twith the additional effect of reversing Harm\/Heal effects. In a party\n\t\t\t\twith several characters with inverted healing (Dhampirs, etc.) this can\n\t\t\t\tallow characters who follow the standard healing mechanics to stay safe\n\t\t\t\tfrom the effects of Harm, thereby allowing you and your allies to spam\n\t\t\t\t3-Action Harm spells to solve all of your violence-related challenges\n\t\t\t\twhile simultaneously healing your party. Unfortunately, the 1-minute\n\t\t\t\tduration will require you to cast this right when you need its benefits\n\t\t\t\trather than casting it ahead of time.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced: Drain Life<\/a>: Simple and effective, and with a 1-Action casting time you can still\n\t\t\t\tcast many other spells in the same turn. I would strongly consider using\n\t\t\t\tthis early in every fight to get the temporary hit points in place as\n\t\t\t\tsoon as possible.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=512\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Grasping Grave<\/a>: Decent damage in a big AOE, and you might slow or immobolize targets.\n\t\t\t\tThe damage scales well, too. Unfortunately, it only works on the ground\n\t\t\t\tand by the time you get this, flying enemies will be common, so be sure\n\t\t\t\tto bring options that can handle flying enemies.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Magic<\/span>: A little bit of extra damage\n\t\ton offensive spells or give yourself some short-lived temporary hit points\n\t\tif you&#8217;re in danger.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introductioni The Sorcerer&#8217;s bloodline serves as their subclass.
