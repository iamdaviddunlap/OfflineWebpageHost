While Summon Monster is most commonly viewed as a way to summon a pet fighter, Summon Monster is capable of doing much more than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Summon Monster gains an alignment tag when summoning a creature with non-neutral alignment, divine spellcasters like Cleric and Oracles may not be able to summon every creature available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The creatures summoned by Summon Monster are usually outsiders, and the easiest way to command them is to share a language with them. Outsiders like celestials and demons typically speak Common, but if you want to command things like elementals you may want to invest a few skill ranks in Linguistics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Each level of Summon Monster is addressed below.

The ability to summon any tiny animal means that Pathfinder&#8217;s large collection of animals offers an impressively long list of potential summons. However, 1d3 creatures means that you&#8217;ll occasionally summon 1 creature of a type too weak to summon with Summon Monster I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for combat threats, you&#8217;ll find few here. Tiny creatures must move into their target&#8217;s space to attack, which provokes an attack of opportunity, and if they survive that attack nothing available deals more than one damage per attack. Because they don&#8217;t have a threatened area, they can&#8217;t flank and can&#8217;t make attacks of opportunity. You&#8217;re also limited to summoning animals which won&#8217;t be able to understand complex instructions, so the best you can hope for is to throw a bunch of weak animals at your enemies or to use Handle Animal checks to herd them into traps or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic -

The weasel can hang around dealing 1 point of damage per\n\t\tround, forcing Concentration checks on spellcasters, but otherwise not\n\t\tdrawing enough attention for enemies to waste their turn detaching the\n\t\tweasel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1\">Summon Monster I<\/h2>\n<p>Because it shares a level with Summon Minor Monster, it&#8217;s easy to draw\n\t\tcomparisons between the two.

Air Elementals are better in the air, for\n\t\texample. At this level, earth elementals are a surprisingly good option.\n\t\tTheir attack bonus and damage are respectable, provided that their target is\n\t\talso on the ground, so if you need a no-frills pet fighter, the small earth\n\t\telemental is a solid choice. Don&#8217;t forget that they have power attack. Their\n\t\tstat block doesn&#8217;t apply Power Attack by default, so you need to command\n\t\tthem to use it. Because small elementals only have one natural weapon\n\t\tattack, it works like a two-handed weapon so they get the extra 50% damage\n\t\tfrom Power Attack.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"giant-centipede\" class=\"rating-orange\">Giant Centipede<\/h3>\n<p>Bite with a poison that deals Dexterity damage.

Grab and disappointing poison.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"squid\" class=\"rating-red\">Squid<\/h3>\n<p>A bigger, worse octopus.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"wolf\" class=\"rating-red\">Wolf<\/h3>\n<p>The Wolf is almost perfectly identical to the Hyena, but with worse\n\t\tstats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3\">Summon Monster III<\/h2>\n<p>Summon III increases the CR of creatures to CR 2. At this stage the options\n\t\tstart to become more diverse and interesting, and they become more useful as\n\t\tactual combat threats.<\/p>\n<p>When you first get Summon III, the Crocodile and Leopard are decent combat\n\t\toptions. However, as their attack bonuses fall behind the Lantern Archon\n\t\tremains a fantastic and reliable option in a variety of situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Table: Summon Monster

if you are\n\t\t\t\t\tgood, the entropic template if you are chaotic, the fiendish template\n\t\t\t\t\tif you are evil, or the resolute template if you are lawful; you may\n\t\t\t\t\tchoose any if you are neutral.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tfoot>\n<\/table>\n<h3 id=\"ant-giant\" class=\"rating-red\">Ant, Giant (Soldier)<\/h3>\n<p>Adding poison doesn&#8217;t do enough to make the giant ant a meaningful combat\n\t\tthreat. Worker ants weren&#8217;t scary with Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally II, and their\n\t\tattack bonuses don&#8217;t change when they become a soldier ant, so they will\n\t\tface additional challenges trying to hit enemies which are now stronger and\n\t\tmore resilient.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"ape\" class=\"rating-red\">Ape<\/h3>\n<p>Despite their size and strength, apes are weak. Their attack bonus is just\n\t\t+3, and their CMB is worse than that of the Giant Frog. They have the\n\t\tadvantage of human-like hands, but if you need something with hands you&#8217;ll\n\t\tbe better served by 1d4+1 mites.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"aurochs\" class=\"rating-green\">Aurochs (Herd Animal)<\/h3>\n<p>Aurochs are good because of Trample. That is all that you need from\n\t\tthem.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"boar\" class=\"rating-red\">Boar<\/h3>\n<p>Boars are dangerous because of their Ferocity trait, but combining their\n\t\tnegative hit points with their normal hit point pool makes them only\n\t\tslightly more durable than the options on the Summon Monster I list. Their\n\t\tattacks and AC are both weak, so the boar won&#8217;t even work as a passable\n\t\tcombat threat.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"cheetah\" class=\"rating-orange\">Cheetah<\/h3>\n<p>Fast with three attacks and trip. Not a terrible option, but summoning 1d3\n\t\thyenas may be more likely to trip foes simply because they can make more CMB\n\t\tattempts.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"constrictor-snake\" class=\"rating-green\">Constrictor Snake<\/h3>\n<p>Slow, but with both climb and swim speeds. Constrictor snakes are good\n\t\tgrapplers, and their constrict damage is threatening. However, if you don&#8217;t\n\t\tneed the climb speed a crocodile has better numbers for similar tricks.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"crocodile\" class=\"rating-blue\">Crocodile<\/h3>\n<p>Crocodiles are great at grabbing one foe and locking them down. Their\n\t\tattack bonus is good and their damage is decent, and with Grab and Death\n\t\tRoll they can really take control of a grapple and keep enemies from\n\t\tescaping.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dire-bat\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dire Bat<\/h3>\n<p>Blindsense will allow the dire bat to locate invisible foes, which might be\n\t\thelpful, but otherwise it&#8217;s unremarkable.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dretch\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dretch<\/h3>\n<p>Poor speed and mediocre attacks. The energy resistances and DR look\n\t\ttempting, but summoned animals will get similar protections from the\n\t\talignment template granted by the spell. Dretches are intelligent and speak\n\t\tlanguages, which allows you to give them verbal commands if you speak the\n\t\tright languages, but they can&#8217;t do much other than move, attack, and carry\n\t\tstuff around.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"electric-eel\" class=\"rating-red\">Electric Eel<\/h3>\n<p>Even in the water this is terrible.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"giant-crab\" class=\"rating-orange\">Giant Crab<\/h3>\n<p>Comparable to the crocodile, but it gets two chances to grab rather than\n\t\tone. I think the crocodile&#8217;s better damage output is the better of the two\n\t\toptions.<\/p>\n<p>Giant Crab is notably exclusive to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally, so everyone else\n\t\tusing Summon Monster can&#8217;t summon giant crabs. You should feel special.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"lantern-archon\" class=\"rating-blue\">Lantern Archon<\/h3>\n<p>Lantern archons have several amazing things going for them.<\/p>\n<p>First, lantern archons are maneuverable. With 60 ft. fly speed, perfect\n\t\tmaneuverability, and small size, they can get around easily in tight areas.\n\t\tWith just 1 Strength and no hands that&#8217;s not always helpful, but you can\n\t\teasily squeeze a bunch of lantern archons into crowded dungeons and other\n\t\tsmall spaces.<\/p>\n<p>Second, from a purely martial standpoint, lantern archons are a reliable\n\t\tsource of damage output. They get two touch attack rays which deal 1d6\n\t\ttypeless damage. At +3 to hit they can hit the average touch AC at any CR\n\t\tabout 50% of the time at the absolute worst, so you can reasonably expect\n\t\tthat a lantern archon can deal 1d6 damage every turn. This means that\n\t\tlantern archons are a reliable combat option in nearly any encounter, making\n\t\tthem an excellent option when you can summon 1d3 or 1d4+1 of them with\n\t\thigher-level summon spells. These attacks are made at range, allowing your\n\t\tsummons to attack enemies well beyond the spells range without putting the\n\t\tarchon directly in harms way and therefore at risk of being unsummoned.<\/p>\n<p>Third, lantern archons have Truespeech, so they can speak and understand\n\t\tany language. That makes lantern archons a perfect translator, replacing the\n\t\tneed for spells like Comprehend Languages and Tongues for the brief duration\n\t\tof Summon Monster. You can also issue commands to the lantern archon in any\n\t\tlanguages.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth, Aura of Menace. Sure, the DC is only 12 but if you summon a bunch\n\t\tof them, your enemies need to save against each aura separately. Even after\n\t\tthe spell&#8217;s duration expires, the effect lasts 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the lantern archon&#8217;s Spell-like Abilities, all of which are usable\n\t\tat will. Detect Evil is situational, and Summon Monster specifically\n\t\tprohibits both teleportation, and spell-like abilities with expensive\n\t\tmaterial components (like Continual Flame) but that leaves Aid. You can use\n\t\tAid to buff your party and have a lantern archon run around in combat\n\t\tcontinuously refreshing everyone&#8217;s temporary hit points whenever they take\n\t\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p>Look at all that text. The Lantern Archon is so good that my assessment of\n\t\twhy its great took up more text than every other summon option at this\n\t\ttier.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"leopard\" class=\"rating-blue\">Leopard (Cat)<\/h3>\n<p>If you just want to kill something, the leopard is your best bet at this\n\t\tlevel. Three attacks, pounce, and rake will produce impressive damage\n\t\toutput.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"monitor-lizard\" class=\"rating-red\">Monitor Lizard<\/h3>\n<p>The poison isn&#8217;t meaningful because of the long onset, and crocodiles will\n\t\tdo better at grappling.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"shark\" class=\"rating-orange\">Shark<\/h3>\n<p>Decent damage, but that&#8217;s about it. 1d3 squids will do comparable damage\n\t\tand can easily grapple foes to keep them from counter-attacking.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"wolverine\" class=\"rating-orange\">Wolverine<\/h3>\n<p>Decent damage once rage starts, but the leopard does comparable damage\n\t\twithout needing to take damage first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4\">Summon Monster IV<\/h2>\n<p>For the first time since Summon I, there is some variation in the CR of\n\t\tyour summon options. At this level, Summon Monster and Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally\n\t\tbeginning to deviate more significantly in their summon options, with Summon\n\t\tMonster introducing more outsiders and Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally getting a few\n\t\tmore exclusive animal options in addition to magical beasts and fey.<\/p>\n<p>Summon IV brings several very viable combat options. Giant Scorpion and\n\t\tGrizzly Bear are both great for locking down single targets, but if you just\n\t\tneed a pet fighter your best bet is the Hound Archon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Table:

The\n\t\tcombination of grab and flight means that it can lift enemies into the air\n\t\tand drop them, or fly over other enemies to reach vulnerable foes fighting\n\t\tat a distance.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bison\" class=\"rating-green\">Bison (Herd Animal)<\/h3>\n<p>Much like the aurochs, bison are good for their Trample ability. The DC is\n\t\t3 higher than that of the Aurochs, and it&#8217;s unlikely that enemies have\n\t\tincreased their save bonuses by 3 in the levels it took you to go from\n\t\tSummon Nature&#8217;s Ally III to IV.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"deinonychus\" class=\"rating-red\">Deinonychus (Dinosaur)<\/h3>\n<p>With four attacks and pounce, the deinonychus is a decent combat options.\n\t\tHowever, the Griffon has similar damage output, better attack bonuses, and\n\t\tcan fly, making the deinonychus redundant.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dire-ape\" class=\"rating-green\">Dire Ape<\/h3>\n<p>Three decent attacks, large size, rend, and a climb speed. A good option to\n\t\tthrow between you an something scary, though their AC is poor so their hit\n\t\tpoints will drop quickly.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dire-boar\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dire Boar<\/h3>\n<p>A big pile of hit points, especially when supplemented by Ferocity. At\n\t\tlarge size with one big attack, the Dire Boar is a good tank and their\n\t\topportunity attacks are decent. However, their AC is poor and all that they\n\t\tcan do offensively is damage so they&#8217;re not versatile in the slightest.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dire-wolf\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dire Wolf<\/h3>\n<p>I was really hoping that the Dire Wolf would be a decent way to trip stuff,\n\t\tbut with just +8 CMB they&#8217;re not especially reliable. You also need to hit\n\t\twith the dire wolf&#8217;s single mediocre attack to trigger Trip. Overall you&#8217;re\n\t\tgetting very little damage with an unreliable chance of tripping things.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"elemental-medium\" class=\"rating-green\">Elemental (Medium)<\/h3>\n<p>At this level elementals&#8217; abilities have a decent DC which some creatures\n\t\tmight actually fail. Air elements can use their Whirlwind to lift enemies\n\t\tinto the air and drop them, while fire elementals can inflict ongoing damage\n\t\twith Burn.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"giant-scorpion\" class=\"rating-blue\">Giant Scorpion<\/h3>\n<p>Giant scorpions are horrifying combat monsters. Two claw attacks with a\n\t\tgood CMB being Grab, and their poison DC is high enough to actually matter.\n\t\tThe Strength damage will reduce enemies&#8217; CMB and CMD, which means that the\n\t\tscorpion will gradually overcome enemies in a grapple as their Strength\n\t\tgradually fails.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"giant-wasp\" class=\"rating-red\">Giant Wasp<\/h3>\n<p>Despite its better sting damage and higher poison DC, the giant wasp is\n\t\tactually worse than the giant ant drone.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"grizzly-bear\" class=\"rating-blue\">Grizzly Bear<\/h3>\n<p>Thanks to grab, the grizzly bear mostly competes with the Giant Scorpion in\n\t\tterms of their combat function. Their stat lines are so similar that I can&#8217;t\n\t\tfigure out why Grizzly Bear is CR 4 but the Giant Scorpion is only CR 3. For\n\t\tyour purposes, the question becomes whether you want the base numerical\n\t\tadvantage of the bear (+1 CMB compared to the scorpion and 5 more hit\n\t\tpoints) of you want the poison damage on the scorpion&#8217;s sting.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"hell-hound\" class=\"rating-red\">Hell Hound<\/h3>\n<p>Basically a dog with a terrible breath weapon and a little extra fire\n\t\tdamage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"hound-archon\" class=\"rating-blue\">Hound Archon<\/h3>\n<p>A solid all-around option. Aura of Menace is a good debuff, Circle of\n\t\tProtection is a great defensive buff for you and your allies, the hound\n\t\tarchon&#8217;s attacks are decent with good damage and better attack bonuses than\n\t\tanything else at this level, and you can communicate with the Hound Archon\n\t\tusing truespeech. If you want spell-like abilities it&#8217;s easier to use 1d3\n\t\tLantern Archons because they can fly around to deliver the effects, but the\n\t\tHound Archon is likely a better option if you need a summoned fighter.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"lion\" class=\"rating-red\">Lion<\/h3>\n<p>Basically just a worse version of the tiger.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"mephit\" class=\"rating-red\">Mephit (any)<\/h3>\n<p>Mephits are mostly terrible. Their breath weapons are weak, and their fast\n\t\thealing won&#8217;t matter because the duration of Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally is so\n\t\tshort. The big draw of Mephits is their spell-like abilities, which can get\n\t\tyou access to some useful spells which you may not have prepared or which\n\t\taren&#8217;t on your spell list. Unfortunately these spells tend to be at most\n\t\t2nd-level, so buying some scrolls is probably a better choice.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"pteranodon\" class=\"rating-red\">Pteranodon (Dinosaur)<\/h3>\n<p>I have no idea how these are CR 3. They&#8217;re terrible.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"rhinoceros\" class=\"rating-red\">Rhinoceros<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll get better damage out of a charge from a tiger or griffon, and after\n\t\tthe charge your tiger or griffon will continue to be scary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5\">Summon Monster V<\/h2>\n<p>Summon V adds an unusually large number of evil outsiders.<\/p>\n<p>On land, Ankylosaurus is an unbeatable tank. If you need damage output,\n\t\tsummon multiple options from lower-level spells. In the water, the Giant\n\t\tMoray Eel is terrifying. If you want to lock down a single physically weak\n\t\ttarget like a spellcaster, the Salamaber is an excellent grappler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<caption>Table: Summon Monster

real\n\t\tappeal of the ankylosaurus is as crowd control. Their Stun ability (which\n\t\tdazes foes rather than stunning them) is devastating. It&#8217;s as effective as\n\t\tPower Word Stun and has a startling high DC of 23. And they can do it on\n\t\tevery attack, including attacks of opportunity. At huge size with 15 ft.\n\t\treach they can lock down huge sections of a battlefield and keep at least\n\t\tone enemy dazed perpetually until you get around to killing it. On top of\n\t\tall of that, the ankylosaurus has a decent AC and a big pool of hit points\n\t\tso it can keep on fighting for a long time.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"babau\" class=\"rating-green\">Babau (demon)<\/h3>\n<p>The biggest appeal of the Babau is its ability to dispel magic at will.\n\t\tRather than wasting a bunch of spell slots to dispel a pesky magical\n\t\tobstacle, summon a Babau and make it dispel repeatedly until it succeeds.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bearded-devil\" class=\"rating-orange\">Bearded Devil<\/h3>\n<p>A passable combat option, but Ankylosaurus is considerably better. The\n\t\twounding effect is tempting, but it&#8217;s too small compared to the\n\t\tAnkylosaurus&#8217;s ability to daze enemies.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"bralani\" class=\"rating-orange\">Bralani Azata<\/h3>\n<p>The Bralania is a weird mix of abilities. It has some spell-like abilities,\n\t\tand both ranged and melee weapons. The spell-like abilities include the\n\t\tability to cast Cure Serious Wounds, so be sure to use that before Summon\n\t\tMonster&#8217;s duration expires. Unfortunately, the bralani&#8217;s diverse skillset\n\t\tmeans that it&#8217;s also not good at any single thing. When you can always\n\t\tsummon a creature specialized to the situation, a generalist is a poor\n\t\tchoice.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dire-lion\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dire Lion<\/h3>\n<p>A linear improvement on the lion and the tiger, dire lion doesn&#8217;t add much\n\t\tadditonal damage, but adds a bunch of extra attack bonus and hit points.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dolphin-orca\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dolphin (Orca)<\/h3>\n<p>120 ft. blindsight is great for finding hidden foes, but orcas are aquatic,\n\t\ttheir attacks are mediocre, and they don&#8217;t speak, so at best they can find a\n\t\thidden enemy and chomp at them impotently until you decide what else to do\n\t\tabout them.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"elemental-large\" class=\"rating-green\">Elemental (Large)<\/h3>\n<p>Large elementals gain a second slam attack, making fire elementals a\n\t\tconsiderably more useful option because they now have twice as much\n\t\topportunity to trigger Burn for ongoing damage against difficult foes. Air\n\t\telementals remain the most relevant option for their ability to use\n\t\tWhirlwind to lift enemies into the air and drop them.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"giant-moray-eel\" class=\"rating-blue\">Giant Moray Eel<\/h3>\n<p>Excellent in the water, the giant moray eel is a fantastic grappler. Grab\n\t\tand Gnaw provide excellent damage output while grappling, and Gnaw allows\n\t\tthe eel to make an additional secondary bit for a little bit more damage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"kyton\" class=\"rating-green\">Kyton<\/h3>\n<p>Four attacks is great, especially if you have something like Inspire\n\t\tCourage running to boost the attacks&#8217; damage. Unfortunately, damage is the\n\t\tonly thing that the Kyton can do, and its attacks do surprisingly little\n\t\tdamage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"salamander\" class=\"rating-blue\">Salamander<\/h3>\n<p>The Salamander is the best single-target elimination option at this level.\n\t\tIts tail attack has both Grab and Constrict, allowing it to quickly grapple\n\t\ta target and burn through their hit points quickly.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"woolly-rhinoceros\" class=\"rating-green\">Woolly Rhinoceros<\/h3>\n<p>Combining the benefits of the rhinoceros and the aurochs, the woolly\n\t\trhinoceros does a does a file of damage on a charge, then follows it up on\n\t\tsuccessive rounds by using Trample to knock foes prone and back away.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"xill\" class=\"rating-orange\">Xill<\/h3>\n<p>Four attacks with grab, and it can lay eggs in your enemies if you&#8217;re crazy\n\t\tlike that.

All of the appeal of the tiger, but bigger and\n\t\twith more damage. However, it needs to compete with the Shadow Demon&#8217;s\n\t\tability to attack with touch attacks.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"elasmosaurus\" class=\"rating-red\">Elasmosaurus (dinosaur)<\/h3>\n<p>A huge bag of hitpoints, but underwhelming damage. Summoning 1d3 Giant\n\t\tMoray Eels will almost certainly work better.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"elemental-huge\" class=\"rating-green\">Elemental (Huge)<\/h3>\n<p>Another linear improvement to elementals. The air elemental&#8217;s whirlwind\n\t\tcontinues to be a good option, but other elementals lag behind other\n\t\tcomparable options.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"elephant\" class=\"rating-green\">Elephant<\/h3>\n<p>Another vehicle for Trample. The damage isn&#8217;t any better than the Woolly\n\t\tRhinoceros, but the DC is better.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"erinyes\" class=\"rating-blue\">Erinyes (Devil)<\/h3>\n<p>The Erinyes can cast Fear at will as a spell-like ability, so its best\n\t\tfunction is to spam Fear every single turn. The DC of 19 isn&#8217;t spectacular,\n\t\tbut even if the targets succeed on saves they are still Shaken, which makes\n\t\tthem more susceptible to the next time your Erinyes uses Fear. Just wait\n\t\tuntil you can summon 1d3\/1d4+1 of them and they can all produce overlapping\n\t\tFear effects. Keep doing it until it works.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"giant-octopus\" class=\"rating-blue\">Giant Octopus<\/h3>\n<p>A fantastic grappler, the giant octopus applies grab on 8 tentacle attacks,\n\t\tmaking it largely guaranteed that the octopus will be able to start a\n\t\tgrapple. The octopus&#8217;s poison does Strength damage, so any protracted fight\n\t\tagainst the octopus will lead to the target gradually losing its ability to\n\t\tfight off the octopus&#8217;s grapple.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"invisible-stalker\" class=\"rating-red\">Invisible Stalker<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s really neat that the Invisible Stalker is invisible, but its damage is\n\t\tgarbage and it can&#8217;t do anything except damage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"lillend\" class=\"rating-blue\">Lillend Azata<\/h3>\n<p>Summon a 7th-level bard! It has a handful of decent spells and spell-like\n\t\tabilities, and it can use Bardic Music to buff your party. If you have time,\n\t\thave the Lillend use its spells to heal you and your allies before your\n\t\tSummon Monster duration expires.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"shadow-demon\" class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Demon<\/h3>\n<p>The shadow demon is incorporeal, so it can pass through walls and it takes\n\t\tno damage from non-magic attacks. Its attacks are all made as touch attacks,\n\t\tand with three attacks it can do a decent amount of damage, and it has both\n\t\tPounce and Sprint so it can easily charge anything within your Summon\n\t\tMonster range. That alone makes it one of the best combat options at this\n\t\tlevel, but it can also cast Shadow Conjuration\/Shadow Evocation three times\n\t\tper day, giving you access to a bunch of useful spells.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"shadow-mastiff\" class=\"rating-red\">Shadow Mastiff<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to terrify enemies, the Erinyes can do a better job because its\n\t\tDC is higher, it can try again, and it doesn&#8217;t affect you.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"succubus\" class=\"rating-green\">Succubus (Demon)<\/h3>\n<p>Not much of a combat threat, and with Summon Monster&#8217;s limited duration a\n\t\tSuccubus won&#8217;t be much use in a social situation, but Dominate Person is\n\t\treally good if you&#8217;re facing humanoids, and Profane Gift is a great way to\n\t\tbuff party members.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"triceratops\" class=\"rating-green\">Triceratops (Dinosaur)<\/h3>\n<p>A bigger, scalier version of the woolly rhinoceros, the triceratops adds\n\t\tmore damage but uses all of the same tricks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7\">Summon Monster VII<\/h2>\n<p>This levels adds nothing conceptually new, but options continue to\n\t\timprove.<\/p>\n<p>The giant octopus outpaces the giant moray eel in the water. The\n\t\tstegosaurus arguably gives the ankylosaurus a run for its money, but 1d3\n\t\tankylosaurus stuns will probably be more effective than just knocking\n\t\tenemies prone.

The Trumpet Archon casts\n\t\tspells rather than using spell-like abilities, which means that it can cast\n\t\tspells like Raise Dead despite the expensive material components, but you\n\t\tstill need to provide those components.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"other-summon-spells\">Other Summon Spells<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"summon-swarm\" class=\"rating-green\">Summon Swarm<\/h3>\n<p>As a 2nd-level spell, Summon Swarm is accessible early in the game. It\n\t\tnotably requires Concentration, so instead of summoning a monster and going\n\t\tabout your business you need to spend your standard action each turn keeping\n\t\tthe spell going. This is a difficult commitment to make, especially once you\n\t\thave enough spell slots that a single 2nd-level slot isn&#8217;t a large\n\t\texpenditure of resources. However, swarms can be a serious threat on the\n\t\tbattlefield, which can make Summon Swarm an excellent way to spend a spell\n\t\tslot. If you&#8217;re worried about action economy, consider casting Flaming\n\t\tSphere before you cast Summon Swarm so that you can spend your turn doing\n\t\tsomething more exciting than thinking about your swarm to keep it around.<\/p>\n<p>Summon Swarm competes with Summon Monster II, and notably Summon Swarm can\n\t\tsummon CR 2 creatures compared to the CR 1 creatures from Summon Monster II.\n\t\tAside from the Concentration issues, Summon Swarm is a solid spell. Dropping\n\t\ta Swarm of Bats into an encounter can be hugely effective, even in\n\t\thigh-level adventures where the damage isn&#8217;t significant, because the bleed\n\t\tdamage will force Concentration checks.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/bestiary\/monster-listings\/animals\/bat\/bat-swarm\">Swarm of Bats<\/a>: The Swarm of Bats can fly and its speed is twice as good as the other\n\t\t\tswarms, making it much better than the other options already, but it also\n\t\t\tdeals a point of bleed damage so you can pile the swarm on top of your\n\t\t\tenemies and run away while they slowly bleed out.<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/bestiary\/monster-listings\/animals\/rat\/rat-swarm\">Swarm of Rats<\/a>: Disease is rarely a useful option for players.<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/bestiary\/monster-listings\/vermin\/spider\/spider-swarm\">Swarm of Spiders<\/a>: Poison, but the DC is terrible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fire Music<\/span>: 5 points of fire resistance\n\t\t\tand +1 fire damage really isn&#8217;t worth a feat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sacred Summons<\/span>: If you&#8217;re a cleric,\n\t\t\tsummoning a creature as a Standard action may be very helpful.

The number won&#8217;t matter as much at later\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels where you&#8217;re typically relying less on teeth and claws, but\n\t\t\t\t\tAugment Summoning remains the foundation of improving Summon spells at\n\t\t\t\t\tany level.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Evolved Summoned Monster<\/span>: The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfact that you get to pick this evolution every time you cast the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspell means that you can always find an evolution which will work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMost of the time you&#8217;re going to be adding an extra attack, adding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgills so that you can summon things underwater, or using Improved\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDamage to emphasize an existing type of attack.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ferocious Summons<\/span>: Essentially\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10 more hit points for your monsters. Nice, but not essential.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Superior Summoning<\/span>: At most\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels, summoning multiple creatures from lower-level lists is a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgood idea, especially with Augment Summoning buffing their stats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdding one more creature summoned makes this an even better\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\toption.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"rating-red\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Aeon)<\/h3>\n<p>Aeons are weird, mostly because of their inability to communicate verbally.\n\t\tThe ring&#8217;s only good form is the Akhana, and honestly the Akhana seems\n\t\tpointless compared to existing options like the Trumpet Archon.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Paracletus<\/span>: Useless in combat, and\n\t\t\tCommune is off limits due to the expensive material component.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Theletos<\/span>: The Theletos&#8217;s spell-like\n\t\t\tabilities aren&#8217;t especially useful, and the attacks are weaker than those\n\t\t\tavailable to other options at the same level.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Akhana<\/span>: In combat, the Akhana has four\n\t\t\tattacks with Grab on each of them, and if it can somehow grapple things\n\t\t\twith its horrid +16 attack bonus, it can use its tail to inflict 1d4\n\t\t\tnegative levels every turn. Beyond that, the Akhana can cast Cure Serious\n\t\t\tWounds at will, and it can cast Raise Dead once per day without the\n\t\t\texpensive material component.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-red\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Agathion)<\/h3>\n<p>The only really good option is the Leonal at Summon 8, which adds access to\n\t\tsome powerful healing options earlier than the Trumpet Archon at Summon\n\t\t9.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silvanshee<\/span>: Useful solely for its\n\t\t\tability to cast Commune without the expensive material component.<\/li>\n<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vulpinal<\/span>: The spell-like abilities are\n\t\t\tmostly terrible. However, the Vulpinal can cast Remove Disease three times\n\t\t\tper day, which may be a helpful option for Sorcers and Wizards who\n\t\t\totherwise don&#8217;t have access to it.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Avoral<\/span>: Dispel Magic at will, but by this\n\t\t\tlevel you&#8217;re more reliant on Greater Dispel Magic.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Leonal<\/span>: Finally a worthwhile option!\n\t\t\tFireball at will is nice, though with such a low DC most creatures will be\n\t\t\ttaking half damage. The real appeal is the healing spells, including Heal\n\t\t\tonce per day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Angel)<\/h3>\n<p>The Movanic and Monadic devas offer some interesting spell-like\n\t\tabilities.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cassian<\/span>: Aid and Commune each once per\n\t\t\tday. Otherwise worthless.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Movanic Deva<\/span>: Passable combat stats,\n\t\t\tincluding flight. The Movanic Deva&#8217;s spell-like abilities are good, too,\n\t\t\tincluding Aid and Dispel Magic at will, Cure Serious Wounds 7 times per\n\t\t\tday, and Antimagic Field, and Holy Aura once per day. Awaken is off-limits\n\t\t\tdue to its expensive material component. Holy Aura is a powerful buff\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s exclusive to the cleric\/oracle list, and as an 8th-level spell you\n\t\t\tget it a spell level early.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monadic Deva<\/span>: Basically a Movanic Deva\n\t\t\twith slightly different spell-like abilities and attacks. Notably includes\n\t\t\tHeal once per day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-orange\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Archon)<\/h3>\n<p>Almost every option is redundant with base options.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Harbinger<\/span>: Cure Light Wounds three\n\t\t\ttimes per day will heal more than Cure Serious Wounds, and it can cast\n\t\t\tCommune once per week.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Legion Archon<\/span>: Decent, but the default\n\t\t\tsummon options are just as good and can do all of the same things.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Archon<\/span>: Constant Magic Circle\n\t\t\tAgainst Evil, but at this level that&#8217;s not very exciting. Decent stats for\n\t\t\ta tank, but almost no damage output. The spell-like abilities aren&#8217;t very\n\t\t\texciting, but with Shield Another you can use your Shield Archon to soak\n\t\t\tup damage for an ally.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-orange\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Asura)<\/h3>\n<p>The Agashura is a helpful addition to Summon 8&#8217;s dismally short list of\n\t\toptions, but it&#8217;s probably not enough to justify buying the ring.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tripurasura<\/span>: Some situational\n\t\t\tspell-like abilities.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Adhukait<\/span>: The spell-like abilities are\n\t\t\tsituational at best, and the combat stats aren&#8217;t any better than the\n\t\t\tdefault options.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Upasunda<\/span>: Again, mediocre spell-like\n\t\t\tabilities and mediocre combat stats.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aghasura<\/span>: Better combat stats than the\n\t\t\tdefault options, but nothing special in terms of spell-like abilities.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-blue\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Daemon)<\/h3>\n<p>This ring notably provides the most summon options of any Ring of Summoning\n\t\tAffinity, totaling 8 new options compared to the typical 3 or 4. Once you&#8217;re\n\t\table to cast Summon 6, the 10,600gp cost of this ring is easily affordable\n\t\tand the ring is well worth its price. The Summon 6 and above options are\n\t\tnearly all fantastic.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cacodaemonto<\/span>: Cast Commune without the\n\t\t\texpensive material component, and eat dead people to put their souls into\n\t\t\tgems. You might be able to use those gems to bargain with evil outsiders\n\t\t\tif your GM is willing to let you do that.<\/li>\n<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Ceustodaemon<\/span>: Strictly a combat option,\n\t\t\tand the default list has better combat options.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hydrodaemon<\/span>: An interesting mix of\n\t\t\tabilities, the Hydrodaemon is a threat at any range. Acid Arrow at will\n\t\t\tallows it to fight at ranges of well over 700 feet, and at closer ranges\n\t\t\tthe Hydrodaemon&#8217;s Sleep Spittle allows it to put individual foes to sleep\n\t\t\tat will. If those options fail you somehow, the Hydrodaemon&#8217;s attacks are\n\t\t\tdecent, though they won&#8217;t compare to those of the Erinyes. When you\n\t\t\tprogress to higher levels, the Hydrodaemon may remain a viable option\n\t\t\tbecause Acid Arrows is a touch attack. 1d3 or 1d4+1 of them can become a\n\t\t\tterrifying artillery array, dealing out piles of d4s at long range and\n\t\t\tquickly wearing down powerful enemies.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leukodaemon<\/span>: Despite being on the low\n\t\t\tend of the CR scale for Summon 7, the Leukodaemon has a lot to offer. Harm\n\t\t\t1\/day and Contagion on its longbow attacks allow the Leukodaemon to deal\n\t\t\tout a bunch of damage in a burst or to pile problematic status effects\n\t\t\tonto enemies. Dispel Magic at will also offers some helpful utility,\n\t\t\tthough at this level you&#8217;ll be much more reliant on Greater Dispel\n\t\t\tMagic.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Piscodaemon<\/span>: Easily outpacing the\n\t\t\tBebelith as a combat threat, the Piscodaemon&#8217;s claws are terrifying.\n\t\t\t18-20&#215;3 crits backed up by Critical Focus and Sickening Critical, with\n\t\t\tboth Grab and Bleed, followed up by impressive Constrict damage. With a\n\t\t\tswim speed and the ability to cast Fly three times per day, the\n\t\t\tPiscodaemon works in nearly any situation, and against a variety of foes.\n\t\t\tOn top of all of that, the Piscodaemon&#8217;s tentacles inflict poison which\n\t\t\tdeals Constitution damage with an alarmingly-high DC of 22.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Derghodaemon<\/span>: The Derghodaemon has a CR\n\t\t\tof 12, placing it <em>above<\/em> the CR of the creatures on the default\n\t\t\tlist of options. However, many of its abilities are removed by the text of\n\t\t\tSummon Monster. Because Summon Monster disallows teleportation or\n\t\t\tsummoning other creatures, the Derghodaemon is limited to its constant\n\t\t\tSpell-Like Abilities and Fear 3\/day, dramatically reducing its\n\t\t\tefectiveness. However, at Summon 8 the Derghodaemon has little\n\t\t\tcompetition, and the Derghodaemon easily outpaces other combat options.\n\t\t\tWith 5 attacks with a better attack bonus than other options, decent\n\t\t\tdamage, and Rend which deals Constitution damage, the Derghodaemon can\n\t\t\teasily become a problem from your enemies simply because it has so many\n\t\t\topportunities to roll well and get past high ACs. On top of all of that,\n\t\t\tFeeblemind Aura allows the Derghodaemon to neutralize arcane\n\t\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Meladaemon<\/span>: Nonlethal damage is easily\n\t\t\tremoved or ignored by a wide variety of creatures, but even if the\n\t\t\tnonlethal damage works the Derghodaemon works better.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Thanadaemon<\/span>: Energy Drain is a great\n\t\t\tway to kill things, but the DC to resist it is only 21 and your\n\t\t\tThanadaemon needs to hit with an attack first, so you have two points of\n\t\t\tfailure. Instead, rely on Fear Gaze. The DC is still only 21, but rather\n\t\t\tthan slightly debuff the target, Fear Gaze causes the target to cower,\n\t\t\tallowing you or your allies to attack the target at their leisure while\n\t\t\tthe target is cowering.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Div)<\/h3>\n<p>Divs can see in magical darkness, including Deeper Darkness, making them a\n\t\thelpful option for spellcasters who like to use magical darkness. The ring\n\t\tprovides a mixed bag of options across a wide range of spell levels, making\n\t\tthe ring worthwhile, but not so good that you would regret not buying\n\t\tone.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Doru<\/span>: Cast Commune without the\n\t\t\texpensive material component.<\/li>\n<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aghash<\/span>: Cursed Gaze can stun a single\n\t\t\tcreature for 1 round at will, or the Aghash can cast Bestow Curse at will.\n\t\t\tBoth have a DC of just 16, but their effects are extremely powerful.\n\t\t\tSummon one or a bunch of these and have them focus on a single target\n\t\t\tuntil it&#8217;s so heavily debuffed that it&#8217;s not a threat. Curses are\n\t\t\tpermanent, which makes this a great option for bringing down foes that you\n\t\t\tneed to capture or imprison. Hit them with every curse option available\n\t\t\tand they&#8217;ll be mostly helpless, making them easy to drag around or throw\n\t\t\tinto a cell.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Pairaka<\/span>: Bad combat stats and few\n\t\t\tspell-like abilities, none of which are interesting.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghawwas<\/span>: The Ghawwas can do a number of\n\t\t\treally great things. First, it can cast Deeper Darkness at will, and as a\n\t\t\tDiv it can see in magical darkness. Second, its spear attacks are on par\n\t\t\twith other summon options at this level, and deal decent damage coupled\n\t\t\twith a Strength-damaging poison with an impressive DC of 22 and unusually\n\t\t\t1d6 damage. Third, the Ghawwas can cast Curse Water at will without the\n\t\t\texpensive material component, providing a way to create limitless\n\t\t\tquantities of unholy water.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shira<\/span>: Almost purely a combat option,\n\t\t\tbut its combat stats are terrible. The Shira&#8217;s sole appeal is its constant\n\t\t\tTrye Seeing ability.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Sepid<\/span>: The Sepid&#8217;s best ability is Rain\n\t\t\tof Debris, which deals decent AOE damage with a reasonably high DC for\n\t\t\thalf damage. Beyond that it has a number of spell-like abilities, but none\n\t\t\tof them are especially high level. Animate Dead is sadly off limits due to\n\t\t\tthe expensive material component.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Inevitable)<\/h3>\n<p>Not worthwhile until very high level, but at Summon 8 and above this is a\n\t\tbargain.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arbiter<\/span>: Commune without the material\n\t\t\tcomponent, and Make Whole three times per day. The arbiter can be a useful\n\t\t\tutility option, but it&#8217;s worthless in combat.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Zelekhut<\/span>: Three attempts at Hold\n\t\t\tMonster could be nice, but the DC is low, and the Zelekhut&#8217;s attacks are\n\t\t\tweaker than other options on the default list of summon options.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Kolyarut<\/span>: Enervation at will.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Marut<\/span>: The Marut&#8217;s CR of 15 is above the\n\t\t\tCR of every default summon option, and it&#8217;s good enough to justify its\n\t\t\thigh CR. Constant true seeing, Circle of Death once per day without the\n\t\t\tmaterial component, and Greater Dispel Magic at will. On top of that, the\n\t\t\tMarut&#8217;s attacks are accurate with impressive damage and the ability to\n\t\t\tblind or deafen targets.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-red\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Kyton)<\/h3>\n<p>Kytons tend to fall at the bottom of the CR scale for each version of\n\t\tSummon Monster, sometimes even falling below the other options at the same\n\t\tsummon level. In addition, the abilities of the creatures are weak compared\n\t\tto similar options already on the Summon Monster list.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Augur<\/span>: Lantern Archon is considerably\n\t\t\tmore effective in combat, and the Augur&#8217;s spell-like abilities are\n\t\t\tawful.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sacristan<\/span>: Passable as a combatant,\n\t\t\tbut the Sacristan&#8217;s big draw is its Shadow Scream ability. Unfortunately,\n\t\t\tthe Sacristan can&#8217;t see in magical darkness, so it&#8217;s as blind and deaf as\n\t\t\teveryone else.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Interlocutor<\/span>: The Interlocutor is lower\n\t\t\tin CR than any of the default CR 9 summon options. As a result, its combat\n\t\t\tabilities lag behind those of other options. The Interlocutor notably can\n\t\t\tcast both Restoration and Breath of Life without paying expensive material\n\t\t\tcomponents. However, at such high level you have a variety of other\n\t\t\toptions which can get you those spells or similar effects.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Protean)<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t rush to get this until you can cast Summon 6. The Voidworm is\n\t\tcomparable to similar rings of summoning affinity at Summon 3, and the\n\t\tring&#8217;s good options don&#8217;t come online until Summon 6 and 9.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Voidworm<\/span>: Cast Commune without the\n\t\t\texpensive material component.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Naunet<\/span>: Passable in combat, the Naunet\n\t\t\tgets several attacks and has the ability to apply rounds of Confusion. I\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t like confusion, personally, so if you&#8217;re like me you may instead\n\t\t\twant to use the Naunet as an Acid Arrow cannon. The Naunet can cast Acid\n\t\t\tArrow at will. With a CL of 7, you&#8217;ll get three rounds of Acid Arrow,\n\t\t\ttotaling 6d4 damage per arrow with a range of over 700 feet.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Imentesh<\/span>: At a CR of just 10, the\n\t\t\tImentesh is fully 3 CR steps below the weakest creature on the default\n\t\t\tSummon 9 list. As a result, its attacks lag significantly behind those of\n\t\t\tother options. However, it has some notable advantages. +4d6 Sneak Attack\n\t\t\tdamage makes it a potent flanking partner, possibly allowing it to match\n\t\t\tthe damage output of other Summon 9 options. The Imentesh has a number of\n\t\t\tinteresting spell-like abilities, including Major Creation at will.\n\t\t\tFinally, Inflict Warpwave gives the Imentesh a single-target ability with\n\t\t\ta mix of debuffs, save-or-suck abilities, and a handful of heals. You can\n\t\t\tcommand your Imentesh to use it as a both a Standard Action and as a Swift\n\t\t\tAction, and since you don&#8217;t care if the Imentesh survives you don&#8217;t need\n\t\t\tto worry if the Imentesh is harmed by its own Warp Wave when it fails the\n\t\t\tsave.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-red\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Psychopomp)<\/h3>\n<p>The few passable options here are situational or redundant.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Nosoi<\/span>: Haunting Melody is the only good\n\t\t\tthing on the Nosoi&#8217;s stat block, and you can get a better DC from a spell\n\t\t\tthat you cast.<\/li>\n<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catrina<\/span>: Against a humanoid with poor\n\t\t\tWill saves, the Catrina can be a win condition. If the Catrina can affect\n\t\t\tthe target with Compel Condemned, then you just hope that the Catrina can\n\t\t\tkiss them to death before the duration of Summon Monster expires. This is\n\t\t\ta very weird monster.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Vanth<\/span>: The Vanth is scary because of its\n\t\t\tFear Aura ability, but by the time you can summon it the 10 HD cap means\n\t\t\tthat almost nothing you fight will be affected.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Morrigna<\/span>: Passable as a combatant, but\n\t\t\tits spells and spell-like abilities aren&#8217;t very interesting at such high\n\t\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Summoning Affinity (Qlippoth)<\/h3>\n<p>Few truly great options, but everything on the list is useful.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Cythnigot<\/span>: Commune without the material\n\t\t\tcomponent, and both Soften Earth and Stone and Warp Wood which are\n\t\t\tnormally exclusive to druids.<\/li>\n<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Shoggti<\/span>: Braincloud is the Shoggti&#8217;s\n\t\t\tonly interesting ability, but it&#8217;s pretty good. 1d4 Wisdom damage doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tseem like much, but it&#8217;s enough to be a real problem for divine\n\t\t\tspellcasters and if you summon multiple Shoggti (Shoggtis? Shoggties?\n\t\t\tShogtii? No idea.) they can bring down a single target in short order.<\/li>\n<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nyogoth<\/span>: The Nyogoth is all about acid,\n\t\t\tand as long as your enemies aren&#8217;t resistant to acid they&#8217;re extremely\n\t\t\tdangerous to enemies of nearly any CR. Acid Fog is a 6th-level spell, and\n\t\t\tgetting it out of Summon 7 is impressive on its own. Combine that with\n\t\t\tAcid Arrow at will, and the Nyogoth can run around in the fog firing acid\n\t\t\tarrows wherever it finds enemies and gradually wearing them down while you\n\t\t\thang out safely outside the area of the Acid Fog.<\/li>\n<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Chernobue<\/span>: 5 attacks, three of which\n\t\t\tdeal con-damage poison, and Chaos Hammer at will. If you&#8217;re fighting\n\t\t\tgood-aligned outsiders this is a fantastic option.<\/li>\n<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Augnagar<\/span>: A decent combat option, but\n\t\t\tnot significantly better than the default options.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Summoning Shackle<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A Rod of Lesser Metamagic (Extend) costs less, works on other spells, and\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t add the ridiculous 30-foot distance limitation,<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon-Slave Crystal<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The possible combinations here are massive. It&#8217;s tragic that this only\n\t\tfunctions once per day, but there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from buying more\n\t\tthan one except your limited funds. However, remember that you lose many of\n\t\tthe target creature&#8217;s abilities, including Extraordinary, Supernatural, and\n\t\tSpell-like abilities, so the best options are typically big dumb brutes like\n\t\tanimals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Summon Monster is allows you to summon a wide variety of extraplanar creatures capable of filling a variety of functions.
