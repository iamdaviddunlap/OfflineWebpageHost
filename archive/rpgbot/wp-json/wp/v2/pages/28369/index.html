Adding spellcasting makes the class much more complex to build and play, but it can also make you extremely effective. The simplest way to play the Arcane Trickster is to use the spellcasting for buffs, illusions, and utilities, but that is certainly not the only option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>True Strike offers a uniquely interesting option for the Arcane Trickster. It\n\tallows you to make a weapon attack using your Intelligence score, allowing you\n\tto focus on your spellcasting ability instead of solely on Dexterity, and it\n\tprovides a scaling damage boost which will stack with Sneak Attack. Relying on\n\tTrue Strike instead of regular attacks will dramatically improve the\n\teffectiveness of your offensive spellcasting at the cost of some AC and\n\teffectiveness with skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/rogue\/arcane-trickster-spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"29849\">Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells Guide<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Arcane Trickster&#8217;s\n\t\tdefining feature. When selecting spells, remember that Sneak Attack requires\n\t\tweapon attacks with Finesse weapons or ranged weapons, so you can&#8217;t apply it\n\t\tto spell attacks. Instead, you&#8217;ll generally rely on spells like Booming\n\t\tBlade, Shadow Blade, and True Strike.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Mage Hand Legerdemain<\/span>: Controlling the\n\t\thand as a Bonus Action means that you can pick locks and pick pockets while\n\t\tyou&#8217;re doing other things like fighting or casting other spells, and, since\n\t\tthe hand is invisible, you can send it off to do those things unnoticed\n\t\twhile you and your allies are busy hiding, fighting, carousing, or whatever\n\t\telse you do with your day.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Ambush<\/span>: Since your spell DC likely\n\t\twon&#8217;t be as good as that of a dedicated spellcaster, this does a lot to\n\t\timprove the reliability of your offensive spells. I&#8217;m still nervous to\n\t\trecommend spells which require saving throws as a go-to option for the\n\t\tArcane Trickster, but mathematically it makes sense. Disadvantage works out\n\t\tto slightly more than a -3 penalty, so, if your Intelligence is 14 or\n\t\thigher, your spells can be roughly as reliable as those of a Wizard with 20\n\t\tIntelligence.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Magical Ambush requires the Invisible condition, but it does not require\n\t\t\tyou to be actually invisible. When you take the Hide action successfully, you gain\n\t\t\tthe Invisible condition. This means that you can use Cunning Action to\n\t\t\tHide, then immediately hit an enemy with Magical Ambush.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that this only works on saves made\n\t\t\t<em>on the same turn<\/em> that you cast the spell. Repeated saves like\n\t\t\tthose against Hold Person won&#8217;t benefit, and neither will spells which\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t call for a save until the beginning of the target&#8217;s turn like\n\t\t\tWeb.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Versatile Trickster<\/span>: This won&#8217;t benefit\n\t\tyou directly, but your other melee allies can benefit a great deal.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Thief<\/span>: The obvious use is to steal\n\t\tspells from enemy spellcasters, but, in a game when you might go several\n\t\tlevels without seeing a spellcaster, a better option may be to &#8220;steal&#8221;\n\t\tspells from your party&#8217;s other spellcasters.  This can be especially helpful\nif your party has non-Wizard spellcasters.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"assassin\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Assassin<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Focused almost exclusively on dealing damage, the Assassin leans into the Rogue&#8217;s role as a Striker. Their features add some great options to enable you to deal extra damage, but you&#8217;re heavily dependent on acting early in initiative order. Against dextrous enemies, you may struggle to benefit from your biggest subclass features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Assassinate<\/strong>: The Assassin&#8217;s signature feature. It&#8217;s all\n\t\tabout going first and dealing a ton of damage on turn 1.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Initiative<\/span>: Couple with the Rogue&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\thigh Dexterity, you&#8217;ll consistently act early in the initiative order,\n\t\t\t\twhich is crucial for enabling Surprising Strikes.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Surprising Strikes<\/span>: Not a ton of\n\t\t\t\tdamage at first, but it&#8217;s easily accessible and the scaling keeps this\n\t\t\t\trelevant throughout your career. Unfortunately, a poor dice roll means\n\t\t\t\tthat your signature feature could not function.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Note that this applies during the first full round of combat, so if\n\t\t\t\t\tyou can manage a second Sneak Attack in that time, you can apply this\n\t\t\t\t\ta second time, too. This may be very difficult, but if you have a\n\t\t\t\t\tBattle Master in the party who also rolled well on initiative, you\n\t\t\t\t\tmight get to deal a big pile of damage.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Assassin&#8217;s Tools<\/strong>: Disguise Kits are only situationally\n\t\tuseful, and Poisoner&#8217;s Kits are borderline useless without the Poisoner feat,\n\t\twhich already gives you proficiency in Poisoner&#8217;s Kits.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t><strong>Infiltration Expertise<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Masterful Mimicry<\/span>: Neat, but only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful. This will depend heavily on your own creativity\n\t\t\t\tand on your DM&#8217;s willingness to play along.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Roving Aim<\/span>: This makes Advantage even\n\t\t\t\teasier, ensuring that you&#8217;ll be able to use Sneak Attack every time.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Envenom Weapons<\/span>: Cunning Strike (Poison)\n\t\tis great despite targeting Constitution saves. This outright negates the\n\t\tdamage cost to use it, making it even better. The bonus damage from this\n\t\tignores Resistance to Poison damage, but, unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t do\n\t\tanything about Advantage on saves against poison. Creatures with Resistance\n\t\tto Poison damage almost always have Advantage on saves against poison.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Death Strike<\/span>: The damage will be\n\t\texcellent when this works, but targeting a Constitution save makes this\n\t\tunreliable. To lean into this, pile as many damage sources as you can into\n\t\tthis attack. Basic Poison, buffs, Booming Blade, Piercer, whatever you can\n\t\tget. Make it hurt. Don&#8217;t forget that Surprising Strikes applies, too.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While this may be unreliable due to the save, there&#8217;s also no limit on\n\t\t\tits use, so you can use this in every encounter. However, it suffers from\n\t\t\tthe same issue as Assassinate: If you won&#8217;t beat an enemy on initiative,\n\t\t\tit won&#8217;t work at all.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"soulknife\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soulknife<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Soulknife is a psionics-based option for the rogue. Your subclass features are fueled from a pool of Psionic Energy dice which work in many ways like the Battle Master Fighter&#8217;s pool of Superiority Dice (spend a die to do a thing, and you typically roll the die and add it to the effect in some way). With some exceptions, the Soulknife always gets something for their Psionic Energy Dice, and, if you fail on whatever roll, you often get to keep the die you used, making the Soulknife reliable and satisfying to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psionic Power<\/span>: The most important part of\n\t\tthe subclass. Your pool of Psionic Energy Dice are your defining resource.\n\t\tThe die size goes from d6 to d12 over the course of your career, and you get\n\t\tmore every few levels. It looks like a big pool, but they mostly recharge on\n\t\ta Long Rest, and between long rests you can recharge just one die per Short\n\t\tRest.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If your DM adheres to the Adventuring Day rules described in the DMG,\n\t\t\tthat means you can recharge just two dice per day. Across a full day of\n\t\t\tadventuring that&#8217;s a small pool to work with and you need to be cautious\n\t\t\tabout spending your dice rather than burning through them in the first\n\t\t\tencounter. The Soulknife&#8217;s Psionic Energy Dice are much easier to retain\n\t\t\tthan the Psi Warrior&#8217;s because they often aren&#8217;t expended if you fail a\n\t\t\troll, but you&#8217;ll still need to be prudent about when something is worth a\n\t\t\tdie.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psi-Bolstered Knack<\/span>: This feature is\n\t\t\t\tall about being the best skill monkey. If you fail a check you can roll\n\t\t\t\ta die even if the chances are incredibly slim that it will make a\n\t\t\t\tdifference. There&#8217;s no waste if you still don&#8217;t make it. nearly every\n\t\t\t\tother feature like this in the game requires you to gamble the resource\n\t\t\t\ton the possibility of success.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>That said, there is the incredibly nebulous definition of &#8220;success&#8221;\n\t\t\t\t\twith regards to certain skills. If you&#8217;re making an Investigation\n\t\t\t\t\tcheck and you don&#8217;t find anything because there was nothing to find,\n\t\t\t\t\tdid you succeed or did you fail? This is a conversation to have with\n\t\t\t\t\tyour group and deciding the answer is beyond the scope of this\n\t\t\t\t\tarticle, but I have a suggestion for how to run it: because you choose\n\t\t\t\t\tto roll the Psi-die after you see what you rolled and the results of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe initial d20 roll, my suggestion is that the Psi-die is only\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered spent if the results are tangibly different after rolling\n\t\t\t\t\tit. This way &#8220;you still find nothing&#8221; doesn&#8217;t consume the die.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Whispers<\/span>: What if your party\n\t\t\t\talways had walkie-talkies? Maybe you&#8217;re scouting ahead, maybe your\n\t\t\t\tWizard wants to tell you where the fireball is going to be before they\n\t\t\t\tcast it. Rary&#8217;s Telepathic Bond is a 5th-level spell, and you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\treplicating its effects (mostly) at level 3. Rary&#8217;s Telepathic Bond also\n\t\t\t\tnotably has a 1-hour duration, and you get 1d6 hours (up to 1d12 hours\n\t\t\t\tat 17th level). You&#8217;re limited to adding 2 allies when you get this\n\t\t\t\t(you&#8217;re in the group for free), but the number increases with your\n\t\t\t\tProficiency Bonus.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Don&#8217;t forget: you get this once per day for free, so there&#8217;s little\n\t\t\t\t\treason to not use it.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Blades<\/span>: This is your primary\n\t\tcombat option. You can attack with the blades equally well in melee and at\n\t\trange, and, with a range of 60 feet, your range is much greater than that of\n\t\ta Aogue using daggers, making this one of the best options available if you\n\t\twant to be a ranged rogue. The fact that this deals psychic damage is great,\n\t\ttoo, since it&#8217;s so rarely resisted and easily bypasses common resistances to\n\t\tnon-magical weapon damage. Oh, and it&#8217;s a d6 damage die instead of the\n\t\tdagger&#8217;s d4.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The Bonus Action attack option is nice, but the comparison to regular\n\t\t\ttwo-weapon fighting is a little messy. If you&#8217;re using a Nick weapon like\n\t\t\ta dagger, you can use two-weapon fighting without spending your Bonus\n\t\t\tAction, leaving it free for Steady Aim or Cunning Action. Psychic Blades&#8217;\n\t\t\tBonus Action attack consumes your Bonus Action, but it also applies your\n\t\t\tability modifier to damage. You can&#8217;t use Psychic Blades with two-weapon\n\t\t\tfighting because the blades lack the Light property.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, this feature does have some drawbacks. The blades only manifest\n\t\t\twhen you take the Attack action or make an Opportunity Attack, which means\n\t\t\tthat you can&#8217;t easily benefit from allies using things like a Battle\n\t\t\tMaster Fighter using Commander&#8217;s Strike or Order Domain Clerics&#8217; Voice of\n\t\t\tAuthority feature. Remember that Sneak Attack is once per turn, not per\n\t\t\tround, so you&#8217;re giving up a substantial piece of Rogue optimization. The\n\t\t\tblades also don&#8217;t gain attack bonuses like a magic weapon, and you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tlocked into a damage type that some things (unintelligent creatures,\n\t\t\tespecially) have unmitigatable resistance or even immunity to. Carry some\n\t\t\tdaggers, even if they&#8217;re only as backup weapons.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can mitigate the off-turn attack limitations somewhat by drawing and\n\t\t\tstowing a dagger before or after attacking on alternate turns, but that\n\t\t\ttrades your Free Item Interaction every turn for the ability to make\n\t\t\tmeaningful attacks as a Reaction every other turn at most. That&#8217;s a hard\n\t\t\ttrade, not to mention how annoying it is. You could also get Fighting\n\t\t\tStyle (Thrown Weapon) which will allow you to draw a dagger as part of the\n\t\t\tmaking the Opportunity Attack, but that may not be worth the cost to do so\n\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re really leaning into the ability to Sneak Attack with your\n\t\t\tReaction.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t><strong>Soul Blades<\/strong>: Two ways to turn your Psychic Energy Dice\n\t\tinto solutions to frequent problems. This is also the first time where your\n\t\tpsychic dice are consistently useful in combat.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Homing Strikes<\/span>: Use this on the last\n\t\t\t\tattack of your turn (maybe you don&#8217;t want to attack with both of your\n\t\t\t\tPsychic Blades every turn; Cunning Action also exists), provided that\n\t\t\t\tyou can deal Sneak Attack with that attack. If you miss the attack roll,\n\t\t\t\tyou can try to turn a near miss into a hit. If you still miss, this\n\t\t\t\tcosts you nothing. If you do hit, you&#8217;re trading your Psionic Energy Die\n\t\t\t\tfor a Sneak Attack. That&#8217;s a very good trade a lot of the time. Even so,\n\t\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t want to use this constantly because it will deplete your\n\t\t\t\tpsionic dice pool too quickly. Use it when you need it to land that\n\t\t\t\tcrucial blow.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Teleportation<\/span>: A Bonus Action\n\t\t\t\tshort-ranged teleport. Even moving the minimum of 10 feet is enough to\n\t\t\t\tget you out of grapples and many area control effects, as well as\n\t\t\t\tthrough many tight openings like arrow slits. However, if you need to\n\t\t\t\tcross a large gap you&#8217;ll find that the unpredictable range is\n\t\t\t\tfrustrating. Fortunately, you choose whether or not you want to teleport\n\t\t\t\t<em>after<\/em> you roll the die, so you never need to worry about\n\t\t\t\taccidentally teleporting yourself above a pit of acid or something, but\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re committing to spend the die before you roll it. Look for other\n\t\t\t\toptions if you&#8217;re not likely to get as far as you need to go.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Veil<\/span>: Invisibility for a full\n\t\thour, and you get it once per day for free. An hour is a long time, and you\n\t\tcan do a lot of things without breaking Invisibility, including things like\n\t\tdisarming traps and taking the Help action to help allies in combat.\n\t\tCombined with Psychic Whispers and Expertise, you&#8217;re an amazing Scout.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can spend a Psionic Energy Die to recharge Psychic Veil, but that&#8217;s\n\t\t\tan easy way to spend your dice very quickly when mundane Stealth checks\n\t\t\twill often suffice.

Big parts of the Thief&#8217;s features also depend on\n\tthe availability of magic items and expensive mundane items like Alchemist&#8217;s\n\tFire. if those items are unavailable, you may not get a lot of use out of the\n\tThief.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Fast Hands<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sleight of Hand<\/span>: The wording here is a\n\t\t\t\tmess, but the Thief Rogue and <em>only<\/em> the Thief Rogue can use\n\t\t\t\tSleight of Hand in conjunction with Thieves&#8217; Tools to pick locks and\n\t\t\t\tdisarm traps.

This is fantastically versatile.\n<p>This also lets you take the Magic action as a Bonus Action in order to use a magic item.

Adding spellcasting makes the class much more complex to build and play, but it can also make you extremely effective. The simplest way to play the Arcane Trickster is to use the spellcasting for buffs, illusions, and utilities, but that is certainly not the only option.
