Typically, natural attack builds are unable to keep up with the damage output of weapon attack builds for martial classes, mainly due to the fact that the number of natural attacks a character can do is limited to a single attack per limb that can do a natural attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, even if a character has a bite, gore, two claws, and two pincers, they still have to choose between the bite or gore and claws or pincers during a full attack. However, the Feral Gnasher gets around this by instead dealing lots of grapple damage or stacking many natural attacks on different limbs. The best Feral Gnashers will be good at both natural attacks and grappling, but will be built to emphasize one or the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Before deciding between building more towards grappling or natural attack damage, it&#8217;s important to find out how your DM rules on the number of free actions per turn. The relevant rule for free actions is \u201cFree actions don&#8217;t take any time at all, though there may be limits to the number of free actions you can perform in a turn.\u201d This is important because the relevant grapple rule is \u201cYou can, as the creature that initiated the grapple, release the grapple as a free action, removing the condition from both you and the target.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that RAW if you land multiple attacks in a turn with the Grab ability, you can attack, free action grapple, free action release the grapple, attack again, free action grapple again, free action release again, and so on. This can get ridiculously powerful in combination with the many ways you can get additional Grabs and grapple damage, which I will outline in other sections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, many DMs may limit the number of free action\n\tgrapple\/releases that can be done in a turn. Ask your DM how many they will\n\tallow, and adjust your build choices accordingly. It may be in your benefit to\n\thave a reasonable limitation on this, because some enemies using this strategy\n\twould also become incredibly deadly and frustrating. I recommend a compromise\n\tof allowing multiple free action grapple\/releases as long as each one is on a\n\tdifferent target. That way there are still fun and strong uses of this ability\n\twithout having such insanely high single-target DPR. Additionally this leaves\n\toptions for tactical play for and against characters using this strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetype-features\">Feral Gnasher Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rage-powers\">Rage Powers<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Build &#8211; Feral Slash Bash and Gnasher<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.
