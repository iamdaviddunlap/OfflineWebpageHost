As such, they both make excellent solo characters and are excellent additions to nearly any party regardless of existing capabilities. With heavy armor and a deep well of healing form Lay on Lands, Paladins are built to survive long, hard days of adventuring, while Divine Smite provides big damage spikes when you need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, Paladins serve as a Defender, Face, and Striker. They do have some Healer and Utility options, but not enough to replace a full spellcaster in most parties. Your choice of subclass will influence which of those roles your character emphasizes, though typically it&#8217;s just a sliding scale between Defender and Striker. The Paladin&#8217;s healing capabilities can mostly replace a full spellcaster as your party&#8217;s Healer, though Paladins lack critical options like Healing Word and get acces to options like Lesser Restoration much later than a full spellcaster does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Paladins are also one of the more complex classes to play. They have a long list of class features, touching on most of the game&#8217;s core mechanics. While this sometimes makes them challenging for new players, this also makes the Paladin a great introductory class because the player needs to learn so much to play it. This complexity phases in gradually over the first 3 class levels, which is a perfect trajectory for a new player to settle into the game and their character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Paladin is an excellent addition to any party, and I strongly recommend them for experienced players playing among new players. The combination of durability, healing, protection, and smite damage makes it easy to support your party without going all-in on a support build or a healbot. I&#8217;ve had a lot of success doing this alongside new players, and the ability to rescue them when things went wrong has always felt very satisfying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

As the pool grows, you can more easily afford to use it to remove status conditions. If possible, reserve a few points as emergency healing in case allies drop to 0 hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Paladins are half casters, which means that their spellcasting advances half as quickly as full spellcasters like the Cleric. They get numerous exclusive spells, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/spells\/2618833-divine-smite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Divine Smite<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/spells\/2618879-find-steed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find Steed<\/a>, which are central to the Paladin&#8217;s identity. While Divine Smite is a huge part of your offensive capabilities, remember that your limited number of spell slots strictly limits how much smiting you can do in a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: Excellent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Weapon Mastery, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/weapon-mastery\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"29315\">Weapon Mastery Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Style<\/span>: Excellent. See Fighting Styles under Feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Paladin&#8217;s Smite<\/span>: Divine Smite prepared for free solidifies it as a central part of the Paladin&#8217;s tactics. Since it uses your Bonus Action, you can only use it once per turn. Remember that you also have other options like Blazing Smite which trade some of Divine Smite&#8217;s damage for additional effects which may be more useful than a little bit of extra damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity<\/span>: A renewable pool of resources that recharged on a Short Rest. Your subclass will typically provide additional uses for Channel Divinity, but every Paladin gets Divine Sense at level 3 and Abjure Foes at level 9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Sense<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but it covers three creature types, and both Fiends and Undead are common enemies. The ability to locate nearby creatures of the affected types negates much of the benefits of stealth and invisibility, at minimum allowing you to attack the correct space. The 10-minute duration is easily enough to get through a combat encounter, but you can also use it to locate nearby enemies before you would have noticed each other by more mundane means, allowing you to engage those enemies on your own terms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Paladin subclasses are briefly summarized below.

You still can&#8217;t smite twice in a turn, but two attacks means twice as many opportunities to hit and potentially smite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>5. <span class=\"rating-green\">Faithful Steed<\/span>: More powerful and more expendable than buying a normal mount. Even if you never ride it, your steed has 25 hit points, and will fight alongside you in combat without cutting into your action economy. You get to cast this for free once per day, but once you hit level 13 and can cast 4th-level spells you may want to use a spell slot so that your steed can fly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>6. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Protection<\/span>: One of the best defensive features in the game. Keeping allies close to you in order to protect them is often a good idea, but keep in mind that cramming the party into a small area also makes you more vulnerable to area damage. You&#8217;ll need to make choices on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>9. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Abjure Foes<\/span>: Fantastic crowd control, and since it uses your Channel Divinity, you can use it frequently <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>10. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Courage<\/span>: Fear effects are common, and Aura of Protection isn&#8217;t foolproof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Radiant Strikes<\/span>: An easy, consistent boost to your damage output. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Restoring Touch<\/span>: This covers everything covered by Lesser Restoration, and at a cost of just 5 points from Lay on Hands you can do this 14 times per day at this level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura Expansion<\/span>: This makes it much easier for allies to spread out in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-paladin-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Paladin Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Lay on Hands. Now a Bonus Action instead of an Action. No longer allows you to remove diseases.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Spellcasting. Moved from level 2 to level 1. You can change only one prepared spell per long rest instead of changing them all on a long rest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Weapon Mastery. New.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Fighting Style. Same changes as the Fighter; Fighting Styles are feats now. Paladins can now pick from any Fighting Style (2014 paladins have a restricted list). Alternatively, you can choose Blessed Warrior to get two cleric cantrips.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Paladin\u2019s Smite. Renamed from \u201cDivine Smite\u201d, but the effect of the feature is to have Divine Smite always prepared. This means that Divine Smite is now a spell, which comes with some complications. It\u2019s cast as a Bonus Action after you hit with a melee weapon or unarmed strike, so you can now smite while punching, but you can only smite once on each of your turns, and you can\u2019t smite on Opportunity Attacks. This will prevent paladins from repeatedly smiting in quick succession to burn through encounters in a single turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Divine Health. Gone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Channel Divinity. 2 users per Short Rest. Scales to 3. Divine Sense is now a Channel Divinity option rather than its own thing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Faithful Steed. New. You get Find Steed prepared for free.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Aura of Protection. The effects of Aura of Protection haven\u2019t changed, but paladin auras now work by piling more effects onto Aura of Protection rather than by having a bunch of different auras. Same effects, just easier to explain.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>9. Abjure Foes. New. Similar to the 2014 Oath of Vengeance feature Abjure Enemy. Fantastic crowd control.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11. Radiant Strikes. Renamed from Improved Divine Smite, which was a name that never made any sense because the only overlap with Divine Smite is that both deal radiant damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Cleansing Touch. Gone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Restoring Touch. Can now spend 5 points from Lay on Hands to remove status conditions similar to Lesser Restoration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Paladin Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>You want some combination of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma\n\tdepending on your build.

The High Elf&#8217;s access to a Wizard\n\t\tcantrip means that you might forgo offensive Cleric cantrips in favor of\n\t\toptions like Guidance.

I&#8217;m not sure that that&#8217;s worth a level. If you do go this route, consider starting with a level of Fighter to\n\t\tget proficiency in Constitution saving throws.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ranger<\/span>: Similar to the Fighter, you can get more Weapon Mastery Slots and an additional Fighting Style, but you also don&#8217;t slow your spell slot progression. Two levels gets you Expertise, which might be helpful for important Face skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue<\/span>: One level for Expertise is fine, but you won&#8217;t get much value beyond that. Cunning Action is great, but the Paladin depends on their Bonus Action for smiting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: If you want more spell slots\n\t\tto fuel your smites, Sorcerer is a good choice. It will advance your\n\t\tspellcasting twice as fast as Paladin levels, and a single level gets you\n\t\tmore Charisma-based Cantrips than Blessed Warrior does, plus powerful level 1 spells like Shield. Two levels gets you Font of Magic, which can let you melt your higher-level spell slots into more numerous level 1 spell slots so that you can smite more frequently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warlock<\/span>: Pact Magic and Pact of the Blade are tempting, but there&#8217;s some nuance to consider. Pact Magic spell slots can be used for Divine Smite, and since they recharge on a Short Rest, they provide a more steady supply for Divine Smite than your normal spellcasting progression. But at the same time, putting those levels into Paladin or Sorcerer will get you more and higher-level spell slots, which is more impactful unless you&#8217;re also benefiting from other Warlock features.\n<p>Pact of the Blade lets you use Charisma for attack and damage with your pact weapon, but feats which make you better with weapons grant increases to Strength or Dexterity. Focusing on Charisma reduces the Paladin&#8217;s MAD issues, but at the cost of making your best feat options unappealing.<\/p> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction DnD 5e&#8217;s Paladins are the most durable, survivable, and self-sufficient class in the game.
