It\n\tremains useful at any level, and is limited only by the small number of uses\n\tper day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unholy Resilience<\/span> (Su): The equivalent of\n\tDivine Grace, Unholy Resilience<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Touch of Corruption<\/span> (Su): The damage behind\n\tTouch of Corruption is not the primary draw. Instead, look at the effects of\n\tCruelties. Also note that Touch of Corruption does not allow you to use it on\n\tyourself as a swift action the same way that a Paladin can. Your GM may allow\n\tyou to do so if you are healed by negative energy, but check with your GM to\n\tbe sure.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Cowardice<\/span> (Su): While this is\n\tnormally not very helpful, it becomes very useful when you pick up the Shaken\n\tand Frightened cruelties.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Plague Bringer<\/span> (Ex): Immunity to disease\n\tbecomes important at high levels when disease and poison become more common,\n\tbut not as important as it is for good-aligned characters because good-aligned\n\toutsiders don&#8217;t typically use poison or disease.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cruelty<\/span> (Su): Cruelties turn Touch of\n\tCorruption into a powerful single-target crowd-control effect, and eventually\n\tinto a save-or-suck effect once you get the high-tier cruelties.

Even then, your saving throw won&#8217;t be great.\n\tIf you insist on using Channel Energy, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/channel_energy\">Practical Guide to Channel Energy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spells<\/span>: Antipaladins are 1\/2 casters, and\n\ttheir spell list strongly resembles the Paladin spell list. However, the\n\tAntipaladin lacks many of the Paladin&#8217;s best buffs and lacks healing options\n\tof any kind.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiendish Boon<\/span> (Sp): Both options are\n\tfantastic. The ability to enhance your weapon can solve a lot of problems,\n\tincluding DR, but fiendish companions offer a lot of amazing options. For help\n\twith Fiendish Companions, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/antipaladin\/companion\">Practical Guide to Fiendish Companions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Despair<\/span> (Su): This has the fantastic\n\tside-effect of making enemies more susceptible to your Touch of Corruption,\n\tbut your allies will also appreciate the penalty against their spells and\n\tabilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Vengeance<\/span> (Su): Fantastic, but\n\tremember that allies must still use a swift action to activate Smite Good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Sin<\/span> (Su): Fantastic for combating\n\tgood-aligned outsiders.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Depravity<\/span> (Su): DR 5\/good will\n\tprotect you from everything except enemy divine spellcasters and good-aligned\n\toutsiders.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unholy Champion<\/span> (Su): Good, but not great.\n\tThe Banishment effect forcible ends your Smite even if it fails, and you can&#8217;t\n\tchoose to forego the effect. Personally I would rather outright kill the\n\toutsider so that it can&#8217;t come back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Antipaladin&#8217;s abilities are much the same as any heavy armored melee\n\tcharacter, but the Antipaladin&#8217;s divine abilities add a dependence on\n\tCharisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: The Antipaladin is a strictly melee\n\tclass, which means that you need Strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: You need 12 to fill out full plate,\n\tbut even that isn&#8217;t strictly necessary, especially if you plan to use a\n\tshield.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: As a front-line character, hit points\n\tare always important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: The Antipaladin&#8217;s skill list is very\n\tshort, and more skill ranks won&#8217;t fix that.

The bonuses\n\tto Constitution and Wisdom offset most of the lost bonus from Unholy\n\tResilience, and the Dwarf&#8217;s other abilities complement the Antipaladin&#8217;s\n\tnatural durability very well. Unfortunately the Dwarf favored class bonus adds\n\tto Concentration, which is nearly worthless for Antipaladins.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: Nothing useful for the Antipaladin.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: Despite small size and a strength\n\tpenalty, the Gnome isn&#8217;t completely awful as an Antipaladin. Bonuses to both\n\tConstitution and Charisma work well with the Antipaladin&#8217;s abilities, but many\n\tof the Gnome&#8217;s other abilities may be wasted. The Gnome Paladin favored class\n\tbonus adds to Lay of Hands healing, so you could reasonably alter it to\n\timprove Touch of Corruption damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tnice, and the Half-Elf has some nice alternate racial features which can work\n\twell for the Antipaladin. The Half-Elf&#8217;s favored class bonus expands the area\n\tof the Paladin&#8217;s auras. Considering the Antipaladin has 5 auras (not counting\n\tAura of Evil), this can be a fantastic buff. If you&#8217;re happy with your aura\n\trange, pick up the Human favored class bonus for some permanent energy\n\tresistance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Flexible ability bonus and some\n\tnice racial abilities which complement the Antipaladin well. Unfortunately,\n\tthe Half-Orc favored class bonus is awful, so pick up the Human favored class\n\tbonus for some permanent energy resistance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: A little less effective than the\n\tGnome because the Dexterity bonus isn&#8217;t as helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always a good option, and the Human\n\tfavored class bonus adds energy resistance to one type of energy. Pick up a\n\tfew points in the four basic energy types (acid, cold, electricity, fire), but\n\tdon&#8217;t worry about sonic. Remember that this resistance stacks with magical\n\tenergy resistance such as the Resist Energy spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (Combat): Antipaladins spend\n\t\ta lot of time in melee by themselves, so this can pay off frequently if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have any other melee allies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): Reflex saves are\n\t\tyour worst save, though they&#8217;ll still be fantastic thanks to Divine\n\t\tGrace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Birthmark<\/span> (Faith): Charm and compulsion\n\t\teffects are scary, but you have Divine grace and good Will saves.

Even if you skip sonic damage you&#8217;re still\n\t\tgetting 8 levels worth of favored class bonus out of one trait. Normally I\n\t\tdon&#8217;t worry about sonic damage, but I think you can spare one point to get 3\n\t\tpoints of resistance, especially for the smug satisfaction of telling people\n\t\tthat you&#8217;ve got sonic damage resistance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Influence<\/span> (Social): Pick up whichever\n\t\tmissing Face skill you didn&#8217;t already get.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Seeker<\/span> (Social): The most rolled skill in\n\t\tgame.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Essential if you plan to\n\t\tplay a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disguise<\/span> (Cha): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): The Fiendish Companion\n\t\tis not technically an animal companion, and you can&#8217;t teach it tricks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Essential if you plan\n\t\tto play a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (religion)<\/span> (Int): One of the\n\t\tmost important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Helpful if you plan to ride\n\t\tyour fiendish companion, but otherwise useless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Essential if you plan\n\t\tto play a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): In full plate you&#8217;re not\n\t\tgoing to have much luck sneaking around.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Ability Focus<\/span>: If this works for Touch of Corruption\n\t\t(and I think it does) it&#8217;s absolutely incredible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Adept Champion<\/span>: Technically requires\n\t\tSmite Evil, but any reasonable GM should allow this to work with Smite Good.\n\t\tThis can add an impressive bonus to your CMB at the expense of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Extra Channel<\/span>: The Antipaladin isn&#8217;t good\n\t\tat channeling energy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Lay On Hands<\/span>: 4 levels worth of\n\t\tadditional uses of Touch of Corruption.

Clerics in particular have a lot of really great\n\t\tbuffs, and many have long durations. Magic Vestments, for example, is a\n\t\t3rd-level Cleric spell with hours\/level duration that can save you a fortune\n\t\ton armor enhancement.

The Antipaladin gets every social skill except Diplomacy, so if you plan to play a Face be sure to use a trait to pick up Diplomacy as a class skill.
