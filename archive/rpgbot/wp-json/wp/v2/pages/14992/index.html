The spell list\n\t\tgets a little better if you&#8217;re underwater frequently, but even then there&#8217;s\n\t\tnot a lot to be excited about.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Two situational\n\t\t\t\toptions. Thunderwave is fine if you get stuck in melee or need to break\n\t\t\t\ta grapple, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider it a go-to damage option because\n\t\t\t\tgetting close enough to hit multiple targets often means getting into\n\t\t\t\tmelee by choice.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Gust of Wind is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational, but Silence is a huge problem for enemy spellcasters,\n\t\t\t\tespecially if your party can keep them inside the area by grappling\n\t\t\t\tthem, hitting them with a tentacle which applies a speed reduction, or\n\t\t\t\totherwise inhibiting their movement.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Lightning Bolt is\n\t\t\t\tfine damage, but hitting more than two targets with line effects is hard\n\t\t\t\tregardless of the line&#8217;s length. Sleet Storm is decent area control but\n\t\t\t\tvery hard to use effectively, doesn&#8217;t scale with spell slot level, and\n\t\t\t\trequires Concentration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Control Water is very\n\t\t\t\tsituational in non-aquatic campaigns, and limiting Summon Elemental to\n\t\t\t\twater elementals similarly handicaps the spell unless you&#8217;re in an\n\t\t\t\taquatic campaign.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Bigby&#8217;s Hand is a\n\t\t\t\tgreat, versatile spell. Cone of Cold is decent if unremarkable AOE\n\t\t\t\tdamage, but if you need area damage you&#8217;ll have better results with\n\t\t\t\tHunger of Hadar.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Tentacle of the Deeps<\/span>: At 1st level, this\n\t\tmatches the effects of Ray of Frost (at least in terms of damage and the\n\t\tsecondary effect. With a 1-minute duration it will get you through a single\n\t\tencounter each time you use it, provided that the encounter doesn&#8217;t move too\n\t\tfar away from the tentacle to reasonably bring the tentacle back into range.\n\t\tThis reduces your reliance on Hex at low levels, allowing you to use your\n\t\tone or two spell slots elsewhere without sacrificing damage output. However,\n\t\tsince the daily usage limit is tied to your Proficiency Bonus, you won&#8217;t be\n\t\table to use this as often as you could use Hex. Consider the two options\n\t\tcomplements to each other: use Hex if you just need to Eldritch Blast stuff,\n\t\tand use Tentacle of the Deeps when you need to use Concentration on\n\t\tsomething other than Hex.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gift of the Sea<\/span>: Great in an aquatic\n\t\tcampaign, but otherwise very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Oceanic Soul<\/span>: Damage resistance is great,\n\t\tand, in an aquatic campaign, the ability to speak to all submerged creatures\n\t\twill make it much easier for you to play a face. However, outside of aquatic\n\t\tcampaigns you may find it difficult to convince creatures to talk to you\n\t\twhile underwater unless you already share a language.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guardian Coil<\/span>: You likely don&#8217;t have any\n\t\tinteresting ways to use your Reaction, so using it to reduce damage to\n\t\tyourself or an ally is an excellent addition to your capabilities. With a\n\t\t1-minute duration on your tentacle, you could reduce up to 10d8 (20d8 at\n\t\tlevel 10) damage every time you use it, dramatically improving your party&#8217;s\n\t\tability to handle damage without resorting to in-combat healing.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grasping Tentacles<\/span>: Evard&#8217;s Black\n\t\tTentacles is a good spell. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s better than Hunger of Hadar,\n\t\tbut the added benefits from this feature certainly help. You get to cast\n\t\tthis once per day for free, which helps with the Warlock&#8217;s tiny pool of\n\t\tspell slots, and any time you cast it (free or otherwise), you get temporary\n\t\thit points. Being unable to lose Concentration on black tentacles due to\n\t\ttaking damage also helps quite a bit in combat, making this an easy go-to\n\t\toption in dangerous situations.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fathomless Plunge<\/span>: With a 1-mile range,\n\t\tthis isn&#8217;t exactly a long-distance teleportation option. Rather, this is a\n\t\tpanic button. When things are going poorly, grab your friends and retreat to\n\t\ta nearby body of water. However, keep in mind this feature has very strict\n\t\tlimitations. You can bring 5 other willing creatures, so if your party is\n\t\tbigger than that you&#8217;re in trouble. There&#8217;s also some debate over whether\n\t\tunconscious allies can be &#8220;willing&#8221;, so if allies are down you might not be\n\t\table to save them. The 1-mile range is small, so you need to be very careful\n\t\tto stay near a suitable body of water, which is hard when you&#8217;re delving\n\t\tdungeons or wandering the planes. Of course, it&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re in an\n\t\tocean because you can just pop out in a different part of the ocean.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fathomless-ability-scores\">Fathomless Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We like all the same ability scores that other Warlocks like.

Medium Armor and a shield is honestly pretty good, especially for casters, who can carry a component pouch so they have a free hand opposite the shield. This is mostly thanks to 5E\u2019s bounded accuracy, which makes AC worth investing in and Medium Armor happens to be the easiest to invest in as far as ability scores go.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient (Constitution)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: In any of my guides, you\u2019ve probably heard me go on about this feat at length. It really is such a good option, not only improving Concentration saves but also protecting against many dangerous save-or-suck effects. Funny though that, like Moderately Armored, this feat could also be bypassed through clever multiclassing. If, for example, you started with a Fighter dip as your first level, you\u2019d get both the Constitution proficiency and all the armors. Multiclassing truly does open up the full power of a character.<\/li>\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3-5 - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3-5 - longer_content -->\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Chef<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Calamari, anyone? Jokes aside, it\u2019s not a bad option when you\u2019re evening out an odd Constitution score. And who can pass on the flavor of offering the party a taste of what the deep has to offer, in a manner of speaking at least. There is at least a bit of selfish motivation here. By making short rests even better, we encourage the party to maybe take an extra one each adventuring day.

If you\u2019ve gotten Medium proficiency, either through multiclassing or Moderately Armored, then you\u2019ll be looking for Half-Plate, similar to a Hexblade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Weapons, on the other hand, are not in the Fathomless\u2019 interest. Keeping an open hand for somatic components is useful, and if you happen to be holding a shield, the best option for that is having a component pouch over having a spell focus (unless you find a magic one but then you have to start juggling or take Warcaster).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-fathomless-warlock-build-never-safe-from-water\">Example Fathomless Warlock Build &#8211; Never Safe From Water<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This build focuses on using the Tentacle of the Deeps feature to add a bit of zoning and control in combat. The damage isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s a good use of our bonus action and helps stretch out spell slots by saving on having to cast Hex as often as other Warlocks. Additionally, we make some unconventional feat choices to increase our own personal protection without resorting to multiclassing. I think the build turns out fine this way.

We can just take the Eldritch Mind invocation for now and trade it out later when we get Resilient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, we take Resilient (Constitution), gaining save proficiency and adding +1 Constitution, going from 16 to 17.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we\u2019re taking Chef to improve the benefits of short resting to encourage the party to get an extra one in each day for the benefit of our Pact Magic slots. We also gain another +1 to Constitution, going from 17 to 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At nineteenth level, we\u2019re taking an ASI for +2 Constitution, capping at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Bonus Feat: Moderately Armored<br><br>Patron: Fathomless<br>-Tentacle of the Deeps<br>-Gift of the Sea<br><br>Pact Magic &#8211; 1 Slot<br>-Cantrips<br>\u2013Eldritch Blast<br>\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/mage-hand\/\">Mage Hand<\/a><br>-1st-level Spells<br>\u2013Armor of Agathys<br>\u2013Hex (c)<br><br>Skills<br>-Acrobatics<br>-Arcana<br>-Deception<br>-Intimidation<br>-Performance<\/td><td>For starting equipment, it\u2019s possible to roll for money and get what we need, since we\u2019ll need 50 GP for Scale Mail, 10 GP for a shield, and 25 GP for a Component Pouch, but I suggest talking with your DM and asking if they mind you just getting Scale Mail as starting gear like other classes that have proficiency by default.<br><br>We get two cantrips and two 1st-level spells at first level.<br>Eldritch Blast is our big reason for being a Warlock. Really important for blasting our foes in the face.<br><br>Mage Hand is a useful spell for doing small things and we can even say it looks like a tentacle when we cast it.<br><br>We only get one slot at this level, and Hex lasts an hour so it\u2019s really useful. Armor of Agathys also lasts an hour so it makes another good choice.<br><br>The Fathomless Patron grants us Tentacle of the Deeps and Gift of the Sea.<br><br>We only get two uses of the Tentacle each day, so don\u2019t waste it but also don\u2019t forget to use it.<br><br>Gift of the Sea is just a swim speed and water breathing. It\u2019s nice when it comes up, and if we can make use of it that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not the end of the world if it\u2019s not relevant because it\u2019s more of a ribbon feature unless you\u2019re in an aquatic campaign.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Invocations<br>-Agonizing Blast<br>-Repelling Blast (Devil\u2019s Sight)<br><br>Pact Magic &#8211; 2 Slots<br>-1st-level Spell<br>\u2013Thunderwave<br>-Or-<br>\u2013Arms of Hadar<\/td><td>Agonizing Blast and Repelling Blast are the key components of forcefully blasting people for fun, profit, and tons of damage. Remember that the same bonus action to tentacle smack someone also allows the tentacle to teleport up to 30 feet before the attack. As long as we don\u2019t repel someone more than 40 feet away from the tentacle, they can be smacked. Alternatively, nothing prevents us from smacking first and repelling later.<br><br>Really, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s more important to repel targets into things that can\u2019t move, like Webs or Walls of Fire or Black Tentacles.<br><br>We could take Devil\u2019s Sight early and leave Repelling for later if we really need the Darkvision now.<br><br>Thunderwave is an AoE spell we get from the Fathomless expanded spell list. While it is a Constitution save, it\u2019s a nice source of pushing targets and the damage isn\u2019t bad.<br><br>Optionally, Arms of Hadar is a little more area radiating out from us for less damage, but vs a Strength save and robbing targets of their Reactions instead of pushing them.<br><br>I think Thunderwave is easier to aim, but Arms of Hadar is fine if that\u2019s your preference.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Pact Boon<br>-Pact of the Talisman<br><br>Pact Magic<br>-2nd-level Spell<br>\u2013Invisibility (c)<br>-Retrain<br>\u2013Thunderwave \u2013&gt; Shatter<\/td><td>For our Pact Boon, we take the Pact of the Talisman.

While it may seem we have competing reactions, there are still going to be fights without the Tentacle and this helps with those.<br><br>Keep in mind the range of this; the <em>attacker <\/em>must be within 30 feet of <em>us<\/em>, not the bearer of the Talisman.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum 7<br>-Forcecage<br><br>Pact Magic<br>-3rd-level Spell<br>\u2013Fear (c)<\/td><td>Forcecage.

If there is a convenient body of water nearby for using this it\u2019s good, but on the average we\u2019ll have trouble using this unless you\u2019re actively in water or you\u2019re in a place like Minnesota where you\u2019re perpetually and inexplicably adjacent to a body of water.<br><br>I don\u2019t have much advice for making this work if there isn\u2019t already convenient water in the area.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum 8<br>-Glibness<br><br>Invocation<br>-Shroud of Shadow<br><br>Pact Magic<br>-4th-level Spell<br>\u2013Sickening Radiance (c)<br>-5th-level Spell<br>-Retrain<br>\u2013Invisibility \u2013&gt; Hold Monster (c)<\/td><td>Of course Tentacles are your friends, and, while Glibness is running, you\u2019ll believe me.<br><br>At-will Invisibility is a very nice Invocation.
