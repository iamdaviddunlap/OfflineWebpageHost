Bloodrage helps by providing a\n\tbonus to Will saves, but don&#8217;t use that as an excuse to not boost your Will\n\tsaves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple and Martial\n\tweapons\n\tgive you lots of options, and medium armor and shields will give you a\n\trespectable armor class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill ranks, but the\n\tBloodrager&#8217;s skill list is very sparse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline<\/span>: Bloodlines grant bonus feats,\n\tbonus spells known, and several abilities. These options determine greatly\n\thow your character operates in combat, and can determine your role in the\n\tparty. For help selecting a bloodline, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/bloodrager\/bloodlines\">Bloodrager Bloodline Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodrage<\/span> (Su): The Bloodrager&#8217;s\n\tsignature\n\tability. This is almost identical to the Barbarian&#8217;s Rage ability, but it\n\talso activates the abilities granted by the Bloodrager&#8217;s Bloodline.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Movement<\/span> (Ex): Excellent,\n\tespecially\n\tfor highly mobile builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Situational. If\n\tyou&#8217;re worried about being ambushed, invest in Perception.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Sanctuary<\/span> (Su): Or you and your\n\tallies could just not drop fireballs on each other. That&#8217;s good too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Casting<\/span> (Su): If you&#8217;re in combat,\n\tyou should be bloodraging. This allows you to use all of your tricks at the\n\tsame time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eschew Materials<\/span>: Nice, but replaceable\n\twith a spell component pouch, and most GMs hand-wave the material\n\tcomponents\n\tof spells covered by Eschew Materials.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spells<\/span>: The Bloodrager only gets 4\n\tlevels\n\tof spells, but the Bloodrager spell list is fairly good, and includes a lot\n\tof buffs which are really fantastic for melee characters. Unlike other 1\/2\n\tcasters like the Ranger or the Paladin, Bloodragers get their full class\n\tlevel as their caster level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Extremely\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Damage Reduction<\/span> (Ex): DR\/- is fantastic\n\ton any character.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Bloodrage<\/span> (Su): This is really\n\tfantastic. A lot of really fantastic buffs have rounds\/level durations,\n\twhich makes it hard to spend a whole combat round casting them. This allows\n\tyou to pick up one of those buffs as a free action, and get right into the\n\tfight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indomitable Will<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but\n\tEnchantment spells are among the scariest effects in the game, and\n\tmind-controlling the party&#8217;s front-line characters is a great way for\n\tenemies to ruin the party&#8217;s day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tireless Bloodrage<\/span> (Su): While this\n\tisn&#8217;t\n\tas important for the Bloodrager as it is for the Barbarian because the\n\tBloodrager doesn&#8217;t need to rage cycle, it&#8217;s still fantastic. If you used\n\tGreater Bloodrage to apply a spell and the spell isn&#8217;t required anymore,\n\tyou\n\tcan drop out of Bloodrage and start again with a new buff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mighty Bloodrage<\/span> (Su): Excellent linear\n\tincrease to the effectiveness of Bloodrage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: The Bloodrager is a melee combatant,\n\tand you need enough Strength to be scary with a weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: With only medium armor, you want\n\tenough AC to keep yourself alive, and Bloodragers have poor Reflex saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: d10 hit points is good, but you\n\tstill need extra hit points to survive in your medium armor. Constitution\n\talso gives you extra Bloodrage rounds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Intelligence only gives you skill\n\tranks, and the Bloodrager&#8217;s skill list is lousy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Only needed for Will saves, but\n\tcertainly don&#8217;t dump it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cha<\/span>: You need 14 for your spells, but\n\tyou\n\tdon&#8217;t need to worry about getting more because you should never be relying\n\ton your spell DCs. You may be want to invest in more charisma for\n\tadditional\n\tspell slots, but don&#8217;t explore that possibility until a Charisma headband\n\tis\n\taffordable enough that you can do it without cutting into more important\n\tresources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 15<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 13<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 15<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 13<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Like the Barbarian, Strength is key. Charisma bonuses are nice, but hardly essential, and bonuses to defensive abilities will keep the Bloodrager alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarf<\/span>: The Dwarf is an excellent\n\tdefensive option for many melee classes, and the Bloodrager is no\n\texception.\n\tThe Charisma penalty is a problem, but because you don&#8217;t need much more\n\tthan\n\t14 Charisma it&#8217;s fairly easy to overcome. The Dwarf favored class bonus\n\tgrants extra rage rounds, which is always nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: The Elf has nothing to do with the\n\tBloodrager.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: The Strength penalty is\n\tproblematic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tnice, and the Half-Elf&#8217;s other bonuses are nice, but they don&#8217;t\n\tspecifically\n\tcontribute to the Bloodrager. The Half-Elf favored class bonus is garbage,\n\tso take the Human favored class bonus to get extra rage rounds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tnice, and Darkvision is always fantastic. The Half-Orc favored class bonus\n\tgrants extra rage rounds, which is always nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: The Strength penalty is\n\tproblematic, but if you&#8217;re dead set on playing a small character the\n\tHalfling&#8217;s bonus to Charisma will help the Bloodrager&#8217;s spells a little\n\tbit.\n\tThe Halfling favored class bonus is surprisingly good, and because most\n\tthings are medium or bigger it will apply in most fights.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always fantastic, the flexible\n\tbonus can go into Strength or Charisma, and the bonus feat can be very\n\thelpful. The Human favored class bonus grants extra rage rounds, which is\n\talways nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Anatomist<\/span> (Combat): Improved Critical\n\t\ton a falchion is good choice. +1 to confirm critical hits could be a\n\t\tworthwhile use of a trait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Axe to Grind:<\/span> (Combat): You will\n\t\tfrequently go toe-to-toe with enemies on your own, so this can be a\n\t\treliable bonus to damage. The value will be eclipsed at higher levels as\n\t\tyour damage bonus grows, but it can be nice for low level campaigns where\n\t\t1 or two damage is a big part of something&#8217;s hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodthirsty<\/span> (Combat): Hard to keep\n\t\ttrack\n\t\tof, and hard to bring into play frequently.

If you\n\t\twant to have reach, go for the Guisarme.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Longsword<\/span>: The Bloodrager is\n\t\tproficient with shields, but still incurs an arcane spell failure penalty\n\t\twhen using them, making sword and board fighting styles problematic. If\n\t\tyou really want a shield, stick to a mithral buckler.

The Mithral Buckler has 0% arcane spell failure,\n\t\twhich makes it a nice option for any arcane spellcaster. If you&#8217;re not\n\t\tusing a two-handed weapon, it&#8217;s certainly worth the price.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Breastplate<\/span>: The best armor available\n\t\tto\n\t\tthe Bloodrager without a feat. Upgrade to Mithral if you need mobility or\n\t\tif your Dexterity is particularly high.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mithral Full Plate<\/span>: If you want a bit\n\t\tmore AC, Heavy Armor Proficiency is a good investment, and Mithral Full\n\t\tPlate won&#8217;t interfere with your spells or Bloodrage, and has the same +3\n\t\tmax dex as a Breastplate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Furious<\/span> (+1): An obvious go-to option\n\t\tfor anyone with a rage ability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Invigorating<\/span> (+2): +2 is expensive,\n\t\tbut this opens up a lot of really great build options. If you like to use\n\t\tabilities which end your rage like Furious Finish, this can let you rage\n\t\tcycle so long as you can kill something in reasonably short order.

Depending on your\n\t\tbloodline this could include some great options. At high levels you&#8217;ll\n\t\thave a mountain of rage rounds to spend and since the Bloodrager only\n\t\tgets\n\t\t4th-level spell slots the economy is really good. Unfortunately, you can\n\t\tonly use this three times per day, but at 4,000gp you can afford more\n\t\tthan\n\t\tone if you find that you&#8217;re getting a lot of mileage out of one ring. If\n\t\tyou rarely cast your bloodline spells, skip this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lingering Blood Magic<\/span>: Except at very\n\t\tlow\n\t\tlevels where you don&#8217;t have rage rounds to waste on this, spells with\n\t\tdurations in rounds\/level typically outlast the fight they were cast\n\t\tin.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Powerful Blood Magic<\/span>: Avoid spells which\n\t\trely on save DCs at all costs.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vengeful Blood Magic<\/span>: You don&#8217;t have\n\t\ta\n\t\tlot of spell slots to power this, and ideally your weapon attacks are\n\t\tstrong enough that this isn&#8217;t a must-have.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Bloodrager really has all that it needs, and gains a lot of excellent abilities as you increase in level.
