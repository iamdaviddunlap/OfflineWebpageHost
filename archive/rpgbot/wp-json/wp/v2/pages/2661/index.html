As such, they both make excellent solo characters and are excellent additions to nearly any party regardless of existing capabilities. In a party, they serve as a Defender, Face, and Striker. They do have some healing and utility options, but not enough to replace a full spellcaster in most parties. Your choice of subclass will influence which of those roles your character emphasizes, though typically it&#8217;s just a sliding scale between Defender and Striker, much like the Barbarian and the Fighter. The Paladin&#8217;s healing capabilities can mostly replace a full spellcaster as your party&#8217;s Healer, though paladins lack critical options like Healing Word.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Paladins are extremely durable and can survive a long hard day of adventuring, but none of their abilities except Channel Divinity recharge on a short rest, so you need to ration your resources more strictly than some classes. They also have nearly no options for fighting at range, which means that nearly every paladin is a heavily-armored melee monster, occasionally throwing javelins when there simply isn&#8217;t another option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Paladins are also one of the more complex classes to play. They have a long list of class features, touching on most of the game&#8217;s core mechanics. While this sometimes makes them challenging for new players, this also makes the Paladin a great introductory class because the player needs to learn so much to play it. This complexity phases in gradually over the first three class levels, which is a perfect trajectory for a new player to settle into the game and their character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Paladin is an excellent addition to any party, and I strongly recommend them for experienced players playing among new players. The combination of durability, healing, protection, and smite damage makes it easy to support your party without going all-in on a support build or a healbot. I&#8217;ve had a lot of success doing this alongside new players, and the ability to rescue them when things went wrong has always felt very satisfying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our other supporting material for the Paladin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11915\">Paladin Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/subclasses\">Paladin Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/spells\">Paladin Spells Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/oathtakers-and-oathbreakers-how-to-rp-your-paladins-divine-duty\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"17986\">Oathtakers and Oathbreakers: How to RP Your Paladin\u2019s Divine Duty<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/paladin-levels-1-4-in-the-name-of-good-a-guide-to-the-holy-warrior-class-rpgbot-podcast-s4e32\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26519\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Paladin Optimization Part 1<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/paladin-levels-5-20-the-path-to-paladinhood-character-build-tips-and-tricks-rpgbot-podcast-s4e33\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26570\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Paladin Optimization Part 2<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

Since it has such a deep pool and\n\tallows you to pick exactly how much you heal, it&#8217;s actually viable during\n\tcombat (healing in combat is typically a poor tactical decision). With such a\n\tlarge pool you can easily bring many allies from 0 to nearly full health in a\n\tsingle Action, or you can spend 1 point to bring them back to consciousness\n\tlong enough to finish a fight so that they can rest and spend Hit Dice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Style<\/span>: Paladins get a smaller list\n\tthan Fighters, but your choice will frequently define how you approach\n\tcombat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The options below include the optional fighting styles introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything. Check with your DM before assuming that those styles are allowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more detailed advice on Fighting Styles, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fighting-styles\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24309\">Practical Guide to Fighting Styles<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blind Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): This one is\n\t\thard. Blindsight, even at just 10-foot range, is extremely useful. It solves\n\t\tissues of invisible enemies, it helps make up for lack of magical options\n\t\tfor Darkvision, and it addresses effects which block line of sight like fog,\n\t\tmagical darkness, or other stuff. But those effects don&#8217;t appear in most\n\t\tencounters, so this is only situationally useful. When it works it&#8217;s great,\n\t\tbut the rest of the time it&#8217;s useless. Unless you have allies in the party\n\t\twho plan to frequently use magical darkness or other options to obscure\n\t\tvision I would skip this.\n\t\t<p>Races which suffer from Sunlight Sensitivity might consider this as a\n\t\t\tsolution to their sunlight issues. If you don a blindfold (or close your\n\t\t\teyes), your DM may allow you to overcome the effects of Sunlight\n\t\t\tSensitivity by willingly blinding yourself. The text of Sunlight\n\t\t\tSensitivity isn&#8217;t perfectly clear if it only applies to attacks which rely\n\t\t\ton sight, so this may not work RAW, but the idea makes sense.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defense<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Not very exciting, but since AC scales so little in 5e a +1 can be a big\n\t\tdifference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blessed Warrior<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): Access to\n\t\tcantrips allows the Paladin to build around spellcasting as their primary\n\t\tcombat option. Unlike the Ranger with Druidic Warrior and Shillelagh, this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t mean using a magically-enhanced weapon. Instead, it means switching\n\t\tto offensive cantrips. I recommend Word of Radiance so that you can handle\n\t\tcrowds plus one offensive option with longer range and ideally a damage type\n\t\tother than radiant (though Sacred Flame is a perfectly fine choice).\n\t\t<p>Unlike the Ranger&#8217;s Druidic Warrior, Blessed Warrior doesn&#8217;t have any\n\t\t\teffect on the Paladin&#8217;s armor choices. You&#8217;ll do just fine marching around\n\t\t\tin heavy armor, though you may want 15 Strength to avoid the 10 ft. speed\n\t\t\tpenalty. It&#8217;s hard to run into melee to use Word of Radiance when you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tstuck at 20 ft. speed.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You might (and probably should) ask yourself: If I want to use Blessed\n\t\t\tWarrior, what am I getting mechanically that I couldn&#8217;t get from playing a\n\t\t\tcleric or a divine soul sorcerer instead? That&#8217;s a great question. The\n\t\t\tpaladin has some unique defensive options like Aura of Protection, plus\n\t\t\ttheir subclasses are really neat. That might be enough. If it&#8217;s not, maybe\n\t\t\tstick to a full spellcasting class.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Note that this works while using a shield. 2 damage closes the damage gap\n\t\tbetween a longsword and a two-handed weapon (4.5-&gt;6.5 vs. 6.5\/7).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Weapon Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This adds\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/rpg.stackexchange.com\/questions\/47172\/how-much-damage-does-great-weapon-fighting-add-on-average#answer-47173\">just over 1 damage per attack on average<\/a>, and even then only with a greatsword. If you&#8217;re using a greatsword,\n\t\tthe average increase in damage per round is roughly equivalent to Archery,\n\t\tbut if you plan to use two-handed weapons other than a greatsword, consider picking\n\t\tDefense instead to compensate for the  alack of a shield. Note that the reroll\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/666462581184315394\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is not intended to apply to Smite damage dice<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Interception<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): Conceptually\n\t\tsimilar to Protection, but there&#8217;s no nuance in how the two styles protect\n\t\tyour target. Protection imposes Disadvantage, so if there&#8217;s a good chance\n\t\tthat the attack would miss it&#8217;s the better choice. Interception reduces the\n\t\tdamage, so it always worksuse but for big attacks it won&#8217;t negate the whole\n\t\tattack. The decision between the two comes down to who you&#8217;re going to be\n\t\tprotecting. If you&#8217;re protecting other allies with decent AC (a melee cleric\n\t\tor rogue, for example), go for Protection. If you&#8217;re protecting allies with\n\t\tawful AC (most wizards), Disadvantage won&#8217;t help much so go for\n\t\tInterception.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Tempting for Defender builds, but allies need to remain adjacent to you\n\t\tfor this to work. Being adjacent to the front line tank is generally a bad\n\t\tplace to be unless you can do so safely without someone defending you. This\n\t\talso appeals to mounted combat builds because you can use it oato compensate for\n\t\tyour mount&#8217;s relative fragility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Paladins get a nice mix of\n\tbuffs and healing options, but they also get a set of mostly exclusive &#8220;smite&#8221;\n\tspells. Instead of relying solely on Divine Smite, they can cast various smite\n\tspells which deal damage and sometimes have rider effects, like Searing\n\tSmite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Smite<\/span>: This will eat through your\n\tspell slots very quickly, but it&#8217;s also the Paladin&#8217;s greatest source of\n\tdamage. When you get this at level 2, the base damage plus a longsword is\n\tenough to one-shot a decent chunk of the enemies you might encounter. However,\n\tyou need to resist the temptation to feed all of your spell slots into Divine\n\tSmite as quickly as possible, or you will find yourself out of options at the\n\tend of the day. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also consider the utility of smite spells. Searing Smite, Thunderous Smite, and Wrathful Smite can do comparable damage with helpful rider effects which may be more appealing than the small amount of extra damage that Divine Smite provides. The biggest appeal of Divine Smite over those spells is that you can choose to use it after you&#8217;ve rolled a critical hit, guaranteeing that you&#8217;ll double the additional damage dice and therefore getting considerably more out of your spell slot than you might<br>otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Health<\/span>: Diseases can be very\n\tproblematic, but you already have the ability to cure them with Lay On Hands,\n\tso this isn&#8217;t terribly helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sacred Oath<\/strong>: Paladin subclasses are briefly summarized\n\tbelow.

The Paladin\n\tgets just 5 new spells, few of which are truly fantastic for the Paladin.\n\tWarding Bond is the only spell which I would rush to suggest, but the other\n\tspell options do have some niche use cases. There&#8217;s nothing here that&#8217;s going\n\tto unbalance the game, and the fact that Warding Bond wasn&#8217;t already on the\n\tPaladin&#8217;s spell list feels like an oversight.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighting Style Options<\/span> (Addition): Exciting\n\tnew options. Blessed Warrior is notably exclusive to the paladin, allowing\n\tplayers to explore a more casting-focused paladin and potentially build around\n\tCharisma rather than Strength or Dexterity. The new options are all interesting new\n\tbuild concepts, though they&#8217;re no more powerful than those which are already\n\tavailable.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing the new Fighting Style options on all paladins. I don&#8217;t\n\texpect the new options to supplant existing options as the best options for\n\tthe Paladin, but the new options introduce exciting new build possibilities.\n\tPlus, paladins still only get one unless they spend a feat or multiclass.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Harness Divine Power<\/span> (Addition): For paladin\n\tsubclasses with poor or situational Channel Divinity options, this offers a\n\tgreat way to make use of a resource which might otherwise be ignored for\n\tseveral sessions at a time. It also helps stretch the Paladin&#8217;s extremely\n\tlimited number of spell slots.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Harness Divine Power on all paladins who take oaths\n\twhich I have rated <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span> or lower.

The ability to change styles\n\toccasionally makes that decision less permanent, and allows you to change\n\tstyles if something happens like you find a cool weapon or you need to switch\n\troles within the party.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Martial Versatility on all paladins. Like with other\n\tretraining mechanics, players still can&#8217;t have more options at the same time\n\tthan they could get if they didn&#8217;t retrain, so players will be more satisfied\n\twith their character but won&#8217;t actually be any stronger than they could be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Paladin Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Paladins have three important stats, but also have three dump stats.

However, this mount is little better than a\n\t\tmundane horse, and making the mount intelligent may actually make it *less*\n\t\tuseful in combat because it then acts as an independent creature, making it\n\t\tmove on its own initiative and requiring a bunch of frustrating coordination\n\t\tbetween you and what is essentially an NPC.m\n\t\t<p>If that sounds too frustrating, ask your DM if they&#8217;ll let you control\n\t\t\tyour mount like a non-intelligent creature.

This is especially useful once youf get Improved Divine\n\t\tSmite, or if you have options like Hunter&#8217;s Quarry (see Oath of Vengeance)\n\t\tor Aura of Hate (see Oathbreaker). The ability to make Opportunity Attacks\n\t\twhen enemies move into your reach gives you a good way to use your Reaction\n\t\tconsistently, especially if you use things like Compelled Duel to motivate\n\t\tenemies to attack you.

Still, you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need Second Wind, and you already get all of the proficiencies granted\n\t\tby multiclassing into Fighter. I&#8217;m not sure that Fighting Style is worth a\n\t\tlevel. If you do go this route, consider starting with a level of fighter to\n\t\tget proficiency in Constitution saving throws.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sorcerer<\/span>: If you want more spell slots\n\t\tto fuel your smites, Sorcerer isn&#8217;t a terrible choice. It will advance your\n\t\tspellcasting twice as fast as Paladin levels, and a single level gets you\n\t\tcantrips and access to the 1st-level abilities of a sorcerous origin.\n\t\tDexterity-based paladins may enjoy the Draconic origin for Draconic\n\t\tResilience&#8217;s AC, while other paladins may like Wild Magic for Tides of\n\t\tChaos. If you want offensive spellcasting, Divine Soul unfortunately doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tget you cleric cantrips, but you can still get options like Booming Blade\n\t\tand Sword Burst.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warlock<\/span>: A common, popular, and effective\n\t\toption.

It doesn&#8217;t require attunement, and has a fly speed of 50 feet,\n\t\tthough many medium characters will exceed the 200 pound limit to reduce the\n\t\tspeed to 30 feet, but even then 30 feet fly speed with no duration cap and\n\t\trequiring no action after speaking the command word is absolutely\n\t\tincredible. The only drawback is that you&#8217;re using the item&#8217;s speed rather\n\t\tthan giving yourself a fly speed, so things that improve your speed won&#8217;t\n\t\tmake the broom move faster, and you can&#8217;t Dash with the broom.

However, a +2 weapon\n\t\tis the same rarity and will be considerably more effective. A +2 weapon will\n\t\tyield comparable improvements to damage output, and once you add Improved\n\t\tDivine Smite the extra reliability from the +2 attack bonus will yield more\n\t\ttotal damage output than the 1d8 damage from Devotee&#8217;s Censer. The healing\n\t\teffect may be helpful since paladins don&#8217;t have any group healing options,\n\t\tbut the healing is slow so<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fate Dealer&#8217;s Deck +1<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Amulet of the Devout will be more consistently useful on many builds and is one rarity lower for the same bonus, but this still have some neat things to offer. The bonus to spell attacks and DCs is good, but Amulet of the Devout&#8217;s is +1 better at the same rarity, which makes it hard to justify intentionally selecting this. Still, the ability to spend hit dice to heal or deal damage is interesting even if it&#8217;s not especially powerful. For a back-line healer, it&#8217;s a great way to turn unused hit dice into something helpful. The damage notably doesn&#8217;t allow a save, either, which is neat but not reliably useful since it&#8217;s so little damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Necklace of Prayer Beads<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Unpredictable, but potentially very powerful. You&#8217;ll get an average of\n\t\t4.5 beads, and the effectiveness of the item varies wildly depending on what\n\t\tyou get. You can notably cast every spell from the beads as a Bonus Action\n\t\t(yes, including Planar Ally which normally has a 10-minute casting time),\n\t\tallowing you to quickly heal allies or get Bless running while leaving your\n\t\tAction for attacks or cantrips.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Periapt of Proof Against Poison<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Poison damage is very common across the full level range, so immunity to\n\t\tit is a significant improvement in your durability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Evasion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to mitigate damage from AOE spells and things like breath\n\t\tweapons which can often be problems from front-line martial characters,\n\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re not built around Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ring of Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Cloak of Protection is lower rarity and has the same effect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ring of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A fine item in a vacuum, but a Ring of Spell Storing full of Absorb\n\t\tElements will be much more effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ring of Spell Storing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Fill it with Absorb Elements and Shield and recharge it whenever possible\n\t\tand this is a spectacular defensive asset on almost any character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield, +2<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: +2 AC, no attunement.

It&#8217;s not significantly better than a +2 rapier in the\n\t\tmajority of cases. Radiant damage is great, but most creatures with\n\t\tresistance to weapon damage types are affected normally by magic weapons so\n\t\tthe benefits of radiant damage compared to piercing or slashing damage from\n\t\ta magical we oapon are minor. It works, but I&#8217;m not certain that it&#8217;s worth\n\t\tAttunement compared to a +2 weapon unless you can expect to face fiends and\n\t\tundead with some regularity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sword of Wounding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Persistent damage that stacks with itself. It&#8217;s only 1d4 and only once\n\t\tper turn, but it stacks with itself and &#8220;once per turn&#8221; means that if you\n\t\tcan attack again outside of your own turn (Opportunity Attacks, etc.) you\n\t\tcan get additional dice very quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warrior&#8217;s Passkey<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: +1 sword, does force damage, casts Knock at will.

For a\n\t\tStrength-based character, raising your Strength above 20 is a massive\n\t\tbenefit, and going up as high as 25 is spectacular.

The\n\t\tsecond ability provides a way to counterattack using your Reaction, and with\n\t\tAdvantage on that attack it&#8217;s an easy and reliable boost to your damage\n\t\toutput.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloak of Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Invisibility is extremely powerful in 5e. Note that this is just the\n\t\tinvisible condition, not the spell have Invisibility, so you can still\n\t\tattack or whatever while invisible. Unless you&#8217;re playing a Defender and\n\t\tactively trying to draw attacks away from your allies, this is absolutely\n\t\tamazing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defender<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Given the choice, I would trade this for a +2 weapon and a +2 shield and\n\t\tconsider that a very good trade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Efreeti Chain<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Even at high levels fire damage is a frequent problem, so immunity is\n\t\treally nice, but the AC simply isn&#8217;t good enough.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Holy Avenger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: As good as a +3 weapon and a Mantle of Spell Resistance combined, plus\n\t\tbonus damage against fiends and undead and the resistance against spells\n\t\tworks in an aura which matches your Aura of Protection, so even your allies\n\t\twill be excited for you to get this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ioun Stone (Mastery)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Proficiency Bonuses apply to a lot of things and a +1 bonus goes a long\n\t\tway. But Attunement is precious and you&#8217;ll probably only get one legendary\n\t\titem. You can get +1 to all saves and all ability checks with a Stone of\n\t\tGood Luck rather than just ones where you have proficiency, and they&#8217;re\n\t\tUncommon so they should be easy to find by this level.

That gives us a character who excels at paladin things, but is\n\totherwise very limited. If you&#8217;re willing to give up some Constitution, reduce\n\tyour starting Strength and Constitution each to 14, and distribute those\n\tpoints elsewhere, and at 4th level put the full Ability Score Increase into\n\tStrength. Lay on Hands gives you a generous pool of hit points to fall back\n\ton, so you&#8217;re perfectly fine with 14 Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Increased<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Classic Dragonborn.

I definitely recommend Persuasion, but\n\tyour other choices can be dependent on the makeup of your party.

You&#8217;re locked\n\t\t\t\t\tinto Chain Mail, but with 8 Dexterity that&#8217;s what you want.<br><br>At\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst level you&#8217;re very similar to the Fighter. Divine Sense gives you\n\t\t\t\t\ta taste of real divine power. It won&#8217;t be useful especially often, but\n\t\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s one of the paladin&#8217;s only ways to locate invisible creatures.<br><br>Lay\n\t\t\t\t\ton Hands is an excellent healing resource. It allows you to precisely\n\t\t\t\t\tapply healing without any of the randomness of hit dice or healing\n\t\t\t\t\tspells, so you can easily fill in the last two or three hit points to\n\t\t\t\t\tget someone to full health without the risk of running over and\n\t\t\t\t\twasting limited resources. Try to keep 1 point on hand at all times in\n\t\t\t\t\tcase you need to save a dying ally.<br><br>Despite your high AC\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom Chain Mail, I really recommend sticking to sword-and-board at\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst level rather than going for a 2-handed weapon. Even with Lay on\n\t\t\t\t\tHands, 1st-level characters are frail and a single attack could take\n\t\t\t\t\tyou from full hit points to 0. A shield goes a long way to make sure\n\t\t\t\t\tyou reach 2nd level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Fighting Style (Any except GWF)<br>Spellcasting<br>Divine\n\t\t\t\t\tSmite<\/td><td>2nd level is where things really pick up for the paladin. Fighting\n\t\t\t\t\tStyle helps define your role in the party. I recommend anything except\n\t\t\t\t\tGreat Weapon Fighting. Even if you go for two-handed weapons, GWF\n\t\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t pay off. If you want to use two-handed weapons, take Defense\n\t\t\t\t\tto compensate for your lack of a shield.<br><br>At this level, you\n\t\t\t\t\thave twice as many spells prepared as you have spell slots. I\n\t\t\t\t\trecommend preparing defensive buffs like Compel Duel and Shield of\n\t\t\t\t\tFaith, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to bring some Smite spells. Often using a\n\t\t\t\t\tspell will have a bigger impact on a fight than burning the spell slot\n\t\t\t\t\tfor Divine Smite, but sometimes you just need a little extra damage to\n\t\t\t\t\tkill something in a hurry.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Divine Health<br>Sacred Oath (Oath of Devotion)<br>Channel\n\t\t\t\t\tDivinity<br>&#8211; Sacred Weapon<br>&#8211; Turn the Unholy<\/td><td>Divine Health is a good passive defense.

You already have 16 Charisma, and a +3\n\t\t\t\t\tbonus to attacks is massive in 5e. The 1-minute duration means that it\n\t\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t last longer than a single fight, but if you can activate Sacred\n\t\t\t\t\tWeapon just before jumping into a fight you will start with a huge\n\t\t\t\t\tadvantage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Strength 17 -&gt; 18, Constitution 15\n\t\t\t\t\t-&gt; 16)<\/td><td>Since we have two important ability scores at odd numbers, we can\n\t\t\t\t\tsplit our Ability Score Increase to make them both even and increase\n\t\t\t\t\tboth of their modifiers.
