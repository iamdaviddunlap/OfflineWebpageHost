Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Rogue Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d6 hit points is hard,\n\tespecially because so many Rogues go for melee builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB is hard for\n\tcharacters so dependent on weapon attacks for damage, especially for\n\tTwo-Weapon Fighting builds, but with decent planning (and with Flanking)\n\tRogues get by just fine.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: The Rogue&#8217;s only good save is\n\tReflex, and with Evasion they&#8217;re very good at Reflex saves. Unfortunately, the\n\tRogue doesn&#8217;t have any built-in means to overcome their poor Fortitude and\n\tWill saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple weapons offer lots of\n\toptions, but your go-to choices will be the Dagger, Short Sword, Rapier, and\n\tShortbow for most builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Short of the Factotum, the Rogue has\n\tthe best skills in the game. Unfortunately, 8+ skill ranks isn&#8217;t enough to\n\tcover everything that a Rogue can do, even with substantial Intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span>: The Rogue&#8217;s primary source of\n\tdamage output. It has some problems because you can&#8217;t affect many types of\n\tcreatures, but there are plenty of options to overcome this limitation. Sneak\n\tAttack can be further customized and improved with Ambush Feats<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trapfinding<\/span>: Not useful in absolutely every\n\tcampaign, but absolutely essential in campaigns with traps.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic for surviving\n\tfireballs and other AOE effects which would normally run through your shallow\n\tpool of hit points with ease.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Trap Sense<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but it\n\tallows you to do silly things like Fight Defensively every round while you&#8217;re\n\twalking around for an easy AC boost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Very\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Special Abilities<\/span>: Special Abilities are\n\tinteresting, but they&#8217;re just not flashy and powerful enough to keep most\n\tpeople in single-class Rogue long enough to reach them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crippling Strike<\/span> (Ex): Like an Ambush\n\t\tFeat, this adds a rider effect to your Sneak Attack. It doesn&#8217;t cost Sneak\n\t\tAttack damage dice, so it&#8217;s easy to combine with other rider effects.\n\t\tStrength Damage is a surprisingly good option. While it won&#8217;t outright\n\t\tmurder things, large enemies with lots of Strength will become pitifully\n\t\tineffective, and weak enemies with very poor Strength will be quickly\n\t\tincapacitated.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defensive Roll<\/span> (Ex): You should very\n\t\trarely need this, and those rare times that you do your Cleric should have\n\t\tRevivify by this level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Frostfell Terrain Mastery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">FF<\/a><\/sup> (Ex): You could live in\n\t\tthe Frostfell full time, and this would still be mediocre at best.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Tempting and flashy,\n\t\tbut by this level your Dexterity should be so absurd that you hardly ever\n\t\tfail Reflex Saves. I would honestly rather take Lightning Reflexes to\n\t\timprove the reliability of Evasion and to protect against non-damaging\n\t\tReflex save effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Opportunist<\/span> (Ex): If you have a flanking\n\t\tpartner (and you should if you&#8217;re in melee), this is a fantastic option to\n\t\tboost your damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skill Mastery<\/span>: There are very few skills\n\t\twhere this is particularly useful. Tumble seems tempting, but at this level\n\t\tyour Tumble bonus can easily outpace even the most difficult DC. UMD is\n\t\tprobably your best bet, but by this level you should be very reliable with\n\t\tUMD if you plan to use it at all.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Slippery Mind<\/span> (Ex): Only affects one school\n\t\tof magic. Enchantment is one of the scariest schools, but it&#8217;s too\n\t\tsituational to justify spending a Special Ability to deal with it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feat<\/span>: Feats are <em>always<\/em> a good\n\t\tidea.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Antiquarian<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Appraise is garbage.

Poison can be a lot of run if you\n\t\treally emphasize it, but giving up Trapfinding hurts when you can take\n\t\tPoison Expert as a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Friend\u2019s Evasion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: High level, costly, and it only applies when your allies are standing\n\t\tadjacent to you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Holy Stalker<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Only worthwhile in extremely undead-heavy campaigns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mimic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">EoE<\/a><\/sup>: Buy a hat of Disguise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Fingers<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DS<\/a><\/sup>: I have never seen a trap disabled in combat.

The Rogue&#8217;s damage dervices mostly from Sneak\n\tAttack, so a -1 or -2 from Strength won&#8217;t matter much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Every Rogue&#8217;s primary ability. It adds\n\tto almost everything the Rogue does.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential for melee builds, but less\n\tso for ranged builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Essential for filling out the Rogue&#8217;s\n\tenormous skill list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Take a bit to boost your poor Will\n\tsaves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Take a bit if you plan to be a Face,\n\tbut if someone else can do the talking you can dump it.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity is crucial. Darkvision is nice to have, but not essential. Medium\n\tsize is nice if you plan to be Reduced, but hardly essential.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarf<\/span>: Darkvision is really the only thing\n\twhich the Dwarf offers the Rogue. As nice as Darkvision can be, there are\n\tplenty of ways to get it on another race.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: Decent, especially with the Dexterity\n\tbonus, but not as helpful as Halfling or Human.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Can&#8217;t compete with Halflings.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Awful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Darkvision is really the only\n\tthing which the Dwarf offers the Rogue.

It has no prerequisites, so pick it up as soon as you can\n\t\tspare the feat and special senses start to be a problem.

Especially useful for snipers who are having trouble finding\n\t\tcover.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloak of Displacement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A great defensive option, but remember that it can&#8217;t be used to hide in\n\t\tplain sight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Vest of Resistance is identical and takes up a much less useful slot, but\n\t\tsince Rogue&#8217;s Vest is so appealing, a cloak might be the way to go.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Circlet of Persuasion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CMG<\/a><\/sup>: A +3 bonus to Charisma-based check across the board gives you all of the\n\t\timportant functions of a +6 Cloak of Charisma at sligtly more than a price\n\t\tof a +2 cloak. This is an easy way to make up for low Charisma if you need\n\t\tto be a Face or if you plan to use Use Magic Device.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gloves of Dexterity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Dexterity is the Rogue&#8217;s bread and butter. Get these early, and enhance\n\t\tthem often.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gloves of The Balanced Hand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: If your DM allows you to move your Dexterity-boosting item to another\n\t\tslot (MIC suggests arms or feet are acceptable slots), this is a great way\n\t\tto cut down on the feat tax of the TWF tree.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Horned Helm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: At only 4000 gp, the Horned Helm grants you a free natural weapon. Every\n\t\textra attack means a potential pile of Sneak Attack damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue&#8217;s Vest<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: The big draw is the bonus Sneak Attack damage, but the skill bonuses are\n\t\tnice, too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot.\n\t\tUnfortunately for Rogues, it has to compete with the Rogue&#8217;s Vest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Darkvision<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Darkvision is essential when so much of your skillset requires sneaking\n\t\taround in the dark. Of course, an Eternal Wand of Darkvision costs 4420gp\n\t\t(compare to 5000gp to pay an NPC to spend 1000 experience to cast Permanency\n\t\tand Darkvision), can&#8217;t be permanently removed by Dispel Magic, lasts a total\n\t\tof 6 hours per day, and you can use it with a UMD check.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reduce Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re medium you can reduce yourself for an easy +2 to Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">See invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With no built-in way to handle invisible creatures, the ability to always\n\t\tsee them is a fantastic benefit. You can&#8217;t Sneak Attack targets with\n\t\tconcealment, so See Invisibility is a much better option than effects like\n\t\tGlitterdust which only allow you to locate invisible creatures, but don&#8217;t\n\t\tremove their concealment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Assassin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>\/<span class=\"rating-green\">Avenger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Web<\/a><\/sup>: Assassins are best known for their Death Attack ability, and while it&#8217;s\n\t\tcertainly a great ability, it&#8217;s not <em>nearly<\/em> as interesting as the\n\t\tAssassin&#8217;s spell list. Despite very few spell slots, the Assassin gets a lot\n\t\tof very unique and powerful spells which offer a lot to the Rogue.\n\t\tUnfortunately, they give up a lot of the Rogue&#8217;s skills and skill points per\n\t\tlevel, but you can make up for the lost skills with some clever spell\n\t\tuse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fighter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Fighter is a great option for getting weapon and armor proficiencies and\n\t\tsome bonus feats. Many Fighter alternate class features work very well\n\t\tRogues, and the Thug variant out of Unearthed Arcana makes it a bit easier\n\t\tto maintain your Rogue skills, especially if you&#8217;re a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Ranger\/Rogue builds are a lot of fun because you get tons of skills, and\n\t\tthere&#8217;s a lot of room for optimization.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Swashbuckler<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you just want a free feat, a single level of Swashbuckler is better\n\t\tthan a level of Fighter because you get 2 more skill points on a skill list\n\t\twhich more closely resembles that of the Rogue. Daring Outlaw is a cool\n\t\toption, but it&#8217;s considerably better for the Swashbuckler than it is for the\n\t\tRogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Swordsage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: One level gets you a few maneuvers and a stance. RAW you select maneuvers\n\t\tand stances based on your total initiator level (initiator class levels plus\n\t\t1\/2 non-initiator class levels), so delay this class dip until you have 8\n\t\tother levels under your belt so that you qualify for Assassin&#8217;s Stance.\n\t\tIsland of Blades is another great stance option, and the Cloak of Deception\n\t\tmaneuver is a fantastic way to get Sneak Attack, or to get into position\n\t\tunnoticed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 3.5
