In fact, they&#8217;re one of my favorite ways to customize the Monk, both for flavor reasons and for mechanical reasons. Technically the feats are available to anyone willing to invest in Improved Unarmed Strike, but they are by far more appealing to the Monk than to other classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the Master of Many Styles. They give up the Monk&#8217;s signature attack\n\toption (Flurry of Blows), but in exchange they get the ability to mix and\n\tmatch style feats in a way that literally no one else can do. This gives you a\n\tton of flexibility, but it also means that you need to look for ways to close\n\tthe gap in damage output between the Master of Many Styles and the vanilla\n\tMonk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Monk Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points is hard for a\n\tstrictly melee class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s primary\n\toffensive option, Flurry of Blows, pretends that the Monk has full BAB, which\n\tis usually enough in combat but can be frustrating when qualifying for\n\tfeats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saves<\/span>: All good saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Monk is proficient with\n\tMonk weapons (which make up a collection of strange, exotic, and often foreign\n\tweapons) and a couple of other odds and ends like hand axes, crossbows, and\n\tspears. Strangely, the Monk weapons tend to be the best options since they can\n\tbenefit from Flurry of blows. Monks gain no armor or shield proficiencies, and\n\tgenerally rely on their Monk AC bonus instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: The Monk skill list has several\n\texcellent options, several of which are difficult for the monk to capitalize\n\ton. By splashing a few skills and focusing on the best ones, the Monk can make\n\texcellent use of their 4+ skill points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">AC Bonus<\/span> (Ex): The Monk AC bonus helps to\n\toffset the monk&#8217;s lack of armor. The scaling is fairly negligible, but it\n\tstill feels good to have. However, your AC will still be awful without\n\tadditional items and AC improvements.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmed Strike<\/span>: This is why you generally\n\tplay a monk: because you want to hit things with your bare hands\/feet\/etc. The\n\tdamage dice starts off fairly small, but when you hit d8 at level 4, it begins\n\tto outpace whatever weapons you might be two-weapon fighting with. At level\n\t12, your fists are greatswords. You can also deal nonlethal damage without\n\tpenalty, which is situationally useful. It&#8217;s important to note that your\n\tunarmed strike damage is heavily size-based, so you want to do everything you\n\tcan to increase your effective size. Get enlarged and throw Impact on an\n\tAmulet of Mighty Fists. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the damage\n\tprogression stops at 20th-level, so items like a Monks Belt stop being useful\n\tat high levels unless you multiclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"size_table\" class=\"wp-block-table zebra-striped is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Small<\/th><th>Medium<\/th><th>Large<\/th><th>Huge<\/th><th>Gargantuan<\/th><th>Colossal<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1st-3rd<\/td><td>1d4<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4th-7th<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8th-11th<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>1d10<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12th-15th<\/td><td>1d10<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16th-19th<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20th<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>2d10<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><td>12d8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Brawler\/Monk Unarmed Strike Damage by Size and Level<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This table is taken from the 3.5 rules. They should be the same in Pathfinder, but Pathfinder doesn&#8217;t provide official rules for monks smaller than small or larger than large. Check with your GM before using this table.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"archetype-features\">Master of Many Styles Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Monks have a small set of\n\tavailable bonus feats, and while there are some gems most are uninteresting.\n\tInstead, you can take style feats or Elemental Fist (You don&#8217;t want Elemental\n\tFist because it&#8217;s awful). But beyond this already fantastic improvement, you\n\tget two other benefits:<\/p>\n<p>First, you do not need to meet prerequisites for these bonus feats. Want to\n\tskip the middle feat in a style feat chain? You can do that, and I encourage\n\tyou to do so for styles like Snake Style or Tiger Style where the middle feat\n\tis terrible but the final feat might be useful.<\/p>\n<p>Second, you can choose a &#8220;wildcard style slot&#8221; instead of a permanent feat.\n\tIf you like to change your active styles frequently, this is a spectacular\n\toption. If you pick up the Combat Style Master feat (and you should), you can\n\tcombine the two mechanics to easily set up one set of styles for use during\n\tyour turn and a second set of styles for everyone else&#8217;s turn, allowing you to\n\texplicitly switch from a set of offensive styles to a set of defensive styles\n\tat will.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this does mean that you can&#8217;t select from the Monk&#8217;s normal\n\tlist of bonus feats, so you can&#8217;t get options like Improved Trip without\n\tprerequisites.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fuse Style<\/span>: Combining two styles allows for\n\tsome truly incredible combinations, and this capability alone makes the Master\n\tof Many Styles an exceptionally tempting option for a 1-level dip into Monk.\n\tIf you stick to Monk, you can add gradually more and more styles, and\n\tthankfully the progression is spaced out in such a way that you have time to\n\tpick up more styles between steps so that you can both feel the gradual\n\tincrease in power and be ready to go when you get to add another simultaneous\n\tstyle to the mix. Don&#8217;t forget the attack bonus you get at 8th level; it will\n\tbe an important boost to your attack rolls which you&#8217;ll need to close the gap\n\tin damage output between the Master of Many Styles and other monks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfect Style<\/span>: 5 styles is dizzyingly\n\tpowerful, but also problematically complex. It&#8217;s difficult to track exactly\n\thow all of your styles will interact, and sorting out which combinations are\n\tworthwhile can easily become a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compatible-archetypes\">Compatible Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Drunken Master<\/span>: A way to get extra Ki is\n\t\tgreat for any monk, but the Drunken Master doesn&#8217;t offer a means to improve\n\t\tyour damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hungry Ghost Monk<\/span>: Punishing Kick is fun,\n\t\tand Steal Ki is spectacular, but like the Drunken Master, the Hungry Ghost\n\t\tMonk doesn&#8217;t offer improvements to your damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kata Master<\/span>: Too MAD.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ki Mystic<\/span>: The Ki Mystic doesn&#8217;t hinder\n\t\tanything that the Master of Many Styles cares about, but it also doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thelp.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk of the Lotus<\/span>: Too pacifist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monk of the Sacred Mountain<\/span>: Without\n\t\tFlurry of Blows to tie your in place, Monk of the Sacred Mountain becomes\n\t\teven less appealing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Qinggong<\/span>: Trade in some of the Monk\n\t\tabilities you don&#8217;t care about for something awesome.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wildcat<\/span>: <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks are primarily a striker, and their damage comes from their Strength, so Strength needs to be their biggest ability. Unfortunately, Monks are one of the most MAD classes, and you also need to invest in Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: As a melee character, strength is the\n\tmonk&#8217;s most important ability. It contributes to your melee attacks and\n\tdamage, shuriken damage, and combat maneuvers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Crucial for the monk&#8217;s relatively low\n\tAC, and contributes to several monk skills. Reflex saves are also a good point\n\tto focus on since you get Evasion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Monks are combat characters with d8\n\thit points, so Constitution is crucial. Fortitude saves are also important for\n\tcombat characters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Dump to 8. Intelligence doesn&#8217;t help\n\tMonks much, but the extra ability points are rarely worth the loss of a second\n\tskill point.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: A lot of the Monk&#8217;s iconic abilities\n\tdepend on Wisdom. However, these abilities are still secondary to the Monk&#8217;s\n\tprimary function of hitting things and dealing damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump to 7. Completely useless on a\n\tMonk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Arrray<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 17<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 17<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 13<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 15<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We want races that can get us bonuses to Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom. Extra vision abilities are always nice. Because the Monk&#8217;s damage output depends so heavily on their damage die size, being small is a serious problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: While they don&#8217;t get a bonus to\n\t\tStrength, a +2 to both Constitution and Wisdom goes a long way. Their\n\t\tpenalty is to the Monk&#8217;s dump stat, and their low speed is offset by the\n\t\tmonk speed bonus. Darkvision is great, and they get a +2 to saves against\n\t\tspells on top of the Monk&#8217;s already impressive saves. Unfortunately, the\n\t\tfavored class bonus is worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: -2 to con is brutal, and their only\n\t\thelpful bonus is a +2 to dexterity. Many of the Elf&#8217;s bonuses relate to\n\t\tspellcasting, which monks can&#8217;t do, and the alternate racial traits are not\n\t\tspecifically helpful to the Monk. The favored class bonus provides a wholly\n\t\tunnecessary bonus to the Monk&#8217;s speed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Small monks? A -2 to strength is\n\t\tcrippling, especially since your damage dice will be smaller, and Enlarge\n\t\tPerson won&#8217;t give you reach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Elf<\/span>: +2 to strength and low-light\n\t\tvision, but that&#8217;s really all we get here. The Half-Elf&#8217;s alternate racial\n\t\ttraits don&#8217;t offer anything helpful, and the Half-Elf&#8217;s alternate racial\n\t\ttraits don&#8217;t help much. The Half-Elf can take the Human favored class bonus\n\t\tfor additional Ki, but that doesn&#8217;t help much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: +2 to strength, and Ferocity\n\t\tcan be helpful if you want to use Intimidate. Darkvision is fantastic, too.\n\t\tThe Half-Orc favored class bonus is garbage, so take the Human favored class\n\t\tbonus for extra Ki.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: Small monks are typically\n\t\tterrible, but Halflings might be viable thanks to their racial feats.\n\t\tEmphasizing Fight Defensively (see my Practical Guide to Fighting\n\t\tDefensively) and taking Risky Striker can provide a significant damage\n\t\tboost, though the total number of feats you&#8217;ll need to succeed may be\n\t\tprohibitive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: +2 strength and a feat is pretty\n\t\tnice, but most decent Monk feats aren&#8217;t available at first level. The skill\n\t\tpoints don&#8217;t hurt, but they&#8217;re not doing us any big favors. The Human\n\t\tfavored class bonus provides a bonus to the Monk&#8217;s Ki pool, which is\n\t\tespecially helpful if you don&#8217;t take an archetype which allows you to\n\t\trecharge your Ki.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anatomist<\/span> (combat): Critical hits are not\n\t\tfor monks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (combat): You may spend a\n\t\tgreat deal of time going one-on-one against enemies, and with your multiple\n\t\tattacks this +1 bonus will add up to a lot of points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodthirsty<\/span> (combat): This is just a bad\n\t\ttrait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bullied<\/span> (combat): If you are building\n\t\tyour Monk as an area control defender, this may be useful. You&#8217;ll likely\n\t\tstill depend more on reach weapons, but you can threaten the area inside\n\t\tyour weapon&#8217;s reach with unarmed strikes, allowing this to provide a nice\n\t\tattack bonus from time to time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Courageous<\/span> (combat): Fear saving throws are\n\t\tgenerally pretty gentle.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dedicated Defender<\/span> (combat): Small and\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (combat): Your saves are\n\t\tfantastic, but more never hurts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dirty Fighter<\/span> (combat): If you spend a\n\t\tlot of time flanking, this helps a lot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Indelible Ire<\/span> (combat): This is bad.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Killer<\/span> (combat): Critical hits are not for\n\t\tmonks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Martial Performer<\/span> (combat): This only matters for the\n\t\tSensei archetype.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nature&#8217;s Mimic<\/span> (combat): Monks don&#8217;t make\n\t\tgood librarians.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reactionary<\/span> (combat): Initiative bonuses\n\t\tare always good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reckless<\/span> (combat): You already get\n\t\tAcrobatics.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient<\/span> (combat): Your saves are\n\t\tfantastic, but more never hurts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Surprise Weapon<\/span> (combat): Only useful\n\t\tfor the Drunken Master archetype.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tactician<\/span> (combat): Reactionary is\n\t\tprobably going to get you better results.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vigilant Battler<\/span> (combat): How many things\n\t\tfeint?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Birthmark<\/span> (Faith): Charm and compulsion\n\t\teffects are powerful, but you would be better served with a general bonus to\n\t\tWill saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blessed<\/span> (Faith): This is bad and hard to\n\t\tuse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Caretaker<\/span> (Faith): Heal is a decent\n\t\toption for Monks.

You may not have the feats to devote to Dodge and Mobility, so\n\t\tAcrobatics can help you move through combat easily.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Climb<\/span> (Str): While not particularly\n\t\tuseful, putting one rank into Climb could save your life. Combined with the\n\t\tclass bonus and your high strength, you can rely on a +8 bonus for much of\n\t\tyour career.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Escape Artist<\/span> (Dex): I&#8217;m not trapped in\n\t\there with you. You&#8217;re trapped in here with me. Escape Artist is highly\n\t\tsituational, and most of those situations involve getting away from a monk.\n\t\tAdd one rank if you can spare on, but certainly don&#8217;t focus on Escape Artist\n\t\ttoo much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Intimidate is you&#8217;re only\n\t\tinteresting charisma-based skill, and Charisma is your dump stat. Unless you\n\t\thave very specific ideas how to use it, such as the Enforcer feat,\n\t\tIntimidate is a waste.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (history)<\/span> (Int): One of the less\n\t\timportant knowledge skills, and your intelligence is garbage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge (religion)<\/span> (Int): One of the\n\t\tbest knowledge skills.

The ability\n\t\tto start every combat in a style means that you can put up a defensive style\n\t\tlike Crane Style at the beginning of combat to keep yourself protected while\n\t\tyou wait for your first turn, then you can use Combat Style Master to switch\n\t\tyour entire mix of styles at will throughout your turn. The most likely\n\t\tscenario is to switch to a set of offensive styles on your turn, then switch\n\t\tto a set of defensive styles at the end of your turn to protect yourself\n\t\tbetween turns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power Attack<\/span>: Without Flurry of Blows you\n\t\treally need all the damage you can get. Using a weapon two-handed with Power\n\t\tAttack may be your best bet.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vital Strike<\/span>: Giving up Flurry of Blows\n\t\tmeans that doing something other than a Full Attack suddenly becomes an\n\t\tinteresting option. Monks aren&#8217;t great at Vital Strike because their damage\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t scale fast enough to compete with a real weapon and because they\n\t\tonly get 2\/3 BAB, but it&#8217;s technically an option. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/vital_strike\">Practical Guide to Vital Strike<\/a>\n\t\tfor more.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Because Master of Many\n\t\tStyles doesn&#8217;t get Flurry of Blows, Two-Weapon Fighting may be a way to\n\t\tmatch the conventional Monk&#8217;s number of attacks. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s\n\t\tfeat-intensive, requires you to buy multiple expensive weapons, and still\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t work as well as Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"style-feats\">Style Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unlike conventional monks, the Master of Many Styles is free to collect style feats and mix-and-match them. I&#8217;ve used a different format here than in my general Monk Handbook in order to further elaborate on the benefits of the styles as a whole rather than discussing the individual feats in a vaccuum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"boar\" class=\"rating-red\">Boar Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Boar Style emphasizes Intimidate (which monks are bad at) and hitting enemies multiple times (which the Master of Many Styles is bad at).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Boar Style<\/span>: Without Flurry of Blows your\n\t\tchances to hit a single enemy multiple times in a round is greatly\n\t\tdiminished. The fact that you can only do this once per turn just makes it\n\t\tworse because there&#8217;s so little incentive to work to trigger the effect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Boar Ferocity<\/span>: Monks are not good at\n\t\tIntimidate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Boar Shred<\/span>: This feat is amusing for\n\t\texactly one purpose: You can take it at 1st-level, giving you the ability to\n\t\tdemoralize foes as a move action. That&#8217;s not helpful for the Monk, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tfantastic for a class dip on a build which relies heavily on Intimidate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"crane\" class=\"rating-blue\">Crane Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crane style is very defensive, works well right away, and all three of the feats are worthwhile. You need to use Fight Defensively to benefit from the style, but because the style usually doesn&#8217;t matter during your own turn it&#8217;s a fantastic candidate for a defensive style which you can activate at the end of your turn using Combat Style Master.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Fight Defensively is central to the style, check out my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/fighting_defensively\">Practical Guide to Fighting Defensively<\/a> for more help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crane Style<\/span>: Reducing the penalty for\n\t\tFight Defensively by half is potentially worth a feat on its own, especially\n\t\tif you have 3 ranks in Acrobatics to boost the AC bonus. The additional +1\n\t\tto AC makes this a clearly excellent choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crane Wing<\/span>: An extra +4 AC is pretty\n\t\tgreat, even though it only applies to melee attacks. You&#8217;ll need to track\n\t\thow close enemies get to hitting you because you lose the AC bonus on a\n\t\tnear-miss. You technically don&#8217;t need this to get the biggest benefits of\n\t\tCrane Style, but it will make Crane Riposte much more reliable due to your\n\t\tincreased AC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crane Riposte<\/span>: Crane Riposte isn&#8217;t\n\t\tnearly as effective as I would like it to be. You only get the extra attack\n\t\tif you lose your Crane Wing AC bonus or if you use Full Defense and use your\n\t\tone free deflection per turn. Consider picking this up with a wildcard slot\n\t\tif you don&#8217;t need anything else at the moment, but it&#8217;s probably not worth a\n\t\tpermanent feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"djinni\" class=\"rating-orange\">Djinni Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Djinni style&#8217;s biggest draw by far is Djinni spin, which is a lot like Whirlwind Attack except that it&#8217;s only a standard action, it automatically deals damage, and it can deafen people. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not always useful, you need to take Elemental Fist for the style to function, and you&#8217;re limited by the daily uses of Elemental Fist. This is a good style to pick up with wildcard slots, but don&#8217;t spend real feats on anything past the base style feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Djinni Style<\/span>: Elemental fist isn&#8217;t\n\t\tspectacular, and the bonus damage won&#8217;t help much. The bonus to AC against\n\t\tattacks of opportunity is situational at best, but complements Mobility\n\t\tnicely if you plan to run into a group of enemies and trigger Djinni Spin.\n\t\tThe Wisdom bonus to damage also applies to Djinni Spin, which is nice. Note\n\t\tthat Djinni style also specifies that you <em>must<\/em> deal electricity\n\t\tdamage with Elemental Fist while in Djinni style, which is not a restriction\n\t\tthat other genie styles share. Talk to your GM; maybe they&#8217;ll be kind enough\n\t\tto ignore this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Djinni Spirit<\/span>: The deafening effect is\n\t\tnice, but being deafened generally isn&#8217;t very problematic. The resistance to\n\t\telectricity is also nice, but can be replaced by a cheap spell. Skip this\n\t\tfeat and pick it up with a wildcard slot if you&#8217;re facing an enemy that\n\t\tdeals lightning damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Djinni Spin<\/span>: Far better than Whirlwind\n\t\tAttack, Djinni Spin deals automatic damage. Combined with Djinni Spirit,\n\t\tDjinni Spin also deafens targets, but that almost never matters. Pick this\n\t\tup with a wildcard slot when there is a group of enemies that you could hit\n\t\twith the effect, but don&#8217;t keep it hanging around when you&#8217;re not actively\n\t\tusing it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"dragon\" class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Dragon Style is a weird style for several reasons. The style itself offers a minor boost to your damage that&#8217;s barely worth noting and a handful of bonuses to saves. If you&#8217;re using Vital Strike you might consider Dragon Style and Dragon Ferocity for the extra Strength damage, but unless your Strength is extremely high they&#8217;re not worth the feats. The real draw is Dragon Roar, which applies some damage in a cone and makes the targets Shaken. If you have Elemental Fist you can boost the damage, and Djinni Style&#8217;s boost to Elemental Fist damage should apply. That&#8217;s tempting, but Efreeti Style can also produce a cone that does the same damage and uses less of your limited daily resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s not terribly important due to the Master of Many Style&#8217;s ability to ignore style feat prerequisites, it&#8217;s interesting to note that Dragon Style is a fork rather than a linear series of feats like other styles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Style<\/span>: A grab bag of bonuses and\n\t\tbuffs, Dragon Style is decent, but not spectacular. The bonus damage to your\n\t\tunarmed strikes sounds great, but even with 30 Strength it&#8217;s at most 5 more\n\t\tdamage per turn.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dragon Ferocity<\/span>: Doubling the damage bonus\n\t\tfrom Strength may be useful if you&#8217;re using Vital Strike or something, but I\n\t\tstill don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the feats. The critical hit mechanic is nice,\n\t\tbut without Flurry of Blows it&#8217;s hard to capitalize on.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Roar<\/span>: The cone&#8217;s small duration\n\t\tmeans that you can affect at most 6 targets, but automatic damage is still\n\t\tpretty good. Adding the Shaken condition is also nice, as Shaken can really\n\t\tmake an enemy vulnerable. Don&#8217;t plan to spam this, but it&#8217;s a cool option on\n\t\tturns when you need to move into combat. Also note that the extra damage\n\t\tfrom Dragon Style and Dragon Ferocity don&#8217;t apply because this isn&#8217;t an\n\t\tattack. If you have Elemental Fist you can add some additional damage, which\n\t\tyou can further improve if you&#8217;re also in Djinni style.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"earth-child\" class=\"rating-red\">Earth Child Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re in a campaign in which giants are a constant antagonist, skip\n\tthis style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Child Style<\/span>: Unless you fight a huge\n\t\tnumber of giants, this is useless. If you do fight large numbers of giants,\n\t\tthis is a significant benefit both offensively and defensively.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Child Topple<\/span>: Unless you fight a huge\n\t\tnumber of giants, this is useless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Child Binder<\/span>: Situational, even if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re fighting giants exclusively.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"efreeti\" class=\"rating-green\">Efreeti Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to Djinni style in many ways, but Efreeti style adds the ability to apply ongoing fire damage. For the Master of Many Styles, any amount of extra damage is a huge temptation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Efreeti Style<\/span>: Similar to Djinni style,\n\t\tthis adds a small amount of damage to your Elemental Fist, which is a fairly\n\t\tlimited resource due to the limited uses per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Efreeti Stance<\/span>: The resistance is nice,\n\t\tand setting things on fire is awesome. Short of an appropriate source of\n\t\twater, the only way to overcome the &#8220;on fire&#8221; condition is to waste a round\n\t\tin hopes that you will pass the reflex save. Then when they finally do, you\n\t\tcan just set them on fire again.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Efreeti Touch<\/span>: The cone is small, but\n\t\tsetting a bunch of enemies on fire is undeniably effective. The ongoing\n\t\tdamage is fairly small, but it is costly to overcome, and racks up faster\n\t\tthan you might expect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"grabbing\" class=\"rating-blue\">Grabbing Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Grabbing style is the go-to option for monks who want to grapple. It functions on its own for the most part, but consider adding Snapping<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grabbing Style<\/span>: Essential for any\n\t\tgrappler. This makes it much easier to grapple two targets at the same\n\t\ttime.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grabbing Drag<\/span>: With Swift Grapple, you can\n\t\tmake three grapple checks in a turn and damage or move two opponents.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Grabbing Master<\/span>: The biggest appeal of\n\t\tGrabbing Style is that you can affect two targets at once without penalty.\n\t\tThis provides a tiny bit of extra mobility, but it doesn&#8217;t function under\n\t\tGrabbing Style&#8217;s primary use case. Save this for a wildcard slot if you ever\n\t\tneed it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"rating-orange\" class=\"rating-orange\">Jabbing Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally a spectacular option for the Monk, giving up Flurry of Blows makes Jabbing Style considerably less effective. Unless you&#8217;re built for two-weapon fighting or something, skip Jabbing style. If you are built for two-weapon fighting for some reason, I would pick up Jabbing Master using one of your bonus feats slots and skip Jabbing Dancer, then pick up Jabbing Dancer with a wildcard slot in those rare cases where it matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jabbing Style<\/span>: Master of Many Styles\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get enough attacks to make this appealing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jabbing Dancer<\/span>: Fantastic for moving\n\t\tinto flanking or getting out of a bad position in combat, but without Flurry\n\t\tof Blows you don&#8217;t get enough attacks to make this meaningful. Pick it up\n\t\twith a wildcard slot if you think you&#8217;ll need it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jabbing Master<\/span>: The damage here is nuts.\n\t\tYour second successful attack adds +2d6 damage, and every further successful\n\t\tattack adds +4d6 damage. But without Two-Weapon Fighting or Flurry of blows\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t have enough attacks to make this meaningful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"janni\" class=\"rating-red\">Janni Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the other genie styles, Janni Style doesn&#8217;t touch energy damage. Instead, it focuses primarily on charging, but also touches Bull Rush and Trip for some reason. The uses are all situational so I don&#8217;t recommend investing permanent feat slots in anything past the base Janni Style feat, but unfortunately that means that you&#8217;ll need to invest skill ranks into Perform (Dance).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the best use cases for the style, there are other feats which work better. Janni Style is worse than Dodge. Janni Tempest is a nice bonus, but the setup is too problematic, and other styles give you free attempts which are more appealing than a bonus which requires you to invest your limited number of attacks in attempting to Bull Rush or Trip. Janni Rush offers the chance to double your base damage on a charge, but Vital Strike does the same thing and doesn&#8217;t require charging or jumping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Janni Style<\/span>: Dodge is strictly better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Janni Tempest<\/span>: Based on the wording,\n\t\tit&#8217;s not clear if this bonus applies to free Bull Rush or Trip attempts that\n\t\tyou could get from other styles like Pummeling Bully or Tiger Claws. As a GM\n\t\tI would rule that the bonus applies, if only to make these feat the tiniest\n\t\tbit useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Janni Rush<\/span>: This only doubles the base\n\t\tdamage dice, and only on a charge if you jump as part of the charge (so you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t do it while burrowing, climbing, flying, or swimming). Honestly, with\n\t\tMonk speed I think you&#8217;re better off taking Vital Strike and using a move\n\t\taction beforehand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"kirin\" class=\"rating-red\">Kirin Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Kiring style requires high Intelligence and ranks in Knowledge skills to be useful, and monks are bad at both of those things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kirin Style<\/span>: A bonus to saving throws\n\t\tagainst attacks. Not special attacks. Not spells. Not special abilities.\n\t\tAttacks. There&#8217;s some room to argue that &#8220;Attack&#8221; in this case constitutes\n\t\tany hostile action (similar to how the spell Invisibility breaks when you\n\t\t&#8220;attack&#8221;), but it&#8217;s not clear, so check with your GM. Oh, and a bonus\n\t\tagainst attacks of opportunity for some reason. On top of how weird the\n\t\tbonuses are, monks are typically terrible at Knowledge skills, so I don&#8217;t\n\t\tknow how you would reliably benefit from the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kirin Strike<\/span>: Oh good, now you&#8217;re dependent\n\t\ton Intelligence for damage on top of the other 4 abilities you need just to\n\t\tremain upright. Making this a swift action is just cruel considering how\n\t\tmuch you need to invest to do more than the minimum damage with it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kirin Path<\/span>: Taking 10 on knowledge checks\n\t\tto identify creatures is nice, and you can do it &#8220;even when using Kirin\n\t\tStyle&#8221;, which is great because that&#8217;s the only time that you would want to\n\t\tdo it. You can dance around your enemies a bit when they move up to you, but\n\t\tto get any real use out of this you need a particularly high\n\t\tintelligence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"mantis\" class=\"rating-orange\">Mantis Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Mantis Style peaks with its first feat. If you want to improve Stunning Fist you should consider Mantis Style, and you can pick up Mantis Wisdom with a wildcard slot, but Mantis Torment is garbage and you should ignore it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantis Style<\/span>: Stunning fist is very\n\t\teffective, but its biggest problem is the DC. This helps quite a bit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mantis Wisdom<\/span>: The first half of the\n\t\tbenefits of this feat is very odd. It encourages multiclassing as a Monk,\n\t\tand allows you to remove Stunning Fist effects. I&#8217;m not sure why you would\n\t\tdo either of those things. The only real draw is the +2 to stunning fist\n\t\tattacks, which is nice because missing wastes the attempt. Pick this up with\n\t\ta wildcard slot on turns where you plan to use Stunning Fist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mantis Torment<\/span>: So instead of becoming\n\t\tStunned, which robs them of their entire turn, forces them to drop their\n\t\tweapons, and makes them flat-footed with an extra -2 to AC, the enemy is\n\t\tdazzled (-1 to attacks), staggered (one action), and then Fatigued a turn\n\t\tlater. This actually makes Stunning Fist worse. You could arguably hit them\n\t\tagain to make them Exhausted, but at that point you&#8217;ve spent four Stunning\n\t\tFist attempts to apply a status condition that&#8217;s less harmful than\n\t\tStunned.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"mardi\" class=\"rating-orange\">Marid Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically the same as the other elemental genie styles. Marid style deals and resists cold damage, gives you the ability to entangle enemies, and lets you deal damage in a line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Marid Style<\/span>: Similar to Djinni style,\n\t\tthis adds a small amount of damage to your Elemental Fist, which is a fairly\n\t\tlimited resource due to the limited uses per day. You get the option to\n\t\tincrease your reach when using Elemental Fist to deal cold damage, but\n\t\tElemental Fist applies to a single attack at a time, so you&#8217;ll likely only\n\t\tuse that option on turns when you move or if you&#8217;re using Vital Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Marid Spirit<\/span>: The ice resistance is nice,\n\t\tbut the Entangle effect is the real draw. Entangled lowers AC and CMD, and\n\t\tkeeps people in place for additional punching.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Marid Coldsnap<\/span>: Lines are one of the\n\t\tleast useful AOEs, but the Entangled effect and automatic damage is nice. I\n\t\twould reserve this for one of your wildcard slots when enemies happen to\n\t\tform a convenient line.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"monkey\" class=\"rating-red\">Monkey Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The only good feat in Monkey Style is Monkey Shine, and it&#8217;s not good enough to justify the style feat to make it a wildcard option. The best use case I can think of is a Brawler taking a level dip into Master of Many Styles to pick up Monkey Shine without needing to waste a feat on Monkey Moves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monkey Style<\/span>: If you spend a lot of time\n\t\tprone, you are a very bad monk.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monkey Moves<\/span>: This allows you to move in a\n\t\tlot of ways that you generally won&#8217;t want to move, and makes you slightly\n\t\tbetter at climbing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monkey Shine<\/span>: Without the normal number\n\t\tof attacks from Flurry of Blows, the Master of Many Styles can&#8217;t easily\n\t\tcapitalize on this before enemies move away.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"panther\" class=\"rating-blue\">Panther Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Panther Style is one of my absolute favorites because it runs counter to so much of how combat works in Pathfinder. Highly mobile builds are generally rare exceptions, and drawing attacks of opportunity is generally something you work really hard to avoid. Instead, the Panther Style encourages you to run around drawing attacks of opportunity and punching anything foolish enough to take them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many other styles, Panther Style really requires you to invest in it for it to work to its full potential. Fortunately, the feats&#8217; prerequisites are all easy to meet, and you could easily pick up all three feats by third level. I strongly recommend picking up Dodge and Mobility to keep your AC high while you&#8217;re intentionally provoking attacks of opportunity. Djinni Style grants an AC bonus similar to Mobility (and it stacks since they&#8217;re both Dodge bonuses), but unless you actively plan to use Djinni Style you&#8217;ll probably get more use out of Crane Style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are required to use unarmed strikes with Panther Style, which may be a problem if you planned to use a weapon two-handed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this style to work, your GM needs to be willing to accommodate you and to avoid metagaming. Obviously your GM will know that making an attack of opportunity against you is a bad idea, but the GM needs to control enemies as though they didn&#8217;t have that knowledge at the start of a fight. Intelligent enemies might figure it out after one or two attempts to hit you, but enemies with poor Intelligence and\/or Wisdom should probably take longer to figure it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t trust your GM to play along, this probably isn&#8217;t the right build for your game. If your GM wants a predefined rule for determining when an enemy might figure out the gimmick, consider making a Bluff check opposed by the target&#8217;s Sense Motive, and if the target wins they learn to avoid making attacks of opportunity against you. You could even grant a +2 bonus on the Sense Motive check each time the defender falls into your Attack of Opportunity trap so that they&#8217;re guaranteed to figure it out if they live long enough. Of course, monks are garbage at Bluff, so this mechanic heavily favors your enemies. Discuss it with your GM, and try to come up with something that feels fair to everyone at the table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panther Style<\/span>: Without Flurry of Blows to\n\t\tlock you in place, mobility is much more appealing for the Master of Many\n\t\tStyles than it is for the vanilla Monk.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panther Claw<\/span>: Run through mobs of enemies\n\t\tat crazy Monk speed and punch the snot out of everything dumb enough to try\n\t\tto stop you. You probably want Mobility, or you&#8217;re going to eat a lot of\n\t\tdamage trying to draw these attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panther Parry<\/span>: This really improves the\n\t\treliability of Panther Claw. You have the potential to kill, stun, trip, or\n\t\totherwise disable the target before they attack you, and you apply a -2\n\t\tpenalty to their attack if they&#8217;re still able to attack you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"pummeling\" class=\"rating-green\">Pummeling Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>DR is a show stopper for the Master of Many Styles. With the same per-hit damage as a conventional monk and fewer attacks, any reduction to your damage output is a serious handicap. Applying DR only once in a turn can go a long way to address this issue. However, because you can&#8217;t rely on your iterative attacks as much as a vanilla monk can rely on the extra Flurry of Blows attacks, the style may not pay off as much as you would like. You&#8217;re also locked into fighting unarmed, which may be a problem if you&#8217;re trying to fight using a weapon two-handed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pummeling Bully and Pummeling Charge both have situationally useful benefits, so keep them in mind for use with your wildcard slots when those situations arise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s not terribly important due to the Master of Many Style&#8217;s ability to ignore style feat prerequisites, it&#8217;s interesting to note that Pummeling Style is a fork rather than a linear series of feats like other styles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pummeling Style<\/span>: An excellent choice for\n\t\tmost monks, but not essential for the Master of Many Styles because you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pummeling Bully<\/span>: You only need to hit\n\t\tonce, and this is much easier to get than Improved Trip, but I would keep\n\t\tthis as an option for your wildcard slots. However, the requirement for\n\t\tImproved Reposition (which requires 13 Int) is really steep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pummeling Charge<\/span>: Making a full attack on\n\t\ta charge is almost always better than making a single attack. But most turns\n\t\tdon&#8217;t involve a charge, so pick this up with a wildcard slot when you need\n\t\tit and dump it when you don&#8217;t.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"shaitan\" class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Shaitan style is basically the same as Efreeti style, but instead of setting things on fire it deals acid damage and makes them staggered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan Style<\/span>: Similar to Djinni style,\n\t\tthis adds a small amount of damage to your Elemental Fist, which is a fairly\n\t\tlimited resource due to the limited uses per day. If you miss you still deal\n\t\tthe acid damage, which is pretty nice for your iterative attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan Skin<\/span>: The acid resistance is\n\t\tdecent, and Staggerred is a pretty good status condition.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan Earthblast<\/span>: Columns are a great\n\t\tAOE shape, and this has the best range of the genie styles. Automatic\n\t\tunarmed strike damage is great, and staggering groups of enemies can really\n\t\tturn a battle in your favor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"snake\" class=\"rating-blue\">Snake Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Snake Style on its own is a passable way to defend yourself at extremely low levels, but Snake Fang is the real draw of the style. An attack of opportunity every time an enemy attacks and misses you means that a reliable AC suddenly becomes a boost to your damage output. Combine this with Crane Style to make your AC really good and pick up Combat Reflexes so you can make more attacks. Put Fortuitous on your weapon or your Amulet of Mighty Fists and you can get an extra attack once per round (albeit at -5 to hit).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snake Style<\/span>: And suddenly Sense Motive\n\t\tis your AC. At first level, with one rank, 14 wisdom, and Snake Style, you\n\t\tcan have a +8 to Sense Motive, which likely beats your AC bonus. This is an\n\t\timmediate action, so you can only do it once per round, which means you\n\t\tstill want to invest in your AC for iterative attacks and multiple enemies.\n\t\tAs you grow in level, your Sense Motive bonus will likely outpace your AC if\n\t\tonly because you get guaranteed skill ranks every level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snake Sidewind<\/span>: Only take this if you&#8217;re\n\t\tbuilding to emphasize critical hits, which you shouldn&#8217;t do because it&#8217;s a\n\t\tterrible idea. Conveniently, you can pick up Snake Fang as a bonus feat and\n\t\ttotally skip Snake Sidewind.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Snake Fang<\/span>: A free attack when your enemy\n\t\tmisses is good enough to justify taking Combat Reflexes and standing in\n\t\tcrowds of enemies to draw fire. Because you also use your immediate action\n\t\tto use Snake Style to replace your AC, you may need to decide between\n\t\tdefending yourself or relying on your AC and potentially hitting your\n\t\topponent an extra time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"snapping-turtle\" class=\"rating-orange\">Snapping Turtle Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re building as a grappler, skip Snapping Turtle Style. Crane Style\n\twill get you more AC, so Snapping Turtle Clutch is the style&#8217;s only real\n\tselling point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snapping Turtle Style<\/span>: Dodge is strictly\n\t\tbetter, but this contributes to the Monk&#8217;s flat-footed AC, which is\n\t\tgenerally terrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Snapping Turtle Clutch<\/span>: Literally the only\n\t\treason to take this is for the free grapple attempts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snapping Turtle Shell<\/span>: An extra +1 to AC\n\t\tstill isn&#8217;t much, but it applies to your AC\/touch AC\/flat-footed AC, which\n\t\tis nice. -4 to critical hit confirmations against you won&#8217;t matter much, but\n\t\tit certainly feels comforting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"tiger\" class=\"rating-orange\">Tiger Style<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiger Style is a really weird gimmick where you shove enemies away from you, then chase them down on the following round to hit them and push them away again. This combination has numerous points of failure, so the whole setup can fall apart quickly with a bad roll or if your enemy somehow gets out of your reach. Perhaps the biggest draw of the style, at least for the Master of Many Styles, is Tiger Claws for the ability to make two attacks at your highest Base Attack bonus. Tiger Pounce is only situationally useful, so use Combat Style Master and your wildcard slots to pick it up as a free action in those rare moment where it&#8217;s useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tiger Style<\/span>: Slashing damage is only\n\t\toccasionally helpful, the CMD bonus is situational, critical hits aren&#8217;t\n\t\tsomething that Monks can really rely on, and even in the case of a critical\n\t\thit the bleed damage doesn&#8217;t last long enough to be meaningful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tiger Claws<\/span>: Because you don&#8217;t get Flurry\n\t\tof Blows, this may be a passable replacement. At any given level, two\n\t\tattacks at your highest BAB is likely more effective than the two or three\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll get with normal iterative attacks. You also get to bull rush your\n\t\tenemy away from you, which can seriously hinder enemies which rely on making\n\t\ta full attack, then follow up with Tiger Pounce on your next turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tiger Pounce<\/span>: You get to move as a swift\n\t\taction, which is great, but it can only be toward an enemy you hit on this\n\t\tturn or your previous turn. The most likely scenario is that you&#8217;re chasing\n\t\ta fleeing foe or that you&#8217;re closing with an enemy which you pushed away\n\t\twith Tiger Claws.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Many styles lock you into fighting unarmed. If you avoid those styles, I suggest using a single weapon two-handed so you can benefit from the additional Strength and Power Attack damage. Because you don&#8217;t need to worry about Flurry of Blows, you might even consider getting proficiency in something interesting like an elven curveblade or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks can&#8217;t use armor, so I recommend getting someone in your party to cast Mage Armor on you. With hours\/level duration even a low level wizard can cover you for the full adventuring day. If your pet Wizard is stingy with his spell slots, drop 1000 gold pieces to buy him a Pearl of Power 1 so you can both share Mage Armor from one slot. The +4 bonus from Mage Armor is enough to make up most of the AC gap between a Monk and typical front-line character like a Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blade of the Sword-Saint<\/span> (75,350 gp):\n\t\t18-20 threat range and you can use it two-handed. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s worth\n\t\tthe cost because Ki Intensifying isn&#8217;t very good, but sometimes you just\n\t\treally want to double-down on the far-east feel of a monk swinging a\n\t\tkatana.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Brawling<\/span> (+1): Add your enhancement bonus\n\t\tto all of your combat maneuvers. Conveniently, unarmed strikes are light\n\t\tbludgeoning weapons so you could put this on an Amulet of Mighty Fists if\n\t\tyou wanted to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Furyborn<\/span> (+2): The best case scenario\n\t\tfor this weapon ability is for a monk to put it on an amulet of mighty\n\t\tfists. You need to be attacking with the same weapon a large number of times\n\t\tto make the ability work, and monks are the best way to do that.\n\t\tUnfortunately, it&#8217;s not clear if the maximum bonus of +5 is +5 in total with\n\t\tother enhancement bonuses (like your +5 unarmed strikes) or if it&#8217;s +5 just\n\t\tfrom Furyborn. If it&#8217;s the latter, the appeal of attacking with a +10\n\t\tenhancement bonus is hard to ignore. Of course, you still face the issue\n\t\tthat you should be killing enemies too quickly for this to ramp up, in which\n\t\tcase you&#8217;re sinking a bunch of money into an ability that rarely\n\t\tmatters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Focus<\/span> (+1): If you insist on using\n\t\tweapons, you need to have this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Intensifying<\/span> (+2): Basically Ki Focus\n\t\tbut you get to add half of your enhancement bonus to relevant special\n\t\tabilities. If you plan to put a bunch of money into an enhancement bonus\n\t\tthis might work, but I would wait until you have a <em>ton<\/em> of spare\n\t\tmoney before you even consider this ability. Enhancing your Wisdom will do\n\t\tmuch more for you for much less money.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wounding<\/span> (+2): Because the bleed stacks\n\t\twith itself, Wounding works best when you make a huge number of attacks with\n\t\ta single weapon, which is where monks specialize. Unfortunately, most of the\n\t\ttime you&#8217;ll get more damage out of abilities like Flaming because bleed\n\t\tdamage takes so long to deal significant of damage. This could be great\n\t\tagainst enemies with huge pools of hit points, but even against those foes\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll do more damage hitting them more on successive rounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wyroot<\/span> (1,000\/2,000\/4,000): An\n\t\teasily-overlooked method for recovering Ki. Attacking a helpless target is\n\t\tan automatic critical hit, so you can use this to farm Ki from unconscious\n\t\tenemies. If you deal nonlethal damage you can beat the same target\n\t\trepeatedly to fully restore your Ki pool, then fill the weapon to recharge\n\t\tlater. I would only get the first tier of the effect unless you&#8217;re high\n\t\tlevel and built to emphasize critical hits..<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection<\/span>: You need all the AC you can\n\t\tget.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cure Light Wounds<\/span>: You can&#8217;t use it, so\n\t\tbuddy up to someone who can.

It has a one-hour duration, which should last through\n\t\tseveral fights if you have time to cast it ahead of time. It provides as\n\t\tmuch AC as Bracers of Armor +4, which cost 16000gp. That&#8217;s more than 23\n\t\twands worth of GP. If you go through 1 wand per level (I don&#8217;t know how you\n\t\twould manage to do that) you will still save money.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Amulet of Mighty Fists<\/span>: This allows you to\n\t\tadd special weapon abilities to your unarmed strikes. Notably, it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire a +1 enhancement bonus like a weapon does, so you can go straight to\n\t\tthe fun stuff. The Impact enhancement is tempting since it lets you use a\n\t\tlarger damage scale, but Paizo has ruled that unarmed strikes count as light\n\t\tweapons and Impact can&#8217;t be placed on light weapons. Instead, consider\n\t\toptions like shocking, speed (oh look more attacks), or holy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Belt of Physical Perfection<\/span>: Get one\n\t\tearly, and upgrade it often.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bracers of Armor<\/span>: A wand of Mage Armor\n\t\tprovides as much AC as +4 bands, and for the same cost you can guy a huge\n\t\tbox of wands, and get the AC bonus at much lower level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\tforego.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deliquescent Gloves<\/span>: For just 8,000 gp\n\t\tyou can add +1d6 acid damage to attacks made with your hands. You&#8217;ll need to\n\t\tuse your hands for unarmed strikes to get the damage, but if you&#8217;re not\n\t\tusing a weapon that&#8217;s probably not a problem. These cost as much as a +2\n\t\tweapon, so wait to get these until your Amulet of Mighty Fists is already\n\t\t+2-equivalent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ioun Stone (Dusty Rose)<\/span>: At only 5000gp,\n\t\ta Dusty Rose Ioun Stone provides a cheaper boost to AC than upgrading your\n\t\tRing of Protection from +1 to +2.

Unarmed Strike is an option, though you may want\n\t\tto stick to an actual weapon since you&#8217;re giving up three levels worth of\n\t\tunarmed strike progression.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; The Striking Panther<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>Eventually they&#8217;ll learn to stop swinging at me, but by then they&#8217;ll all be dead.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build works primarily by combining Panther Style and Snake Style to intentionally draw attacks However, mixing in other styles (Crane Style, Pummeling Style, etc.) as you gain levels makes the build gradually more effective and reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our ideal scenario looks like this: You move, drawing an attack of opportunity. You interrupt your opponent with Panther Parry to hit them. They then take their attack at a -2 penalty against your AC +4 (Mobility), and when they miss, you take an attack of opportunity against them. If you haven&#8217;t used your immediate action for the round, you can spend it to get another free attack with Snake Fang. That&#8217;s up to three free attacks at your full base attack bonus, and if you moved 10 feet before drawing attacks of opportunity, all of them are sneak attacks. Now do that for every enemy on the field in one turn (minus the second free attack made as an immediate action because you only get one per round).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our favored class bonus, I recommend getting additional hit points. This is a Defender\/Striker build, so you&#8217;re filling in for a fighter or a similar character. You can afford to leave the skills to other party members, but you need to make up the gap created by your d8 hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fatal-flaws\">Fatal Flaws<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This build has two serious flaws: First, the build is chained to the potential drawbacks of Panther Style (see the section on panther Style, above). If your GM isn&#8217;t willing to be accommodating with Panther Style, the whole build falls apart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the build is limited by the Monk&#8217;s relatively small amount of damage dealt with a single unarmed strike. You&#8217;ll want to pick up ways to deal extra damage with each attack like permanently enhancing your unarmed strikes and an amulet of mighty fists loaded with things like Flaming and Shocking.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your specific ability spread doesn&#8217;t differ from a conventional monk. You&#8217;ll want enough Dexterity to make Snake Fang and Combat Reflexes really effective, and you&#8217;ll want at least 14 Wisdom for Panther Style so you can use it more than once per round.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of race matters very little to the build. Human gets you an extra feat at level 1, which is helpful but not essential. Half-Elf can get you proficiency in an exotic weapon as an alternate racial trait. Halfling is a tempting option because the bonuses for small size may outweigh the reduction in damage by keeping you alive and making your attacks more accurate.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your skills don&#8217;t matter much, but I recommend taking at least three ranks in Acrobatics to improve Fight Defensively so that you can capitalize on Crane Style.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Bullied and any other trait. The majority of our attacks will be attacks of opportunity which you&#8217;re forced to make unarmed, so Bullied will get a lot of mileage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table zebra-striped is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1 &#8211; Monk 1<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat &#8211; Snake Style<\/li>\n<li>Bonus Feat &#8211; Snake Fang<\/li>\n<li>Fuse Style (2 Styles)<\/li>\n<li>Stunning Fist<\/li>\n<li>Unarmed strike<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At this level we&#8217;re all about Snake Style. Put yourself on the front lines and draw fire. Ideally you want an enemy to miss you so that you get to make two attacks against them. Since Panther Style hasn&#8217;t made its way into your build yet, use a two-handed weapon to maximize your damage output. A Sansetsukon is my go-to for monks, but if you&#8217;re a half-elf you might have something better.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re intentionally skipping Snake Widewind. It&#8217;s not essential to the build since we can use our bonus feats to go straight to Snake Fang.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 &#8211; Monk 2<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Bonus Feat &#8211; Panther Style<\/li>\n<li>Evasion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At this level you don&#8217;t want to use Panther Style too much. It&#8217;s risky to provoke attacks of opportunity before you&#8217;ve picked up options to boost your AC. The best plan is to try to use Snake Fang&#8217;s immediate action attack, which will preclude your swift action when your turn comes back around, then use Panther Style if you didn&#8217;t get to use Snake Fang.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 &#8211; Monk 3<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat &#8211; Combat Reflexes<\/li>\n<li>Fast Movement<\/li>\n<li>Maneuver Training<\/li>\n<li>Still Mind<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Combat Reflexes makes Snake Fang considerably more effective because we can make more than one free attack in a given round. If your AC is decent, now is the time to start putting yourself into groups of enemies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At this level we also hit 3 ranks in Acrobatics. If you&#8217;re using a weapon with the Blocking property like a tonfa or a 9-section whip you can now use Fight Defensively to get a total +4 to AC, though the -4 to attacks may be too much to overcome at this level.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 &#8211; Monk 4<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ki Pool (magic)<\/li>\n<li>Slow Fall 20 ft.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Without Flurry of Blows, your Ki Pool is much less useful. Expect to use it for Qinggong abilities if you use it at all.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is the first level where we can use Qinggong Monk to trade abilities. Drop Slow Fall for Barkskin. Barkskin is one of the most useful AC buffs in the game, and it&#8217;s a much better use of your Ki than the 1-round AC buff. Even at this low level you have enough Ki to keep Barkskin running throughout your entire adventuring day.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 &#8211; Monk 5<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat &#8211; Panther Claw<\/li>\n<li>High Jump<\/li>\n<li>Purity of Body<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Panther claw allows our attacks from Panther Style to keep up with out attacks from Snake Fang. That means that your typical turn will nearly always include using your move action to walk around and provoke attacks of opportunity. By this level you have +10 ft. move speed, so you can cover quite a few squares with a move action. If you need to remain in place to prevent enemies from getting close to your squishy friends, you can always take a nice walk before returning to the square in which you started.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Consider trading High Jump for a Qinggong ability like Ki Stand, but at this level you have few worthwhile Qinggong options.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 &#8211; Monk 6<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Bonus Feat &#8211; Wildcard Slot<\/li>\n<li>Slow Fall 30 ft.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>This level brings our first Wildcard Slot. Generally that&#8217;s going to be filled by Panther Parry, but since we have the prerequisites for Panther Parry the Wildcard Slot is objectively better than permanently picking the feat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With Snake Fang and Panther Parry both running, you&#8217;re now able to fulfill the core function of the build. Use Panther Parry to hit enemies and handicap their attacks of opportunity, then when they miss hit them with the attack from Snake Fang.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By this level you have enough gold that getting permanent +5 unarmed strikes is affordable. Because this build depends so heavily on unarmed strikes, this is an absolutely fantastic investment. +5 damage is already good, but consider picking up an amulet of mighty fists with something to improve your damage further.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 &#8211; Monk 7<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat &#8211; Dodge<\/li>\n<li>Ki pool (cold iron\/silver)<\/li>\n<li>Wholeness of Body<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got lots of options at this point. If you&#8217;re hitting reliably (and you should with +5 unarmed strikes) you might consider Power Attack instead of a style feat. You might even consider a class dip at this level. Brawler, Fighter, and Rogue all offer some excellent options. More style feats seems like the obvious way to go because we&#8217;re using Master of Many Styles, but don&#8217;t limit yourself to style feats.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But this is a build guide, so I&#8217;m going to give you a fixed choice. We get to add an additional simultaneous style at 8th level thanks to Fuse Style, so another style feat makes sense. Since we&#8217;re spending a lot of time drawing attacks, I think working toward Crane Style makes the most sense. Unfortunately that means we&#8217;ll need to pick up Dodge and wait a while. Enjoy that +1 Dodge bonus to AC while you&#8217;re running around drawing attacks. Barkskin also improves at this level, so your AC jumps nicely.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 &#8211; Monk 8<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Fuse Style (3 Styles)<\/li>\n<li>Slow fall 40 ft.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t pick up a third style feat, this level is very boring. You get your first iterative attack at this level, but since you need to spend your move action walking around don&#8217;t expect to use it. Walking out of a threatened space then walking back in can get you 2 to 3 attacks at your full BAB, which is obviously more effective than one attack at BAB -5.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 &#8211; Monk 9<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat &#8211; Crane Style<\/li>\n<li>Improved Evasion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>With Crane Style, 3 ranks in Acrobatics, and a blocking weapon, you can Fight Defensively for -2 to attacks and a total +5 to AC. That&#8217;s a pretty great trade. If you want to do so for some reason, you can use your Wildcard slot to drop Panther Parry to pick up Crane Wing for another +4 Dodge bonus to AC against melee attacks. That will make you really hard to hit, which will make Snake Fang really effective.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; Monk 10<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Bonus Feat &#8211; Wildcard Slot<\/li>\n<li>Ki pool (lawful)<\/li>\n<li>Slow Fall 50 ft.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>With two wildcard slots, you can run both Panther Parry and Crane Wing at the same time so you&#8217;re both dangerous and hard to hit.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11+<\/td><td>\n<p>Beyond 10th level things get even more flexible. You have all of the gimmicks that the build really cares about, so you&#8217;re totally free to experiment. Remember that you&#8217;re dependent on taking a move action, so anything that takes a full round action doesn&#8217;t work. Fighter seems like a great option for the feats, but levels of ninja or rogue might work if you can reliably deliver sneak attack damage (try using Catch Off-Guard or stunning enemies).<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Style feats are really cool. In fact, they&#8217;re one of my favorite ways to customize the Monk, both for flavor reasons and for mechanical reasons.

They give up the Monk&#8217;s signature attack option (Flurry of Blows), but in exchange they get the ability to mix and match style feats in a way that literally no one else can do.
