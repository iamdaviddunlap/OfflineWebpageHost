Every Lineage has the choice of +2\/+1 increases or three +1 increases except for the Custom Lineage which only receives a single +2 increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lineages are applied on top of a base race. While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait. Despite selecting a base race, you do not count as a member of your race for the purposes of any other effect, such as qualifying for feats or using magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-custom-lineage\" class=\"rating-blue\">Custom Lineage<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A single +2 increase is all that the Warlock really needs. A feat is a\n\tpowerful asset, and if you want you could pick a feat which gives you a +1\n\tCharisma increase, allowing you to start at level 1 with 18 Charisma. You also\n\tget either a skill or Darkvision, and I recommend Darkvision unless you plan\n\tto take Devil&#8217;s Sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-dhampir\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dhampir<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>Sadly, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re able to use Hex Warrior with the Dhampir&#8217;s bite, so there&#8217;s little to be had here. Sure, Spider Climb is near, but that&#8217;s just not enough, especially since you can get flight from Ancestral Legacy. You could use Ancestral Legacy for the skills, but at that point you&#8217;re basically a tabaxi who can walk on ceilings.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-hexblood\" class=\"rating-blue\">Hexblood<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>Hex and Disguise Self for free save you the trouble of learning them, not to mention saving you spell slots since you can cast each of them once per day for free. Ancestral Legacy can get you either two skills or a movement type, and either is a great options. Flight is probably the go-to choice here, making the Hexblood at least equal to the Fairy in effectiveness..<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-reborn\" class=\"rating-green\">Reborn<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>An interesting choice for a melee hexblade, the Reborn&#8217;s durability is a nice addition to a relatively frail front-line build. Ancestral Legacy can get you two skills or flight, but if you want flight you&#8217;ll likely do better with other options like the Fairy or the Hexblood. If you go for skills, you can expand beyond Face skills, and Knowledge From a Past Life will provide a useful bonus on skill checks..<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Charisma bonuses are crucial, but there&#8217;s little else that&#8217;s truly a must-have so there&#8217;s lot of room to explore the benefits other racial traits. Darkvision is less useful for warlocks due to the availability of Devil&#8217;s Sight, but if you don&#8217;t want to rely on magical darkness, Darkvision is just as good for the Warlock as for anyone else. Innate spellcasting is unusually helpful for warlocks compared to other full spellcasters. Since warlocks get so few spell slots, innate spellcasting is a significant expansion to your resources, and if the spellcasting is Charisma-based you&#8217;re already well suited to using
