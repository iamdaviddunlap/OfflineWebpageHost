At the same time, over the\n\tcourse of Dungeons and Dragons&#8217; real-world history they have come to be known\n\tfor their clever usage of traps and contraptions, their sometimes absurd\n\twillingness to throw themselves on adventurer&#8217;s weapons, and their paradoxical\n\tability to outwit and outfight experienced, powerful adventurers. They are at\n\tthe same time both pitiful and terrifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>As a playable race, the original version of the Kobold was a significant design point in the evolution of race design in 5th edition. They were the first race to feature an ability <em>decrease<\/em>, which is a design decision which I assumed would be left on the ashes of 3rd edition (orcs also featured an ability decrease, but they&#8217;re later in the alphabet so kobolds still count as first). Of course, this was later removed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also feature the powerful Pack Tactics trait which is typically reserved for weak creatures designed to be threatening in a group but negligible on their own. This is partially offset by Sunlight Sensitivity, but players are typically clever enough to offset Sunlight Sensitivity somehow, so it wasn&#8217;t much of a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the strength of Pack Tactics, the original Kobold is very limited. With only a single ability score increase, anything that couldn&#8217;t survive almost exclusively on Dexterity was a difficult choice without the custom origin rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The updated version of the Kobold published in Monsters of the Multiverse completely reworked their design, removing both Pack Tactics and Sunlight Sensitivity, which was met with much skepticism from people who enjoyed Pack Tactics. That was loss was certainly tragic, the new version of the Kobold is interesting, versatile, and very playable. If we had gotten this as the original version of the Kobold, I think people would have really liked it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the concept of subraces has gone away, the Kobold&#8217;s Kobold Legacy trait functions similarly to a subrace, offering one additional decision point within your race to customize your kobold to your liking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#versions\">Kobold Versions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#pack-tactics\">Pack Tactics<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-mmom\">Kobold Classes (MMoM)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-custom-origin\">Kobold Classes (Customizable Origins)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-default\">Kobold Classes (Classic Rules)<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Keep in mind that the state of the meta periodically changes as new source materials are released, and the article will be updated accordingly as time allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"versions\">Kobold Versions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Kobold effectively has 4 versions. The original version was published in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/vgtm\/character-races#KoboldTraits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Volo&#8217;s Guide to Monsters<\/a>, and included a Strength decrease as part of the Kobold&#8217;s racial traits. This decrease was removed in errata, which we&#8217;ll call version 1.1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of the custom origin rules in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/character-options#CustomizingYourOrigin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything<\/a> gave us the third version of the Kobold, allowing players to move the single +2 increase to other places. This made any SAD class viable for the Kobold without suffering through poor ability scores for most of your career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/motm\/fantastical-races-continued#Kobold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monsters of the Multiverse<\/a> gave us the Kobold&#8217;s fourth version. This was a complete rewrite, abandoning the previous version of the Kobold&#8217;s traits in favor of some exciting new ideas. Draconic Cry calls back to Grovel, Cower, and Beg, but rather than assuming cowardice, you&#8217;re free to describe it as groveling or as a mighty draconic roar. Grovel, Cower, and Beg also previously only benefited your allies and took an Action, while Draconic Cry is a Bonus Action and also benefits you. This makes it an easy way to get Advantage in a hurry, though the 10-foot range is a problem for ranged attackers. Kobold Legacy offers a decision point which makes the Kobold appealing with nearly any class.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pack-tactics\">Pack Tactics<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you are using the version of the Kobold published in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/vgtm\/character-races#KoboldTraits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Volo&#8217;s Guide to Monsters<\/a>, you will need to understand the mechanical implications of Pack Tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pack Tactics is immensely dangerous as-written. Advantage should never be\n\tthis easy to achieve. Sure, there are easy options like using an owl familiar\n\tto take the Help action, but even that can be easily negated by killing your\n\tfamiliar. Pack Tactics merely requires that &#8220;at least one of your allies is\n\twithin 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn&#8217;t incapacitated&#8221;. The ally does\n\tnot need to be able to detect your or the target, you don&#8217;t need to be able to\n\tdetect either the ally or the target, and the target does not need to be aware\n\tof or able to detect either of you (other rules apply in all of those cases,\n\tof course).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To explain exactly how problematic this is, consider this case: A kobold\n\tfighter has a pet rat. Not a familiar, just a pet. They keep this rat in their\n\tpocket, where the rat is quite content to remain while combat takes place.\n\tThis rat qualifies as an ally, and so long as it isn&#8217;t napping or affected by\n\tsomething unpleasant it&#8217;s not incapacitated. The DM could reasonably rule that\n\tthe rat is Restrained and can&#8217;t see out of the pocket, but neither of those\n\tthings prevent the kobold from using the rat to qualify for Pack Tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that our imaginary kobold can use Pack Tactics against anything\n\twithin 5 ft., negating Disadvantage from any source (Sunlight Sensitivity,\n\tattack invisible foes, being fully blind, etc.) with no effort beyong keeping\n\ttheir rat safe and happy. Unless the kobold&#8217;s foes learn about the rat, it&#8217;s\n\tlikely that the rat can only be harmed by accident. The kobold could take\n\tfurther precautions and keep the rat in a small sealed box to give it full\n\tcover, protecting it from area effects and blocking line of sight so that it\n\tcan&#8217;t be targeted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is clearly not how Pack Tactics was intended to be used, but it\n\tillustrates my point: Pack Tactics was written for monsters, not for players.\n\tIt&#8217;s too good to let players use it as-written.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your group shares my concerns but you still don&#8217;t want to use the updated\n\tversion of the Kobold, here&#8217;s what I recommend as a variant on Pack\n\tTactics:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Pack Tactics.<\/strong> As a bonus action you may take advantage of\n\t\tthe presence of your allies. You gain Advantage on the next attack roll you\n\t\tmake this turn against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5\n\t\tfeet of the creature and the ally can observe the creature and is able to\n\t\ttake the Attack action.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This both limits the usage of Pack Tactics to once per turn (there is only one published monster with more than one attack that also has Pack Tactics) and restricts the required ally to allies who would reasonably be to contribute to Pack Tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course I can&#8217;t assume that you&#8217;ll accept my suggestions, so the advice\n\tbelow assumes that you&#8217;re using the official version of Pack Tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-mmom\">Kobold Classes (MMoM)<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"artificer\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\">Artificer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A great choice for melee builds where Draconic Cry&#8217;s short range is easy to achieve safely.

Take Kobold Legacy (Draconic Sorcery) and you can turn a lore bard into a decent melee threat with Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade, bringing you into close quarters where you&#8217;re in range for Draconic Cry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cleric\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\">Cleric<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Kobold Legacy (Draconic Sorcery) offers easy access to Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade, either of which will make using a weapon justifiable despite the Cleric&#8217;s difficulties making weapons useful. Grab a domain which grants heavy armor proficiency, march into melee, and use Draconic Cry to support your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"druid\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\">Druid<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Draconic Cry typically drags you into melee, which is a hard prospect for the Druid due to their persistent durability issues. You could go for Circle of Spores and use Kobold Legacy (Draconic Sorcery) to get Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade and stack it with your bonus damage from Symbiotic Entity. You could also go for Circle of the Moon. I think Draconic Cry works while using Wild Shape, but check with your DM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fighter\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\">Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A good choice for melee builds, and any version of Kobold Legacy could be useful. Craftiness will help make you useful outside of combat. Defiance will protect against a common mental status effect that is frequently a huge problem for fighters. Draconic Sorcery can get you Booming Blade, giving eldritch knights a small damage boost until Extra Attack comes online. Then when you get War Magic you can go back to Booming Blade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monk\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\">Monk<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Monk already leans heavily on their Bonus Action, but using Draconic Cry in place of a Bonus Action to attack may provide a bigger boost to your party&#8217;s damage output than just hitting your enemies one more time that turn. Draconic Legacy is hard, but Crafty may be your best bet despite the limited skill options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"paladin\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\">Paladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective for all the same reasons as the Fighter. Paladins also don&#8217;t get as many attacks as fighters, so Kobold Legacy (Draconic Sorcery) to get Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade can be a significant boost to your damage output even once Extra Attack comes online. Crafty looks tempting, but the skill options don&#8217;t work well for most paladins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ranger\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\">Ranger<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rangers often lean heavily on their Bonus Action, and few of the Kobold Legacy options are great for the ranger. If you&#8217;re your party&#8217;s primary front-line martial character, go for Defiant. If you need skills, Craft may help despite the limited skill choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"rogue\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\">Rogue<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Draconic Cry provides easy Advantage to trigger Sneak Attack in a pinch, and Kobold Legacy (Draconic Sorcery) gets you Booming Blade so that you can use Cunning Action to perform easy hit-and-run tactics. You also get Darkvision, which is crucial for sneaking around in the dark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sorcerer\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Draconic Cry is dangerous because of its short range. Kobold Legacy offers a few useful options, but I would go for Crafty over the others. Fear is less of a problem when you don&#8217;t need to approach enemies or make attacks, and an extra sorcerer cantrip is nice but not essential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"warlock\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\">Warlock<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As dangerous as it is, using Draconic Cry at short range before blasting an enemy with Eldritch Blast can be very effective. Or you can be a hexblade and shoot\/stab people. Any of the Kobold Legacy options work fine, but I would skip Draconic Sorcery unless you desperately need just one more cantrip for some reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wizard\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\">Wizard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being close enough to use Draconic Cry is dangerous for any wizard except a bladesinger.

If\n\tyour DM allows you to retain Pack Tactics while using Wild Shape (I think they\n\tshould since Pack Tactics isn&#8217;t a function of the Kobold&#8217;s anatomy), it&#8217;s a\n\tpowerful addition to your Wild Shape forms.

Since getting\n\tAdvantage is so easy with Pack Tactics, consider using Sharpshooter to\n\tsignificantly boost your damage output. Unfortunately there isn&#8217;t a comparable\n\tmelee option since kobolds are terrible with two-handed weapons, but a kobold\n\twill fare just fine in melee with a finesse weapon (or two if you want to\n\tbuild for two-weapon fighting).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"classic-monk\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\">Monk<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Dexterity increase is technically all that you need, and easy Advantage\n\twith Pack Tactics will help keep your attacks reliable.
