Sure, once per turn isn&#8217;t as good as Bless&#8217;s 1d4, but Bond of Peace applies to ability checks and doesn&#8217;t require Concentration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do this PB\/day.

Keep in mind that your maximum number of Sorcery Points is determined by your sorcerer level, so if you want to melt higher-level spell slots you likely want to go beyond 3rd level in sorcerer so that you&#8217;re not wasting points when you melt spell slots of 3rd level and above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Level<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feat(s) and Features<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Notes and Tactics<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>Sorcerous Origin: Divine Soul<br>Divine Magic<br>Favored by the Gods<\/td><td>Favored by the Gods lets you add 2d4 to a failed attack or save once per rest.<br><br>With access to cleric spells, we can learn Guidance and Bless.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Font of Magic<\/td><td>Melt higher-level spell slots into 1st-level slots to cast Bless more.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warlock-fiend-or-any\">Warlock (Fiend or any)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Warlock&#8217;s contributions to the dice pool effort come online slowly, and they come from the easily-overlooked Pact of the Talisman.

We now get 3rd-level spell slots, but if we melt them into Sorcery Points we lose 1 because our max is currently 2 points, so save those slots for upcasting spells. Similarly, melting 2nd-level spells gets you enough points for a single 1st-level slot, so save yourself a step.<br><br>PB increases to +4.
