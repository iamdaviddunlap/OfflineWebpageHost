They channel a primal rage to empower themselves\n\tboth in and out of combat. Barbarians can be a lot of fun to play, and, with\n\tsimple tactics and easy resource management, they&#8217;re also easy to play\n\tsuccessfully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In an adventuring party, the Barbarian is a capable Defender and Striker,\n\tabsorbing a lot of damage and dealing a lot in kind. With Weapon Mastery and\n\tBrutal Strike, the Barbarian can also add some Controller options, allowing\n\tthem to reposition enemies or limit enemies&#8217; tactical options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Barbarian&#8217;s biggest shortcoming is their capabilities outside of combat.\n\tThey have few good skill options, and their best skills all depend on\n\tsecondary ability scores. Primal Knowledge does a lot to help this, but Rage\n\tuses are precious and only last for 10 minutes, so, in a long adventuring day,\n\tyou may find yourself struggling to use your skills effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, you might enjoy our other supporting content:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-barbarian\/barbarian-subclasses\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28250\">Barbarian Subclasses Guide<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/barbarian-levels-1-4-the-frat-bro-of-the-dnd-world-rpgbot-podcast-s4e76\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28014\">BARBARIAN Levels 1 \u2013 4: The Frat Bro\u2019 of the DnD World \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E76<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/barbarians-levels-5-20-woohoo-smash-smash-smashy-smash-rpgbot-podcast-s4e77\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28129\">BARBARIANS Levels 5 \u2013 20: Woohoo!

The bonus damage isn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s reliable and consistent.\n\tThe resistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing your limited pool of Rage uses is crucial to playing a Barbarian\n\teffectively. Don&#8217;t be afraid to use Rage, but don&#8217;t waste it, either. You\n\tdon&#8217;t need to use it in every single encounter, as much fun as that is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that Rage&#8217;s damage bonus works with any Strength-based attack, so\n\tyou can use it with many thrown weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1. <span class=\"rating-orange\">Unarmored Defense<\/span>: This is great flavor\n\tfor the Barbarian, but won&#8217;t do much good for you unless your ability scores\n\tare very high. Your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers need to total +7 to\n\tmatch the total AC bonus provided by half plate armor. That&#8217;s generally\n\tachievable by level 8 unless you rolled for ability scores, assuming that you\n\tstarted with 14 Dexterity and largely ignored Strength. More realistically,\n\tyou should expect to hit 20 Constitution by 12th level at the earliest, and\n\teven then Unarmored Defense will only match Half plate.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>If magic items are an option, Unarmored Defense becomes even harder to\n\tjustify. +X armor doesn&#8217;t require Attunement like Bracers of Defense do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: Always excellent. Since\n\tyou only get 2 at a time, I recommend picking your favorite melee weapon and\n\tthe Trident. With the Topple property, you can throw a trident to knock flying\n\tenemies prone, making it a great solution to an otherwise frustrating\n\tchallenge.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Weapon Mastery, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/weapon-mastery\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"29315\">Weapon Mastery Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Danger Sense<\/span>: Given the Barbarian\u2019s\n\tproficiency in medium armor, your Dexterity is probably 14, and Barbarians\n\taren\u2019t proficient in Dexterity saves. Advantage on these saves will make you\n\treasonably good at them.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Reckless Attack<\/span>: Rage makes you resistant\n\tto damage from normal weapons (attacks which do weird damage types still work\n\tfine), so Advantage on attacks against you doesn&#8217;t matter as much. Advantage\n\tmakes your own attacks extremely reliable, which means consistent, reliable\n\tdamage output.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about Reckless Attack making you too vulnerable, consider\n\ta weapon with the Sap mastery. Imposing Disadvantage on your target&#8217;s next\n\tattack will negate the Advantage from Reckless Attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that Reckless Attack works with any Strength-based attack, so you\n\tcan use it with many thrown weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Barbarian subclasses are briefly summarized below. See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-barbarian\/barbarian-subclasses\/\">Barbarian Subclasses Guide<\/a> for help selecting your subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Path of the Berserker: Simple, but deadly, the\n\t\tBerserker adds even more damage and can shrug off common charm and fear\n\t\teffects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Path of the Wild Heart: Channel animal-themed\n\t\tabilities each time you rage, allowing you to choose powerful tactical\n\t\toptions to meet the needs of the moment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Path of the World Tree: Protect your allies and\n\t\tensnare your enemies with a fun mix of extended reach, teleportation, and\n\t\ttemporary hit points.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Path of the Zealot: Channel the fury of the\n\t\tgods to make yourself nearly unstoppable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3. <span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Knowledge<\/span>: This offers the\n\tBarbarian some options to be more effective outside of combat. Intimidation,\n\tPerception, and Stealth are all good skill choices for Barbarians, and\n\tchanging them to be Strength checks will dramatically improve your skill\n\tbonus. Rage also gives you Advantage on Strength checks, making these skills\n\tvery reliable.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>While Primal Knowledge is a great boost to your skills, remember that you\n\thave a limited number of Rages per day. Strongly consider how much value you\n\texpect to get from using Rage outside of combat before you spend a Rage to\n\tmake one Perception check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>5. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Two attacks means\n\tpotentially twice as much damage in a turn, and twice as much opportunity to\n\tapply your Rage bonus to damage and to apply Weapon Mastery.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>5. <span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Movement<\/span>: A little bit of extra\n\tspeed won&#8217;t have a huge effect on the game most of the time, but it does make\n\tit easier for you to get into melee quickly.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>7. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Feral Instinct<\/span>: Going early is always\n\tgreat. Get into melee with enemies before they can move to attack your squishy\n\tallies. Just try not to block any area damage or area control effects which\n\tyour party&#8217;s spellcasters might be planning.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>7. <span class=\"rating-green\">Instinctive Pounce<\/span>: At this level the\n\tBarbarian has Fast Movement, so many Barbarians will have 40 ft. speed. Moving\n\thalf of that speed when you begin a Rage allows the Barbarian to get into\n\tmelee faster, which is essential since the Barbarian is essentially a\n\tmelee-only class.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>9. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Brutal Strike<\/span>: This is the Barbarian&#8217;s\n\texciting option at high levels. Brutal Strike lets you add a bit of damage and\n\ta powerful on-hit effect similar to Weapon Mastery. However, you need to forgo\n\tall Advantage on the attack (not just from Reckless Attack, but any source of\n\tAdvantage) in order to use it. This means that your Brutal Strike attack won&#8217;t\n\tbe as reliable as you may expect after 7 levels of using Reckless Attack.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the +1d10 damage is actually a DPR increase even when giving up\n\tAdvantage. A level 9 raging Barbarian with a greataxe and 20 Strength will\n\thave a DPR of 13.36 per attack (26.72 total). That same Barbarian using Brutal\n\tStrike will have a DPR of 13.60 for the Brutal Strike attack, very slightly\n\tincreasing their DPR compared to a regular attack despite losing Advantage.\n\tThe gap gets even wider if your weapon damage die is smaller, and widens again\n\twhen Brutal Strike&#8217;s bonus damage improves at level 17.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Forceful Blow<\/span>: 15 feet is a decently large\n\t\tdistance, easily putting nearly any enemy out of reach of your allies. The\n\t\tability to follow them for free means that you can remain in melee with them\n\t\tafter pushing them. Note that this says &#8220;straight away&#8221;, not just &#8220;away&#8221;, so\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t use it to launch enemies into the air without some extra\n\t\tsteps.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hamstring Blow<\/span>: 15 feet is a big speed\n\t\tpenalty. If you expect to apply other speed penalties, such as from the Slow\n\t\tmastery, you can make it effectively impossible for enemies to move away\n\t\tfrom you in order to attack your allies. If you&#8217;re using a whip (the only\n\t\treach weapon with the Slow mastery), you can apply hit-and-run tactics and\n\t\tslow enemies enough that they can&#8217;t catch up to you, effectively eliminating\n\t\tmelee-only enemies with no effort.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>11. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless Rage<\/span>: This will keep you\n\tconscious for a long time if you get hit with a low number of high-damage\n\tattacks, but lots of small attacks will raise the DC too quickly for this to\n\tremain effective. Be sure to eliminate weak but numerous enemies before your\n\tHP starts getting scary.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>13. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Brutal Strike<\/span>: Even more\n\toptions!<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Staggering Blow<\/span>: If you can land this,\n\t\tyour target is vulnerable to the next save-or-suck effect that your party\n\t\tcan hit them with. If they&#8217;re affected by something that allows repeated\n\t\tsaves, such as Hold Monster, you can time this to affect that save and keep\n\t\tthem under the effect, effectively locking your target out of combat and\n\t\tturning them into a pi\u00f1ata.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sundering Blow<\/span>: Great if you have allies\n\t\twho do more damage in a single hit than you do, such as a Rogue.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>15. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Persistent Rage<\/span>: Refreshing your Rage\n\tuses once per day effectively doubles the size of your pool. You&#8217;re also less\n\tlikely to lose your Rage since being Incapacitated no longer causes it to\n\tend.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>17. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Brutal Strike<\/span>: No new options\n\tat this level, but you add another 1d10 damage and now you can apply two\n\teffects at the same time. Combining Forceful Blow and Hamstring Blow can put\n\tan enemy out of range to get back into melee unless they Dash, which can take\n\tmelee-only enemies out of combat. There&#8217;s not much other synergy between the\n\teffects, but making a target vulnerable on their next save and on the next\n\tattack against them by combining Staggering Blow and Sundering Blow makes it\n\teasy for your party to focus their attention on a single high-value target.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>18. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Indomitable Might<\/span>: Your Strength is\n\talmost certainly 20 by this level, which means that the floor on d20 rolls for\n\tStrength checks is now 20. This gets even sillier when your floor is higher\n\tthan 20 thanks to Epic Boons and Primal Champion.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>20. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Champion<\/span>: Mathematically\n\tfantastic. A huge buff to your capabilities both offensively and defensively.\n\tNote that this can raise your ability scores to 25 specifically to allow for\n\tthe +1 from an Epic Boon taken at level 19.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll likely have either 24 or 25 Strength at this level, but you might not\n\thave enough Constitution to break 20 depending on your other build choices. If\n\tyou did rush to 20 Constitution before getting Primal Champion, give Unarmored\n\tDefense another look. With 14 Dexterity and 24 Constitution, it gives you an\n\tAC of 19, which easily beats half plate unless you&#8217;re wearing magic armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-barbarian-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Barbarian Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1: Rage now lasts up to 10 minutes, and can be extended by forcing a saving throw or by spending a Bonus Action in addition to extending it by making an attack roll.

The Bonus Action\n\t\tattack from the Enhanced Dual Wielding feature appears to be separate from\n\t\tthe one granted by the Light weapon property, so if you&#8217;re using two Light\n\t\tweapons and one has the Nick mastery, you may be able to attack with your\n\t\tsecond weapon both during your Attack action and as a Bonus Action, allowing\n\t\tyou to make 3 total attacks (4 with Extra Attack) in a turn.

This gives you Advantage on\n\t\tyour melee attacks and gives them Disadvantage, which is safer (though\n\t\tslower) than using Reckless Attack.

Use a reach weapon, and you can hit enemies\n\t\tfrom outside of their reach, then take a few steps to get too far away for\n\t\tthem to chase you without spending their Action to Dash.
