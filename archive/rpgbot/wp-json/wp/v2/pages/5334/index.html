Over two years after publishing Occult Adventures, the Spiritualist class has a number of extremely obvious errors in its text. They&#8217;ve been pointed out on the Paizo forums, and the designers have apparently publicly discussed corrections, but there has been no errata made to formally correct the issues. Because of these issues, several mechanics make it unclear how to determine the Phantom&#8217;s armor class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Spiritualists are like the occult equivalent of Hunters or Summoners. They&#8217;re a 2\/3 spellcaster built around a cool pet. Phantoms are relatively simple compared to other pet mechanics, but they&#8217;re also less versatile and customizable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Spiritualist&#8217;s biggest problem is that the Spiritualist itself doesn&#8217;t have a clear role. The Phantom does most of the heavy lifting, but the Spiritualist doesn&#8217;t have clearly useful options in combat. Expect to spend your feats trying to find something useful to do like firing a crossbow or something because there aren&#8217;t enough useful feats for Spiritualists to consume more than a handful of your feat slots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Lack of shields is annoying, but Darkwood\n\tshields have no armor check penalty, they cost next to nothing, and\n\tSpiritualists use Psychic spells so they don&#8217;t need to worry about arcane\n\tspell failure.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skills with a decent skill\n\tlist, but very few of them are Wisdom-based. Your Phantom also gets its own\n\tskills which can nicely complement yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Spiritualists are 2\/3\n\tWisdom-based spontaneous psychic spellcasters. Their spell list is mostly\n\tsupport and utility options, but there are a handful of offensive options in\n\tthe mix that you&#8217;ll probably want to ignore, plus Undead Anatomy I, II, and\n\tIII for some reason.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Phantom<\/span>: Phantom is the Spiritualist&#8217;s\n\tdefining ability. It&#8217;s like an animal companion, but spooky. For help with\n\tyour phantom, see my\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/spiritualist\/phantoms\">Practical Guide to Spiritualist Phantoms<\/a>. I\n\tstrongly recommend reading it before proceeding because understanding the\n\tPhantom is so fundamental to understanding the rest of the class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shared Consciousness<\/span> (Su): This is a nice\n\tconsolation prize for when your phantom is hanging out in your brain instead\n\tof being useful. Remember that fully manifesting your Phantom takes a full\n\tminute, so you don&#8217;t want to walk into a fight with your Phantom inhabiting\n\tyour brain instead of ready to fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Etheric Tether<\/span> (Su): The first part of this\n\tability allows you to sacrifice hit points to keep your Phantom alive. The\n\tsecond puts a leash on your Phantom, preventing it from ranging too far away\n\tfrom you. Most of the time you&#8217;ll want your Phantom to remain within 50 feet\n\tof you. Ectoplasmic phantoms can only go out to 100 feet if you spend your\n\tturn concentration, and Ethereal phantoms can only range beyond 50 feet for a\n\tfew rounds at a time. In either case, if the Phantom is outside the 50-foot\n\tleash at the wrong time it can be banished.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonded Senses<\/span> (Su): This would be great\n\tfor other pets, but Etheric Tether sets a short leash for your Phantom, so you\n\twon&#8217;t get much use out of this. Eventually when your Phantom can spend more\n\ttime away from your while Ethereal, which will make this more useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonded Manifestation<\/span> (Su): Briefly wear\n\tyour Phantom and gain some cool abilities.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ectoplasmic Bonded Manifestation<\/span>: This\n\t\tis the combat option. The shield bonus is fine, but won&#8217;t stack with your\n\t\tDarkwood Shield, and the Armor bonus probably won&#8217;t beat your actual armor\n\t\tby the time you&#8217;re high enough level to get it. The big appeal is the\n\t\ttentacles, which will probably be your biggest source of damage output while\n\t\tyour Phantom is confined.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incorporeal Bonded Manifestation<\/span>: This\n\t\tis the sneaky option. Use it to sneak around and avoid notice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spiritual Interference<\/span> (Ex or Su): The\n\tshield bonus won&#8217;t stack with your Darkwood Shield, but circumstance bonuses\n\tto saving throws are rare, which means that they&#8217;ll stack with just about\n\tanything you already have. Ectoplasmic clearly has the better option here.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Undead<\/span> (Sp): You could cast this as a\n\tspell at level 1.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantom Recall<\/span> (Su): Your phantom will\n\talmost never be more than 50 feet away, but if your phantom is about to die\n\tand you need to run away, this could be helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Calm Spirit<\/span> (Sp): You could cast this as a\n\tspell at level 4.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">See Invisibility<\/span> (Sp): You could cast this as\n\ta spell at level 4.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fused Consciousness<\/span> (Su): Most of the\n\tbenefits of keeping your Phantom confined without actually confining it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spiritual Interference<\/span> (Ex or Su):\n\tAn excellent improvement to Spiritual Interference, but don&#8217;t expect your\n\tallies to follow your spirit around just to keep the bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spiritual Bond<\/span> (Su): Until now you&#8217;ve been\n\tsacrificing hit points to keep your Phantom alive. Suddenly the Phantom can do\n\tsomething similar.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Call Spirit<\/span> (Sp): You could cast this as a\n\tspell at level 13.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dual Bond<\/span> (Su): The name doesn&#8217;t make\n\tsense, and Bonded Manifestation is mediocre at best.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Empowered Consciousness<\/span> (Su): This is a\n\treally disappointing capstone. There aren&#8217;t enough mind-affecting effects\n\twhich involve possession to make this meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Spiritualists are primarily dedicated to supporting this Phantom, so their ability scores should be built around that capacity<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump it to 7 and get a crossbow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: In light armor with d8 hit dice you\n\treally need a bit of AC. Your best weapon option is probably a crossbow, so a\n\tbit of Dexterity helps there, too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Con<\/span>: Your Phantom is going to be doing most\n\tof your fighting, and while it gets d10 hit dice it only gets 15 hit dice over\n\t20 Spiritualist levels. Expect to spend a lot of your own hit points to\n\tprotect your Phantom via Etheric Tether. With only d8 hit dice, you don&#8217;t have\n\ta huge pool of hit points on your own, so improving your Constitution is\n\timportant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Nice for skill ranks and to\n\tcomplement your Knowledge skills, but you don&#8217;t need it for much else.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Wisdom is the Spiritualist&#8217;s\n\tspellcasting ability, but they&#8217;re only 2\/3 spellcasters, so you never strictly\n\tneed more than 16.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump to 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 16<\/li>\n<li>Int: 13<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 16<\/li>\n<li>Int: 11<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 11<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of race matters surprisingly little.

Fairly few classes get access to\n\t\tthis, so you need to step up here.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Dungeoneering)<\/span> (Int): Identify\n\t\taberrations and oozes.

Unless you have a druid or ranger, you may be the only one in the\n\t\tparty with this skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (Nobility)<\/span> (Int): Situational,\n\t\tand very dependent on the campaign.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Planes)<\/span> (Int): Identify\n\t\toutsiders. Outsiders are diverse and strange, and knowing stuff about them\n\t\twill help your survival greatly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Religion)<\/span> (Int): Identify\n\t\tundead. More easily available than Knowledge (Arcana), but still very\n\t\tuseful, especially since your cleric probably dumped intelligence.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Linguistics<\/span> (Int): Cast tongues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): You&#8217;re Wisdom-based,\n\t\tso this is a great way to support your party&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Craft items and identify\n\t\tspells and magic effects.

Extra AC is a good idea, and it will help you to do something\n\t\tuseful for your party by walking into melee to draw attention.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Distant Delivery<\/span>: Etheric Tether limits\n\t\tyour Phantom to a 50 ft. radius around you, but they need to move within 30\n\t\tft. for you to deliver touch spells. This is a minor inconvenience, but if\n\t\tyou really enjoy delivering touch spells you may want this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Focused Phantom<\/span>: Worse than Skill Focus,\n\t\twhich is actually impressive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantom Fighter<\/span>: Ghost Touch means that\n\t\tyour phantom can attack incorporeal enemies unimpeded, but the text of\n\t\tIncorporeal Form reads &#8220;an incorporeal phantom can\u2019t attack corporeal\n\t\tcreatures, except to deliver touch-attack spells using the deliver touch\n\t\tspell ability&#8221; so your phantom can&#8217;t abuse this to attack while\n\t\tincorporeal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantom Fortification<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shared Soul<\/span>: Keeping your phantom\n\t\tconfined is usually a terrible idea, and spending feats to improve it is\n\t\texpensive and ineffective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spiritualist&#8217;s Call<\/span>: Your Phantom really\n\t\tneeds the bonuses, but the 10-minute duration is annoying. Expect to confine\n\t\tthen re-manifest your Phantom between fights to keep this running.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toughness<\/span>: Etheric Tether allows the\n\t\tSpiritualist to use their own hit points to reduce damage dealt to their\n\t\tPhantom, so extending your own pool of hit points is a direct improvement to\n\t\tyour Phantom. Because you get more hit dice than your Phantom, it&#8217;s better\n\t\tfor you to take Toughness than for your Phantom to take it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vigilant Phantom<\/span>: Marginally better than\n\t\tSkill Focus while your Phantom is handy, but I would probably stick to Skill\n\t\tFocus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of weapon largely comes down to how you want to keep yourself busy while your Phantom is doing something important.
