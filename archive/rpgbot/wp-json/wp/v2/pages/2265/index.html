The\nSwashbuckler attempts to be a charismatic Fighter with a sense of Panache, but\ncomes out as a lightly armored Fighter with less feats. Swashbuckler can be a\ngreat class dip for weapon finesse builds, but single-class Swashbucklers are\ndismally ineffective.

Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Swashbuckler Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 hit points is standard for a\nmelee class.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Full BAB.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Fortitude is the Swashbuckler&#8217;s only\ngood save, but Grace and a dependence on Dexterity will help with the\nSwashbuckler&#8217;s Reflex saves.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Martial weapons and light\narmor, but no shields. None of the Swashbuckler&#8217;s class features require that\nyou don&#8217;t use a shield, so you can use a masterwork buckler or a bigger shield\nif you pick up shield proficiency.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill ranks is better than a\nFighter, and Swashbucklers get every social skill except Intimidate, which\nallows you to be a Face as long as you&#8217;re not trying to intimidate people.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Finesse<\/span> (Ex): A good reason for finesse\nfighters to take a single level dip into Swashbuckler. Largely defines the play\nstyle of the class.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Grace<\/span> (Ex): The bonus is puny, but it helps\nmake the Swashbuckler&#8217;s Reflex saves decent.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Insightful Strike<\/span> (Ex): This is a cool idea,\nbut the actual damage bonus will generally be pretty small, especially compared\nto things like Power Attack.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Dodge Bonus<\/span> (Ex): This would be great if it\nwere a flat Dodge bonus to AC, but instead it only applies to melee attacks from\none enemy at a time.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Acrobatic Charge<\/span> (Ex): Very situational, and\nyou can jump over difficult terrain as part of a charge.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Flanking<\/span> (Ex): Fairly useless unless\nyou have Daring Outlaw and can capitalize on Sneak Attack.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Lucky<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are great at any level,\nbut a Cleric can do this at first level. Save this for save or suck effects.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Acrobatic Skill Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Nice if you\ntake Leap Attack, but generally not useful.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Weakening Critical<\/span> (Ex): Strength damage is\nnice at any level, especially against weaker creatures. Combine this with ambush\nfeats and you can put out quite a bit of ability damage.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Slippery Mind<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are great, but this\nonly affects on school of magic, making it very situational.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Wounding Critical<\/span> (Ex): Constitution damage is\nalways nice, but there are much better ways to do it, including ambush feats.\n<h3 id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Stunt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially a nice way to add some cool utility abilities, but replacing\n\t\tGrace means that you can&#8217;t take Daring Outlaw. If your DM is really nice,\n\t\tthey might let you advance this in place of Grace with Daring Outlaw. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re dipping into Swashbuckler for one level, this is basically free.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield of Blades<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: The AC bonus is one higher than the Dodge bonus, and it works against\n\t\teverything instead of just melee attacks from one target. If you&#8217;re using\n\t\tTwo-Weapon Fighting, this is a good option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swift and Deadly<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DotU<\/a><\/sup>: I can&#8217;t really think of a situation in which to use this, but it&#8217;s no\n\t\tworse than Acrobatic Charge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Swashbuckler&#8217;s abilities look like a finesse Fighter. Dexterity is crucial, but everything else is largely secondary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Take 13 for Power Attack, but you don&#8217;t\nneed any more. The Swashbuckler can&#8217;t afford a ton of Strength for damage, so we\nneed to get it from somewhere else. Take 15 if you plan to be permanently\nreduced.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: The Swashbuckler&#8217;s primary ability.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are crucial for hit points.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: 4 skill ranks is plenty to get all of\nthe Swashbuckler&#8217;s good skills, but Precise Strike allows you to apply\nIntelligence to Damage. If you have extra skill ranks, pick up Spot and Search\nas cross-class skills. You will likely want 13 so that you qualify for Combat\nExpertise.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: A bit of Wisdom for saves is nice, but\nyou don&#8217;t need much.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Despite the theme of the class, the\nSwashbuckler doesn&#8217;t strictly <em>need<\/em> Charisma. Take a bit if you plan to\nplay a Face, but otherwise you can dump it.\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity bonuses are crucial. If you&#8217;re going for a Defender build, you may want to be medium so that you can be Enlarged, but the Dexterity penalty makes that unappealing. Being Medium is still nice if you want to be Reduced, but it&#8217;s hardly necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarf<\/span>: Doesn&#8217;t really fit the theme of the\nclass, and doesn&#8217;t really offer anything specifically useful.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: The Dexterity bonus works, and the Elf&#8217;s\nother class features can be nice, but be careful with the Constitution penalty.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: Nothing useful for the Swashbuckler.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Awful.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The only really interesting thing\noffered by the Half-Orc is Darkvision.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: The Dexterity bonus is great, and\nthe Strength penalty is easily overcome, but the Halfling&#8217;s affinity for Stealth\nis wasted on the Swashbuckler.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Bonus feat and bonus skill rank.\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Balance<\/span> (Dex): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Helpful for a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): Essential for a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Escape Artist<\/span> (Dex): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jump<\/span> (Str): Situational, but essential\n\t\tif you go for Leap Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Helpful if you plan\n\t\tto play the Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swim<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tumble<\/span> (Dex): Situational.

A Swashbuckler\n\t\twithout Daring Outlaw is either a class dip or a bad idea. It requires three\n\t\tlevels of Rogue (or a level of Rogue and a level of something else), which\n\t\talso brings Trapfinding, Evasion, and the option of several interesting\n\t\tclass features.

Your DM may be nice enough\n\t\tto let you get a +2 belt instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gloves of Dexterity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Dexterity is the Swashbuckler&#8217;s primary ability. Get these early.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ioun Stone (Dusty Rose)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: At only 5000gp, a Dusty Rose Ioun Stone provides a cheaper boost to AC\n\t\tthan upgrading your Ring of Protection from +1 to +2. The bonus is an\n\t\tinsight bonus, which makes it easy to stack because insight bonuses to AC\n\t\tare extremely rare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shirt of Demonskin\/The Fey\/The Inevitable\/Ironskin\/The Moon\/Slaadskin\/The\n\t\t\tTreant<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: DR 3\/something for 15,000 gp. Expensive, but it&#8217;s a great way to get DR.\n\t\tAbsolutely <em>do not<\/em> get a Shirt of Resilience. By the time you can\n\t\tafford this nearly everything you meet can bypass DR\/magic. DR\/adamantine is\n\t\tmy favorite because only things like Iron Golems can bypass it without an\n\t\tadamantine weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot. A\n\t\tstrictly better choice than a Cloak of Resistance, unless you plan to buy a\n\t\tShirt of X for DR.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Essential for Defender builds, large size gets you constant reach.\n\t\tCoupled with a spiked chain, you get a total of 15 foot reach, allowing you\n\t\tto dominate huge portions of the battlefield. The penalty to Dexterity cuts\n\t\tinto your attacks of opportunity and attack bonus, and you lose a total of 2\n\t\tto your AC, which can be problematic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reduce Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re medium you can reduce yourself for an easy +2 to Dexterity, but\n\t\tremember that it may prevent you from using Power Attack because of the -2\n\t\tpenalty to Strength, so pick up a Strength-boosting item to offset the\n\t\tpenalty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">See invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With no built-in way to handle invisible creatures, the ability to always\n\t\tsee them is a fantastic benefit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Barbarian<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A single level can get you Pounce and Rage, both of which can be\n\t\textremely helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great source of bonus feats without cutting into your BAB. Don&#8217;t bother\n\t\twith Daring Warrior. The Hit-and-Run Tactics<sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DotU<\/a><\/sup>\n\t\tACF works particularly well when combined with Daring Outlaw.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Daring Outlaw is basically required.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Swordsage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: One level gets you a +2 to both of the Swashbuckler&#8217;s bad saves,\n\t\tmaneuvers, and a stance. Because the Shadow Hand school is available to\n\t\tSwordsages (and only Swordsages), you can take the Martial Stance feat to\n\t\tget Assassin&#8217;s Stance, which grants you Sneak Attack and might qualify you\n\t\tfor Daring Outlaw. A second level allows you to add Wisdom to your AC, but\n\t\tthe Swashbuckler really doesn&#8217;t need more MAD, so one level is fine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warblade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: One level gives you maneuvers and stances, Int to reflex saves (which\n\t\twill stack with Grace since it\u2019s an Insight bonus), and the ability to\n\t\tretrain weapon-specific feats like Weapon Focus to use another weapon.\n\t\tManeuvers are useful, but Swordsage&#8217;s access to the Shadow Hand style is a\n\t\tbetter option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 3.5
