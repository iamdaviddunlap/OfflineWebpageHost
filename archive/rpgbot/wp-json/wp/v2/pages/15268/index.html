These Amps are unique to each Conscious Mind, making them an iconic and unique capability. Combined with the granted spells, your Conscious Mind does a lot to define your role within your party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The cantrip options granted by your Conscious Mind are among the most\n\timportant parts of building your Psychic. You get 3 Amp-able cantrips at level\n\t1 and add another at levels 6 and 10 for a total of 5 cantrips in addition to\n\tthe 3 regular cantrips granted by the Psychic&#8217;s spellcasting. You need to have\n\ta good understanding of your Amp-able cantrips because they&#8217;re your go-to\n\toption in combat, much like a fighter swinging a weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the use of cantrips and Amps is so central to the Psychic&#8217;s\n\tcapabilities in combat, a Conscious Mind with poor cantrip options is\n\tdifficult to play effectively. You can fall back on leveled spells, but with\n\tfewer spell slots than comparable spellcasters, you&#8217;re more reliant on\n\tcantrips, so your cantrips <em>really<\/em> need to work for you. Your\n\tConscious Mind&#8217;s cantrips don&#8217;t all need to be direct attack options, but you\n\tneed something reliable and repeatable to use in combat, so you may need to\n\tfill in the gaps with your 3 regular cantrips if your choice of Conscious Mind\n\tdoesn&#8217;t do the trick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the cantrips, the leveled spells granted by your Conscious Mind are\n\tfrequently taken from other spell lists. This offers access to some great\n\toptions which aren&#8217;t typically available to Occult spellcasters.

The spells all involved moving stuff,\n\tsometimes in a way that&#8217;s useful in utility terms, but usually in a way that\n\tinvolves damage. This is nice combination of Blaster, Controller, and Striker.\n\tThe added spells give you options for a variety of combat situations, and\n\toptions like Mage Hand, Fly, and Telekinetic Haul offer some useful\n\tutility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Spells<\/span>: Mostly good options, but\n\t\tfew truly amazing ones. None of the spells have benefits for heightening\n\t\tthem until you get to Poltergeist&#8217;s Fury, which isn&#8217;t a problem, but it is\n\t\tunusual. Expect to pick Signature Spells from your regular set of spells\n\t\tknown.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Kinetic Ram<\/span>: A great way to forcibly\n\t\t\t\treposition your enemies, especially with a possible 1-Action casting\n\t\t\t\ttime. 10 feet of movement is plenty to force enemies out of melee reach,\n\t\t\t\tto break grapples, or to push an enemy into a hazard like a pit or a\n\t\t\t\ttrap. You won&#8217;t use this constantly, but it&#8217;s great to have in your back\n\t\t\t\tpocket. Unfortunately, at level 1 it&#8217;s not a great use of your\n\t\t\t\tincredibly small number of spell slots, and it competes for space with\n\t\t\t\tAmped Mage Hand, which can repeatedly Push the target. This is great if\n\t\t\t\tyou just need one quick push, but if you need to repeatedly reposition\n\t\t\t\tthe target (maybe it really likes to grapple), go for Amped Mage\n\t\t\t\tHand.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Maneuver<\/span>: If you need to\n\t\t\t\tShove, Kinetic Ram will do the job better for lower cost. Disarm is only\n\t\t\t\toccasionally useful, and you can do it with Amped Mage Hand. That just\n\t\t\t\tleaves Trip, and you&#8217;re spending 2 Actions and a 2nd-level spell slot to\n\t\t\t\tcost the target 1 Action. Unless making them Prone is going to be hugely\n\t\t\t\timpactful, this isn&#8217;t worth the slot.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Levitate<\/span>: Low-budget almost flight.\n\t\t\t\tIt&#8217;ll get your target off the ground and potentially out of melee reach\n\t\t\t\twithout eating an action every turn like flying does, but the attack\n\t\t\t\tpenalty is rough, so try to rely on stuff that allows saving throws\n\t\t\t\twhile you&#8217;re floating around. You&#8217;ll also run into issues with range:\n\t\t\t\tsince you can&#8217;t reposition horizontally without crawling (which is slow\n\t\t\t\tand requires a suitable surface), enemies can move out of range and\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re left floating around like a magical party balloon unless you\n\t\t\t\tspend Actions to get back to the ground and crawl back into range.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fly<\/span>: Powerful and versatile, but also\n\t\t\t\tcostly. You want to not need this, but it&#8217;s a massive tactical advantage\n\t\t\t\tover enemies which can&#8217;t fly and can&#8217;t attack at range. Remember that\n\t\t\t\tyou need to spend an Action to Fly each turn or you fall, so if you need\n\t\t\t\tmore Actions you may need to land temporarily.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Haul<\/span>: Only situationally\n\t\t\t\tuseful, but 80 Bulk is a lot of Bulk. For comparison: Gargantuan\n\t\t\t\tcreature is only 48 Bulk, so you&#8217;re lifting something up to 20x20x20 and\n\t\t\t\timmensely heavy. Maybe you can lift a small bulding and drop it on\n\t\t\t\tsomeone.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Poltergeist&#8217;s Fury<\/span>: Decent damage in\n\t\t\t\tprolonged fights with multiple enemies, and your allies have a bit of\n\t\t\t\thelp on the Reflex save. It&#8217;s still best to avoid catching your allies\n\t\t\t\tin the area, but in enclosed spaces where your enemies can&#8217;t easily\n\t\t\t\tretreat, this can be very impactful. However, if your allies have poor\n\t\t\t\tReflex saves you&#8217;re going to make your whole party angry because they\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t escape either. In large, open areas where enemies can simply run\n\t\t\t\taway, this won&#8217;t be impactful. Consider combining this with Fly so that\n\t\t\t\tyou can remain safely in the air above your enemies while you wear them\n\t\t\t\tdown.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Bombardment<\/span>: Decent\n\t\t\t\tdamage, matching a Fireball heightened to the same level, though the\n\t\t\t\tarea is considerably smaller. In exchange, you might knock enemies prone\n\t\t\t\tand potentially stun them, as well as leaving difficult terrain in the\n\t\t\t\tarea of effect. A good combination of damage and crowd control. There&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tno clear explanation of what happens to the projectile or what state it\n\t\t\t\tmust be in, so depending on how your GM interprets this you may be able\n\t\t\t\tto damage nearby structures and terrain (throw sheds, uproot trees,\n\t\t\t\tetc.) in addition to the explicit effects of the spell.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Falling Sky<\/span>: At this level, flying\n\t\t\t\tenemies are common. This is a great countermeasure. Flying enemies are\n\t\t\t\tmoved downward and take the falling damage automatically, so even if\n\t\t\t\tthey pass the save you still get the consolation prize of a bunch of\n\t\t\t\tdamage and forcing enemies closer to the ground. You want targets to\n\t\t\t\tmove through as much of the column as possible because they take double\n\t\t\t\tnormal faling damage, so try to place the column with your enemies at or\n\t\t\t\tnear the top. Enemies that <em>succeed<\/em> on the save still fall\n\t\t\t\tprone, so if the 60-foot column isn&#8217;t big enough to get them to the\n\t\t\t\tground, gravity might do the rest.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The wording of the Critical Success effect is confusing. &#8220;The\n\t\t\t\t\tcreature is unaffected&#8221; should mean that they don&#8217;t take the damage,\n\t\t\t\t\teither, but the rest of the sentence indicates that they do. I think\n\t\t\t\t\tthe intent is that they still move and take damage, but there&#8217;s no\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther effect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Implosion<\/span>: Decent single-target\n\t\t\t\tdamage and you can repeat is against other targets on future turns, but\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s only damage and against crowds you typically want something that\n\t\t\t\twill work fast to cut through the horde.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Standard Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mage Hand<\/span>: Great utility. If you need\n\t\t\t\tto Shove, Telekinetic Projectile may be more reliable. Many creatures&#8217;\n\t\t\t\tFortitude DCs will be higher than their AC, and you&#8217;re rolling with your\n\t\t\t\tSpell Attack Modifier either way.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Telekinetic Projectile<\/span>: Good\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target damage with good scaling. Amping it increases the damage,\n\t\t\t\twhich a great use for your Focus Points at least until you get Dancing\n\t\t\t\tBlade. You&#8217;ll have trouble matching Telekinetic Projectile&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target damage output even with leveled spells.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Surface: Telekinetic Rend<\/span>: Decent\n\t\t\t\tdamage in two small AOEs, allowing you to target several enemies easily.\n\t\t\t\tThe damage scales reasonably well, and couple with the damage boost from\n\t\t\t\tAwaken Psyche and potentially an Amp, this can do a lot of damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deeper: Vector Screen<\/span>: Only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful. I wouldn&#8217;t consider this a consitently useful\n\t\t\t\toption until it&#8217;s heightened to 6th level and affecs more than\n\t\t\t\tprojectiles.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deepest: Dancing Blade<\/span>: Good,\n\t\t\t\tconsistent damage. You don&#8217;t need to magically enhance your weapon,\n\t\t\t\teither, but special materials might help against some enemies. Amping\n\t\t\t\tthis is very efficient because the spell lasts up to a minute, so you\n\t\t\t\tcan repeatedly benefit.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-infinite-eye\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ConsciousMinds.aspx?ID=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Infinite Eye<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Focused on divination, the Infinite Eye is a Scout and Support caster. The\n\tonly directly offensive option in the whole subclass is Organ Sight, which is\n\ta lot like a fish with a bicycle (good tool, but no way to use it). In combat,\n\tyou&#8217;re reliant on buffing and supporting your allies. You can get offensive\n\toptions from your regular spellcasting, but the Psychic relies heavily on\n\tcantrips, and without an offensive cantrip from your Subconscious Mind you&#8217;re\n\tnot well suited to blasting stuff. Consider direct damage a secondary function\n\tin combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of combat, use your magical abilities to gather knowledge and plan\n\tahead. If you take a Subconscious Mind which makes Intelligence your Key\n\tAbility Score, you&#8217;re well-suited to knowledge skills like Arcana and\n\tOccultism, so you can double down on knowing things ahead of time to put your\n\tparty at an advantage over any threats you might face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Spells<\/span>: A good mix of iconic\n\t\tdivination options. They&#8217;re primarily support and utility options, so don&#8217;t\n\t\texpect to find any damage output here. Not all of the options are great, but\n\t\tyou get some wonderful staples like Augury and Prying Eye.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">True Strike<\/span>: Only benefits you, and\n\t\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t have any great built-in attack options. If you want to get any\n\t\t\t\tuse out of this, look for leveled single-target attack spells which take\n\t\t\t\t2 Actions to cast. Unfortunately, the Occult spell list doesn&#8217;t have\n\t\t\t\tmany.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Augury<\/span>: This is one of my favorite\n\t\t\t\tdivination spells, and has been since 3rd edition DnD. While it&#8217;s not\n\t\t\t\tterribly precise, it&#8217;s often enough to get a party unstuck when\n\t\t\t\t\u201canalysis paralysis\u201d sets in. If your party can&#8217;t decide what to do,\n\t\t\t\tcast Augury and try to get some hints. Unfortunately, the flat check\n\t\t\t\tmeans that it&#8217;s only 75% accurate, so be cautious whenever you receive a\n\t\t\t\tresult of \u201cNone\u201d.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Organsight<\/span>: A great spell for\n\t\t\t\tsomeone with good options for dealing piercing\/slashing damage and a\n\t\t\t\tgood Medicine bonus. You can pair this with Telekinetic Projectile for\n\t\t\t\trepeatable damage output, but spending 3 Actions every turn on this\n\t\t\t\tcombo leaves you no room for anything else.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clairvoyance<\/span>: Excellent for scouting\n\t\t\t\tpotentially dangerous areas, but it&#8217;s immobile and expensive. Use this\n\t\t\t\twhen you can&#8217;t scout by any other means. You only get 2 spell slots per\n\t\t\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prying Eye<\/span>: Extremely useful for\n\t\t\t\tscouting. Provided that the eye isn&#8217;t spotted by a creature that can see\n\t\t\t\tinvisibile things or accidentally destroyed (falling debris, traps,\n\t\t\t\tetc.), the duration is as long as you care to Sustain the Spell. With no\n\t\t\t\tcap on range from the caster, a patient caster could use this to scout\n\t\t\t\thuge areas before risking going anywhere near them. With this spell in\n\t\t\t\thand, there&#8217;s little excuse for walking into an area without a good idea\n\t\t\t\tof what&#8217;s already there. Of course, it can&#8217;t go through solid objects\n\t\t\t\tand most keyholes are smaller than an inch, so a enclosed structures may\n\t\t\t\tbe more difficult to scout.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">True Seeing<\/span>: Powerful, but with a\n\t\t\t\t10-minute duration you can&#8217;t afford to keep it running constantly, so\n\t\t\t\tyou still need to have some idea of when to switch this on.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">True Target<\/span>: True Strike, but for\n\t\t\t\tfour creatures of your choice against one target of your choice. The\n\t\t\t\tbenefits are good, but unless your allies are going to make big singular\n\t\t\t\tattacks (spells, etc.), the benefits won&#8217;t be impressive compared to\n\t\t\t\twhat you could do with a 7th-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unrelenting Observation<\/span>: Far too\n\t\t\t\tsituational. If you need to handle invisible creatures, there are\n\t\t\t\tbetter, lower-level options like True Seeing. If you need to track a\n\t\t\t\tcreature, consider Scrying or follow them around with Prying Eye.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blur\">Foresight<\/span>: A spectacular buff with a\n\t\t\t\t1-hour duration. Put this on your party&#8217;s Defender before a big\n\t\t\t\tfight.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Standard Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Detect Magic<\/span>: Detect Magic is a\n\t\t\t\tcrucial option in any party. The Amp option is helpful against\n\t\t\t\tspellcasters, but I wouldn&#8217;t gamble it unless you&#8217;re certain that you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tfacing spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guidance<\/span>: Guidance is already a\n\t\t\t\twonderful buff for important rolls, but using it as a Reaction means\n\t\t\t\tthat you can rescue allies from failed saves. Increasing the bonus at\n\t\t\t\thigh levels makes this even better. Never again fear failing by 1.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Surface: Glimpse Weakness<\/span>: The damage\n\t\t\t\tbonus is tiny, but this damage is essentially guaranteed, so it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\ttempting despite the low amount. A good way to spend leftover Actions.\n\t\t\t\tThe damage calculation if you Amp this is unimpressive, so it&#8217;s not\nworth your Focus Point if you have anything else interesting to spend it on.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deeper: Omnidirectional Scan<\/span>: One\n\t\t\t\tAction and your Reaction to both Seek in a 30-foot emanation and then\n\t\t\t\tAid one pre-selected ally on an attack against one pre-selected enemy.\n\t\t\t\tSeek and readying to Aid for one Action is good, but your Perception\n\t\t\t\tprogression is poor. It&#8217;s fine, but between this and Glimpse Weekness,\n\t\t\t\tGlimpse Weakness is a better combat buff unless you&#8217;re facing hidden\n\t\t\t\tenemies. The Amp effect is fine, but it&#8217;s only until the beginning of\n\t\t\t\tyour next turn, and it won&#8217;t stack with similar and less expensive buffs\n\t\t\t\tlike Bless.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deepest: Foresee the Path<\/span>: This\n\t\t\t\tessentially allows you to give an ally the Attack of Opportunity\n\t\t\t\tReaction against a single enemy. Only useful if you have multiple allies\n\t\t\t\tin the party who are built for melee but can&#8217;t get Attack of Opportunity\n\t\t\t\tor another way to use their Reaction.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-oscillating-wave\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ConsciousMinds.aspx?ID=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Oscillating Wave<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A Blaster\/Striker, plain and simple. Psychics are great at damage output\n\tthanks to Unleash Psyche, and if you want to double down on that capability,\n\tOscillating Wave is a great choice. It lacks any utility options to use\n\toutside of combat, so try to fill those gaps with skills and with your other\n\tspells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conservation of Energy<\/strong>: The wording on this ability appears\n\tto be broken. I believe the intent is that your cantrips and granted spells\n\tmust alternate between adding\/removing energy, but RAW you could choose to\n\tremove energy when you cast your first applicable spell and be perpetually\n\tstuck in &#8220;removing energy&#8221; mode. Similarly, RAW you can pick &#8220;adding energy&#8221;,\n\tcast one fire spell, then be stuck in &#8220;removing energy&#8221; for the rest of the\n\tencounter. I&#8217;m going to assume that the intent is to go back and forth every\n\ttime you cast an appopriate spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pathfinder Society rules clarify that Conservation of Energy applies to\n\tthe granted leveled spells, Produce Flame, and Ray of Frost, but not to the\n\tUnique Psi Cantrips. Oddly, it doesn&#8217;t clarify that Conservation of Energy is\n\tactually supposed to oscillate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that rules oddity out of the way, Conservation of Energy is how you\n\t&#8220;oscillate&#8221; between cold damage and fire damage. Unless your target has\n\tresistances\/immunities\/vulnarabilities to cold or fire, this is mostly\n\tcosmetic. In addition, you can alter things with the Mindshift trait (Psi\n\tBurst, Cranial Explosion, etc.) to deal cold or fire damage on a Reflex Save\n\tinstead of whatever they do normally. Most of these abilities deal bludgeoning\n\tdamage on a Reflex Save, so changing to energy damage might get you around\n\tdamage resistances\/immunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Spells<\/span>: You get several of the\n\t\tmost important and iconic fire\/ice spells, but some of those spells are\n\t\teither outright bad or just bad for the Psychic.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Burning Hands<\/span>: Awful damage, small AOE,\n\t\t\t\tshort range. Psychics don&#8217;t get Electric Jolt, which is the best direct\n\t\t\t\tcomparison, but the fact that there are cantrips which are outright\n\t\t\t\tbetter than this tell you why it&#8217;s bad.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heat Metal<\/span>: Useful against metal\n\t\t\t\tenemies and enemies in metal armor, but those are a a small subsection\n\t\t\t\tof the creatures which you&#8217;ll face in your career, so this won&#8217;t see\n\t\t\t\tmuch use. The effects are good when this does make sense to use.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fireball<\/span>: In a game full of nails,\n\t\t\t\tFireball is a hammer. Good AOE, good damage, good scaling. Strongly\n\t\t\t\tconsider making this a Signature Spell.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fire Shield<\/span>: The Psychic should never\n\t\t\t\tbe in melee enough to need this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cone of Cold<\/span>: 2d6 more damage than a\n\t\t\t\tFireball cast at the same spell level, and the same scaling as Fireball\n\t\t\t\tso it remains more damaging if you heighten either. The 60-foot cone is\n\t\t\t\tgreat, but still not as easy to use as Fireball, not to mention\n\t\t\t\tFireball&#8217;s 500-foot range. Cone of Cold is fine, but Fireball is still\n\t\t\t\tbetter in most situations.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Vortex<\/span>: Smilar to Flaming Sphere,\n\t\t\t\texcept it&#8217;s tall, doesn&#8217;t need to stay on the ground, and also does\n\t\t\t\tbludgeoning damage. The Action cost is high, and you don&#8217;t get to move\n\t\t\t\tit immediately upon casting, so you&#8217;re affecting a vertical column of\n\t\t\t\tsquares (I&#8217;m told that these are called &#8220;cubes&#8221;) with a single 5-foot\n\t\t\t\tsquare at the base. The odds of catching multiple enemies in that area\n\t\t\t\tare nearly non-existant, so try to hit one at least. The hope is that on\n\t\t\t\tfuture turns you can Sustain the Spell to move it in a straight line and\n\t\t\t\tstrike multiple foes. But without the ability to turn and only 20 feet\n\t\t\t\tof movement per Action, you likely need to spend multiple Actions to\n\t\t\t\tcatch multiple foes, and even when you do the damage isn&#8217;t impressive.\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is simply not a good spell. The area is too small, the\n\t\t\t\t\trequirement that you have sufficient vertical space prevents it from\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing use in the only situations where this would be effective, the\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage is too poor, and it moves too slowly and too rigidly to apply\n\t\t\t\t\tthe damage multiple times. For two Actions and 3rd-level spell slot,\n\t\t\t\t\tyou can cast Fireball, which does more damage than a single hit from\n\t\t\t\t\tFlame Vortex, and you can almost certainly hit more targets in the\n\t\t\t\t\tinitial burst than you could hit in the first two turns of Flame\n\t\t\t\t\tVortex.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiery Body<\/span>: For one minute, turn\n\t\t\t\tyourself into a flying machine gun. Reducing Produce Flame to a single\n\t\t\t\tAction and boosting its damage by a single die means that you can use it\n\t\t\t\tas many as three times per turn. With the boosted damage, that&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\textremely appealing, especially since it presents no additional cost\n\t\t\t\tbeyond casting Fiery Body. However, Multiple Attack Penalty becomes a\n\t\t\t\tproblem (unusual for most spellcasters) so you may want to use Produce\n\t\t\t\tFlame alongside spells which call for saving throws like Fireball. Try\n\t\t\t\tto hit multiple targets if possible to maximize the benefit of the\n\t\t\t\tadditional damage die, and avoid flying unless you need that tactical\n\t\t\t\tadvantage becuase you still need to spend an Action to fly, which cuts\n\t\t\t\tinto your Produce Flame spam.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The ability to cast Produce Flame as an Innate Spell is a little bit\n\t\t\t\t\todd, and the wording isn&#8217;t super clear. By default, an innate spell is\n\t\t\t\t\tcast using Charisma, so if you&#8217;re Intelligence-based, the Innate Spell\n\t\t\t\t\tisn&#8217;t as effective. But maybe you&#8217;re intended to use the same\n\t\t\t\t\tspellcasting ability as whatever you used to cast Fiery Body? I&#8217;m\n\t\t\t\t\thonestly not sure. It also doesn&#8217;t specify a tradition, so I assume\n\t\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s supposed to be the same as you&#8217;re using when you cast Fiery\n\t\t\t\t\tBody.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>This has some odd interactions with Conservation of Energy. When you\n\t\t\t\t\tcast this it will be either fire or cold, and the resistances and\n\t\t\t\t\tvulnerabilities to fire\/cold will be the opposite. What happens to the\n\t\t\t\t\tvulnerability to water? I have no idea. When you go to spam Produce\n\t\t\t\t\tFlame (it&#8217;s 1 Action <em>and<\/em> does an extra die of damage!),\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re going to alternate between fire and cold damage. So either\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re a flying ice sculpture or some sort of humanoid torch and\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re shooting alternating balls of fire and light-producing ice. The\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage boost only applies to spells which match the element you used\n\t\t\t\t\twhen you cast Fiery Body, so you can use Produce Flame to oscillate,\n\t\t\t\t\tthen cast leveled spells using the matching damage type.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>And don&#8217;t forget: Unleash Psyche&#8217;s damage boost applies to each\n\t\t\t\t\tcasting of Produce Flame, so you&#8217;re dropping a massive amount of\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage per shot.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Polar Ray<\/span>: Good single-target damage\n\t\t\t\ton an attack roll, and Drained 2 adds a bunch more. It&#8217;s all-or-nothing,\n\t\t\t\tso give yourself every advantage possible before you cast this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Meteor Swarm<\/span>: Fireball&#8217;s cool older\n\t\t\t\tbrother. The AOE is massive, the range is huge, and the ability to drop\n\t\t\t\tfour AOEs means you can obliterate several things far apart from each\n\t\t\t\tother, ideally placing the areas so that your allies aren&#8217;t affected. If\n\t\t\t\tall you need is damage, it&#8217;s hard to find a better option.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Standard Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Produce Flame<\/span>: Simple,\n\t\t\t\tstriaghtforward damage with good persistent damage on a crit. Don&#8217;t use\n\t\t\t\tthis in melee. The larger damage like look nice, but you have no armor\n\t\t\t\tand 6+ hit points. Don&#8217;t get dumb.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ray of Frost<\/span>: Decent damage,\n\t\t\t\texcellent range.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Surface: Thermal Stasis<\/span>: Decent\n\t\t\t\tresistance, but don&#8217;t let this eat your Actions. If you need this, spend\n\t\t\t\tthe Focus Point to Amp it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deeper: Entropic Wheel<\/span>: Effectively a\n\t\t\t\tscaling damage bonus that accumulates over the course of combat. At low\n\t\t\t\tlevels you don&#8217;t need to Amp this because your maximum number of motes\n\t\t\t\tis low, but as you gain levels you may want to Amp this for longer\n\t\t\t\tencounters.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deepest: Redistribute Potential<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\tDecent damage, but the positioning rarely works. Amping this to increase\n\t\t\t\tthe area makes it much easier and the damage is comparable to spells\n\t\t\t\tlike Fireball.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-silent-whisper\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ConsciousMinds.aspx?ID=4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Silent Whisper<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Silent Whisper&#8217;s cantrips are complicated. You need to need to be very\n\tprecise about how and when you use them, and in many cases each cantrip will\n\tonly work once per encounter so you&#8217;ll need to have other options ready in\n\tcombat. And, unfortunately, the granted spells don&#8217;t help much. You&#8217;ll\n\tfrequently find yourself looking at the options granted by Silent Whisper and\n\tthinking &#8220;I&#8217;ve used the good ones and now everything is immune to them&#8221; and\n\tthen resort to your regular spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silent Whisper attempts to add a bunch of Utility to your capabilities, but\n\tit&#8217;s limited by the difficult, situational nature of many of the granted\n\tspells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Granted Spells<\/span>: A small oddity: Silent\n\t\tWhisper gets two 5th-level spells and no 6th-level spells. Beyond that\n\t\toddity, the options here aren&#8217;t amazing. They&#8217;re very thematic, but there\n\t\tare several options which you might go your whole career without using once.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Mindlink<\/span>: Absurdly situational. If you\n\t\t\t\tneed to tell someone something that&#8217;s going to take 10 minutes, either\n\t\t\t\tyour GM is intentionally saying &#8220;I need this to take place over several\n\t\t\t\tminutes&#8221; for some reason, or you&#8217;re going to say &#8220;I explain the thing&#8221;\n\t\t\t\tand your GM says &#8220;Great. 10 minutes later, they know the thing.&#8221;<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Touch of Idiocy<\/span>: Stupefied in any\n\t\t\t\tamount is a powerful debuff against spellcasters, but the Touch range is\n\t\t\t\ta problem unless you have a familiar or Reach Spell.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroism<\/span>: The bonus is great if you\n\t\t\t\tplan to have multiple fights within the 10-minute duration, but it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\talso expensive. This will have the greatest benefit on your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tfront-line martial characters.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telepathy<\/span>: Useful if you need to\n\t\t\t\tcommunicate silently, but the 10-minute duration means that you can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tkeep this running all the time.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Synapatic Pulse<\/span>: In encounters with\n\t\t\t\tmultiple enemies, this puts your party at a huge advantage in the action\n\t\t\t\teconomy. Targets are Stunned 1 on a <em>success<\/em>, so you&#8217;re nearly\n\t\t\t\tguaranteed to benefit.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sending<\/span>: A great utility, but only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful. For communicating with your party, Message is\n\t\t\t\ttypically sufficient, especially since you can send it around\n\t\t\t\tcorners.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Visions of Danger<\/span>: Good damage and\n\t\t\t\tarea control in an impressively large AOE. Note that the applies when\n\t\t\t\tyou create the effect, then again when creatures start their turn in the\n\t\t\t\tarea, so the initial targets make the save and take damage twice before\n\t\t\t\tthey can take their turn. If your allies know you&#8217;re doing this, they\n\t\t\t\tcould stand outside the area and Seek until they disbelieve the illusion\n\t\t\t\tbefore charging into it while immune to the effects. This could allow\n\t\t\t\tyour party to retreat into the area while enemies hesitate to enter, or\n\t\t\t\tit could allow your party to grapple enemies to keep them inside the\n\t\t\t\tarea.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Uncontrollable Dance<\/span>: Similar tactical\n\t\t\t\tuses to Synaptic Pule, but singe-target. Against single powerful foes,\n\t\t\t\tthis is an ongoing, persistent debuff. Even on a Success, you&#8217;re eating\n\t\t\t\tas many as 3 Actions (maybe they wanted to Stride already) and making\n\t\t\t\tthe target Flat-Footed for 3 rounds, putting your party at a major\n\t\t\t\tadvantage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Telepathic Demand<\/span>: Extremely\n\t\t\t\tsituational. It&#8217;s a neat idea, but you have to do prior setup to make\n\t\t\t\tcreatures a valid target, and even then you&#8217;re limited in what you can\n\t\t\t\taccomplish with this. Your best bet is to target enemies and command\n\t\t\t\tthem to do something helpful for you but not against their\n\t\t\t\tself-interest, like taking the guard dog on a walk or something equally\n\t\t\t\tbenign. But is that worth a 9th-level spell?<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Standard Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Daze<\/span>: Unless your party has reliable\n\t\t\t\tways to repeatedly deal mental damage (which is generally only available\n\t\t\t\tto casters), this isn&#8217;t worth the Amp. The base spell is only useful if\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re unusually likely to cause a Critical Failure, so as a whole this\n\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t see much use.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Message<\/span>: The ability to send Message\n\t\t\t\taround corners is neat, but only situationally useful. More impactful:\n\t\t\t\tYou can Amp this to give an ally a mostly-free Step or Stride,\n\t\t\t\tpotentially leaving them another Action on their own turn to do\n\t\t\t\tsomething cool. When you get to 4th-level spells, they can choose one of\n\t\t\t\tseveral Attack actions, and since they&#8217;re made between turns, Muliple\n\t\t\t\tAttack Penalty won&#8217;t accumulate.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Surface: Forbidden Thought<\/span>: Complex.\n\t\t\t\tThe damage is good. Creatures might choose to face the save and take\n\t\t\t\tdamage, or they might forego an important action like Strike for a full\n\t\t\t\tturn, in which case you have likely negated an important Action that\n\t\t\t\tthey were going to take. Unfortunately, the target is then immune to\n\t\t\t\tthis for 1 minute, meaning that you can probably only use this once per\n\t\t\t\ttarget per encounter.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deeper: Shatter Mind<\/span>: Adequate\n\t\t\t\tdamage, but the AOE is tiny, so it&#8217;s dangerous for psychics to use this.\n\t\t\t\tFortunately, it doesn&#8217;t affect allies so you can use while your allies\n\t\t\t\thave enemies bogged down in melee. You can Amp this to dramatically\n\t\t\t\timprove both the damge and the size of the cone. I don&#8217;t know why you\n\t\t\t\twould choose the 30-foot option of the 60-foot option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deepest: Contagious Idea<\/span>: The effects\n\t\t\t\tare nice even if you don&#8217;t Amp it, but if you&#8217;re facing large numbers of\n\t\t\t\tenemies, this likely isn&#8217;t worth the action cost.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-tangible-dream\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ConsciousMinds.aspx?ID=5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Tangible Dream<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Mostly focused on area control and crowd control.

Against creatures with 25-foot speed (typical for\n\t\t\t\tplayers and many creatures), difficult terrain and a 10-foot speed\n\t\t\t\tpenalty means that they can move at most one square per Stride. That\n\t\t\t\tsounds appealing, but with a 15-foot radius, a creature exactly in the\n\t\t\t\tcenter can escape unharmed in 3 Actions. Realistically, if you target\n\t\t\t\tmultiple creatures it&#8217;s going to be more like 1 or 2 Strides to get out\n\t\t\t\tof the area. This would be better if the AOE was considerably larger,\n\t\t\t\tbut it&#8217;s not good enough to justify spell slots of a high enough level\n\t\t\t\tthat the area would matter.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient Sphere<\/span>: A good way to\n\t\t\t\tremove a single target from an encounter, especially if they&#8217;re not a\n\t\t\t\tbig damage dealer. Hardness 10 can mitigate quite a bit of damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Etheric Shards<\/span>: A very cool concept,\n\t\t\t\tbut the damage isn&#8217;t great, so unless you can force enemies to move\n\t\t\t\tthrough the area repeatedly, this isn&#8217;t worth the spell slot.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blade Barrier<\/span>: A great mix of area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol and damage. If you have a way to force enemies into the wall\n\t\t\t\t(allies who like to Shove, Kinetic Ram, a Decanter of Endless Water,\n\t\t\t\tetc.), you can repeatedly force enemies to take the damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Project Image<\/span>: Conceptually, this is\n\t\t\t\ta great way to have enemies attack the illusion instead of attack you.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, you need to be within 30 feet with line of sight to the\n\t\t\t\tillusion, which means that you probably want to hide. Even then, this\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t do anything about your speech, so the verbal components for\n\t\t\t\tspells will give away your location. Mirror Image provides largely the\n\t\t\t\tsame function for a much smaller cost.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scintillating Pattern<\/span>: Making\n\t\t\t\tcreatures Dazzled gives them a 20% miss chance and also allows other\n\t\t\t\tcreatures to hide from them. Creatures within the area may be Confused\n\t\t\t\tor Stunned, so if you have multiple enemies in the area they might spend\n\t\t\t\tseveral turns attacking each other. Creatures currently affected don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tmake more saves, but if their current effect ends they&#8217;re then\n\t\t\t\tsusceptible to making more saves. If you can, have your allies repeated\n\t\t\t\tshove enemies into the 20-foot burst, then retreat to a safe distance\n\t\t\t\twhile your enemies attack each other.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prismatic Sphere<\/span>: Put something (or\n\t\t\t\tseveral somethings that are close together) in a very strict 1-hour time\n\t\t\t\tout.

If\n\t\t\t\tyou Amp this, you can prevent a ton of damage, but based on the pronoun\n\t\t\t\tusage I think the Amped version only works on you, which is\n\t\t\t\tdisappointing.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Surface: Imaginary Weapon<\/span>: The\n\t\t\t\tdamage is fine, but you do not belong in melee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deeper: Astral Rain<\/span>: Decent damage,\n\t\t\t\tand cheap area control. The wording to Amp the spell is confusing.

The regular version may force enemies to move through the\n\t\t\t\twall to continue fighting, and the Amped version can remove enemies from\n\t\t\t\ta fight at least long enough for them to smash through the walls,\n\t\t\t\tleaving you and your allies enough time to hopefully defeat everything\n\t\t\t\telse.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-unbound-step\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ConsciousMinds.aspx?ID=6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Unbound Step<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unbound Step is all about teleportation, and while teleportation is a great\n\tway to get around, it doesn&#8217;t solve any problems except positioning.

If you need to use this consistently in combat, your allies\n\t\t\t\tshould be carrying their own gear around.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge<\/span>: Improved reach, a little bit\n\t\t\t\tof extra damage, and a nice 5-minute duration so it&#8217;s sure to last\n\t\t\t\tthrough all but the most absurdly-long fights. The fact that the spell\n\t\t\t\traises a creature directly to Large size also means that you can cast it\n\t\t\t\ton small creatures like halflings and they still get the full benefits\n\t\t\t\tin combat, but it also means that you can cast it on tiny creatures like\n\t\t\t\ta familiar and potentially ride them. While the effects of the spell\n\t\t\t\timprove with spell level, the 2nd-level version of the spell is still a\n\t\t\t\tsignificant advantage for your melee allies, especially if they have\n\t\t\t\tReaction options like Attack of Opportunity, so you can count on a\n\t\t\t\t2nd-level spell to provide a significant tactical advantage even at high\n\t\t\t\tlevels.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rally Point<\/span>: Very situational. If\n\t\t\t\tyou need short-distance teleportation you can create the rally point and\n\t\t\t\timmediately teleport for 3 Actions, which is cheaper than Dimension Door\n\t\t\t\t(at least in terms of spell slots). Beyond that, I can&#8217;t think of a\n\t\t\t\trecurring situation where this would be useful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimension Door<\/span>: Decent\n\t\t\t\tshort-distance teleportation. Requiring line of sight limits your\n\t\t\t\toptions, but this is still enough to get out of grapples, dangerous\n\t\t\t\tlocations, etc. Unfortunately, you also have Warp Step, which provides\n\t\t\t\texcellent and inexpensive short-range teleportation, so there&#8217;s not much\n\t\t\t\treason to use Dimension Door.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Strange Geometry<\/span>: Hillarious, but not\n\t\t\t\treliable and certainly not easy to use. You can spread the cubes around\n\t\t\t\tand force melee-only creatures to chase you through the cubes repeatedly\n\t\t\t\twhile the Benny Hill theme song plays in the background.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Collective Transposition<\/span>: Drop allies\n\t\t\t\tinto melee range of your enemies, drop enemies into dangerous positions,\n\t\t\t\tor just lift them high enough off the ground to cause falling\n\t\t\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Momentary Recovery<\/span>: Teleport and get\n\t\t\t\t2 Actions to take while you&#8217;re between locations. Great if you need to\n\t\t\t\tdrink a potion, buff yourself, deal with persistent damage, etc. You&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tbe Slowed 1 on your next turn, which is inconvenient, but if you need to\n\t\t\t\tget out of a bad spot this is great.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maze<\/span>: Take the target out of a fight\n\t\t\t\twithout an initial save. Creatures with poor Wisdom will struggle to\n\t\t\t\tescape at all. The duration is only one minute and you need to Sustain\n\t\t\t\tthe Spell, but the time this buys you should give you and your party a\n\t\t\t\thuge tactical advantage (or allow you to run away). Remember that you\n\t\t\t\tcan choose not to sustain the spell, so if you&#8217;ve cleaned up your other\n\t\t\t\tenemies, gather the party, ready some actions, and end the spell\n\t\t\t\tearly.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bilocation<\/span>: Very situational. You don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tmitigate any risk by doing this, you don&#8217;t get any additional actions or\n\t\t\t\ttactical advantages, and now you&#8217;re in two places for enemies to target\n\t\t\t\tyou. You could do something with sending one body somewhere before\n\t\t\t\tending the spell and returning to whichever body is in a safer location,\n\t\t\t\tbut why not just teleport?<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Standard Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phase Bolt<\/span>: Decent single-target\n\t\t\t\tdamage, but the Circumstance bonus to AC stuff generally only matters\n\t\t\t\twhen attacking humanoids who can do things like use shields.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warp Step<\/span>: Already a good way to cover\n\t\t\t\tdistance quickly, but if you Amp this you get to Stride twice with a +10\n\t\t\t\tft. speed bonus for a single Action. Once you can cast 4th-level spells\n\t\t\t\tyou can instead teleport, providing amazing utility both in and out of\n\t\t\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Surface: Distortion Lens<\/span>: Weird and\n\t\t\t\tonly situationally useful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deeper: Ghostly Shift<\/span>: The damage\n\t\t\t\tresistance is decent and broadly useful, but the Amp effect is poor. If\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re worried about enemies getting in your way, Warp Step lets you\n\t\t\t\tteleport not long after you get this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deepest: Tesseract Tunnel<\/span>: This could\n\t\t\t\tbe a good way to get your melee allies into melee quickly, but it won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tbe useful frequently. The Amped version is great utility outside of\n\t\t\t\tcombat, and notably doesn&#8217;t require line of sight so you can use this to\n\t\t\t\tteleport through walls.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The larger of the Psychic&#8216;s two subclasses, your choice of Conscious Mind gives you additional spells known, including the cantrips which you&#8217;ll be able to Amp.
