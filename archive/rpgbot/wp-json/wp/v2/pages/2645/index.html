Cast Blade Ward, then swing a\n\t\tweapon as a bonus action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Booming Blade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): If\n\t\tyou can use War Magic with either Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade and\n\t\ttrigger the bonus damage, you will consistently deal more damage than\n\t\tattacking normally. Booming Blade has the added benefit of providing extra\n\t\treasons for enemies to not move away from you, which is sorely needed in 5e\n\t\tbecause opportunity attacks are usually not a serious deterrent. See my\n\t\tarticle on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.\n\t\t<p>Note that Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything published an updated version of\n\t\t\tBooming Blade.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frostbite<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: The damage won&#8217;t match Booming Blade, but combining War Magic, Eldritch\n\t\tStrike, and Frostbite creates a sustainable offensive combo. Hit the target\n\t\twith Frostbite to impose disadvantage on its first weapon attack the\n\t\tfollowing round, then hit it with a weapon attack as a bonus action so it\n\t\tgets Disadvantage on its save against the first spell you cast on it next\n\t\tturn. Repeat. Of course, Blade Ward will have a similar effect, and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thave nearly so many points of failure.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Green-Flame Blade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tBooming Blade is more useful for the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s role as a front-line\n\t\ttank, and you only get a total of 3 cantrips over your entire career, so\n\t\tit&#8217;s hard to justify taking both. The ability to damage two enemies with one\n\t\tattack is really enticing, but if you need that functionality you can either\n\t\tattack twice or use War Magic and hit the second target as a Bonus Action.\n\t\t<p>Note that Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything published an updated version of\n\t\t\tGreen-Flame Blade.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Lure<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tDespite the 15-foot range, this can be a great option for melee Eldritch\n\t\tKnights. Against enemies with poor Strength (like many enemy spellcasters),\n\t\tyou can use this to drag them into melee with you and force them to teleport\n\t\tor Disengage in order to get away from you unharmed. If you&#8217;re flying, you\n\t\tmay even be able to pull enemies into the air to cause a small amount of\n\t\tfalling damage. Since it only has Verbal components, you can easily use this\n\t\twithout juggling your weapon. The save is Strength, so unfortunately with\n\t\tyour relatively poor save DC you&#8217;ll only be successful with this against\n\t\tphysically weak foes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sword Burst<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tEldritch Knights are typically in melee, and Sword Burst is a great way to\n\t\thandle crowds of multiple enemies. See my article on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Toll the Dead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: 60 ft. range, the damage is measured in d12&#8217;s, and since it&#8217;s necrotic\n\t\tdamage almost nothing will resist it. Unfortunately, you&#8217;ll still deal more\n\t\taverage damage with a weapon in most cases, especially since your\n\t\tIntelligence won&#8217;t match your Strength or Dexterity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Absorb Elements<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: You get spellcasting later and slower than anyone else, so you have very\n\t\tfew options for protecting yourself from non-weapon damage. This will handle\n\t\tthat issue, but it will eat your spell slots quickly so be sure to eliminate\n\t\tthe source of the elemental damage as quickly as possible so that you don&#8217;t\n\t\trun through your spell slots too quickly.\n<p>The biggest challenge for Absorb Elements is that is has Somatic components, which require\na free hand. By default, this means that two-weapon fighting builds and sword-and-board builds\nwill be unable to use this unless you&#8217;re dilligent about drawing and stowing your weapon, which\nboth makes opportunity attacks hard and only allows Absorb Elements every other round. Unfortunately,\nthe only way around this is <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/war-caster\/\">War Caster<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Burning Hands<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to handle crowds of enemies, and the damage is good for a\n\t\t1st-level spell if you can for multiple foes in the AOE.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth Tremor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Not nearly enough damage, and being prone isn&#8217;t enough of a problem in\n\t\t5e. The difficult terrain effect is the real draw. It only works on &#8220;loose\n\t\tearth or stone&#8221;, but that covers nearly anything you&#8217;ll stand on except\n\t\twood, so it&#8217;s an easy way to create difficult terrain. Unfortunately, it\n\t\talso affects you so be careful not to trap yourself among enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mage Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re Dexterity-based, this is the only way to match the base AC\n\t\tprovided by plate armor. The 8-hour duration is especially nice since you\n\t\tget so few spell slots to throw around.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Missile<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great option at long range, and reliable damage, but at high levels the\n\t\tdamage won&#8217;t be good enough to justify over using a weapon, so you may want\n\t\tto trade it for something else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Find Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Eldritch Knights get just one 1st-level spell outside of their normal\n\t\tschool limitation, and Find Familiar is a great candidate. Get an owl and\n\t\thave it use Flyby and Help to give you Advantage before you try to hit an\n\t\tenemy with Booming Blade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection from Evil and Good<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great defensive buff with a reasonably long duration. A great use of\n\t\tyour extremely limited spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A fantastic boost to your defenses. Nearly all the effect of the\n\t\tDefensive Duelist feat, and all it costs is a spell slot.\n<p>The biggest challenge for Shield is that is has Somatic components, which require\na free hand. By default, this means that two-weapon fighting builds and sword-and-board builds\nwill be unable to use this unless you&#8217;re dilligent about drawing and stowing your weapon, which\nboth makes opportunity attacks hard and only allows Absorb Elements every other round. Unfortunately,\nthe only way around this is <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/war-caster\/\">War Caster<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silvery Barbs<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a><\/sup>: \nExtremely powerful, but also very complicated. See my \n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\">blog post on Silvery Barbs<\/a>\nfor details on the numerous abuse cases which the spell allows. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s outside of the\nEldritch Knight&#8217;s school limitations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snare<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Good for setting a trap, or if you&#8217;re resting somewhere dangerous with a\n\t\tconvenient choke point like a narrow hallway. Targets are restrained for at\n\t\tleast one round, which is hopefully enough for you to fight your way out of\n\t\tyour bedroll and grab a weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tasha&#8217;s Caustic Brew<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): A great\n\t\tspell, but your save DC likely isn&#8217;t good enough to make it work.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thunderwave<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Your saving throws won&#8217;t (and shouldn&#8217;t) keep pace with a full caster,\n\t\tand pushing enemies away from you is rarely a good idea when your job is to\n\t\tget into melee and make them stay there.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Witch Bolt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>: The ongoing damage should\n\t\tbe much less than what you can do with a weapon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aganazzar\u2019s scorcher<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: I&#8217;ve never been a fan of lines. It&#8217;s too difficult to line up more than\n\t\ttwo creatures at a time, so you&#8217;ll probably never hit more than two\n\t\tcreatures unless you have a long hallway handy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge\/Reduce<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: One of the absolute best buffs you can put on a fighter, and you can cast\n\t\tit yourself. Advantage on Strength checks makes it easy for your to Shove\n\t\tand Grapple enemies, allowing you to keep them in place easily.\n\t\tUnfortunately the 1 Action casting time is annoying in combat, and with a 1\n\t\tminute duration it&#8217;s difficult to cast ahead of time. It&#8217;s also outside of\n\t\tthe school limitations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Kinetic Jaunt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a><\/sup>: Enables hit-and-run tactics. Use War Magic to hit an enemy with Booming Blade, followed by another attack\nas a Bonus Action, then step out of their reach and make them come to you. However, keep in mind that this\nmay encourage enemies to walk around you and attack your less durable allies. This is also outside the\nEldritch Knight&#8217;s school limitations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Having access to magic weapons is crucial, but this is a really hard way\n\t\tfor you to get one. If anyone else in the party can cast Magic Weapon, don&#8217;t\n\t\tlearn it. The scaling is rough for the Eldritch Knight, and it&#8217;s outside of\n\t\tthe school limitations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: Keeping enemies in place so that you can beat them up is hard in 5e, and\n\t\tthe Eldritch Knight doesn&#8217;t have a lot of options to do it. Earthen Grasp is\n\t\ta great way to address the issue, and since it calls for a Strength saving\n\t\tthrow it works really well on small nimble enemies and weak spellcasters,\n\t\tboth of which are likely to look for ways to run away from you.\n\t\tUnfortunately this isn&#8217;t within the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s school limitations so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll need to spend some of your very limited spells known that ignore the\n\t\tschool limitations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Misty Step<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great spell all around. Eventually you&#8217;ll want to trade it out once you\n\t\tget Arcane Charge, but that&#8217;s not until 15th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scorching Ray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Without an on-hit damage bonus of some kind this is obsolete by the time\n\t\tyou can cast it. If you need ranged damage, pull out a bow or throw a\n\t\tjavelin.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Outside your school limitation, but you don&#8217;t have another way to handle\n\t\tinvisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Blade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Compared to a rapier, the Shadow Blade adds 1d8 damage per attack, it\n\t\tchanges to psychic damage (which is resisted by very few creatures), it adds\n\t\tthe Thrown property for some reason, and since it gives you Advantage to\n\t\tattack creatures in dim light or darkness it will offset Disadvantage for\n\t\tattacking creatures when it&#8217;s too dark for you to see. Unfortunately it&#8217;s an\n\t\tIllusion spell so learning it consumes one of your limited spells known that\n\t\tignore the school limitations.\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s not clear yet if the Shadow Blade qualifies to use with Booming\n\t\t\tBlade and Green-Flame Blade, but Jeremy Crawford has indicated that\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2020\/11\/18\/does-the-monetary-value-of-the-component-now-negate-being-able-to-use-your-pact-of-the-blade-weapon-or-shadow-blade-in-conjunction-with-booming-blade\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he would allow Shadow Blade to work with Booming Blade<\/a>.

This makes it easy\n\t\tfor you to keep enemies close, and the 10-minute duration can get you\n\t\tthrough multiple fights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">FToD<\/a><\/sup>: Bonus action casting time, and the damage doesn&#8217;t allow a save. This is a\n\t\tgreat spell for gish builds, but by the time you can cast it the damage is negligible. This is great for builds with better spellcasting than the Eldritch Knight, but for the Eldritch Knight you should likely look elsewhere..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Counterspell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Counterspell is incredibly powerful, but it&#8217;s a really hard choice for\n\t\tthe Eldritch Knight. You need to focus on your physical ability scores over\n\t\tIntelligence, and you don&#8217;t have the high-level spell slots to guarantee\n\t\tthat you can successfully counter spells. You can still try it and hope to\n\t\troll well on your Intelligence check, but I would never count on this as a\n\t\treliable option so it&#8217;s likely not worth one of your limited spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dispel Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If your party doesn&#8217;t have someone else who can cast Dispel Magic by the time\n\t\tit&#8217;s an option for you, you&#8217;re probably all dead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fireball<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: At 8d6 damage, Fireball will likely exceed the amount of damage you can\n\t\tdo to a single creature until you get four attacks at 20th level. Sure, your\n\t\tsave DC will be relatively low, and enemies are likely to pass the save, but\n\t\tif you hit two or more creatures it&#8217;s almost always going to do more damage\n\t\tthan weapon attacks, and the more creatures you can hit in the sizable AOE,\n\t\tthe more damage you&#8217;ll do.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Arrows<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Tempting for a fighter to boost your damage output, but it&#8217;s not good\n\t\tenough to consume one of your few spells known that go beyond your school\n\t\tlimitations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fly<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Flight is a defining tactical advantage over creatures who can&#8217;t fly,\n\t\tespecially if those creatures don&#8217;t have effective ranged options. Even\n\t\tthough this is beyond the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s school limitations it&#8217;s a\n\t\tmust-have option. If you don&#8217;t have easy access to flight by other means (an\n\t\tallied spellcaster, an item, a flying mount, etc.), you need this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Haste<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent buff at any level, but it&#8217;s outside your school limitations\n\t\tand it&#8217;s available to many other spellcasters so you may be able to get it\n\t\tfrom an ally when you really need it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intellect Fortress<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Technically situational, but an absolutely spectacular defense against\n\t\tenemies which rely on spells or common effects like charm and fear effects.\n\t\tUnlike racial traits like the Gnome&#8217;s Cunning or the Satyr and Yuan-Ti\n\t\tPureblood&#8217;s Magic Resistance, this applies to <em>all<\/em> Intelligence,\n\t\tWisdom, and Charisma saving throws, providing broad and effective protection\n\t\tagainst many of the most dangerous save-or-suck effects in the game. You\n\t\talso get resistance to psychic damage, which is nice if you&#8217;re fighting mind\n\t\tflayers, aboleths, or bards who enjoy Vicious Mockery. With a 1-hour\n\t\tduration, the Concentration requirement can be problematic, but it also\n\t\tmeans that you can carry this through multiple encounters at low cost, so in\n\t\tsituations where you need this it&#8217;s not going to eat all of your spell\n\t\tslots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Leomund&#8217;s Tiny Hut<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Perhaps an odd choice for the Eldritch Knight, but Tiny Hut is a great\n\t\tplace to rest, and if you have time to set it up it&#8217;s a great defensive\n\t\tposition.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Bolt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: As much damage as fireball, but it&#8217;s much harder to hit multiple\n\t\tcreatures with a line.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Circle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent, but too situational to consume one your very few spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Melf&#8217;s Minute Meteors<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: I love that you can use this to turn your bonus action into damage\n\t\toutput, but with your poor save DC this deals too little damage to waste a\n\t\t3rd-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Energy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent defensive option, but you may be doing alright with Absorb\n\t\tElements.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Shroud<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Outside your school limitations. A 1-minute combat buff which adds 1d8\n\t\tdamage and a 10 ft. speed reduction to each of your numerous attacks.\n\t\tTempting on a Defender build, but Haste may be more impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunder Step<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: You can get most of the same function from Arcane Charge, which you get\n\t\tone level after you get your unrestricted spell known.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wall of Sand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Decent area control, and since it restricts movement you may be able to\n\t\tuse to to keep enemies from fleeing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wall of Water<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: This makes it hard for you to to engage enemies. Wall of Sand is more\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Banishment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a fantastic spell, but your save DC probably isn&#8217;t good enough\n\t\tfor it to be reliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: One of the Fighter&#8217;s primary roles is Defender. Your job is to stand in\n\t\tthe front and get attacked by scary monsters. Throw up Fire Shield and enjoy\n\t\ta bunch of extra damage output for being in the right place and doing your\n\t\tjob.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Invisibility is an absolutely spectacular buff, but part of the Fighter&#8217;s\n\t\tprimary role in the party is to draw attention away from less durable\n\t\tallies. If you&#8217;re invisible, you can&#8217;t do that.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ice Storm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This spell is terrible. Two types of dice for no readily apparent reason.\n\t\tTwo types of damage, which makes sense but is still annoying. Compare this\n\t\tto Erupting Earth: ice Storm&#8217;s AOE is much bigger (20 ft. cube vs. 20 ft.\n\t\tradius cylinder), but it does an average of just 3 more damage, and the\n\t\tdifficult terrain only lasts until the end of your next turn so it&#8217;s nearly\n\t\tpointless. This simply isn&#8217;t good enough to justify being a spell level\n\t\thigher than Erupting Earth.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mordenkainen&#8217;s Private Sanctum<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You get one 4th-level spell slot every day. Do you really want to spend\n\t\tit on a place to sleep?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Otiluke&#8217;s Resilient Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save-or-suck. Great, but your spell save DC is probably too\n\t\tlow for it to reliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Polymorph<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With an hour-long duration, this is a great use of your single 4th-level\n\t\tspell slot. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/polymorph\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a>\n\t\tfor more information.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stoneskin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A decent buff, but at this level magic attacks are common.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Storm Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Decent area control, but your spell attack bonus probably isn&#8217;t good\n\t\tenough to make the spell attacks reliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Fire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Even if you save DC is poor, Wall of Fire is still a great area control\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vitriolic Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Fireball will deal roughly the same initial damage, but the secondary\n\t\tdamage might be enough to be appealing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Watery Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Without a maxed out spell save DC this spell isn&#8217;t reliable enough to\n\t\twaste your only 4th-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sickening Radiance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: This spell is very easy to overlook. The effects are complicated, and the\n\t\t4d10 damage looks underwhelming, but don&#8217;t let that deter you. This is a\n\t\tgreat spell to cast into a room then shut the door, but even if that&#8217;s not\n\t\tan option it&#8217;s a fantastic way to handle crowds. With a 30-foot radius you\n\t\tcan hit a huge number of targets, and with a 10-minute duration you can\n\t\teasily kill anything stuck in the area for an extended period. The 4d10\n\t\tdamage is fine, and negating invisibility is great, but the real appeal is\n\t\tthe levels of Exhaustion.\n<p>One level makes targets less able to resist\n\t\tgrappling or other crowd control spells like Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp or\n\t\tWeb which your allies could cast to keep enemies in the area. Two levels\n\t\thalves targets&#8217; speed, making it harder for them to move out of the area.\n\t\tThree levels imposes Disadvantage on saves so their condition will\n\t\tdeteriorate even faster. If targets somehow survive until 5 levels of\n\t\texhaustion (they&#8217;ll have taken 20d10 radiant damage by now, which is a lot),\n\t\ttheir speed drops to 0 so you no longer need to do anything to prevent\n\t\tescape. Just wait for them to hit 6 levels of Exhaustion, which results in\n\t\tdeath if a total of 24d10 radiant damage somehow hasn&#8217;t killed them. Just be\n\t\twarned: this spell affects allies, too, and if the spell ends the levels of\n\t\tExhaustion are removed instantly.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e Fighter&#8217;s spell
