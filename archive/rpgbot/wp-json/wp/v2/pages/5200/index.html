The Alchemist has the ability to fill\n\ta variety of roles: blaster, healer, striker, and support.

Barely better than a Wizard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill ranks, and Craft\n\t(Alchemy) is basically required. The Alchemist is Intelligence-based, so they\n\tshould have plenty of bonus skill ranks to pick up the few good skills\n\tavailable to the Alchemist, and you might consider picking up additional class\n\tskills using traits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemy<\/span> (Su): The Alchemist works a bit like\n\ta 2\/3 prepared caster, but they drink all of their spells. Be sure to pick up\n\tthe Infusion Discovery so that you can share your Extracts with the party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bomb<\/span> (Su): An excellent blast at first\n\tlevel, the Bomb&#8217;s damage drops off quickly compared to spells. If you plan to\n\tuse bombs, be sure to invest some Discoveries to improve Bomb. Also consider\n\t&#8220;Bomb Admixture&#8221; spells which supplement the effects of your bombs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Brew Potion<\/span> (Ex): Potions aren&#8217;t fantastic\n\tin terms of item crafting, but it never hurts to hand out cheap healing\n\tpotions to the party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mutagen<\/span> (Su): 10 minutes per level will\n\tlast a reasonably long time. The bonuses to your abilities are fantastic, and\n\tstack with enhancement bonuses. Be careful of which ability you choose to\n\tincrease: improving Strength will improve damage with thrown weapons, but will\n\thandicap your Bombs and Extracts. Dexterity will improve AC, attack rolls with\n\tranged weapons, and Reflex saves, but will handicap your already low Will\n\tsaves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Throw Anything<\/span> (Ex): The Throw Anything\n\tfeat won&#8217;t really help much unless you like throwing garbage or non-ranged\n\tweapons, but the bonus damage with splash weapons dramatically improves the\n\tdamage of alchemical weapons like Acid. Note that this bonus damage doesn&#8217;t\n\tget added to the Alchemist&#8217;s Bomb damage because Bomb already adds the\n\tAlchemist&#8217;s intelligence bonus to damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Discovery<\/span> (Su): Alchemist Discoveries are\n\tpowerful and unique ways to customize your alchemist, and a class dip into\n\tAlchemist is a common choice for many builds (especially those that need an\n\textra arm to reload weapons). For help selecting Alchemist Discoveries, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/alchemist\/discoveries\">Alchemist Discovery Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but\n\tpoison becomes common at high levels where your bonus is substantial.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Use<\/span> (ex): The Alchemist isn&#8217;t a big\n\tweapon user, so it&#8217;s difficult for them to find a way to make use of poison.\n\tHowever, if you have someone in the party who doesn&#8217;t mind using poison you\n\tcan poison their weapons for them and send them into combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Swift Alchemy<\/span> (Ex): Crafting alchemical\n\titems more quickly further improves your access to alchemical items like Acid\n\twhich you will expend quickly. Poisoning weapons as a move action is nice in\n\tcombat, but the Alchemist still isn&#8217;t combative enough to be notably scary\n\twith poison on their own weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swift Poisoning<\/span> (Ex): Poison weapons even\n\tfaster! Of course you probably still need to pass them to someone who&#8217;s good\n\tenough with weapons for it to matter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Persistent Mutagen<\/span> (Su): The Mutagen&#8217;s\n\tbiggest limitation is its duration, and multiplying the duration by 6 is a\n\thuge improvement.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Instant Alchemy<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s pretty rare\n\tthat you need to whip up an item in the middle of combat, and the only reason\n\tto poison a weapon as an immediate action is to use it for an attack of\n\topportunity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grand Discovery<\/span> (Su): Grand Discoveries are\n\tamazing.

However, a conventional\n\talchemist will have trouble making use of the Dwarf&#8217;s abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Bonuses to both of the Alchemist&#8217;s\n\tprimary abilities, and the other Elven racial abilities provide some\n\tinteresting bonuses. The Elf favored class bonus gets you some extra formulae\n\tknown, but you can purchase extra formulae.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: Despite lacking useful ability\n\tbonuses, the Gnome&#8217;s Knack with Poison alternate racial trait and the Gnome\n\tracial favored class bonus can make for a decent Alchemist. Small size is also\n\thelpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The Half-Elf is an interesting\n\toption, and the Alchemist can actually justify making use of Adaptability. The\n\tHalf-Elf favored class bonus improves the relatively poor range of alchemical\n\tweapons, but Long Shot will be more effective (though the two stack nicely),\n\tand with ranged touch attacks you should rarely have problems hitting even\n\twith a few range increment penalties.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Beyond the flexible ability\n\tbonus, the Half-Orc has very little to offer the Alchemist. The Half-Orc\n\tfavored class bonus adds a little bit of extra damage to your bombs, but it&#8217;s\n\tnot enough to make the Half-Orc a particularly good option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: A bonus to Dexterity and small\n\tsize make the Halfling great at throwing alchemical weapons, but the Halfling\n\tdoesn&#8217;t add anything else particularly useful for the Alchemist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always a good option, the human works\n\tfor any Alchemist build. The Human favored class bonus is the same as the Elf,\n\tand should be largely ignored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Accelerated Drinker<\/span> (Combat): It&#8217;s unclear wether or\n\t\tnot this works with extracts. My personal opinion is that it does not, but\n\t\tdiscuss it with your GM. It&#8217;s also important to note that the potion must be\n\t\tin your hand at the start of your turn, so you need to retrieve the potion\n\t\tahead of time. If you&#8217;re fine walking around with a potion in one hand in\n\t\tcase you get attacked, it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Once you get into combat,\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll need to\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/coreRulebook\/combat#manipulate-an-item\">retrieve a potion as move action<\/a>\n\t\ton one turn and use Accelerated Drinker on the following turn. This leaves\n\t\tyour standard action free to throw a bomb, drink an extract, etc. (the\n\t\tAlchemist&#8217;s Alchemy feature specifically says &#8220;An alchemist can draw and\n\t\tdrink an extract as a standard action.&#8221;). Non-alchemists need to use a move\n\t\taction to retrieve a potion and a second move action to drink it, making\n\t\tthis trait massively situational for them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemical Adept<\/span> (Magic): This could\n\t\tsave you a lot of money if you plan to craft a lot of alchemical items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Alchemical Intuition<\/span> (Magic): Charisma is a\n\t\tdump stat for Alchemists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cross-Knowledge<\/span> (Magic): Many Formulae\n\t\tare also on the Wizard spell list, but 1 extra caster level won&#8217;t make a\n\t\thuge difference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enduring Mutagen<\/span> (Magic): Tempting at\n\t\tlow level, but once you have Persistent Mutagen it won&#8217;t matter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focused Burn<\/span> (Magic): Locks you into\n\t\tfire damage if you want the benefits, and the damage is really small. You\n\t\twon&#8217;t see a single point until 3rd level. Unless you&#8217;re playing a campaign\n\t\tthat you expect to last into high levels, I wouldn&#8217;t bother with this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hedge Magician<\/span> (Magic): 5% may not seem\n\t\tlike a lot, but it adds up very quickly if you like to craft a lot of\n\t\tpotions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pragmatic Activator<\/span> (Magic): UMD is a\n\t\tfantastic skill, and Alchemists have the Intelligence to make Pragmatic\n\t\tActivator work, but you don&#8217;t get it as a class skill, and I can&#8217;t think of\n\t\tmany options that you would need from wands or scrolls that you couldn&#8217;t get\n\t\tfrom the Alchemist&#8217;s spell list. UMD is a way for arcane casters to use\n\t\tdivine spells, divine spellcasters to arcane spells, and non-spellcasters to\n\t\tcast spells. You get a mix of arcane spells and spells normally limited to\n\t\tdivine spellcasters, so there&#8217;s little reason to invest in UMD.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unstable Mutagen<\/span> (Magic): Too Random, and\n\t\tonce you get Enduring Mutagen one of the 3 good outcomes becomes a bad\n\t\toutcome.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Appraise<\/span> (Int): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Craft (Alchemy)<\/span> (Int): Essential to the\n\t\tfunction of the class.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disable Device<\/span> (Dex): Fantastic if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have someone in the party with Trapfinding.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): Never more than one rank, and\n\t\teven then not until fairly high level when you can fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): An excellent supplement to\n\t\tmagical healing, but not terribly effective without a lot of Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (arcana)<\/span> (Int): One of the most\n\t\timportant Knowledge skills in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (nature)<\/span> (Int): One of the most\n\t\timportant Knowledge skills in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The most rolled skill in\n\t\tthe game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sleight of Hand<\/span> (Dex): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Situational, and the\n\t\tAlchemist relies on Craft (Alchemy) for creating potions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Use Magic Device<\/span> (Cha): Charisma is a dump\n\t\tstat, and the Alchemist already gets access to a wide variety of both arcane\n\t\tand divine magic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Close-Quarters Thrower<\/span>: Just take a 5 foot\n\t\tstep away.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Die for Your Master<\/span>: If you have a tumor\n\t\tfamiliar, this could save your life.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Bombs<\/span>: Only two extra bombs per\n\t\tday.

It also saves you th 50gp cost of actually\n\t\tbuying a tanglefoot bag.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crafter&#8217;s Fortune<\/span>: An exceptionally\n\t\tgenerous +5 luck bonus. Learn this early and use it to craft alchemical\n\t\titems better and faster than you could otherwise. The duration is\n\t\tdays\/level, so this is great to use on a day where you not adventuring, then\n\t\tif you need to craft something in a hurry you&#8217;ve got a hefty bonus to help\n\t\tspeed things along.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extracts-2\">2nd-Level Extracts<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ablative Barrier<\/span>: hours\/level duration\n\t\tmeans that this will last all day. The armor bonus won&#8217;t stack with real\n\t\tarmor, but it will still work while polymorphed. The real draw is the damage\n\t\tconversion effect. Nonlethal damage means that you&#8217;re more likely to be\n\t\tknocked unconcious and ignored than actually killed. In additon, healing\n\t\trestores an equal amount of regular and nonlethal damage so healing you\n\t\tbecomes twice as effective. This is an excellent option if you&#8217;re working in\n\t\tmelee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemical Allocation<\/span>: Despite the obvious\n\t\thygienic issues, this makes potions and elixers reusable, potentially making\n\t\t3rd-level potions worth their exorbitant cost. This means that by using\n\t\tthist extract you can spend 900gp to add any potion-compatible spell of\n\t\t3rd-level or lower to your spell list. The more potions you acquire, the\n\t\tmore useful this gets. Consider the huger list of options: fly, greater\n\t\tmagic fang, cure critical wounds, Beast Shape I, etc.. The only real\n\t\tlimitation is that you need to be the one to consume the potion or elixer,\n\t\tso you&#8217;re limited to effects which affect you. In the absolute worst usage\n\t\tscenario, this allows you to use Cure Critical Wounds as a 2nd-level extract\n\t\tinstead of a 3rd-level extract.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skinsend<\/span>: A poor man&#8217;s version of Twin\n\t\tForm. Compression can be occasionally useful, and construct traits are nice\n\t\tbecuase of the immunities you get, but this is really risky to use in\n\t\tcombat. At only half of your normal hit points, you&#8217;re much more likely to\n\t\tdie in your skin form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extracts-4\">4th-Level Extracts<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mutagenic Touch<\/span>: It&#8217;s hard to know when\n\t\tthis will work well. If you have another party member who&#8217;s a combat monster\n\t\t(fighter, etc.) they might really enjoy this. Of course, combat monsters\n\t\ttypically have poor mental ability scores, so the penalty from the mutagen\n\t\tmight incapacitate them if you have discoveries which improve your\n\t\tmutagen.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">False Life, Greater<\/span>: Temporary hit poitns\n\t\twith hours\/level duration. Always good on a class with relatively few hit\n\t\tpoints. It&#8217;s really weird that Alchemists don&#8217;t get regular False Life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extracts-5\">5th-Level Extracts<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Delayed Consumptiom<\/span>: Turn any extract into\n\t\tan immediate action. Resist Energy is a great example; activate it when\n\t\tyou&#8217;re about to take energy damage you&#8217;ve solved the biggest problem with\n\t\tResist Energy: guessing what to resist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resurgent Transformation<\/span>: A fantastic way\n\t\tto keep yourself alive, but the 100gp material component cost will add up\n\t\tquickly if you use it every day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extracts-6\">6th-Level Extracts<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Twin Form<\/span>: Unique to Alchemists (and\n\t\tIngestigators because they share a spell list), twin form lets you get away\n\t\twith some serious shenanigans. Create a twin and send it to scout ahead, set\n\t\toff traps, or distract a monster. Send your twin into a dangerous combat,\n\t\tlet it die, then run into the fight after the twin dies at full health and\n\t\tready to win the day. The rounds\/level duration doesn&#8217;t let you do a lot,\n\t\tbut that&#8217;s probably for the best.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Armor<\/span> (22,400 gp): Unless you\n\t\thave heavy armor proficiency <em>and<\/em> a Dexterity modifier of at most\n\t\t+5, Celestial Armor is the best armor in the game if all you need from your\n\t\tarmor is AC. For more, check out my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/celestial_armor\">Practical Guide to Celestial Armor<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clawhand Shield<\/span> (8,158 gp): This is a\n\t\tweird item. It&#8217;s a bit more expensive than your typical +2 shield, so it may\n\t\tnot be worth the cost compared to a mithral buckler. However, it allows you\n\t\tto perform somatic components with the hand holding the shield, which means\n\t\tthat you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue, and because it\n\t\thas no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone can use it without\n\t\tissue. The ability to automatically damage enemies while in a grapple is a\n\t\thelpful deterrent for small or physical weak characters, but ion&#8217;t go\n\t\tlooking for excuses to use it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection<\/span>: If you want to go into melee,\n\t\tyou need all of the AC you can get.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wizardy<\/span>: Since alchemists are only 2\/3\n\t\tcasters, rings of wizardry are proportionately more effective for them than\n\t\tthey are for full casters. Personally, I like Wizard 2 because Alchemical\n\t\tAllocation is so amazing. It&#8217;s not totally clear if Rings of Wizardry work\n\t\tfor Alchemists, but Boro Beads are functionally identical to Pearls of\n\t\tPower, so it seems reasonable that a comparable ring would work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Admixture Vile<\/span>: A bit pricey for one use\n\t\tper day, but you can combine two third-level extracts, which is amazing for\n\t\tshort-duration buffs which you want to set up at the start of a fight.\n\t\tDisplacement and Haste are a good combination.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Amulet of Natural Armor<\/span>: If you want to\n\t\tgo into melee, you need all of the AC you can get. The bonus is am\n\t\tenhancement bonus to natural armor, so it will stack with natural armor\n\t\tbonuses like the ones from Mutagen and from Polymorph spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Belt of incredible dexterity \/ Belt of Physical Perfection<\/span>: If you stay out of melee, all your need is Dexterity. If you go into\n\t\tmelee, you want a belt of physical perfection.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boro Bead<\/span>: Pearls of power for alchemists.\n\t\tExcellent for 2nd-level slots so that you can use Alchemical Allocation\n\t\tmore.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\tforego.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Formula Alembic<\/span>: Rarely useful enough to\n\t\tjustify buying it. If you want to add more spells to your formulae book it&#8217;s\n\t\tcheaper to pay for the extra pages than to buy a potion of the same\n\t\tspell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of vast intelligence \/ Headband of Mental Prowess<\/span>: Intelligence is crucial, but investing in Wisdom will provide a useful\n\t\tboost to your Will saves and will offset the penalties from your\n\t\tMutagen.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Poisoner&#8217;s Gloves<\/span>: Put two infusions\n\t\t(you&#8217;ll need the Infusion discover) into the gloves. Put the gloves on a\n\t\thired NPC, and have him buff you. If you don&#8217;t want to lug a level 1\n\t\tcommoner into combat, get a Tumor Familiar shaped like a monkey or something\n\t\telse with hands, and have it wear the gloves instead. It can pat you down,\n\t\tthen re-attach itself while you&#8217;re busy fighting stuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vest of Stable Mutagen<\/span>: The penalty to\n\t\tphysical ability scores from your mutagen can be serious problem if you&#8217;re\n\t\tnot built to gracefully handle the penalties. For 20,000 gp you can remove\n\t\tthe penalties entirely.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter (Mutation Warrior)<\/span>: If you&#8217;re\n\t\tbuilding a melee-focuses alchemist, a single level of Fighter will get you\n\t\theavy armor, martial weapons, and a feat. A second level gets you another\n\t\tfeat, and a third will get you Mutagen from Mutation Warrior, which should\n\t\tstack with your Alchemist levels. Personally I wouldn&#8217;t take more than one\n\t\tlevel because you&#8217;ll lose too much of your alchemist extract abilities, but\n\t\ta one-level dip could be a great way to boost your capabilities in\n\t\tmelee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Master Chymist<\/span>: The Master Chymist gives\n\t\tup some of the Alchemist&#8217;s ability to create Extracts in order to focus on\n\t\tusing the Mutagen to become an alchemically-infused melee monster.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The vanilla Alchemist is a weird class. The Alchemist has the ability to fill a variety of roles: blaster, healer, striker, and support. The Alchemist&#8217;s most iconic abilities are Bombs and Mutagen, but without some serious work neither of these abilities are particularly useful to the Alchemist. Alchemists notably gain access to all of the same polymorph spells which Sorcerers and Wizards get (up to 6th-level, that is), which is an exciting option when combined with Mutagen.
