Tool Proficiencies are the same way, but tend to be overlooked and glossed over because of their supposedly narrow focus. In this guide, we\u2019ll be going over the majority of tools to find some interesting uses, like an expansion to the idea put forth in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/dungeon-masters-tools#ToolProficiencies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xanathar\u2019s Guide to Everything<\/a> starting on page 78.

Unlike most Artisan\u2019s tools, they aren&#8217;t used to really craft anything but are rather an all-purpose quick repair and patch kit. As such they have a more general synergy with every tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Repair<\/strong> &#8211; Perform repairs on a multitude of objects.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Any Tool<\/strong> &#8211; When rushing a patch job, having knowledge of both Tinker\u2019s Tools and a relevant proficiency, such as <strong>Carpenter\u2019s Tools<\/strong> for a wooden object or <strong>Cobbler\u2019s Tools<\/strong> for shoes, offsets any penalties for rushing the repairs.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weavers-tools\">Weaver\u2019s Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Whether spinning thread or sewing clothes, these are the tools you\u2019ll need to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Repair<\/strong> &#8211; Repair cloth objects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Craft Clothing<\/strong> &#8211; Make an outfit during a long rest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Animal Handling<\/strong> &#8211; Know what fur and hair make good threads helps in getting a good yield while shearing animals.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"woodcarvers-tools\">Woodcarver\u2019s Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While Carpentry is about assembling wood into structures like cabinets, Woodcarving is about making intricate designs or precise cuts into a wooden surface. Additionally Woodcarving is used for making arrows and bolts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Craft Arrows<\/strong> &#8211; Craft wooden ammunition, including arrows, bolts, and javelins, as part of a rest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Carpenter\u2019s Tools<\/strong> &#8211; Additional flourishes and other intricate design work increase the aesthetic quality of your products.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"assorted-tools\">Assorted Tools<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The rest of the tools don&#8217;t have a common category like Artisans&#8217; Tools, but that is fine. Many of these replace other forgotten skills from editions past. In the interest of removing redundancy, Instruments and Gaming Sets are going to be condensed into their categories.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disguise-kit\">Disguise Kit<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this replaced the Disguise skill. While the obvious benefit of making a mundane disguise is the primary purpose of this tool, this kit also covers the broader idea of costuming and makeup artistry in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Create Disguise<\/strong> &#8211; Assemble a disguise as part of a long rest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Musical Instruments<\/strong> &#8211; Enhancing your act with appropriate style choices will help get the crowd on your side.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"forgery-kit\">Forgery Kit<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Would you be surprised at this point if I told you that Forgery was the skill in 3.5 that this replaces? Forgery is about making convincing duplicate objects. This is not limited to documents like some might reasonably assume, but anything one could make could be forged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick Fake<\/strong> &#8211; Forge documents of varying lengths as part of a short or long rest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Artisan\u2019s Tools<\/strong> &#8211; The best way to fake the work of a master craftsperson is to <em>be<\/em> a master craftsperson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Musical Instruments<\/strong> &#8211; Knowing music theory would make forged sheet music far more convincing if you needed to do that for some reason.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gaming-sets\">Gaming Sets<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Games of chance and skill are all interchangeable as far as what they can do, but the differ in what kind of ability check they work with. Playing cards for example might be Wisdom to read your opponent without giving up anything in return, while Dragonchess is instead likely played with Intelligence checks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gambling<\/strong> &#8211; As a downtime activity, you can spend a week gambling.

It\u2019s also used for identifying plants which some might consider a Nature skill check as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brew Healing Potions<\/strong> &#8211; This proficiency allows for crafting of healing potions. While there are four rarities of potion, anything beyond the standard potion of healing is overpriced and takes far too long to craft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Identify Plants<\/strong> &#8211; Quickly identify plants.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Calligrapher\u2019s Supplies<\/strong> &#8211; Exotic dyes made from plants add that little extra to make your writing pop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Forgery Kit<\/strong> &#8211; Other strange and wonderful plants can create wondrous yet mundane inks that vanish while remaining hidden from magical scrutiny.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"musical-instruments\">Musical Instruments<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Similar to Gaming sets, the things that you can accomplish with instruments are roughly interchangeable, but while a Flute might call for a Dexterity check, holding a long note to sound an alarm with a Horn is likely to be a Constitution check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compose a Tune<\/strong> &#8211; Write a new song over a long rest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tinker\u2019s Tools<\/strong> &#8211; It\u2019s far easier to repair an instrument if you can play it to check how the repairs are going.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"navigators-tools\">Navigator\u2019s Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While Cartographer\u2019s tools are for making a map, Navigator\u2019s tools are for reading those maps. Looking to the past, the 3.5 Knowledge skills Local and Geography have been combined into this tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sighting<\/strong> &#8211; Locate your position on a chart and determine time of day with careful measurements.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance<\/strong> &#8211; By turning directions into a catchy song it will be easier for others to recall and follow them.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"poisoners-kit\">Poisoner\u2019s Kit<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Like the Herbalism kit except angry.

This tool is the new face of Open Lock and Disable Device skills from 3.5 and it\u2019s rather useful for dungeoneering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Set a Trap<\/strong> &#8211;&nbsp; Assemble a trap as part of a short rest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"synergies\">Synergies<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Poisoner\u2019s Kit<\/strong> &#8211; Salvaging the poison off of a disabled trap for later is technically recycling and therefore good for the dungeon environment.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vehicles\">Vehicles<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Classified as Tools because they don\u2019t fit anywhere else, Land and Water Vehicles are an incredibly broad category. In the majority of campaigns, this is fine because Vehicles are an unusual thing to encounter or need. In Naval or Siege Warfare campaigns however, it might be prudent to subdivide these proficiencies into more specialized roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vehicle Handling<\/strong> &#8211; When piloting, your Proficiency Bonus applies to the vehicle\u2019s AC and Saves.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"land\">Land<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Land vehicles encompass a wide array of wheeled or sledding vehicles that are usually drawn by beasts of burden. In 3.5, Knowledge Architecture and Engineering, Profession Siege Engineer, or Handle Animal were the closest relevant skills.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"siege-warfare-subdivisions\">Siege Warfare Subdivisions<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to run a game where the players are involved in this kind of warfare, I suggest narrowing this tool into a few categories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Siege Artillery<\/strong> &#8211; Everybody is going to want to be this guy, the guy that fires the ballista and rolls all the damage dice but realistically you need just one guy trained to aim. Two additional bits of advice for this one. First treat this like a weapon proficiency in every way except for how it\u2019s obtained as a tool proficiency, and second if the person using this is an Artificer don\u2019t apply the sixth level tool expertise to these attack rolls. Accuracy is bounded for a reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Siege Driver<\/strong> &#8211; This is the ability to manage and direct trained military animals to get the siege piece into position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Siege Engineer<\/strong> &#8211; Maintenance, hand-to-hand defending, loading the weapon, anything that isn\u2019t firing the weapon or steering the vehicle can be lumped in here.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"water\">Water<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Water vehicles are all types of boats, ships and sailing vessels, which should be obvious. What is less obvious is that proficiency in this tool is a combination of the 3.5 skills Profession Sailor and Use Rope. Yes, according to XGtE on page 82, Vehicles (Water) includes anything a professional sailor would know, including tying knots.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"naval-warfare-subdivisions\">Naval Warfare Subdivisions<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>In an seafaring campaign, sure you can just have everyone take Water Vehicles as a proficiency and call it good. Or you can cut this up into more specialized proficiencies. If you do divide it like this, anything ship related that isn\u2019t explicitly part of these expanded proficiencies is overlapped to all of them. For example, all of these would be proficient in any checks to adjust the sails or hoist the anchor as those are tasks that all sailors need to perform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Naval Cannoneer<\/strong> &#8211; This is all about firing those broadside attacks at the enemy ships at medium to long ranges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Naval Helmsman<\/strong> &#8211; Manning the helm of a sailing ship is quite difficult. Usually it\u2019s near the rear of the ship to lower the distance from the wheel to the rudder which puts the sails exactly in the right place to block your forward vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Naval Shipwright<\/strong> &#8211; Repairs, maintenance, all manner of other specialized tasks that keep the ship upright and afloat.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction In 5e D&amp;D, Skill Proficiencies represent an abstract set of knowledge that can be applied to ability checks.
