Unless you&#8217;re sleeping, you should always have this\n\t\trunning. The amount of additional hit points is basically an additional hit\n\t\tdie, so this goes a long way to improve your durability, making this an\n\t\texcellent option for hexblades and any other warlock planning to spend time\n\t\tin melee, but may not be as useful for other warlocks who spend their time\n\t\tfighting at range where they&#8217;re (relatively) safe. There are also more\n\t\teffective options like Inspiring Leader wich can provide larger pools of hit\n\t\ttemporary hit points, so if you have room for those options you might take\n\t\tthis early in your career then retrain it to another Invocation.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/classes#GazeofTwoMinds\" class=\"rating-red\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gaze of Two Minds<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational.

Effects don&#8217;t stack with themselves, so you can&#8217;t use\n\t\tthis to repeatedly reduce the target&#8217;s speed. The best case I can think of\n\t\tfor this is if you&#8217;re heavily reliant on area control spells like Hunger of\n\t\tHadar or Sickening Radiance which rely on ongoing damage being applied over\n\t\tseveral rounds. In those cases, reducing creatures&#8217; speed can help keep\n\t\tenemies in the area. Of course, you can accomplish the same thing by moving\n\t\ttargets with Grasp of Hadar or Repelling Blast, and since Repelling Blast\n\t\tcan work more than once per target they&#8217;re likely to be more effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/classes#MaskofManyFaces\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mask of Many Faces<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: In a game involving stealth or intrigue the ability to disguise yourself\n\t\tis a big advantage.

Even if magic items are available, many magic weapons don&#8217;t\n\t\toffer +1 to attacks and damage, and any bonus to attack rolls is great. The\n\t\tability to conjure longbows also means that melee warlocks can easily switch\n\t\tto ranged combat, and can entirely forgo Eldritch Blast and the invocations\n\t\twhich warlocks typically spend to optimize it.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/warlock#InvestmentoftheChainMaster\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Investment of the Chain Master<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: (Pact of the Chain) Essentially required for Pact of the Chain.

Melee warlocks can capitalize on this by\n\t\tdiving into groups of enemies and attempting to catch as many as possible in\n\t\tthe area. If enemies attempt to flee, take opportunity attacks, then chase\n\t\tthem down on the following turn. Against enemies that are especially hard to\n\t\thit, force them into a corner, block their escape, stand next to them, and\n\t\tDodge. The damage is guaranteed and doesn&#8217;t allow a save, so against many\n\t\tenemies you can stand still and wait for them to fall over. Still, I\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t take this on any warlock except the Hexblade, and Poison damage is\n\t\tcommonly resisted so you can&#8217;t always count on it to be effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/subclasses#EldritchSmite\" class=\"rating-orange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eldritch Smite<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: (Pact of the Blade) This is rarely worth a spell slot to activate.

Knocking enemies prone\n\t\tis tempting, but it also makes them hard for you to hit with ranged attacks,\n\t\tincluding Eldritch Blast. Your best bet is to reserve this for when you\n\t\tscore a critical hit, at which point you can choose to use Eldritch Smite\n\t\tand double the damage dice.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/warlock#FarScribe\" class=\"rating-red\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Far Scribe<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: (Pact of the Tome) Very cool, but very situational.

Hex has some overlap\n\t\twith Bestow Curse, providing a similar debuff to ability scores and a\n\t\tsimilar damage buff, but Hex doesn&#8217;t allow the target a saving throw and\n\t\tallows you to move the spell between targets so you get considerably more\n\t\tbenefit from your tiny number of spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/classes#ThirstingBlade\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thirsting Blade<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: (Pact of the Blade) Crucial for Hexblades to keep pace with more\n\t\tconventional melee characters who get Extra Attack at 5th level, but you may\n\t\tdo better with a melee cantrip like Booming Blade unless you&#8217;re also looking\n\t\tat options like Great Weapon Master or Sharpshooter.
