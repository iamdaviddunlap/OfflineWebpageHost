Themed around nature and\n\texploration, the Ranger is a welcome asset in parties exploring untamed lands\n\tabove or below ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Ranger can fill the role of either a Fighter-equivalent or a\n\tRogue-equivalent (sometimes both), and works well as a Scout and Striker, but\n\ttrades the Fighter&#8217;s durability for better skills and improved damage output.\n\tWhile they do have the ability to cast spells, and can therefore provide\n\thealing and utility options, the Ranger doesn&#8217;t have nearly enough magic to\n\tserve as a Healer or a Utility caster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Rangers are a cool concept that has long captured players&#8217; imaginations, but\n\tthey&#8217;ve been plagued by mechanical issues since they were first introduced,\n\tliterally decades before the original release of 5th edition Dungeons and\n\tDragons. The features which make them unique and interesting often go unused\n\tbecause they force rangers to specialize in solving problems and fighting\n\tenemies which players can&#8217;t guarantee that they&#8217;ll face. The Ranger&#8217;s Favored\n\tEnemy and Natural Explorer features ask players to choose creatures and places\n\twhich the Ranger specializes in fighting, and if those things don&#8217;t appear in\n\tthe game the features are essentially wasted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further torment ranger players, the Beast Master subclass as it was\n\tpublished in the Player&#8217;s Handbook was so frustratingly bad that it poisoned\n\tthe community&#8217;s opinion of rangers to the point that years later the Ranger is\n\tstill the character optimization community&#8217;s favorite punching bag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>But 5+ years into 5e&#8217;s life span, the Ranger has come into its own.

Rangers also get three skills, which is unusually\n\thigh, but since Rangers fall somewhere between a Fighter-equivalent and\n\tRogue-equivalent, it makes sense that they get an extra skill.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Favored Enemy<\/span>: Situational by nature, and\n\tthe bonuses you gain against the subject are somewhat small.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Favored Enemy is perhaps more indicative of the problems with the Ranger than\n\tany other part of the class: it requires the player to make a decision which\n\tis unchangeable and which is often made with little or no information guiding\n\tthat decision, and if the player makes the wrong decision they may never\n\tbenefit from the feature even if they&#8217;re fortunate enough to play that\n\tcharacter all the way to level 20. And even in those cases where the player\n\thas the right Favored Enemy, the effects are so minor and fleeting that it\n\tfeels like there&#8217;s no benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aberrations<\/span>: One of the more numerous\n\t\tcreature types, but very few have a CR above 10.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Beasts<\/span>: Beasts are common at low levels,\n\t\tbut very few beasts have a CR above 5 so you&#8217;ll stop facing them early in\n\t\tyour career.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestiais<\/span>: Like Fiends, but only select\n\t\tthis in an evil campaign.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Constructs<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t a lot of\n\t\tconstructs in the Monster Manual, and they don&#8217;t appear frequently because\n\t\tthey&#8217;re hard to shoe-horn into many adventures. Plus, how often do you need\n\t\tto track a golem which was created to guard a room?<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dragons<\/span>: Dragons are a tempting option\n\t\tbecause they&#8217;re so iconic and scary, but they&#8217;re also a bad option because\n\t\tthere are so few of them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elementals<\/span>: There are very few elemental\n\t\tcreatures which frequent appearances as enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Fey<\/span>: There are almost no Fey in the Monster\n\t\tManual, and their CRs are all very low.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiends<\/span>: A great option, especially in an\n\t\tall-good campaign. Fiends are numerous, and run the whole CR range.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Giants<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t a ton of giants,\n\t\tand their highest CR is 13.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Monstrosities<\/span>: There are a lot of great\n\t\tmonsters which qualify as &#8220;Monstrosities&#8221;, but very few of them have a CR\n\t\tabove 11.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Oozes<\/span>: There are almost no oozes in the\n\t\tMonster Manual.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Plants<\/span>: There are very few plant monsters\n\t\tin the game.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Undead<\/span>: Iconic, numerous, and consisting\n\t\tof a long list of enemies running the whole CR range. Undead pop up in many\n\t\tcampaigns, even those where undead aren&#8217;t a major them, so they&#8217;re a good,\n\t\treliable option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Humanoid<\/span>: Humanoids are hard to pin\n\t\tdown. Depending on your campaign, you may face a huge number of humanoids or\n\t\tyou may face absolutely none. Only select humanoids if you know that you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing to face them. Since you get to pick two types of humanoids, I\n\t\trecommend Humans and another race which is prominent in the campaign&#8217;s\n\t\tsetting.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your group is using Optional Class Features, consider trading Favored Enemy for Favored Foe (yes, I know those are synonyms). See below, under &#8220;Optional Class Features&#8221;, for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Natural Explorer<\/span>: You get three choices\n\tover the course of your career, so hopefully your campaign doesn&#8217;t involve a\n\thuge amount of traveling. The bonuses are fairly small, but fit the flavor the\n\tclass.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>If your group is using Optional Class Features, consider trading Natural Explorer for Deft Explorer. See below, under &#8220;Optional Class Features&#8221;, for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Style<\/span>: Rangers get a subset of the\n\tFighting Styles available to Fighters, but the ones they get offer plenty of\n\toptions. Unlike Fighters, Rangers only get one Fighting Style so it&#8217;s\n\timportant to pick one that fits your build since you won&#8217;t get to pick a\n\tsupplemental style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The options below include the optional fighting styles introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything. Check with your DM before assuming that those styles are allowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more detailed advice on Fighting Styles, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fighting-styles\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24309\">Practical Guide to Fighting Styles<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archery<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: The obvious choice for ranged builds. +2 to hit is a big deal in a game\n\t\twhere a 20th-level character can expect a maximum of +11 to hit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blind Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): This one is\n\t\thard. Blindsight, even at just 10-foot range, is extremely useful. It solves\n\t\tissues of invisible enemies, it helps make up for lack of magical options\n\t\tfor Darkvision, and it addresses effects which block line of sight like fog,\n\t\tmagical darkness, or other stuff. But those effects don&#8217;t appear in most\n\t\tencounters, so this is only situationally useful. When it works it&#8217;s great,\n\t\tbut the rest of the time it&#8217;s useless. Unless you have allies in the party\n\t\twho plan to frequently use magical darkness or other options to obscure\n\t\tvision I would skip this.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Races which suffer from Sunlight Sensitivity might consider this as a\n\t\t\tsolution to their sunlight issues. If you don a blindfold (or close your\n\t\t\teyes), your DM may allow you to overcome the effects of Sunlight\n\t\t\tSensitivity by willingly blinding yourself. The text of Sunlight\n\t\t\tSensitivity isn&#8217;t perfectly clear if it only applies to attacks which rely\n\t\t\ton sight, so this may not work RAW, but the idea makes sense.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Defense<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: AC boosts are great, but Rangers are Strikers at heart and you need a\n\t\tFighting Style which boosts your damage output. Of course, Beast Master\n\t\tRangers may prefer to rely more heavily on their companion for offense, so a\n\t\tboost to AC can allow you to protect yourself while your companion does the\n\t\twork.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Druidic Warrior<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Access to cantrips allows the Ranger to build around spellcasting as\n\t\ttheir primary combat option. Shillelagh is your go-to choice for melee\n\t\tcombat, and Produce Flame is your go-to ranged option. If you can do without\n\t\tone or both of those options, Guidance is a great utility, and Thunderclap\n\t\tcan help handle crowds.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While Druidic Warrior allows the Ranger to be built around Wisdom instead\n\t\t\tof Strength or Dexterity, it comes with its own complications.\n\t\t\tWisdom-based builds will need medium armor, which means that you need 14\n\t\t\tDexterity and you&#8217;ll suffer Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks\n\t\t\tjust like Strength-based builds. Rangers also have very little\n\t\t\tspellcasting and few directly offensive spells, so your Wisdom score\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t do as much for the Ranger as it does for the Druid.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you look at the pros and cons of Druidic Warrior and you still want to\n\t\t\tuse it on a ranger, the last question you need to ask yourself is &#8220;what\n\t\t\twill this character do that a druid couldn&#8217;t do better?&#8221; If you have an\n\t\t\tanswer to that question which satisfies you (and there are some good\n\t\t\tanswers), Druidic Warrior will work fine. Beast Master is a great go-to\n\t\t\texample; since you can rely on your beast in combat, focusing on Wisdom\n\t\t\tand spellcasting is often much easier. But for many other subclasses,\n\t\t\tsticking to weapons is often a better choice.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dueling<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Note that this works while using a shield. 2 damage closes the damage gap\n\t\tbetween a longsword and a two-handed weapon (4.5-&gt;6.5 vs. 6.5\/7). For\n\t\tmany subclasses, this is the go-to melee option because your Bonus Action\n\t\tmay be monopolized by other things like commanding a beast companion or\n\t\tusing features like Planar Warrior.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Thrown Weapon Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional) Finally a way\n\t\tto make thrown weapons workable in 5e! Unlike a bow or crossbow, you can use\n\t\tthrown weapons one-handed and some even work effectively with two-weapon\n\t\tfighting since thrown weapons are usually melee weapons with the Thrown\n\t\tproperty. If you&#8217;re using magic weapons you may have some trouble since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re repeatedly throwing your weapons away, but you&#8217;ll be able to recover\n\t\tthem after combat.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Thrown Weapon Fighting has some unique interactions with other fighting\n\t\t\tstyles. If you use a melee weapon with the light and thrown property like\n\t\t\thandaxes, you can benefit from the Two-Weapon Fighter style. If you take\n\t\t\tthe Dual Wielder feat, you can upgrade to Javelins. If you instead use\n\t\t\tranged weapons with the thrown property like darts, you can benefit from\n\t\t\tthe Archery style, adding +2 to both attacks <em>and<\/em> damage. That\n\t\t\tallows you to match the average damage of a longbow while still holding a\n\t\t\tshield.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>To summarize: This is probably the most complex Fighting Style because\n\t\t\tyou need to combine it with other options (feats and\/or another Fighting Style)\n\t\t\tto make it truly effective, but those complex interactions also allow\n\t\t\tsome really fun combinations. I don&#8217;t recommend this for new players, but\n\t\t\tan experienced player could build a very interesting character around\n\t\t\tthis.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: One of the biggest issues with two-weapon fighting is that you don&#8217;t get\n\t\tto add your ability modifier to your off-hand attack without this fighting\n\t\tstyle, and taking this style makes it considerably more viable. Unlike a\n\t\tFighter, TWF is a perfectly viable option for many Rangers. Hunter&#8217;s Mark\n\t\tadds a small but notable damage boost which closes the damage gap between\n\t\tgreatswords and short swords, making TWF highly effective for Rangers since\n\t\tthe extra attack offers an additional opportunity to deliver Hunter&#8217;s Mark&#8217;s\n\t\tdamage boost.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, two-weapon fighting struggles with the action economy. Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\t\tMark requires a Bonus Action to cast or re-assign, so in the heat of\n\t\t\tcombat you often need to decide between using Hunter&#8217;s Mark or making your\n\t\t\tadditional attack. Many subclasses also have features like Planar Warrior\n\t\t\tor Slayer&#8217;s Prey which also consume your Bonus Action, as do many other\n\t\t\tranger spells so for many subclasses you&#8217;ll find that your Bonus Action is\n\t\t\tin use too often to make use of two-weapon fighting. TWF can still work\n\t\t\tvery well for the Hunter, but many other subclasses should avoid it.\n\t\t\tBefore you commit to this, take a good look at your subclass and see if\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll need your Bonus Action to activate subclass features.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Rangers have a really\n\tinteresting spell list with a lot of unique options exclusive to the Ranger.\n\tHowever, nearly every spell on the list uses Concentration, so it&#8217;s really\n\thard to use more than one spell at a time.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>For help selecting spells, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/spells\"\n\t\t>Ranger Spell List Breakdown<\/a\n\t>.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ranger Archetype<\/strong>: Ranger subclasses are briefly summarized\n\tbelow.

The fact that this costs spell slots to activate is\n\tfrankly insulting. Primeval Awareness is so laughably useless that if you\n\tsimply removed it from the Ranger no one would notice. I once had a ranger in\n\tmy party use it while we were trying to search for some undead enemies. They\n\tread the effect, the DM told us &#8220;Yes&#8221;, and the entire group paused in stunned\n\tsilence to reflect on how truly worthless Primeval Awareness is even in a\n\tsituatio perfectly suited for Primeval Awareness to succeed.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>If your DM allows it, trade Primeval Awareness for the Primal Awareness\n\tOptional Class Feature.

These rules are optional, and you should not assume that your DM will allow these features without consulting them first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments and suggestions for specific Optional Class Features are presented here, but for more information on handling Optional Class Features in general, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\">Practical Guide to Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rangers have received more Optional Class Features than any other class. Of every &#8220;replacement&#8221; feature published, only one of them isn&#8217;t a Ranger feature. Wizards of the Coast saw the problems and they gave us a ton of tools to fix them. Because there are so many Optional Class Features for the ranger, you may need to be more cautious when consider the new features than you would with other classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deft Explorer<\/span> (Replacement): Deft Explorer\n\treplaces each of the three favored terrains which the Ranger gains as they\n\tgain levels.<\/p\n>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Canny<\/span>: Expertise in one skill and two free\n\t\tlanguages. Expertise in a skill helps close the skill gap between the Ranger\n\t\tand the Rogue. The languages seem like a weird choice since rangers make\n\t\tterrible Faces (the Fey Wanderer is an exception). Personally I&#8217;d like the\n\t\tability to trade the languages for tool or vehicle proficiencies, but you\n\t\tcan always get those from your background if you need to. Normally if you\n\t\twant Expertise I recommend a level in rogue, but this makes that class dip\n\t\tless important.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Roving<\/span>: Climb speeds are the next best\n\t\tthings to fly speeds. Swim speeds are only occasionally useful, and if you\n\t\twant the swim speed for an aquatic campaign it won&#8217;t solve the issue of\n\t\tbreathing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tireless<\/span>: Activate the temporary hit\n\t\tpoints after every fight. It&#8217;s a free hit die worth of hit points. The\n\t\tExhaustion removal is only situationally useful, but it has the hilarious\n\t\tbenefit of allowing you to negate the effects of starvation and dehydration\n\t\tby taking a nap.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p\n\t>I hate the Natural Explorer feature to a degree that I can&#8217;t adequately\n\tjustify, and which I definitely can&#8217;t justify explaining twice in one article\n\t(see the assessment above, under Ranger Class Features). Replacing Natural\n\tExplorer with Deft Explorer is a dramatic improvement on the Ranger in every\n\tsense: more effective mechanically, simpler and more satisfying to play, and\n\tmore interesting.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Deft Explorer on all single-class rangers. It allows\n\tthem to more easily fill a role as the party&#8217;s Rogue-equivalent, and it fits\n\tthe theme of the Ranger as a capable and hardy explorer very well. It&#8217;s a\n\tlinear buff to the class and the Ranger gives up basically nothing to get Deft\n\tExplorer, but in the case of the Ranger I really don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a\n\tproblem.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Favored Foe<\/span> (Replacement): A small damage\n\tboost once per turn. This has two interesting benefits to the function of the\n\tRanger which go far beyond &#8220;deal extra&#8221; damage. First, builds which don&#8217;t\n\tattack as a Bonus Action feel less weak compared to two-weapon fighting and\n\tcrossbow expert builds, and subclasses like the Horizon Walker which have\n\treliable Bonus Action features don&#8217;t need to choose between ignoring subclass\n\tfeatures and getting more damage out of Hunter&#8217;s Mark.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>Second, Hunter&#8217;s Mark becomes less of a crucial damage option and therefore\n\tless of a tax on the Ranger&#8217;s limited pools of spell slots and spells known.\n\tHunters Mark is still good, and it&#8217;s is still better for rangers who can make\n\tnumerous attacks than Favored Foe is, but Favored Foe can frequently cover\n\tsituations where you can&#8217;t manage Hunter&#8217;s Mark, and it&#8217;s close enough in\n\teffectiveness that you could use your spell slots (and your Bonus Action) for\n\tsomething more exciting.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Favored Foe on all single-class rangers. Favored Foe\n\tisn&#8217;t a fantastic ability, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be. It&#8217;s always useful, and\n\tthough the damage bonus is small it&#8217;s reliable and doesn&#8217;t require guesswork\n\tfor the player to make it effective. It also reduces the need to take Hunter&#8217;s\n\tMark, removing a frustrating tax on the Ranger&#8217;s extremely limited pool of\n\tspells known.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Additional Ranger Spells<\/span> (Addition): The\n\tRanger&#8217;s spell list is small, weird, and limited. It&#8217;s best known for\n\tsignature spells like Hunter&#8217;s Mark and Zephyr Strike, but since the Ranger\n\tdraws most of its spells from the Druid&#8217;s spell list while being so much worse\n\tas spell casting, most of the Ranger&#8217;s spell list isn&#8217;t worth exploring. The\n\tnew spells add a lot of really interesting options which give the Ranger\n\tsomething worthy of their Concentration that&#8217;s not Hunter&#8217;s Mark or Guardian\n\tof Nature.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>There are some odd options here. Searing Smite is a weird choice, and Aid,\n\tRevivify, and Greater Restoration feel somewhat out of place. But considering\n\tthat Revivify was added to the Druid, and that the Ranger gets those spells\n\tconsiderably later than other spellcasters, I think they&#8217;re interesting\n\tadditions that introduce some very important new capabilities to the Ranger\n\twithout making them outshine other classes like the Druid.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing the additional spells on all rangers. The Ranger&#8217;s spell\n\tlist has long been a pain point, and expanding those options means that we may\n\tfinally see some diversity in spells known since there are more than a handful\n\tof worthwhile spells on the spell list.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighting Style Options<\/span> (Addition): Exciting\n\tnew options. Druidic Warrior is notably exclusive to the ranger, allowing\n\tplayers to explore a more casting-focused ranger and potentially build around\n\tWisdom rather than Strength or Dexterity. The new options are all interesting new\n\tbuild concepts, though they&#8217;re no more powerful than those which are already\n\tavailable.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing the new Fighting Style options on all rangers. I don&#8217;t\n\texpect the new options to supplant Archery or Two-Weapon Fighting as the best\n\toptions for the Ranger, but the new options introduce exciting new build\n\tpossibilities. Plus, rangers still only get one unless they spend a feat or\n\tmulticlass.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting Focus<\/span> (Addition): The flavor\n\tmakes sense, but for the vast majority of character using a spellcasting focus\n\tinstead of a spell component pouch is a purely cosmetic change. The one\n\texception is using a staff, which can also double as a quarterstaff, making\n\tthe staff an effective choice if you want to combine Shillelagh, a\n\tquarterstaff, a shield, and potentially the Polearm Master feat.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Spellcasting Focus on all rangers. The impact is\n\textremely minor, but the flavor is fun.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Awareness<\/span> (Replacement): Five free\n\tspells known isn&#8217;t a huge benefit, and all of the spells are situational, but\n\tgetting them for free means that rangers (who must permanently learn spells\n\trather than preparing them) actually have a chance of casting these spells\n\tfrom time to time. Giving up Primeval Awareness for even something as modest\n\tas Primal Awareness is a good trade.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Primal Awareness on all rangers. It allows some very\n\tsituational spells to see some use without a druid needing to take a Long\n\tRest, and rangers get so few spell slots that it&#8217;s not going to upset your\n\tgame.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Martial Versatility<\/span> (Addition): Being locked\n\tinto your choice of Fighting Style at level 2 gives you very little time to\n\tdecide on how your ranger is going to fight. The ability to change styles\n\toccasionally makes that decision less permanent, and allows you to change\n\tstyles if something happens like you find a cool weapon or you need to switch\n\troles within the party.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Martial Versatility on all rangers. Like with other\n\tretraining mechanics, players still can&#8217;t have more options at the same time\n\tthan they could get if they didn&#8217;t retrain, so players will be more satisfied\n\twith their character but won&#8217;t actually be any stronger than they could be.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature\u2019s Veil<\/span> (Replacement): The uses for\n\tthis are impressively numerous, and getting as many as 6 uses per day means\n\tthat you can make this a g-oto tactical option. Turn invisible to run out of\n\tmelee or to quickly sneak between cover. Turn invisible to dart into melee\n\tunnoticed before ambushing someone. Turn invisible to get Advantage on your\n\tnext attack. Get creative.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Nature&#8217;s Veil on all rangers using subclasses which I&#8217;ve\n\trated <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span> or lower. This is a powerful\n\tfeature that can allow the ranger to do a lot of stuff which normally requires\n\tmagic, and the more powerful subclasses don&#8217;t need the additional tactical\n\toption to be competitive with other classes.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>For the vast majority of rangers, Dexterity dominates the Ranger&#8217;s abilities\n\tbecause rangers are most effective in light armor using finesse weapons or\n\tranged weapons. Constitution is always helpful, and rangers should invest a\n\tlittle bit in Wisdom to support their spellcasting and crucial skills like\n\tPerception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength-based builds are possible, but face additional difficulties not\n\tfaced by Dexterity-based builds. Half plate (the best medium armor) imposes\n\tDisadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and thrown weapons have much\n\tshorter range than bows. Rangers are most likely to stick to one-handed melee\n\tweapons, and the rapier is just as good as any one-handed weapon which you\n\twould use with Strength. You&#8217;ll be able to use two-handed melee weapons, but\n\tthere&#8217;s very little reason to do so when so much of the Ranger&#8217;s damage can\n\tcome from Favored Foe and Hunter&#8217;s Mark. To summarize: Strength-based builds\n\tsuffer immediate setbacks, and gain essentially no benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Fighting Style (Druidic Warrior) allows for Wisdom-based builds.\n\tTake the Shillelagh cantrip and a ranged attack cantrip like Produce Flame,\n\tand you can fight both in melee and at range using Wisdom instead of Strength\n\tor Dexterity. Furthermore, your spellcasting will be more effective. However,\n\tyou&#8217;ll likely resort to medium armor and suffer the same challenges Dexterity\n\t(Stealth) checks faced by Strength-based builds. The improved spellcasting and\n\tWisdom-based skills may be worth the trade, but this is an unusual build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: With light\/medium armor you need\n\tDexterity for AC. Since you have Dexterity for AC, you may as well use it for\n\tweapons. Since you&#8217;re using Dexterity for weapons, you can dump Strength. The\n\tonly exception is if you decide to use a polearm for some reason.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity fuels the majority of what\n\tthe Ranger does. Even for builds that aren&#8217;t Dexterity-based, you need at\n\tleast 14 to fill out the Dexterity cap on Half Plate.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: As a martial character rangers should\n\texpect to draw a lot of fire, so you need the hit points to handle it.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: A bit for Investigation and Nature\n\tmight be nice, but you don&#8217;t really need it.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Adds to spells and eventually to Foe\n\tSlayer.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Dex-Based<\/th><th><\/th><th>Str-Based<\/th><th><\/th><th>Wis-Based<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Ranger Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Rangers are a MAD class, but not so much as the Paladin or the Monk.

You don&#8217;t get a bonus to attack and damage, so this only better than a non-magic javelin in that you don&#8217;t need to juggle items and that it&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s not a perfect\nsolution for a thrown weapon build, but those are few and far between without an artificer in the party.\n<p>If you&#8217;re eyeing a throw weapon build, you&#8217;ll run into issues with this. Fighting Style (Thrown Weapon Fighting) only works with weapons with the Thrown property, and while the shield allows you to make a weapon attack, it does not have the Thrown property. Similarly, this won&#8217;t work with Fighting Style (Archery) because it&#8217;s not a ranged weapon.

It doesn&#8217;t require attunement, and has a fly speed of 50 feet,\n\t\tthough many medium characters will exceed the 200 pound limit to reduce the\n\t\tspeed to 30 feet, but even then 30 feet fly speed with no duration cap and\n\t\trequiring no action after speaking the command word is absolutely\n\t\tincredible. The only drawback is that you&#8217;re using the item&#8217;s speed rather\n\t\tthan giving yourself a fly speed, so things that improve your speed won&#8217;t\n\t\tmake the broom move faster, and you can&#8217;t Dash with the broom.

With a 1-hour duration, you can easily stretch one spell slot through every encounter you&#8217;ll face between short rests. Unfortunately that may mean that one third of your day doesn&#8217;t include Hunter&#8217;s Mark (assuming the &#8220;Adventuring Day&#8221; rules in the DMG, which suggest two short rests in a full day of adventuring).<br><br>On days when you stop to take a long rest, cast Goodberry with all of your remaining spell slots. There&#8217;s no cap on how many hit points you can heal from Goodberry, so each casting gives you and your party 10 hit points worth of healing that you can consume between fights to stretch other resources like hit dice and other healing magic.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Ranger Archetype: Hunter<br>Hunter&#8217;s Prey<br>Primeval Awareness<\/td><td>If you took Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting, take Hunter&#8217;s Prey:\n\t\t\t\t\tColossus Slayer. If you took Fighting Style: Archery, take\n\t\t\t\t\tHordebreaker.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Dexterity 16 -&gt; 18)<\/td><td>More AC, better attacks, and better damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<\/td><td>Any martial class loves Extra Attack.<br><br>5th level also\n\t\t\t\t\tbrings 2nd-level spells, including a few notably useful options.\n\t\t\t\t\tLesser Restoration allows you to contribute your limited healing\n\t\t\t\t\tcapabilities, and Spike Growth provides an excellent area control\n\t\t\t\t\toption. Pass Without Trace offers a significant bonus to Dexterity\n\t\t\t\t\t(Stealth) checks, allowing even clumsy, heavily-armored party members\n\t\t\t\t\tto accompany you with a decent chance of going unnoticed.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Favored Enemy improvements<br>Natural Explorer improvements<\/td><td>Choose another favored enemy and another favored terrain. All of the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame issues apply, but hopefully by now you know where the bulk of the\n\t\t\t\t\tcampaign will be taking place and who the primary antagonists are.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Defensive Tactics: Multiattack Defense<\/td><td>Multiattack Defense is the best option for Defensive Tactics. Escape\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Horde is tempting for melee builds, but at that point just\n\t\t\t\t\tDisengage and make better use of your next turn.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Dexterity 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>Your AC now hits its maximum at 17 in studded leather, and your\n\t\t\t\t\tattacks and damage improve.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Nothing at this level except 3rd-level spells. You get some fun\n\t\t\t\t\toptions like Conjure Animals, but remember that anything which\n\t\t\t\t\trequires Concentration will conflict with Hunter&#8217;s Mark. You can also\n\t\t\t\t\tcast Hunter&#8217;s Mark as a 3rd-level spell to make it last 8 hours,\n\t\t\t\t\tallowing you to stretch a single casting all day long provided that\n\t\t\t\t\tyou can maintain Concentration.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Natural Explorer improvement<br>Hide in Plain Sight<\/td><td>Your last favored terrain. Hopefully you&#8217;ve covered enough bases that\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll never be outside of your favored terrain.<br><br>Hide in\n\t\t\t\t\tPlain Sight isn&#8217;t what it was in previous editions. In previous\n\t\t\t\t\teditions you could simply hide where you stood. I guess WotC realized\n\t\t\t\t\thow problematic that was without using a spell, so now you need to\n\t\t\t\t\tspend some time camouflaging yourself. Since it takes a full minute\n\t\t\t\t\tand requires you to remain still, you&#8217;ll need to use this for spying\n\t\t\t\t\ton or ambushing enemies. Combine it with Spike Growth and you can turn\n\t\t\t\t\tan area into a killing field with a few minutes of preparation.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Multiattack<\/td><td>Multiattack is split into a clearly melee-oriented option and a clearly ranged option. Volley is for archers, and Whirlwind Attack is for two-weapon fighters. However, note that neither of these actions is the &#8220;Attack&#8221; action, so you can&#8217;t actually do two-weapon fighting, and if you took Crossbow Expert, you can&#8217;t use the bonus action extra attack. Either way, Multiattack won&#8217;t be your go-to option. Look for opportunities to use it, but in most cases enemies won&#8217;t be neatly clustered enough for you to get more attacks from Multiattack than from a normal Attack.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Constitution 14 -&gt; 16)<\/td><td>With maximized Dexterity, it&#8217;s time to start improving other ability scores. We started with 16 Wisdom, which is absolutely plenty for the ranger, so focus on increasing your Constitution instead to get the extra hit points. Your AC is going to be stuck at 17 for the rest of your character&#8217;s career (excluding spells and magic items) so you need all the durability you can get.<br><br>The one counterpoint which might convince you to increase Wisdom instead of Constitution is Foe Slayer. Foe Slayer is based on your Wisdom bonus, and it&#8217;s pretty good. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s 8 levels off, and if you don&#8217;t live to level 20 it won&#8217;t matter how high your Wisdom is.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Nothing at this level except 4th-level spells. This is very exciting,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut with just 4 spells included in the SRD you have very few\n\t\t\t\t\toptions.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Favored Enemy improvement<br>Vanish<\/td><td>Vanish is considerably more useful for archers than it is for melee\n\t\t\t\t\trangers, but even a melee ranger is good with a bow. If you need to\n\t\t\t\t\tavoid attention, jump in a bush and snipe things.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Superior Hunter&#8217;s Defense<\/td><td>Rogues get both Evasion <em>and<\/em> Uncanny Dodge, but you are\n\t\t\t\t\tforced to choose one or the other. I recommend Evasion for archery\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilds and Uncanny Dodge for melee builds.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Constitution 16 -&gt; 18)<\/td><td>More constitution gets us a nice pile of extra hit points at this\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Nothing at this level except 5th-level spells, and the SRD contains\n\t\t\t\t\tjust two 5th-level Ranger spells. Look at your lower-level spells for\n\t\t\t\t\toptions that work well when cast with a higher-level spell slot.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Feral Senses<\/td><td>Invisible creatures were a problem long before this. Hopefully by\n\t\t\t\t\tthis level you&#8217;ve found a solution to that challenge, but Feral Senses\n\t\t\t\t\tis likely a better solution.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Constitution 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>You&#8217;re now as durable as you can get, which is nice considering that\n\t\t\t\t\tyour AC is still stuck at 17, while enemies&#8217; attack bonuses and damage\n\t\t\t\t\thave gradually climbed over time. If you&#8217;re doing alright with 18\n\t\t\t\t\tConstitution, you might increase Wisdom instead to get another point\n\t\t\t\t\tout of Foe Slayer now that it&#8217;s only one level away.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Foe Slayer<\/td><td>This is the first time our 16 Wisdom has ever been a setback, but the difference between +3 and +4 typically won&#8217;t be a problem.<br><br>Foe Slayer can turn a miss into a hit since you can use it after the roll is made, so the primary use case is as an attack bonus. Turning a miss into a hit will deal more damage than applying the +3 damage. If you make it to your last attack for the turn and all of your attacks either hit or rolled too low to save, use Foe Slayer for the bonus damage. You can use it once every turn, and you should make every effort to do so.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the
