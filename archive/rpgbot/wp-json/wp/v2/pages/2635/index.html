Your best bet is to throw this on an ally\n\t\tbefore going into combat, but if you have that luxury you should be casting\n\t\ta better Concentration spell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sacred Flame<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Probably the best\n\t\tsource of radiant damage in the game. It&#8217;s a reliable way to kill zombies,\n\t\tand since it requires a saving throw rather than an attack you can use it\n\t\tagainst adjacent enemies without issue. As the damage scales, it will easily\n\t\toutpace your damage with a weapon, so by 11th level there is usually no\n\t\treason to keep a weapon in your hand.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spare the Dying<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Tempting, but once\n\t\tyou&#8217;re got a reasonable number of spell slots, you can just use Healing\n\t\tWord.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Thaumaturgy<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Thematically fun, but\n\t\tnot especially useful.

I would only use this in encounters where you&#8217;re vastly\n\t\toutnumbered, and even then it&#8217;s typically better to use area damage or\n\t\tcontrol spell spells to eliminate enemies rather than debuffing them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bless<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: At low levels Bless can\n\t\tdecide if you win or lose a fight, but even at very high levels adding 1d4\n\t\tto attack rolls can dramatically improve your party&#8217;s damage output. This\n\t\tgets better as your party gains the ability to make more numerous attacks,\n\t\tso if you have fighters, warlocks, or characters who use two-weapon\n\t\tfighting, Crossbow Expert, or Polearm Master, this will get a ton of\n\t\tmileage. If you&#8217;re not concentrating on anything else, Bless is a great\n\t\tgo-to option in nearly any case.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-none\">Ceremony<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is a weird spell.\n\t\tThe fact that it exists implies that clerics perform burial rites, wedding\n\t\tceremonies, and rites of passage magically at a cost of 25gp each.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>It certainly feels cool for a cleric to have a dedicated mechanic for\n\t\t\tperforming these functions, but I don&#8217;t know why this isn&#8217;t just a\n\t\t\tReligion check or something. It also creates a bizarre economic divide\n\t\t\tbecause of the 25gp price tag between people who can and can&#8217;t afford to\n\t\t\tblow that gold on making a religious ceremony literally magic.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Regardless of all of that, the spell provides weird incentives to do\n\t\t\tthings like getting married before a dungeon crawl or a boss fight. As a\n\t\t\tDM I would discourage players from abusing these options.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Command<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Enough effects to be\n\t\tuseful in some situations, but it&#8217;s a single-target spell so at low levels\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t afford to spend a spell slot on this. Consider picking this up a\n\t\tfew levels into your career.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create or Destroy Water<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ability to\n\t\tmagically create water has many uses. Few of them are combat-related, but\n\t\tthis neatly solves a major component of any survival scenario.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cure Wounds<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: More healing than\n\t\tHealing Word, but rarely a good option in combat. If you use this in combat,\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll frequently find that you&#8217;re spending spell slots to heal less damage\n\t\tthan enemies are dealing by waving their claws about.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Evil and Good<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situationally useful,\n\t\tand you can use it to find invisible enemies or detect enemies through thin\n\t\twalls.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Magic<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Someone needs to have\n\t\tit in every party. Cast it as a ritual if you can.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Poison and Disease<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very situational, and\n\t\tunless you can also cast Protection From Poison there&#8217;s little you can do\n\t\tabout it anyway. Fortunately, you can cast this as a ritual.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guiding Bolt<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Great single-target\n\t\tdamage for a 1st-level spell, and even though the Advantage only applies for\n\t\tone attack it&#8217;s easy to have an ally follow your Guiding Bolt with another\n\t\tspell or with a high-powered attack like a Sneak Attack.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Word<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Because death is so\n\t\tgentle in 5e, Healing Word is extremely powerful. You can save it for when\n\t\tyour allies drop to 0, get them back on their feet, then wait to heal them\n\t\tagain until they get dropped back to 0. Since this is a bonus action, you\n\t\tcan still use your action to hit something with a mace or cast a\n\t\tcantrip.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Inflict Wounds<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Inflict Wounds is the\n\t\thighest single-target damage of any 1st-level spell (though Magic Missile is\n\t\tstill better in some ways). If you can get Advantage to make the attack more\n\t\treliable, it&#8217;s easily one of the best offensive options around at 1st level.\n\t\tThe average of 16.5 damage will one-shot most monsters of CR 1\/2 and below.\n\t\tGranted, the <em>only<\/em> thing that Inflict Wounds does is damage, so you\n\t\tmay get more out of other spells like Guiding Bolt which provide secondary\n\t\teffects which may lead to more damage in total.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Evil and Good<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A great defensive\n\t\toption at any level, but Sanctuary will be more effective in melee and\n\t\tSanctuary doesn&#8217;t care about creature type.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Purify Food and Drink<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Cast this as a ritual\n\t\tand you&#8217;ll never need to worry about spoiled food again. One of many reasons\n\t\tthat Dungeons and Dragons makes a terrible wilderness survival game.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanctuary<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Potentially forcing\n\t\tenemies to give up an attack is great, and this doesn&#8217;t prevent the target\n\t\tfrom contributing via support spells, the Help action, summoned creatures,\n\t\tpets, etc. Sanctuary also has a Bonus Action casting time, so you can attack\n\t\tor cast a cantrip in the same turn (likely before casting Sanctuary). It\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t even require Concentration, so for the puny cost of a few 1st-level\n\t\tslots you could throw this on everyone in your party over the course of\n\t\tseveral turns (don&#8217;t actually do this; no one will be able to attack).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since Sanctuary allows the attack to retarget their attack, Sanctuary\n\t\t\tisn&#8217;t as effective against ranged attacks as it is against melee attacks,\n\t\t\tbut that shouldn&#8217;t deter you.<\/p\n\t\t><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield of Faith<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: +2 AC is a significant\n\t\tboost, and the Bonus Action casting time means that you can easily wait to\n\t\tcast this until you get into combat. The spell lasts 10 minutes and it&#8217;s\n\t\tonly 1st level, so Shield of Faith remains an excellent buff on any\n\t\tcharacter at any level. However, it requires Concentration, so in many cases\n\t\tSanctuary will be more effective unless you&#8217;re running directly from one\n\t\tencounter to another and can benefit from Shield of Faith&#8217;s relatively long\n\t\tduration.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aid<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: With an 8-hour duration\n\t\tand three targets, this is a staple buff that&#8217;s worth casting literally\n\t\tevery day. Keep in mind that this actually increases the targets&#8217; hit point\n\t\tmaximum, so temporary hit points can be added, too.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Aid&#8217;s casting time allows it to be used in combat, which is unusual but\n\t\t\toffers an interesting option. With three targets and a 30-foot range, you\n\t\t\tcan cast it to both buff and heal your allies during combat. Targets&#8217;\n\t\t\tcurrent hit points and hit point maximum both increase, so allies at 0 hit\n\t\t\tpoints are healed in addition to having their hit point maximum raised,\n\t\t\tthereby allowing Aid to serve a similar function to Mass Healing Word.\n\t\t\tHowever, since spells don&#8217;t stack with themselves, it&#8217;s hard to repeat\n\t\t\tthis trick. You&#8217;ll need to cast Aid again using higher-level spell slots,\n\t\t\twhich can get expensive quickly, so Mass Healing Word is probably better\n\t\t\tif Aid is already running and if Mass Healing Word is an option for your\n\t\t\tparty.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Augury<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is my absolute\n\t\tfavorite divination spell because it allows players to politely ask their DM\n\t\tfor hints. Castable as a ritual with a reusable material component, if you\n\t\thave time you can cast this repeatedly to question all sorts of\n\t\tdecisions.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blindness\/Deafness<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>:\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#blind\"\n\t\t\t>Blinding<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\ta target can make them much less dangerous, but Constitution saves tend to\n\t\tbe high, and the target gets a save every round so you can&#8217;t count on this\n\t\tfor long and it works best on enemies with low Constitution saves like\n\t\tspellcasters who can usually resort to are effect spells when they can&#8217;t see\n\t\tto target their spells.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Borrowed Knowledge<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a>)<\/sup>: A great way to\n\t\tcompensate for limited skill proficiencies, Borrowed Knowledge lasts and\n\t\thour and doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, so you can combine it with Enhance\n\t\tAbility to become instantly excellent at any skill. Enhance Ability is more\n\t\tbroadly useful because you can cast it on other allies to support them when\n\t\ttheir best skills come into play, but when there&#8217;s a gap in your party&#8217;s\n\t\tskillset, you can use this to come to the rescue.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Calm Emotions<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Two situational but\n\t\tfrequently useful effects. First, you can use this to temporarily suppress\n\t\teffects which charm or frighten your allies. Both effects are common, and\n\t\tmany enemies can apply them to your whole party. Charm effects often include\n\t\tmind control effects, and suppressing them for a minute on a willing ally\n\t\tcan easily buy you enough time to deal with whatever is trying to mind\n\t\tcontrol your friends. Fear effects are often area effects, such as a\n\t\tdragon&#8217;s Frightful Presence, so suppressing them for a minute can bring\n\t\twhichever portions of your party failed their saves back into the fray.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Second, you can use this to make enemies not be hostile toward you and\n\t\t\tyour allies for one minute. That will at least pause most encounters for\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s duration, which is enough time to either heal and buff the\n\t\t\tparty or escape. I wouldn&#8217;t try to negotiate a truce in one minute,\n\t\t\tespecially since the targets can go right back to hostile the moment that\n\t\t\tthe spell ends. Note that this effect intentionally uses the\n\t\t\t&#8220;Hostile\/Indifferent\/Friendly&#8221; scale referenced in the\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/basic-rules\/adventuring#SocialInteraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social Interaction<\/a\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\trules in the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Continual Flame<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Having reliable,\n\t\tconstant light is really nice.

Eagle&#8217;s Splendor on your party&#8217;s Face make social interactions\n\t\tmuch easier, and Bull&#8217;s Strength provides a huge edge while grappling.\n\t\tEnhance your spellcasting ability (or that of an ally) to get Advantage on\n\t\tthe ability checks to counter spells and to dispel magic.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Find Traps<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>: Too expensive and too\n\t\timprecise.

Normally you can cremate a body to\n\t\tprevent it from becoming undead, but cremating a body takes an alarmingly\n\t\tlarge amount of fuel which you probably don&#8217;t have laying about. You can\n\t\tmutilate the body, but that&#8217;s gross and in many campaign settings the gods\n\t\tview that sort of thing as evil. So if you need to maintain a body until you\n\t\tcan give it a real burial, this is your best bet. Fortunately, you can cast\n\t\tit as a ritual and you can typically wait until the next day so that you can\n\t\tprepare this as needed.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Gentle Repose also pauses the timer on effects which raise the dead.\n\t\t\tWhile this is specifically called out as working with Raise Dead, it works\n\t\t\twith anything that raises creatures from the dead.

But In those cases you typically just want your party\n\t\tabove 0 hit points, and the difference of a few hit points on average won&#8217;t\n\t\tmatter much. Also, you can&#8217;t cast two leveled spells in the same turn\n\t\tanyway, so that ideal scenario is explicitly against the rules. Instead, use\n\t\tthe time you would spend casting this to cast literally anything else so you\n\t\tcan end the fight faster instead of burning precious resources trying to\n\t\tfeed hit points into an insatiable blender.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestow Curse<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The effects are\n\t\tversatile enough that you can easily bring this into play in a variety of\n\t\tsituations, and the scaling mechanism works well enough that this remains a\n\t\tviable option for higher-level spell slots. Use the third option against big\n\t\ttanky enemies with poor Wisdom, or use the first option against enemies that\n\t\tlike to grapple. If you&#8217;re ever uncertain, use the third option.

If you have the time to cast this repeatedly, you can use initial\n\t\tcastings to scout a location, then re-cast the spell and place a new sensor\n\t\tsomewhere else to continue scouting. The spell&#8217;s 1-mile range allows you to\n\t\tcover huge areas at a safe distance. Unless enemies can see the invisible\n\t\tsensor, you can scout totally unnoticed and walk into dungeons, castles,\n\t\tetc. with thorough knowledge of the layout and the inhabitants. Even if they\n\t\tsee the sensor, it just looks like a &#8220;luminous orb&#8221; so they may have no idea\n\t\twhat you&#8217;re up to.

Still, if you can isolate a single enemy outside of\n\t\tcombat you may be able to ply them for information or send them on errands\n\t\twhich will save you trouble later. Tragically, the spell only lasts an hour\n\t\tso just as you&#8217;re getting really attached to your new best friend the\n\t\teffects end, and the targets knows that you charmed them. You may be able to\n\t\tcast this repeatedly or you may be able to negotiate the situation\n\t\tpeacefully even after the spell ends, but many people don&#8217;t take kindly to\n\t\tbeing charmed.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Feign Death<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glyph of Warding<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Depending on how your\n\t\tDM handles it, this is either a situationally useful defensive measure or a\n\t\treality-bending way to break the game from the comfort of your own home.

The best\n\t\tuse case is generally to invert the effects and use a spell to summon a\n\t\tcreature so that you can bargain with it without risk of the creature\n\t\tescaping.

The target must fail a total of\n\t\t\tthree saving throws to apply your chosen disease, and considering a typical\n\t\t\tcombat lasts 3-5 rounds many enemies won&#8217;t live long enough for that to\n\t\t\thappen.

However, since the banishment\n\t\t\teffect doesn&#8217;t effect creatures on their home plane, the banishment may\n\t\t\tnot be as appealing as spells like Banishment which can affect creatures\n\t\t\tnative to your current plane.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Strike<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is a bad spell.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s only as much damage as Fireball, which is two spell levels lower.

But if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re casting a 5th-level spell intending to only get partial damage,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re wasting a 5th-level spell slot. If you want radiant damage, 5th-level\n\t\tSpirit guardians will deal 5d8 radiant damage (avg. 22.5) compared to 8d6\n\t\t(avg. 28) from Flame Strike, and Spirit Guardians last 10 minutes and you\n\t\tcan walk around with it. If you want fire damage most clerics are out of\n\t\tluck, but if you just need a ranged AOE Dawn or Insect Plague will be more\n\t\teffective in almost every case.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Geas<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This spell is\n\t\tsituational by design.

You&#8217;re going to restrain the subject, and stand around chanting\n\t\tfor a full minute and hope that they fail the save. Once that&#8217;s done, you\n\t\tneed to give them a suitable command (read the spell description). Generally\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll want it to be something that benefits you, but will also take the\n\t\ttarget most of the duration to keep them from becoming a problem for you.\n\t\tAlso remember that the base effect of the Charmed condition makes it easier\n\t\tfor you to talk the creature into doing things with Charisma checks, so a\n\t\tGeased creature may be a useful ally for the duration of the effect even if\n\t\tthe original order isn&#8217;t directly related to what you want them to do.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Increasing the spell level extends the duration, but weirdly the damage\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t increase. 5d10 is a nice pile of damage, but it doesn&#8217;t scale with\n\t\t\tspell level and at some point the target will get smart enough to wake up,\n\t\t\ttrigger the 5d10 damage, take a short rest, then go about their business.\n\t\t\tIf the damage scaled this would be less of a problem, but damage is so\n\t\t\teasily repaired in 5e outside of combat that without further penalties\n\t\t\tGeas is more a tax on hit dice than the magical shackles it&#8217;s intended to\n\t\t\tbe. If you want a homebrew fix, add a level of fatigue each day that the\n\t\t\ttarget is out of compliance, or make the damage impossible to heal until\n\t\t\tthey go a day without taking it.

But as the spell is\n\t\t\twritten the area can be occupied while you cast the spell, including by\n\t\t\tcreatures that you&#8217;re going to forbid.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you come upon a dungeon which you know is full of forbiddable\n\t\t\tcreatures (technically you don&#8217;t need to know, but knowing ahead of time\n\t\t\tis the abuse case), you can sit down, spend 20 minutes to cast this as a\n\t\t\tritual, and turn 40,000 square feet of dungeon into a 30-foot high area of\n\t\t\tongoing damage for 24 hours with no save. That&#8217;s a 200x200x30 area, and 30\n\t\t\tfeet is tall enough for many two-story buildings, so you could enclose up\n\t\t\tto 80,000 square feet of floor space in sufficiently rectangular\n\t\t\tbuildings.

It also removes some annoying status conditions, but not enough\n\t\tthat it can replace Restoration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroes&#8217; Feast<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The duration is\n\t\tinstantaneous, but the effects of eating the feast last 24 hours, and that&#8217;s\n\t\tdefinitely not confusing. Jokes aside, you should cast this spell every day.\n\t\tPoison and fear are common nuisances, and advantage on <em>all<\/em> Wisdom\n\t\tsaving throws is spectacular. On top of those already amazing benefits, 2d10\n\t\textra hit points is a small but still helpful boost to your party&#8217;s\n\t\tdurability (and it stacks with Aid!). Note that these extra hit points\n\t\taren&#8217;t temporary hit points, so you can still add temporary hit points on\n\t\ttop of your boosted hit point maximum. The only drawback is the 1,000gp cost\n\t\tto cast the spell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Planar Ally<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Casting this spell is\n\t\texpensive, difficult, and confusing, and the creature that you summon counts\n\t\tas a member of the party and gets a share of the experience points that your\n\t\tparty earns. Use this as an absolute last resort, or if you know a specific\n\t\textraplanar creature which might be willing to help you for free.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sunbeam<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Spirit\n\t\tGuardians will typically be a better offensive use of a spell slot.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Seeing<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Extremely powerful,\n\t\twith a 1-hour duration.

A CR 4 creature will likely feel underwhelming in combat, so\n\t\ttry to find other ways for the summon to be useful. Your DM chooses what\n\t\tgets summoned, unfortunately, so you can&#8217;t use this to pick from a list.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For more help, see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/summoning#conjure-celestial\"\n\t\t\t\t>Practical Guide to Summoning Spells<\/a\n\t\t\t>.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Word<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Primarily this is a\n\t\twritten as a way to handle crowds of weak enemies, and while the spell does\n\t\tthat well it&#8217;s actually more effective as a way to banish high-CR extraplanar\n\t\tenemies. Affected creatures are banished similar to Banishment, but there&#8217;s\n\t\tno numerical limit on the number of affected creatures and they can&#8217;t return\n\t\tfor 24 hours without serious magic like Wish, so enemies can&#8217;t Plane Shift\n\t\tright back into the fight to express how little they enjoyed that time that\n\t\tyou banished them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Etherealness<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A profoundly effective\n\t\tscouting\/escape option. Unless you&#8217;re fighting ethereal enemies, you&#8217;re\n\t\tuntouchable. You can see and hear into the material plane (albeit at limited\n\t\tdistance), allowing you to spy on other creatures in person without their\n\t\tknowledge. The spell lasts 8 hours, which is sufficient to do a lot of\n\t\tthings potentially including a Long Rest.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire Storm<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Imagine a fireball that\n\t\tyou got to cut up and shape in 10-foot cubes. That&#8217;s essentially what Fire\n\t\tStorm is. It&#8217;s a decent blast spell, but it doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough damage\n\t\tfor a spell of this level.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plane Shift<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Simultaneously a\n\t\tfantastic long-distance travel spell and a single-target save-or-suck. If\n\t\tyou want to travel within the same plane you may need to cast this twice, so\n\t\tmake sure that your lay-over is somewhere pleasant like Celestia or Elysium.\n\t\tIf you use this to get rid of someone, send them somewhere really unpleasant\n\t\tlike sending a demon to Celestia or a humanoid to the plane of fire.\n\t\tUnfortunately, you do need a specific tuning fork for each plane that you\n\t\twant to visit, so start a collection as soon as possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Regenerate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Limb removal is\n\t\texceptionally rare in DnD 5e, typically the subject of specific traps or\n\t\thouse rules written by players who enjoy the thought of their characters\n\t\tlosing limbs every time a sword comes out. Still, any amount of regeneration\n\t\tmeans that a character never stays Dying, and with a 1-hour duration this\n\t\theals an impressive 600 hit points on top of the initial hit point\n\t\trestoration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resurrection<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational by design,\n\t\tand intentionally very expensive.

The\n\t\t1-hour casting time makes this rarely useful except for specific story\n\t\tpoints (celebrate a holy day, conduct a ceremony like a wedding, provide\n\t\tsanctuary against an attack that you know is coming), so you should be able\n\t\tto prepare and cast this well ahead of time.

Even with such a small radius, removing magic from\n\t\tthe game totally shifts the balance of the game. The biggest problem is that\n\t\tyou are primarily a spellcaster, so you are turning off your biggest set of\n\t\ttool to use this. The best-case scenario is to use this when you are\n\t\toutmatched magically, but your allies can still fight without magic and\n\t\tdefeat whatever you&#8217;re facing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Control Weather<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very situational, and\n\t\tkind of a pain for the DM. Go to your setting&#8217;s arctic equivalent, and raise\n\t\tthe temperature to &#8220;Unbearable Heat&#8221; for 8 hours. That certainly won&#8217;t cause\n\t\thorrifying and potentially irreparable ecological damage that the DM will\n\t\tneed to either totally disregard or track in some unpleasant fashion for the\n\t\tduration of the campaign.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earthquake<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A powerful area control\n\t\tspell, but you don&#8217;t want to be within the 100 ft. radius, and because you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get the control the appearance of fissures you also can&#8217;t risk placing\n\t\tit with enemies near the edges. You also can&#8217;t don&#8217;t want to risk using it\n\t\tinside or in an area where a nearby structure will fall on your. So you need\n\t\tto center the effect on your targets as much as possible, you need to be at\n\t\ta safe distance from the center point, and you may need some extra space to\n\t\tavoid falling structures. If you can manage those parameters and still\n\t\tmanage to put the spell where you want (consider flying), this can level a\n\t\tcity with an Action. Concentrating on the spell doesn&#8217;t do anything except\n\t\tmaintain the difficult terrain, which means that you get almost all of the\n\t\tspell&#8217;s effects in one turn, so feel free to drop Concentration and switch\n\t\tto something else.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Holy Aura<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ultimate defensive\n\t\tbuff.

Undead can\n\t\tbe blinded, but that&#8217;s such a minor part of the effect that it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tmatter much.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sunburst<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Imagine\n\t\tfireball with three times the radius and it blinds the targets. The targets\n\t\tget a Constitution save every turn to remove the blindness so you can&#8217;t\n\t\texpect it to stay in effect for long, but the save is at the end of their\n\t\tturns so they&#8217;ll spend at least one turn blinded if they fail the initial\n\t\tsave, and that may be enough to determine the outcome of the encounter.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Astral Projection<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A relatively safe way\n\t\tto explore the Astral Plane, but it has some complications. Avoid Githyanki\n\t\tat all cost; their silver swords can cut your astral cord and kill you\n\t\toutright. If things ever look bad for you, spend the Action to return\n\t\teveryone to their bodies. If any of your allies drop to 0 they&#8217;ll go back to\n\t\ttheir body unharmed, but if you don&#8217;t see it happen you may not know about\n\t\tit so you need to have a way for your party to contact your astral\n\t\tprojection from wherever you hid your bodies. If you ever get forcibly\n\t\treturned to your body and don&#8217;t have a chance to end the spell intentionally\n\t\tand bring your allies back too, they can always get home by punching\n\t\tthemselves down to 0 hit points.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While you have this spell running, make sure that your party&#8217;s bodies are\n\t\t\thidden and protected somewhere that your enemies (or curious but hungry\n\t\t\tmonsters) can&#8217;t get to you, but that won&#8217;t be immediately dangerous if you\n\t\t\treturn to your body with no spell slots. A comfortable, but totally sealed\n\t\t\tunderground hideout is a great option that you could feasibly create using\n\t\t\tStone Shape and some patience.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Your bodies don&#8217;t need food or air while you&#8217;re under the spell&#8217;s effects,\n\t\t\tbut the spell doesn&#8217;t mention water. I assume that this is an oversight,\n\t\t\tbut check with your DM; you may need to solve the issue of keeping your\n\t\t\tbodies hydrated. Since you don&#8217;t need to breathe, maybe submerge everyone\n\t\t\tin a shallow pool of water fed by a Decanter of Endless Water? Or maybe\n\t\t\tget a dedicated sect of monks to tend your bodies. Since your bodies don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tage, this makes you effectively immortal while you&#8217;re exploring the Astral\n\t\t\tPlane, so this can be a good way to keep your character alive between\n\t\t\tworld-threatening problems so that you can return to the world to smite\n\t\t\tthe latest lich without worrying about gray hair or whatever.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: There are several ways\n\t\tto use this spell, two of which were intended when the spell was designed.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Travel to another plane: The simplest option, you open a door and you\n\t\t\t\twalk through to another plane, leaving the gate open for up to a minute\n\t\t\t\tfor whoever else to walk through in either direction.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Summon a creature: If you know the name of a creature on another plane,\n\t\t\t\tyou can drag them (potentially against their will and without a save) to\n\t\t\t\tyour location. This is easy to abuse by going to a plane where you know\n\t\t\t\tthey aren&#8217;t (pocket dimensions work great for this, but there are so\n\t\t\t\tmany planes that it&#8217;s hard to accidentally be on the same one), then\n\t\t\t\tforcibly summon them. You could summon your biggest antagonist after\n\t\t\t\tspending a bunch of time setting up traps, buffs, and readied actions,\n\t\t\t\tthen have your party stomp them into the dirt. If you&#8217;re extra clever,\n\t\t\t\tyou can use Astral Projection to fight whatever you&#8217;re summoning while\n\t\t\t\tprojected so if something goes wrong you won&#8217;t actually die and you\n\t\t\t\tcould try again later. I think the intent of this function was to summon\n\t\t\t\tan ally to help you in a fight, but I think my idea is more useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>One-way cover: You can only enter the portal from the front, but it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tunclear what the back looks like or how it functions. It&#8217;s not described\n\t\t\t\tas solid, so it&#8217;s entirely possibly that you can fire projectiles\n\t\t\t\tthrough it from the rear, while projectiles from the front pass into the\n\t\t\t\tportal. I can&#8217;t imagine that you can see through the portal, so this may\n\t\t\t\tbe hard to do, but it may be possible. Check with your DM.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>Magical drain: About to drown? About to hit by a flow of magma or\n\t\t\t\tfalling rocks? Open a gate to literally anywhere else and let the\n\t\t\t\toffending substance enjoy eternity floating in limbo or anywhere else\n\t\t\t\tthat isn&#8217;t a problem for you.
