While these were mostly good, but not problematic, the Bugbear immediately stood out as terrifyingly ripe for abuse. The RPGBOT team latched onto the new Bugbear and brainstormed a series of absolutely terrifying builds, each wildly upsetting the game&#8217;s DPR expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article seeks to refine those brainstorms into a few absolutely\n\thorrifying builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Bugbear&#8217;s most mechanically impactful feature is Surprise Attack, which allows you to deal an additional 2d6 damage per attack when you hit a creature that has not yet acted in combat. If you roll well for initiative (high Dexterity, a weapon of warning, a sentinel shield, the Alert feat, the Bard&#8217;s Jack of All Trades, the Gloomstalker Ranger&#8217;s Dread Ambusher, the War Magic Wizard&#8217;s Tactical Wit feature, Gift of Alacrity, Guidance, etc.), you can all but guarantee that you&#8217;ll have viable targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With the issue of initiative solved, the challenge becomes maximizing your\n\tnumber of attacks. Obvious options like two-weapon fighting, Extra Attack, and\n\tFlurry of Blows will all draw your attention, and those options are certainly\n\tcrucial, but the harder you look, the more terrifying your options become. And\n\tby multiclassing to some degree, we can make something truly, truly\n\thorrifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>These tactics are inherently &#8220;bursty&#8221;; this build will intentionally be very effective on turn 1, then less impactful on later turns. The hope is that you can drop so much damage in one turn that it&#8217;s not an issue. Much like a wizard who will often drop one powerful spell on turn one then coast on cantrips for the remainder of a fight, this build seeks to define combat on turn one, then spend the rest of the fight cleaning up the leftovers, if there are any.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to fully triple the &#8220;Dude Stop&#8221; DPR range, which means that we&#8217;re dealing in one turn what the game expects a 4-person party to do over the course of 3 turns. If we can do 400 DPR in one turn, we can solo a CR 20 enemy in one turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build will draw heavily from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/races\/bugbear\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2705\">Bugbear Guide<\/a>, our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"7657\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2691\">Fundamental Math of Character Optimization<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Bugbear Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-and-subclasses\">Classes and Subclasses<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#artificer-armorer\">Artificer (Armorer)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cleric-war-domain\">Cleric (War Domain)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fighter-echo-knight\">Fighter (Echo Knight)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk\">Monk<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ranger-gloomstalker\">Ranger (Gloomstalker)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rogue-assassin\">Rogue (Assassin)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#paladin-vengeance\">Paladin (Vengeance)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#warlock-fiend\">Warlock (Fiend)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#warlock-hexblade\">Warlock (Hexblade)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wizard\">Wizard<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-1-ambush-caster\">Example Build 1 &#8211; Ambush Caster<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Build 2 &#8211; Tam Bush<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Build 3 &#8211; Bugbearlock<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Can produce triple Dude Stop DPR the most times back-to-back once it has enough spell slots of sufficiently high level, but the limited number of spell slots still places a limitation on how many times we can repeat the combo per day. Ambush Caster hits the 400+ DPR threshold earliest among the three example builds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tam Bush: Works safely in melee (and <em>only<\/em> in melee), and has the highest initiative bonus. The biggest limitation is the number of Unleash Incarnation uses per day, which is just 2 for most of your career, so you may only be able to repeat the combo once per day. Tam Bush hits the 400+ DPR threshold the latest of the three example builds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bugbearlock: The only build of the three to get above triple Dude Stop and then fall behind it. By relying on cantrips and Pact Magic, we&#8217;re able to repeat the combo at least once per short rest. Melting our sorcerer slots and potentially warlock slots for more Sorcery Points means that we may be able to repeat the combo several times between rests. Bugbearlock is never the highest DPR of the three builds, but it is the most consistent, reliable, and repeatable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bugbear Introduction The launch of Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse brought us numerous new and updated race options.
