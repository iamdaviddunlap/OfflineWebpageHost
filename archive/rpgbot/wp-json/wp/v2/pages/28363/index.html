You master beasts. You don&#8217;t beastmast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iconic pet build, the Beast Master Ranger commands a powerful beast in\n\tcombat, allowing them to be in two places at once, making them very effective\n\tas a Striker and potentially as a Defender. The unusual action economy and\n\ttactics take some emphasis off of Hunter&#8217;s Mark, making Druidic Warrior builds\n\tan effective choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-ranger\/ranger-subclasses\/beast-master\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28651\">Beast Master Ranger Subclass Guide<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Companion<\/span>: Your defining feature,\n\t\tyour companion is equal parts pet and weapon. It has a separate pool of hit\n\t\tpoints to draw damage away from you and the rest of your party, and its\n\t\tattacks do as much damage as yours do. Your beast&#8217;s stats are based on your\n\t\tWisdom modifier, so strongly consider building around Wisdom.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unlike summoned pets which other classes might use (Dancing Item,\n\t\t\tWildfire Spirit, etc.), your pet sticks around all the time. You don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tneed to summon it or whatever. However, like any other member of your\n\t\t\tparty, it needs food, healing, rest, etc.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The abilities to easily revive your beast with any spell slot and to\n\t\t\treplace the beast after a Long Rest mean that your beast is functionally\n\t\t\tdisposable. If it dies in combat, or if you need to change beasts to\n\t\t\tchange tactics, doing so is nearly as easy as casting a new summon\n\t\t\tspell.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Commanding your beast monopolizes your Bonus Action. This directly\n\t\t\tconflicts with casting Hunter&#8217;s Mark, which is a significant problem for\n\t\t\tthe Ranger, but your beast&#8217;s damage is good enough to make up the gap.\n\t\t\tThis gets a little messy when you pick up Bestial Fury at level 11 and\n\t\t\tyour beast also benefits from your Hunter&#8217;s Mark damage bonus, but by that\n\t\t\tpoint your beast&#8217;s attacks are more impactful than Hunter&#8217;s Mark. Expect\n\t\t\tto use Hunter&#8217;s Mark only in encounters against big single foes, otherwise\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll waste your Bonus Action to move it around when you should be commanding\n\t\t\tyour beast.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Beast of the Land<\/span>: Simple and iconic.\n\t\t\t\tWith 40 ft. land and climb speed, this thing can get around very\n\t\t\t\tquickly. The damage will match or exceed a weapon, and Charge allows\n\t\t\t\tyour companion to knock foes prone if they can get a running start.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beast of the Sea<\/span>: Only viable in\n\t\t\t\taquatic campaigns. 5-foot land speed is not enough for your sharktopus\n\t\t\t\tto hobble around on land and be effective in combat. If you can somehow\n\t\t\t\tget its speed up to reasonable amount (look for spells like Longstrider\n\t\t\t\twith long durations which don&#8217;t require Concentration), you may be able\n\t\t\t\tto make this work on land. If you can do it, the Beast of the Sea&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tattacks grapple when they hit, which is a powerful option not normally\n\t\t\t\tavailable to players.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast of the Sky<\/span>: 60-foot fly speed\n\t\t\t\tand Flyby. Less hit points than the other options, but with the ability\n\t\t\t\tto remain perpetually out of melee reach that&#8217;s less of a problem. The\n\t\t\t\tdamage is also slightly lower than Beast of the Land, but Beast of the\n\t\t\t\tLand deals 6.5+PB on average and the Beast of the Sky&#8217;s 5.5+PB isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tnoticeably lower. Having a flying companion discourages you from using\n\t\t\t\tyour companion as a Defender by interposing itself between you and your\n\t\t\t\tenemies, but Beast of the Sky&#8217;s AC is just as good as the other options\n\t\t\t\tand if your companion&#8217;s hit points are looking problematic it can use\n\t\t\t\tFlyby to withdraw to safety.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exceptional Training<\/span>: The Bonus Action\n\t\toptions are fantastic. Disengage will let your companion move out of melee\n\t\tsafely, but you want it in melee tanking hits for your less durable party\n\t\tmembers. Help will give you or an ally Advantage on a high-value attack.\n\t\tMost of the time you&#8217;ll default to Dodge, which will significantly improve\n\t\tyour beast&#8217;s durability.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Making your companion&#8217;s attacks deal Force damage lets you bypass nearly\n\t\t\tall damage resistances. Resistance to non-magic weapon attacks is common\n\t\t\tand becomes more common as you gain levels.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestial Fury<\/span>: Double your beast&#8217;s damage\n\t\toutput. The bonus damage from Hunter&#8217;s Mark is mostly a consolation prize\n\t\tfor giving up your beast&#8217;s attacks for a turn in order to cast Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\tMark. Don&#8217;t rush to cast it just to get the 1d6 damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Share Spells<\/span>: This is a fantastic way to\n\t\tshare buff spells. You can use options like Cure Wounds, but don&#8217;t expect to\n\t\tcast those frequently.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"-can-the-beast-companion-take-the-bestial-strike-action-twice\">Can the Beast Companion Take the Bestial Strike Action Twice?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people may ask how the companion gets two attacks. It\u2019s not perfectly clear, so let\u2019s take a look at the rules, and you and your table can come to an informed agreement about how to handle things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the 2024 Player&#8217;s Handbook:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Beast\u2019s Strike action.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the beast shares your turn, it performs the command you give it immediately. The confusion comes from the word \u201calso\u201d in the second sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can interpret the text to mean that using a Bonus Action is the primary way to command your beast, but you also have the option to command your beast by replacing an attack, but you can only command it to take the Beast\u2019s Strike action rather than commanding to do something else, such as Disengage. This means that you can use your Bonus Action for things like spellcasting, which is helpful if you plan to cast Hunter\u2019s Mark to benefit from the second half of the Bestial Fury feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if that was the intent, the word \u201cinstead\u201d should have been used in place of \u201calso\u201d. \u201cAlso\u201d means that you can do both, and there\u2019s no further text preventing you from doing so. This creates a specific-beats-general situation where, RAW, you can command it as a Bonus Action and also command it to use Beast\u2019s Strike as part of your Attack Action. This creates one of two outcomes when the player spends their Bonus Action and then also replaces an attack to command their beast:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The beast takes one specified Action and then also takes the Beast\u2019s Strike action despite having only one Action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The player has effectively wasted either their Bonus Action or the attack that they\u2019ve traded.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to say that the DnD design team would not leave a rules trap in the text which caused players to needlessly waste a resource for no benefit, but we\u2019ve been running RPGBOT for well over a decade. Yes, they would do exactly that. Not intentionally, but they\u2019re human beings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re mostly certain that the RAI is for this to provide flexibility so that you can make your beast attack once per turn with either your own Attack or your Bonus Action, but the RPGBOT optimization panel has voted and we agree that, RAW, this language makes the most sense interpreted to mean that your beast can attack twice. If they were aiming for flexibility instead, they shouldn&#8217;t have used &#8220;also&#8221; and had the second command option be a separate sentence. But, just like with any unclear rules text, we encourage you to discuss this with your own group and and arrive at a decision that works for your table.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fey-wanderer\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fey Wanderer<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Tricky and challenging, yet very effective, the Fey Wanderer Ranger is an\n\texcellent subclass with a lot to offer to players who know how to use it to\n\tits fullest. You can play this subclass like a typical Ranger the same way\n\tthat you would play a Hunter, but you&#8217;re going to miss out on a lot of what\n\treally makes the Fey Wanderer shine. It&#8217;s built to lean into a Wisdom-based\n\tDruidic Warrior build with more emphasis on spellcasting and Face skills than\n\tyour typical bow-wielding damage monster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dreadful Strikes<\/span>: This roughly matches\n\t\tHunter&#8217;s Mark, but with a lot of advantages. The most obvious benefit is\n\t\tthat it&#8217;s free, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there. There&#8217;s no action cost. It stacks\n\t\twith Hunter&#8217;s Mark&#8217;s damage bonus. The damage is psychic, which is rarely\n\t\tresisted.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Dreadful Strikes only applies once per target per turn, but if you can\n\t\t\thit multiple targets, they&#8217;ll all take the bonus damage. It also applies\n\t\t\ton Opportunity Attacks (Hunter&#8217;s Mark does, too, but it&#8217;s still really\n\t\t\tnice). The one drawback is that it doesn&#8217;t work quite as well as Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\t\tMark does when focusing on a single target, so Hunter&#8217;s Mark may still be\n\t\t\tworth casting.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this applies once per target per turn, you&#8217;re motivated to attack\n\t\t\tmultiple targets if that&#8217;s an option. Ranged weapons work best for this,\n\t\t\tthough they may be difficult for the high-Wisdom build expected of the Fey\n\t\t\tWanderer. More likely you&#8217;ll want to use spells like Zephyr Strike and\n\t\t\ttwo-weapon fighting to quickly move between and attack multiple\n\t\t\ttargets.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fey Wanderer Spells<\/span>: The vast majority\n\t\tof the options are only situationally useful, but you do get Misty Step,\n\t\twhich is good on exactly 100% of characters.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 1<\/span>: A strange choice\n\t\t\t\tmechanically, but the theme makes sense. Your save DC won&#8217;t match a full\n\t\t\t\tspellcaster unless you&#8217;re using Druidic Warrior to build around Wisdom,\n\t\t\t\tand Charm Person doesn&#8217;t give you any visual indication that it worked,\n\t\t\t\tso you need to be extremely cautious when using it. You don&#8217;t get enough\n\t\t\t\tspell slots to cast it repeatedly just to be absolutely sure that it\n\t\t\t\tworked.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 2<\/span>: The best teleportation option\n\t\t\t\tin combat.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 3<\/span>: This will lag far behind\n\t\t\t\tsummons cast by full spellcasters. Your summoned Fey&#8217;s AC and hit points\n\t\t\t\twill make it frail, and their relatively small number of attacks will\n\t\t\t\tmean that their damage isn&#8217;t as impactful as you probably want. Still,\n\t\t\t\tif you&#8217;re built around Druidic Warrior, this is a much better use of\n\t\t\t\tConcentration than Hunter&#8217;s Mark. Also see the Fey Reinforcements\n\t\t\t\tfeature, which lets you shorten Summon Fey&#8217;s duration in order to remove\n\t\t\t\tthe Concentration requirement.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 4<\/span>: Less of a go-to combat\n\t\t\t\tteleportation option than Misty Step, but it has better range and\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t require line of sight, so it&#8217;s more powerful outside of combat\n\t\t\t\tor if you need to completely escape an encounter. You&#8217;ll still get more\n\t\t\t\tfrequent use out of Misty Step thanks to its Bonus Action casting time\n\t\t\t\tand lower-level spell slot requirement, but Dimension Door can get you\n\t\t\t\tthrough walls and locked doors.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 5<\/span>: Situational. Not a great\n\t\t\t\toption in combat, but out of combat this provides a passably safe way to\n\t\t\t\tscout an area or to trick other creatures if mundane stealth won&#8217;t do\n\t\t\t\tthe trick for some reason.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Otherworldly Glamour<\/span>: One Face skill and\n\t\tyou add your Wisdom modifier to all Charisma checks on top of any Charisma\n\t\tmodifier. This is enough to make you an effective Face without high\n\t\tCharisma, but a little bit is still a great idea. You don&#8217;t want 8 Charisma\n\t\tdragging you down.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Beguiling Twist<\/span>: Hilarious and very\n\t\teffective, but likely difficult to use to its greatest potential.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The obvious use case is to take charm\/fear effects from your enemies and\n\t\t\tessentially redirect them back at your enemies. That works great, and can\n\t\t\tlead to scenarios like dragons being frightened by their own Frightful\n\t\t\tPresence. To make this as effective as possible, you want allies in your\n\t\t\tparty who can reliably pass saving throws against charm\/fear effects.\n\t\t\tThese are nearly always Wisdom or Charisma saves, so high scores in those\n\t\t\tability scores and proficiency in the saves both help, but also look for\n\t\t\tracial traits like Brave and class features like Aura of Protection.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The less-obvious use case is using this offensively. If you have allies\n\t\t\twho can produce charm\/fear effects (often spellcasters, but there are\n\t\t\tnon-spell options too), you can capitalize on any creatures who pass saves\n\t\t\tagainst your allies&#8217; abilities and force another creature to save against\n\t\t\tBeguiling Twist.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fey Reinforcements<\/span>: Summon Fey once per\n\t\tday for free without the 300gp material component. The fey&#8217;s attack bonus is\n\t\tbased on your Spellcasting Modifier and the spell is heavily dependent on\n\t\tspell level, both of which are hard prospects for many rangers. But even if\n\t\tit&#8217;s not quite as effective offensively as something summoned by a full\n\t\tspellcaster, it&#8217;s still an effective pet for up to an hour per casting.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The second benefit allows you to cast a shorter version of the spell\n\t\t\twithout the Concentration requirement, but that&#8217;s a really hard prospect\n\t\t\twith the Ranger&#8217;s limited pool of spell slots.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Note that the free casting per day doesn&#8217;t use a spell slot, so it\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t conflict with casting a leveled spell on the same turn. That&#8217;s\n\t\t\trarely going to be an issue with the Ranger&#8217;s limited spellcasting, but it\n\t\t\tcan be a very powerful tactical option.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Misty Wanderer<\/span>: Misty Step for free\n\t\tseveral times per day, and you can even bring a friend along! This makes it\n\t\teasy to rescue your friends from grapples or restraints, and you become very\n\t\thard to keep in one place during combat.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gloom-stalker\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Gloom Stalker<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Gloom Stalker Ranger is a fantastic Scout, especially in environments\n\twith little light where Umbral Sight makes them near-permanently invisible.\n\tBut that invisibility is by far the subclass&#8217;s greatest highlight. The spell\n\tlist is disappointing, and their Dread Ambusher damage boost gets to few uses\n\tper day that you would be forgiven for forgetting that it exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gloom Stalker, not Gloomstalker.

Now, you\n\t\ttoo can decide that you need an extra-dimensional pocket to short rest in.\n\t\tThis only isn&#8217;t rated higher because Disguise Self and Fear care about your\n\t\tspell save DC which won&#8217;t be as good as a dedicated caster.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 1<\/span>: Situational.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: A fantastic way to rest\n\t\t\t\tsafely, and normally exclusive to artificers and wizards. But rangers\n\t\t\t\tget very few spell slots, and spending one to take a Short Rest safely\n\t\t\t\tis a high cost for the Ranger. Do your best to avoid needing this.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 3<\/span>: It&#8217;s unlikely that you have\n\t\t\t\tsufficient Wisdom to make any spell which allows a saving throw\n\t\t\t\treliable, so you&#8217;ll want to save this for encounters with numerous weak\n\t\t\t\tfoes.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 4<\/span>: Amazing on any stealthy\n\t\t\t\tcharacter. Ideally you&#8217;ll never need this because you can rely on Umbral\n\t\t\t\tSight, but if your enemies pull out a torch you can cast Greater\n\t\t\t\tInvisibility and remain unseen.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 5<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\t\t\thelpful when your party needs to go somewhere where the locals are\n\t\t\t\tunfriendly.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Umbral Sight<\/span>: Getting free Darkvision is\n\t\tfantastic on its own, but invisibility to Darkvision is absolutely crazy.\n\t\tMost creatures that will ambush you using Darkvision won&#8217;t have a light\n\t\tsource in their possession, so you functionally have Improved Invisibility.\n\t\tEven if an enemy finds a light source, if you extinguish it, you&#8217;re right\n\t\tback to invisibly murdering them.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Invisibility at this level normally comes at great cost: a relatively\n\t\t\thigh-level spell slot, Concentration, and a prohibition against doing\n\t\t\tnearly anything aggressive with it. This has none of those costs, it just\n\t\t\tonly applies when something is only able to see you because of its\n\t\t\tDarkvision. This means that we should be trying to be in darkness in\n\t\t\tcombat as much as is physically possible. Work to make sure that everyone\n\t\t\telse in your party can function without light as well so that enemies are\n\t\t\trelying on Darkvision wherever possible.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While it is incredible, Umbral Sight does have limitations. The feature\n\t\t\tspecifies that it only works in darkness. That means that it doesn&#8217;t work\n\t\t\tif there&#8217;s dim light (candles, etc.). It must be actual darkness. It also\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t work on things that can perceive you because of truesight,\n\t\t\ttremorsense, blindsight, etc. Only Darkvision. With that said, in the\n\t\t\tright conditions, this is one of the best class features in the game.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Mind<\/span>: Additional saving throw\n\t\tproficiencies are always welcome, especially when they&#8217;re for a\n\t\tcommonly-targeted save.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><strong>Stalker&#8217;s Flurry<\/strong>: The damage scaling is so small that I&#8217;m\n\t\tsurprised they bothered to add it at all. You&#8217;re here for the rider effects\n\t\ton Dread Ambusher, which are both fine, but you won&#8217;t get to use them enough\n\t\ttimes per day for them to feel impactful.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sudden Strike<\/span>: Nice if enemies happen\n\t\t\t\tto be adjacent to each other. Capitalizing on this is a good idea even\n\t\t\t\tif you&#8217;re attacking a creature that&#8217;s not currently target by Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tMark.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Mass Fear<\/span>: Good, but you probably\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t have the spell save DC to make this reliable.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadowy Dodge<\/span>: It only works once per\n\t\tround because it consumes your Reaction, but that&#8217;s often plenty. The Gloom\n\t\tStalker thrives on being unseen, so this is powerful insurance if your\n\t\tenemies manage to attack while you&#8217;re not in total darkness and also not\n\t\trunning Improved Invisibility.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hunter\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunter<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The iconic Ranger, the Hunter adds almost no complexity to the Ranger, instead complementing the class&#8217;s core tactics with mostly passive features. The only part of the Hunter which requires you to take additional actions is Superior Hunter&#8217;s Defense. This makes the Hunter very accessible and easy to play. Unfortunately, most of the Hunter&#8217;s features provide very minor benefits and the rest won&#8217;t be consistently useful, so the subclass&#8217;s decision points only present the illusion of choice. The Hunter&#8217;s best options are at their best in melee, but ranged builds may find little value here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/ranger-subclasses\/hunter\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"30822\">Hunter Ranger Subclass Guide<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunter&#8217;s Lore<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to be running\n\t\tHunter&#8217;s Mark in nearly every encounter, so you&#8217;re going to know the\n\t\tImmunities\/Resistances\/Vulnerabilities of most of the creatures that you\n\t\tface. Of course, you probably can&#8217;t do anything with that information since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going to be dealing Piercing damage almost exclusively.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>None of this specifies &#8220;damage&#8221;, so RAW it appears that you also know if\n\t\t\tthe target has any condition immunities. Unfortunately,\n\t\t\tAdvantage\/Disadvantage on saves against a condition aren&#8217;t considered\n\t\t\tResistance\/Vulnerability in 5e.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Hunter&#8217;s Prey<\/strong>: You can change your choice on a Short or\n\t\tLong Rest, but realistically there is no reason to do so.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Colossus Slayer<\/span>: Enemies will spend\n\t\t\t\tvery little time in combat at full health, and then they&#8217;ll be probaly below\n\t\t\t\tfull health for the rest of their lives, so this damage is easy and\n\t\t\t\tconsistent. It&#8217;s not a ton of damage, but it&#8217;s very reliable and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\trequire any real effort.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Because this works once per turn, it also works on Opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\tAttacks. This is very helpful for melee builds, making you a bit\n\t\t\t\t\tscarier to move past even for enemies that aren&#8217;t the target of\n\t\t\t\t\tHunter&#8217;s Mark.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Horde Breaker<\/span>: This is basically the\n\t\t\t\tsame as the Cleave Weapon Mastery, except that you can&#8217;t have already\n\t\t\t\tattacked the secondary target. Since you&#8217;re stuck focusing on the target\n\t\t\t\tof Hunter&#8217;s Mark and can&#8217;t easily switch targets, you&#8217;re going to have a\n\t\t\t\tlot of trouble consistently attacking enemies that are within 5 feet of\n\t\t\t\teach other. Opportunities to use Horde Breaker will be vanishingly rare.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>The timing of Horde Breaker alongside the Cleave mastery is slightly\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplex, but doesn&#8217;t create issues. Horde Breaker applies when you\n\t\t\t\t\tmake the attack, while Cleave doesn&#8217;t apply until after you hit. This\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans that you can hit the same secondary target with both Horde\n\t\t\t\t\tBreaker and Cleave after making a single attack against your primary\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget, but none of that actually matters because Cleave only exists\n\t\t\t\t\ton Strength-based weapons and Strength-based Rangers don&#8217;t work.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><strong>Defensive Tactics<\/strong>: You can change your choice on a Short\n\t\tor Long Rest, but you&#8217;re almost certainly going to try Escape the Horde,\n\t\trealize that it&#8217;s not making an impact unless you&#8217;re deliberately drawing\n\t\tOpportunity Attack, then switch permanently to Multiattack Defense.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Escape the Horde<\/span>: If you&#8217;re relying\n\t\t\t\ton hit-and-run tactics or if you&#8217;re built to fight at range, this is a\n\t\t\t\tgood choice. However, Multiattack Defense may still provide better\n\t\t\t\toverall protection. If enemies get into melee with you and hit you with\n\t\t\t\tMultiattack, Multiattack Defense will protect you against more attacks\n\t\t\t\tthan Escape the Horse will when you try to move away on your next\n\t\t\t\tturn.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Multiattack Defense<\/span>: Almost every\n\t\t\t\tenemy that relies on weapon attacks will have multiattack by now. This\n\t\t\t\twill provide consistent defense against those creatures. If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tfighting in melee, this is a great choice. If you&#8217;re fighting at range,\nthis will rarely be useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Superior Hunter&#8217;s Prey<\/span>: 1d6 extra damage\n\t\tper turn. This is not mathematically significant. It&#8217;s nice that it works on\n\t\tevery turn so that it also applies with Opportunity Attacks, but it&#8217;s still\n\t\tnot enough damage to make a big difference and it also requires that you\n\t\thave a valid secondary target.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Superior Hunter&#8217;s Defense<\/span>: A fantastic\n\t\tdefensive option. Many enemies can only deal one damage type per turn (a\n\t\tdragon&#8217;s breath, a spell, a weapon), and the ones that deal multiple types\n\t\tare typically doing something like hitting you with a mace that does 1d6\n\t\tbludgeoning and a mountain of fire damage or something.
