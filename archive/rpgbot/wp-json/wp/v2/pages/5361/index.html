Reflex saves will\n\tbe a problem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Martial weapons, heavy armor,\n\tshields, and Improved Unarmed Strike if it&#8217;s your deity&#8217;s favored weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: With 2+ skill ranks and no other need\n\tfor Intelligence, the Warpriests skills are very thin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spells<\/span>: Warpriests are 2\/3 casters, and\n\tselect their spells from the Cleric spell list. This allows a huge number of\n\tfantastic options, and allows you to change your role in the party on a daily\n\tbasis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Aura<\/span>: This almost never comes up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blessings<\/span>: Warpriest Blessings offer a lot\n\tof very interesting options to fit your play style. For help selecting\n\tBlessings, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/warpriest\/blessings\">Warpriest Blessing Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Focus Weapon<\/span>: Weapon Focus for free gives\n\tyou a nice +1 to attacks, but locks you into one weapon for the rest of your\n\tcareer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Orisons<\/span>: Versatile and fantastic. Don&#8217;t\n\tunderestimate the effectiveness of Virtue at low levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sacred Weapon<\/span>: Sacred Weapon is a very weird\n\tmechanic which allows you to override your weapon&#8217;s normal damage die with the\n\tone specified for your Sacred Weapon. This damage won&#8217;t surpass a longsword\n\tuntil 10th level, but because the damage die scales and using a two-handed\n\tweapon doesn&#8217;t change it, you might be able to do something clever with Vital\n\tStrike at high levels. Be sure to get yourself permanently enlarged so that\n\tyou get the bigger dame dice. You also get the ability to magically enhance\n\tyour weapon for a few rounds per day similar to a Magus or Paladin. Being\n\tlimited to rounds\/day is unfortunate, but it adds some nice versatility to\n\tyour weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spontaneous Casting<\/span>: The Warpriest can\n\tspontaneously cast cure\/inflict spells just like a Cleric.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Bonus Languages<\/span>: Pointless. Either cast Tongues or\n\tspend a couple of ranks on Linguistics.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fervor<\/span>: This is absolutely amazing. You can\n\tuse Fervor to heal yourself or someone else like a crappy version of Lay on\n\tHands, or you can cast any Warpriest spell on yourself as a Swift action. This\n\tmeans that you can cast effectively Quickened, Stilled spells at 2nd level,\n\twhich is fantastic for useful buffs with short durations that you can&#8217;t\n\tpredict needing before a fight starts, and you don&#8217;t need to juggle your\n\tweapon to find a free hand to cast with.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Free feats, and you get access\n\tto Fighter-only feats like Weapon Specialization and Disruptive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Energy<\/span>: Channel Energy is nice as\n\tan AOE heal for your party, but it consumes two uses of Fervor. Because Fervor\n\tis so powerful and allows so few uses per day, Channel Energy should be a used\n\tvery sparingly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sacred Armor<\/span>: Unlike Sacred Weapon, the\n\tWarpriest can enhance their armor for minutes\/level. This is great when you\n\tdon&#8217;t have other buffs which you need to cast using Fervor, or when you&#8217;re low\n\ton spells. By 7th level you should easily be able to use this in every fight\n\tin a day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aspect of War<\/span>: This is a fantastic buff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The following abilities assume that you&#8217;re planning to play a melee Warpriest, which is likely considering that Warpriests get heavy armor. If you plan to play a ranged Warpriest, switch Strength and Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Your primary offensive ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: You need at most 12 to max out full\n\tplate and to give you a bit of help with the Warpriest&#8217;s poor Reflex saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Everyone needs hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Used for nothing but skills. If your\n\tparty can cover your skill needs, dump to 7.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Your spellcasting ability, and\n\tdetermines uses per day for several Warpriest abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Used for nothing but skills.

The Dwarf favored class bonus offers\n\ta few extra uses per day of the Warpriest&#8217;s Blessings, but you need to use\n\tspecific blessings.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: Nothing useful for the Warpriest.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Absolutely nothing good for the\n\tWarpriest.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Flexible ability bonus, bot\n\tnothing specifically helpful for the Warpriest. You can trade in some\n\talternate racial features to make the Half-Elf a bit more appealing, like the\n\tAncestral Weapons trait which can let you use something cool like a Falcata as\n\tyour Sacred Weapon. The Half-Elf favored class bonus is awful, but Half-Elves\n\tcan also take the Elf or Human favored class bonuses, and getting bonus combat\n\tfeats is a great option. If you&#8217;re planning to take Exotic Weapon Proficiency,\n\tthe Half-Elf is essentially equal to the Human.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Flexible ability bonus and\n\tDarkvision. The Half-Orc favored class bonus is garbage unless you plan to\n\tspend a lot of time dying, so take the Human favored class bonus instead for\n\tsome free combat feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Halfling<\/span>: Absolutely nothing good for the\n\tWarpriest.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Fantastic and versatile. The flexible\n\tability bonus can go in either Strength or Wisdom depending on your play\n\tstyle. The Human favored class bonus gets you extra combat feats, which may be\n\tthe best favored class bonus in the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any Face,\n\t\tbut Charisma is a dump stat for the Warpriest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): The Warpriest doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tget a pet to train.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): Excellent supplement to\n\t\tmagical healing, and the Warpriest should have decent Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any Face,\n\t\tbut Charisma is a dump stat for the Warpriest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (engineering)<\/span> (Int):\n\t\tSituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (religion)<\/span> (Int): One of the\n\t\tmost important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): The Warpriest doesn&#8217;t get a\n\t\tmount to ride.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Essential for any\n\t\tFace, but Charisma is a dump stat for the Warpriest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Great for identifying\n\t\tspells and magic items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swim<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channeled Blessing<\/span>: The range on Channel\n\t\tEnergy is puny.

However, Sacred Weapon works with any weapon, so you might\n\t\tconsider access to a shield or a weapon which works with weapon finesse an\n\t\tacceptable compromise.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because your weapon&#8217;s damage scales thanks to Sacred Weapon, go for something with cool abilities or a high threat range like a flail or a scimitar.

However, it allows you\n\t\tto perform somatic components with the hand holding the shield, which means\n\t\tthat you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue, and because it\n\t\thas no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone can use it without\n\t\tissue.

If you are a 3.5 native, go read Pathfinder&#8217;s rules for staffs because they have improved dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staffs are a reliable, rechargeable source of extra spellcasting that can give spellcasters easy and reliable access to spells from their spell list which they might not want to learn, or which they might like to use so frequently that they can&#8217;t prepare the spell enough times in a given day. On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Warpriest is already a hybrid class, so there is little reason to multiclass further.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Warpriest is a combination of the Fighter and the Cleric, but manages to be distinctively different from the Paladin.
