The penalties can be fairly gentle if you plan for them, and the new Revelations are absolutely amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Oracle&#8217;s Curse<\/span>: Taking another curse hurts,\n\tbut a couple of the curses are fairly gentle.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: None?

Forcing enemies to reroll might make them more likely to fail a\n\t\tcrucial saving throw, or they might just burn the reroll on an attack. There\n\t\tis no saving throw, which is fantastic for really tough enemies, but be sure\n\t\tnot to use this on targets with Spellcraft.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">oracle&#8217;s burden<\/span>: Because you have two\n\t\tcurses, this is twice as versatile as it is for most Oracles. Of course,\n\t\tit&#8217;s also much more useful if your curse is one of the more debilitating\n\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">bestow curse<\/span>: Fantastic debuff.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelations<\/span>: Two additional revelations, and\n\tthe two new revelations made available are absolutely incredible.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Misfortune<\/span> (Ex): Imagine this scenario:\n\t\tYou are a straight caster Oracle. Your Charisma is insanely high, and your\n\t\tspell DCs are nearly impossible to overcome. You cast Dominate Person or\n\t\tsomething on an enemy, and he rolls a natural 20, his only change of saving\n\t\tagainst your spell. You use Misfortune, force him to reroll, and watch as he\n\t\tproceeds to murder his former allies. You can use this as many times per day\n\t\tas you want, and there is almost no reason to not use it when an enemy\n\t\tpasses a saving throw. On top of that, you can use this on your allies, so\n\t\tyou can force them to reroll failed saves which would otherwise kill them.\n\t\tThis is also a great option if you are planning to class dip into Oracle for\n\t\twhatever reason because it doesn&#8217;t depend on your level in any way.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fortune<\/span> (Ex): A universal d20 reroll,\n\t\tusable multiple times per day.

The abilities and effects are vaguely related to being possessed, but not in the &#8220;I&#8217;m a vesel for an otherwordly being&#8221; way. More of the &#8220;slightly spooky shit happens around me and I find it just as unsettling as you do&#8221; sort of way. If your Mystery has a bad spell list, Possessed replaces most of it with some decent options, but otherwise leaves the Mystery in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Oracle&#8217;s Curse<\/span>: Haunted and Tongues are two\n\tof the least harmful curses, but it&#8217;s still annoying to need to take two\n\tcurses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Some very good options, some\n\tvery bad ones.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">ventriloquism<\/span>: Very situational, and easily\n\t\treplaced by Ghost Sound.

The minutes per level duration is\n\t\talso surprisingly good for a first level spell.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">glitterdust<\/span>: Despite a rounds per level\n\t\tduration, this is at least as good as Faerie Fire. The blinding effect can\n\t\tblind groups of enemies, and there is no save to resist the\n\t\tinvisibility-negating effect.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">guiding star<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">wandering star motes<\/span>: Great option for\n\t\tdisabling enemies, and for removing concealment. If it falls off of the\n\t\ttarget it will jump to another, so hopefully this will get some mileage in\n\t\tgroups of enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">meteor swarm<\/span>: Very flashy, but not as\n\t\tpowerful as it should be for a 9th-level spell.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revelations<\/span>: A couple of Revelations from\n\tthe Heavens Mystery. Guiding Star is bad, but Star Chart can be very\n\tuseful.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Guiding Star<\/span> (Su): Very situational. Most\n\t\tadventuring tends to happen during the day, and much of it takes place\n\t\tinside.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Star Chart<\/span> (Ex): Commune is a great spell\n\t\tdespite the 500gp cost. Make sure to talk to your GM to make sure that they\n\t\tare okay giving you this much information on a daily basis.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Mystery Class Skills, Mystery Spells (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 18th), Revelation (1st, 7th)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"warsighted\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/occultist\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-occultist-archetypes\/warsighted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warsighted<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Warsighted Oracle trades 4 Revelations for Martial Flexibility.
