While they are primarily a martial class similar to the Fighter, some of their most powerful and interesting class features depend on Charisma, so it&#8217;s difficult to simply ignore them in order to simplify your ability score needs. Races which can get three ability score increases are often the Paladin&#8217;s best choice, though many paladins do just fine with only middling Charisma and thanks to Fighting Style (Blessed Warrior) you can also build around Constitution and Charisma and let your Strength\/Dexterity remain low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Paladins are already one of the most durable classes in the game, so while other classes often need to look for extra defenses from their race, paladins are often fine without them. Between Aura of Protection, various immunities, and Lay on Hands, paladins are perfectly capable of staying upright when things get tough. If you do explore additional defenses, be cautious about the &#8220;tank fallacy&#8221;, and expect to use a two-handed weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Paladins get the typical 4 skills (2 from class, 2 from background), and since you&#8217;re dependent on Charisma you&#8217;re likely going to learn some Face skills. If you want to expand beyond Face skills, additional skill proficiencies from your race are a great idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Innate spellcasting is an interesting option for the Paladin. While you do have spell slots to re-cast spells, those slots are few in number and in many cases they&#8217;ll serve you better if you use them for smiting. If you do look for innate spellcasting, it may need to be spells that you only want to cast once or twice a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2661\">paladin handbook<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Paladin Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dragonmarks\">Dragonmarks<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Lineages<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"app-root\">\n\t<p>Filter controls are loading.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/js\/dnd5RacesPageFilters.js?version=12\"><\/script>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Paladin Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that not all races will be available in every game.
