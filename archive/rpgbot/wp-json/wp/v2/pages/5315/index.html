If you would like help with Pathfinder options not covered here, please <a href=\"mailto:RPGBOT@RPGBOT.net\">email me<\/a> and I may be able to provide additional assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks. Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"talents\">Talents<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Assault Leader<\/span> (Ex): The limited use is\n\ttragic, but the benefit is fantastic. If you&#8217;re a flanking-based rogue, this\n\tcould mean giving your fighter a free attack. If you miss, the extra damage\n\tfrom your ally is a nice consolation prize.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Black Market Connections<\/span> (Ex): If you are\n\thigh enough level for this ability to matter, you likely have access to\n\tteleportation spells available to your party. Teleport to a bigger city and go\n\tshopping.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bleeding Attack<\/span>* (Ex): Bleed effects are\n\talways tempting, but rarely worthwhile. This could be useful for hit-and-run\n\tattacks, but you would be better served outright killing someone instead of\n\twaiting for them to bleed to death. At higher levels the bleed damage can\n\tbecome very scary, but fast healing and regeneration become more common.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Befuddling Strike<\/span>* (Ex): The effect isn&#8217;t\n\tas good as Offensive Defense, but they work together, and Befuddling Strike\n\tlasts multiple rounds. If you have open talents and you need defense on top of\n\tOffensive Defense, this could be a good option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Camouflage<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational. With\n\tyour insane Rogue Dexterity and maxed ranks in Stealth, you shouldn&#8217;t need\n\tthis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Canny Observer<\/span> (Ex): Hugely situational. How\n\toften do you eavesdrop? The benefit to finding secret doors can be easily\n\treplace by Eyes of the Eagle, which cost 2500gp, give a +5 bonus, and cover\n\t<em>all<\/em> perception checks, instead of one specific usage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Charmer<\/span> (Ex): If you are the party&#8217;s Face,\n\tthis is good. Rerolls of any kind are excellent, and Diplomacy is one of the\n\tbest skills in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Coax Information<\/span> (Ex): This functionally\n\tsaves you an entire skill worth of skill ranks. If you&#8217;re the party&#8217;s Face and\n\tdon&#8217;t have enough skill ranks to throw around, this can be very helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Swipe<\/span>: Stealing isn&#8217;t something you\n\ttypically do in combat. Sneak in and use Sleight of Hand like a real Rogue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Trick<\/span>: While many rogue tricks are\n\tbetter than feats, it&#8217;s hard to argue with the versatility of an additional\n\tcombat feat. Two-Weapon Fighting or an archery feat are excellent options, and\n\tthis helps with feat-heavy builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Convincing Lie<\/span> (Ex): I didn&#8217;t even know that\n\tthere were rules for people repeating your lies. This is hugely\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cunning Trigger<\/span> (Ex): Unless you took\n\tQuick Trapsmith, this is totally useless. Even then, if you&#8217;re using traps a\n\tlot you should be placing your traps in such a way that you don&#8217;t need to\n\ttrigger them yourself.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deft Palm<\/span> (Ex): I would let a player hide a\n\tweapon in plain sight without this talent. I would apply a fairly high\n\tpenalty, but I would allow it. Even if your DM isn&#8217;t as liberal as I am, this\n\tis hugely situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Distracting Attack<\/span>* (Ex): This is really\n\tonly important if you have a second rogue in the party. Very few enemies\n\tdepend on Dexterity or Dodge bonuses to their AC, so unless your ally is sneak\n\tattacking there is little you will get from this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Esoteric Scholar<\/span> (Ex): You will fail.\n\tKnowledge checks tend to have fairly high DCs, and unless you have wizard-like\n\tintelligence, you will have very little chance of success.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Expert Leaper<\/span> (Ex): There are very few\n\tsituations where this will come up, and those situations can usually be solved\n\tby flying.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fast Fingers<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are fantastic,\n\tbut Sleight of Hand doesn&#8217;t see a lot of use in most campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Getaway<\/span> (Ex): This is good for Scout\n\tRogues, or for archery rogues who get stuck in melee. Slow Reactions is\n\tgenerally better unless multiple foes are threatening you. If multiple foes\n\tare threatening you, you should probably just Withdraw.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Fast Picks<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fast Stealth<\/span> (Ex): This can be helpful for\n\tinfiltrating and scouting, but if you&#8217;re sneaky enough you shouldn&#8217;t have a\n\tproblem moving at half speed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Finesse Rogue<\/span>: Weapon Finesse is basically a\n\tgiven for melee rogues, and it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have on an archer rogue in case\n\tyou become stuck in melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Firearm Training<\/span> (Ex): Firearms can be very\n\tpowerful in the hands of a rogue. A flat-footed touch attack is nearly\n\timpossible to miss, and is a great way to deal sneak attack damage. If your\n\tcampaign allows better than early firearms, this shoots right up to blue.\n\tDual-wield revolvers and unload on people from stealth.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Follow Clues<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Getaway Artist<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grit<\/span> (Ex): Effectively two feats for a Rogue\n\ttalent. If you use firearms at all, this is a must.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Guileful Polyglot<\/span> (Ex): Cast tongues.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hard to Fool<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are great, but\n\tthis is very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hold Breath<\/span> (Ex): Cast Water Breathing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Honeyed Words<\/span> (Ex): This isn&#8217;t as good as\n\tCharmer because Bluff doesn&#8217;t get used as often, but rerolls are still\n\tfantastic. If you feint a lot, this can be a really useful option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Iron Guts<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Pool<\/span> (Ex): Wisdom is not an important\n\tstat for Rogues. Ki Pool can let you make use of a lot of cool ninja tricks,\n\tbut you will have very limited uses due to your limited pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lasting Poison<\/span> (Ex): The biggest problem\n\twith poison is the cost. This doubles your mileage with poisons, but\n\texacerbates the issue of low DCs. If you&#8217;re planning to use poison, definitely\n\tconsider this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ledge Walker<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Major Magic<\/span> (Sp): Vanish seems like an\n\texcellent choice. Even so, being forced to take Minor Magic first really hurts\n\tthis option. It can be salvaged somewhat by taking the Elf favored class bonus\n\tto get additional uses per day and the Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat.\n\tImagine using Shocking Grasp as a swift action a few times per day alongside\n\tyour other attacks. It&#8217;s a hefty investment, but it&#8217;s a nice pile of\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Minor Magic<\/span> (Sp): Acid Splash is good for\n\tranged sneak attacking, and Detect Magic can help with traps. Whatever your\n\tchoice, this will be very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Nimble Climber<\/span> (Ex): Cast Spider Climb.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ninja Trick<\/span> (Ex): Most ninja tricks are the\n\tsame as rogue tricks, and the ones that aren&#8217;t require a ki pool. If you have\n\thigh enough wisdom to make good use of the Rogue Ki Pool talent, you should\n\thave played a ninja. The best use of this trick is to use Ninja Trick to get\n\tRogue Trick and pick something better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Offensive Defense<\/span>* (Ex): Great for melee\n\trogues. Your AC won&#8217;t be as good as the fighters, and you don&#8217;t have a ton of\n\thit points, so protection is very important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Peerless Maneuver<\/span> (Ex): Good for tumbling\n\tto avoid attacks of opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Positioning Attack<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic for Scout\n\trogues or for Two-Weapon Fighting rogues who need to get into position early\n\tin the combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Powerful Sneak<\/span>* (Ex): This is really\n\ttempting, but you need to use it as a full attack, which makes it useless for\n\tScout Rogues, and it applies a -2 penalty. Rogues already have problems\n\thitting due to their low BAB, so attack penalties aren&#8217;t something you want to\n\ttake lightly. Even without these issues, it only increases your damage from\n\t3.5 to 3.6. That is a rounding error, not an ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Disable<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Disguise<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Trapsmith<\/span> (Ex): Traps can be useful,\n\tbut very few fights take place on the players&#8217; home turf.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resiliency<\/span> (Ex): This is almost toughness.\n\tWith some discipline, toughness is better because you always have the hit\n\tpoints. If you tend to get yourself into bad situations, this is a nice\n\tfail-safe. You can pick up a Vest of the Cockroach to get the talent for free\n\tor to double the effect if you already have it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue Crawl<\/span> (Ex): If you are prone, you\n\tare in serious trouble. The best use of this is to 5-foot step\/crawl away,\n\tthen stand as a move action.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Rope Master<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slow Reactions<\/span>* (Ex): Fantastic for escaping\n\tor for Scout rogues.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Snap Shot<\/span> (Ex): This combines very well\n\twith Underhanded, but a good rogue usually has very high dexterity and\n\tImproved Initiatiative, which should let you go first most of the time\n\tanyway.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Sniper&#8217;s Eye<\/span> (Ex): Get Improved Precise Shot\n\tinstead. If you are focused on ranged combat, you&#8217;re going to want it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Stand Up<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational. You should\n\tnot be tripped enough to justify taking this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Strong Impression<\/span>: It&#8217;s not likely that\n\tyou have enough strength to justify this unless you&#8217;re playing a brute Rogue.\n\tEven then, you can probably find better options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Strong Stroke<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Surprise Attack<\/span> (Ex): If your initiative\n\tisn&#8217;t great, this makes it much easier to sneak attack during the surprise\n\tround.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survivalist<\/span>: Heal and Survival are decent\n\tskills, but a rogue doesn&#8217;t have a lot of uses for them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swift Poison<\/span> (Ex): Poison is a hard\n\tmechanic, and you typically want to pre-plan your poisons, so applying them in\n\tcombat shouldn&#8217;t happen enough to justify this talent unless you plan on\n\tpouring gold on enemies until they die.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Terrain Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Favored Terrain is one\n\tof the Ranger&#8217;s worst abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Trap Spotter<\/span> (Ex): This saves you the\n\ttrouble of constantly looking around for traps.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Underhanded<\/span>* (Ex): You need 12 charisma to\n\tuse this at all, which is unfortunate, but guranteed maximum sneak attack\n\tdamage is pretty fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wall Scramble<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Training<\/span>: Since you have medium BAB,\n\tattack bonuses are nice.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advanced_talents\">Advanced Talents<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Another Day<\/span> (Ex): Strictly better than\n\tDefensive Roll, even if you can only use it once per day. If you almost die\n\tmore than once in a day, you need to take the day off.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crippling Strike<\/span>* (Ex): This shuts down\n\tanything that can take ability damage. Casters will be incapacitated quickly,\n\tand big strong enemies will be crippled by their sudden lack of strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deadly Cocktail<\/span> (Ex): Has the opposite\n\teffect of Lasting Poison.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deadly Sneak<\/span>* (Ex): This feels nice, but is\n\tstatistically useless. Average roll on a d6 is 3.5, and if you make 1s and 2s\n\tinto 3s, your average roll changes from 3.5 to 4.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defensive Roll<\/span> (Ex): This could save your\n\tlife, but at this point damage rolls will be fairly huge, and your reflex\n\tsaves will certainly not keep up with damage bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dispelling Attack<\/span>* (Su): If you need to\n\tdispel things, your spellcasters should be doing it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Entanglement of Blades<\/span>* (Ex): A 5-foot\n\tstep is a very important tactical option, but rogues typically aren&#8217;t\n\tarea-control fighters. With the possible exception of spellcasters, anyone\n\tthat is stepping away from you isn&#8217;t going to gain much of an advantage. Even\n\tthen, the Step Up feat is likely a better option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Tumble<\/span> (Ex): Using Acrobatics to move\n\tthrough combat is crucial at any level. Moving at full speed makes tumbling a\n\tconsiderably better option, and removing that +10 to the DC is a pretty big\n\tbonus. For Scout Rogues and other mobile builds, this is a must.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feat<\/span>: Strictly better than Fighter bonus\n\tfeats. At this level you have access to some truly amazing feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frugal Trapsmith<\/span> (Ex): If you really like\n\ttraps, which are expensive, this is a good way to save some cash.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter&#8217;s Surprise<\/span> (Ex): Once per day, until\n\tthe end of your turn, you get to murder people without actually working for\n\tit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knock-Out Blow<\/span> (Ex): This works very\n\tsimilarly to the Assassin&#8217;s Death Attack ability. Knocking a target\n\tunconscious essentially makes them bait for a coup de grace.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Iconic and\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Opportunist<\/span> (Ex): Extra attacks are\n\tessential for melee rogues. Combine this with Assault Leader, and you can\n\tmiss, your friend gets an attack, then you get to try your attack again.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skill Mastery<\/span>: Acrobatics, Perception, and\n\tUse Magic Device are fantastic choices. The DCs are easily attainable with a\n\t10 at this leve, but failure can get you killed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Slippery Mind<\/span> (Ex): Reroll saves against\n\tenchantment spells one round later. I&#8217;m not sure how this works with\n\tEnchantment spells which kill you, but Enchantment is one of the scarier\n\tschools of magic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Master of Disguise<\/span> (Ex): Buy a hat of\n\tdisguise. By this level the cost is negligible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Redirect Attack<\/span> (Ex): If you have two things\n\tadjacent to you, you are adjacent to an ally, or you are in the wrong place.\n\tSo either you redirect the attack to an ally, which is rude, or you&#8217;re in a\n\tbad situation and shouldn&#8217;t need this power.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stealthy Sniper<\/span> (Ex): For archer and sniper\n\trogues, this is essential. The -20 penalty for sniping is brutal, and this can\n\tmake sniping a much more reliable option. Keep in mind that using Perception\n\tin combat is a move action, so at the very least people need to spend a move\n\taction looking for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thoughtful Reexamining<\/span> (Ex): Sense Motive\n\tand Perception are both class skills for you, but using a reroll later in the\n\tday is fairly situational. Your knowledge skills aren&#8217;t fantastic, so you&#8217;re\n\tnot going to get a lot of mileage out of re-rolling them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Confounding Blades<\/span>* (Ex): Slow Reactions is\n\tfantastic, and this is miles better. Now you can use Confounding Blades, then\n\tswitch to other sneak attack modifying talents for a few rounds. Maybe use\n\tBleeding Attack and run away while your targets all bleed to death.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Familiar<\/span> (Ex): Minor Magic and Major Magic\n\tare not very good, but a familiar for a rogue is fantastic. Familiars use your\n\tskill modifiers, which means they get your fantastic stealth and perception\n\tmodifiers. If you get a viper as your familiar, you can collect poison from\n\tit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Getaway Master<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hard Minded<\/span> (Ex): Most things which allow\n\twill saves are mind-affecting. This means you get free rerolls\n\t<em>every turn<\/em> against most will saves. Your will save probably won&#8217;t be\n\tfantastic, so these rerolls can really help to cover your defenses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hide in Plain Sight<\/span> (Ex): If your campaign\n\ttakes place largely in one region, such as a town or a megadungeon, this is\n\treally fantastic. If you tend to travel a lot, it will be hard to use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Rumormonger<\/span> (Ex): UI don&#8217;t know why this\n\tneeds to be a talent. People spread rumors all of the time without being\n\t11th-level rogues. As a DM, I would allow players to do this without a talent.\n\tEven if your DM won&#8217;t, this is still a highly situational ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unwitting Ally<\/span> (Ex): Great for Two-Weapon\n\tFighting rogues in situations with multiple enemies. Unfortunately you can\n\tonly use this on the same target once per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Snatcher<\/span> (Ex): Your Sleight of Hand\n\tskill will be considerably better than your CMB, but watch out for the attack\n\tof opportunity from attempting to disarm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Rogue talents define a Rogue in much the same way that feats define a fighter.
