If you have frail allies (and almost every party includes a few), they&#8217;ll benefit greatly from this archetype, especially if they&#8217;re also in melee where they&#8217;re likely to draw attacks from time to times. The only drawback is that the archetype provides no abilities which increase your damage output, which makes it important to have another Striker in the party to compensate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ancestral Guardian&#8217;s biggest problems are that it doesn&#8217;t provide additional damage output except Vengeful Ancestors (which may be totally fine if your party already does plenty of damage) and doesn&#8217;t make you any more durable than the core barbarian class features already do. This is very much a subclass dedicated to protecting your allies at your own expense. Be sure to keep your AC and your hit point maximum as high as possible, and expect to lean heavily on healing resources (hit dice, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Path of the Ancestral Guardian also notably doesn&#8217;t have an ability to consume your Bonus Action once you have started Rage, which makes this archetype a viable choice for two-weapon fighting if you&#8217;re desperate for a TWF barbarian, but you might also look at other options like Great Weapon Master, Shield Master, etc. But if you find that tracking Ancestral Protectors and Spirit Shield is already enough complexity, don&#8217;t stress about not using your Bonus Action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/ancestral-guardian\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"12052\">Path of the Ancestral Guardian Barbarian Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ancestral Protectors<\/span>: This is an amazing\n\t\t&#8220;taunt&#8221; mechanic. Sure, the target can attack other people, but they do so\n\t\twith Disadvantage and do half damage. At that point, attacking anyone except\n\t\tyou seems pointless. You do need to hit something for this to trigger, so\n\t\tyou should absolutely use Reckless Attack to improve the likelihood that you\n\t\thit as much as possible.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Shield<\/span>: There is no limitation on\n\t\thow often you can use this except that it uses your Reaction. This is a\n\t\t<em>massive<\/em> increase to your party&#8217;s survivability, and even if this\n\t\tnever scaled it would still be fantastic. The only problem is that you can&#8217;t\n\t\tuse it on yourself, but fortunately you get damage resistance from Rage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Consult the Spirits<\/span>: Augury and\n\t\tClairvoyance are two of my favorite divinations because they&#8217;re simple, but\n\t\textremely useful. Use Augury any time you make a major decision with unknown\n\t\trisks. Use Clairvoyance to scout around corners, behind doors, etc. By this\n\t\tlevel actual spellcasters will be able to do this with ease, but you can use\n\t\tthis ability once per short rest without spending spell slots, so doing it\n\t\tyourself may be less costly for the party.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vengeful Ancestors<\/span>: As a Reaction, reflect\n\t\tup to 4d6 damage directed at an ally back to the attacker. Amazing. You\n\t\tmight encourage your allies to draw fire just so you can use this,\n\t\tespecially when facing enemies with multiple low-damage attacks so that you\n\t\tcan reliably reflect all or most of the damage from a single attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battlerager\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/barbarian#PathoftheBattlerager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Path of the Battlerager<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Battlerager is a grappling-focused option for the Barbarian. It leans into the Barbarian&#8217;s love of aggressive melee tactics, encouraging you to dive into melee, grab onto an enemy, and make yourself a big, spiky problem. But with poor durability and terrible scaling, the Battlerager really struggles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/battlerager\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31145\">Battlerager Barbarian Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Battlerager Armor<\/span>: A free attack as a\n\t\tBonus Action is great. Don&#8217;t forget that your Rage bonus to damage still\n\t\tapplies. The ability to deal damage when you grapple is also nice, but it&#8217;s only 3 damage, it doesn&#8217;t scale, and there&#8217;s no\n\t\tway for you to improve it further.\n\t\t<p>However, spiked armor&#8217;s stats are bad and the 16 AC will be a constant\n\t\t\tproblem for you, especially with Reckless Attack. Using the Bonus Action\n\t\t\tattack can be hard, too, because many Barbarian class features are\n\t\t\tactivated as a Bonus Action, including Rage.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reckless Abandon<\/span>: You&#8217;re likely going to\n\t\tuse Reckless Attack every turn in combat, and the temporary hit points reset\n\t\tevery time you do so, dramatically improving your ability to endure damage.\n\t\tThis will be crucial since your 16 AC is going to make you a huge target for\n\t\tany random kobold that&#8217;s getting Advantage to hit you thanks to Reckless\n\t\tAttack.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Battlerager Charge<\/span>: Functionally similar\n\t\tto the Charger feat. Unfortunately, since you want to use the same Bonus\n\t\tAction to attack with your armor, it means that you give up damage output to\n\t\tget into position to attack.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Spiked Retribution<\/span>: Not a lot of damage\n\t\tat this level, but, by now, many enemies will have multiple attacks, so it will\n\t\tadd up quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/barbarian#PathoftheBeast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Path of the Beast<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Path of the Beast is a perfect balance of durability and damage output, allowing the Barbarian to serve as a front-line Defender without falling into the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/the-tank-fallacy\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13154\">Tank Fallacy<\/a>&#8221; which plagues many other barbarian subclasses. Like the Path of the Totem Warrior, the Path of the Beast includes several decision points to customize your build, but unlike totem barbarians the Path of the Beast can change these choices either every time they rage or every time they rest, allowing the Barbarian to rapidly adapt to situations rather than just gritting their teeth and raging through whatever comes their way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/path-of-the-beast\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"12204\">Path of the Beast Barbarian<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Form of the Beast<\/span>: Every time you rage,\n\t\tyou get to choose which of the three options to use. They are all good, but\n\t\tthey&#8217;re all good for different things at different times, so knowing which\n\t\tone to use in any given situation is important.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bite<\/span>: Bite is technically the least\n\t\t\t\timportant of the three available options, but if anyone is going to hang\n\t\t\t\tout at less than half hit points it&#8217;s the Barbarian. You can use this\n\t\t\t\twhile both of your hands are full, which makes it easy to use with a\n\t\t\t\tshield. Still, if you&#8217;re not guaranteed to benefit from the healing in\n\t\t\t\tyour current fight, go for a different option. Remember that the healing\n\t\t\t\tonly works once on each of your turns, so if you want to switch to a\n\t\t\t\tweapon for your second attack (once you get Extra Attack), that may be a\n\t\t\t\tgood idea if you have a cool magic weapon to use.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Claws<\/span>: Your go-to option for damage\n\t\t\t\toutput. The wording here is easy to miss, so let me spell it out: If you\n\t\t\t\ttake the Attack action and attack with the claws once, you get an\n\t\t\t\tadditional attack with the claws as part of the same action. You don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tneed to spend your Bonus Action to do it, so you can get the extra\n\t\t\t\tattack in the same turn that you rage. You can make all of your claw\n\t\t\t\tattacks with one hand, so there is no reason to forgo a shield.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tail<\/span>: Longsword damage, reach, and\n\t\t\t\tboost your AC as a Reaction. The AC bonus averages to 4.5, which is\n\t\t\t\tenough to negate a lot of attacks. Unfortunately attackers need to be\n\t\t\t\twithin 10 ft. so you won&#8217;t be able to block ranged attacks typically.\n\t\t\t\tLike the other options you can use this with a shield.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestial Soul<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to rely on\n\t\tnatural weapons, you need them to count as magical or you&#8217;re going to have a\n\t\tlot of trouble dealing damage.\n\t\t<p>This level also lets you take on some animal traits that allow you to\n\t\t\tfunction in some unusual scenarios which typically require magic. These\n\t\t\tbenefits notably work outside of your rage, so you don&#8217;t need to get angry\n\t\t\tto breath water or climb on the ceiling.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swim Speed<\/span>: Situational, but the\n\t\t\t\tfact that you also get to breath water is really helpful. Take a nap and\n\t\t\t\tdream about weresharks, and you&#8217;ll wake up with gills and webbed toes\n\t\t\t\t(it doesn&#8217;t actually say that in the rules, but it feels like that\n\t\t\t\tshould happen).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Climb Speed<\/span>: Climb speeds are the next\n\t\t\t\tbest thing to fly speeds, and this is basically Spider Climb, which is\n\t\t\t\tthe gold standard of climb speeds. Climb on the ceiling and hit people\n\t\t\t\twith your tail or throw javelins at them.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jump<\/span>: Jumping is very rarely useful,\n\t\t\t\tand situations which require jumping can typically be handled better by\n\t\t\t\tclimbing or flying. Still, of all the jumping-related abilities in 5e,\n\t\t\t\tthis one is among the best. It works both vertically and horizontally,\n\t\t\t\tso you can jump incredibly high. However, it notably doesn&#8217;t address\n\t\t\t\tfalling, so if you leap 30 feet into the air you&#8217;re going to regret that\n\t\t\t\tdecision unless you grab onto something before falling since 5e doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tnegate falling damage just because you jumped.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Infectious Fury<\/span>: Tying the DC to your\n\t\tConstitution is great. Even if you started at 16 Constitution and haven&#8217;t\n\t\tgotten a chance to increase it, your DC will be decent. Using this a number\n\t\tof times per day equal to your Proficiency Bonus is enough that it can be\n\t\ttactically impactful, but it&#8217;s not something that you can afford to use\n\t\tevery turn.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Forced Attack<\/span>: Forcing enemies to\n\t\t\t\tattack their allies is great, but the benefits don&#8217;t stop there. Since\n\t\t\t\tthis forces the target to use their Reaction, they can&#8217;t perform an\n\t\t\t\tOpportunity Attack and they can&#8217;t do annoying things like cast\n\t\t\t\tCounterspell so if your target&#8217;s melee attacks are pitiful you could\n\t\t\t\tforce them to attack you for whatever measly damage they might do in\n\t\t\t\torder to prevent spellcasters from doing cast shenanigans.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Damage<\/span>: 2d12 damage is enough\n\t\t\t\tto match a single attack from many creatures, but as you reach higher\n\t\t\t\tlevels you&#8217;ll face many enemies which can do considerably more so you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tget more out of the forced attack. However, the forced attack doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\thelp in single-enemy encounters, and even in multi-enemy encounters you\n\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t always have another enemy nearby which you can target with the\n\t\t\t\tforced the attack. The damage is psychic, and very few creatures are\n\t\t\t\tresistant or immune to psychic damage, so this is a safe, reliable\n\t\t\t\tdamage boost, but remember that this has a daily usage limit so don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tburn through it too quickly. The damage is also from a separate source\n\t\t\t\tfrom your attack, so it&#8217;s not multiplied on a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Call of the Hunt<\/span>: The benefits to you\n\t\tscale based on the number of creatures that accept the benefit. There is no\n\t\tdownside to the effect, so assume that your party is going to accept. The\n\t\tmaximum number of creatures is your Constitution Modifier, which can get up\n\t\tto +7 at level 20, so you need to somehow get 7 creatures to accept the\n\t\teffect. A typical party of 4 can&#8217;t do that unless you add familiars, pets,\n\t\tsummons, or a bag full of angry rats. The pile of temporary hit points on\n\t\ttop of the damage resistances provided by Rage will make you incredibly\n\t\tdurable, and the d6 bonus damage for your allies will be a nice boost to\n\t\tdamage output for anyone who relies on attack rolls (fighters, monks, and\n\t\twarlocks are ideal).\n\t\t<p>The wording on the damage bonus is strange, but the effect is actually\n\t\t\treally simple. Affected creatures deal +1d6 damage when they hit with an\n\t\t\tattack. It doesn&#8217;t specify a type, so they add bonus damage of the same\n\t\t\ttype which their attack deals. If their attack deals multiple types, the\n\t\t\tattack can typically decide which type to add but the DM might choose to\n\t\t\thave it divide evenly between the multiple damage types. The weird wording\n\t\t\tof the damage bonus seems to mean that the d6 isn&#8217;t multiplied on a\n\t\t\tcritical hit since they gain a bonus equal to a roll of the d6 rather than\n\t\t\tadding 1d6 as &#8220;extra damage&#8221; like Hunter&#8217;s Mark or Divine Smite do.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You can only use this a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus\n\t\t\teach day, but by the time you get this your Proficiency Bonus and your\n\t\t\tnumber of rages per day match, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about tracking\n\t\t\tthis unless you somehow gain additional rages per day.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"berserker\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/barbarian#PathoftheBerserker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Path of the Berserker<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Berserker is a the iconic Barbarian. If you want to get mad and wreck people&#8217;s faces, the Berserker is a fine choice. However, its signature ability Frenzy has a complicated interaction with the Exhaustion rules which makes the subclass a difficult choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun fact: &#8220;Berserker&#8221; translates to &#8220;Bear Shirt&#8221;, but the Berserker has nothing to do with bears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest problem with the Berserker is Exhaustion. Frenzy is great, but it&#8217;s simply too costly. You can manage one level of Exhaustion without much trouble, especially since Rage grants Advantage on Strength checks which will mostly offset the effects of one level of Exhaustion. Two levels of Exhaustion makes it hard to function in combat. Fast Movement&#8217;s speed increase helps, but having a speed of 20 feet (less for some races like dwarves) makes it difficult to get around in melee, and being unable to close the distance to get into melee means that you&#8217;re borderline useless. 3 levels of exhaustion is basically a death sentence in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, the only free way to resolve Exhaustion is to take a long rest, which means that using Frenzy can take several days to recover from if you use it repeatedly, so while wizards are getting back all of their spell slots overnight you need to spend several days resting to get back to your full capacity. You could use Greater Restoration at a cost of 100gp per use, but that&#8217;s a hard cost to pay repeatedly, not to mention the spell slot cost that your allies need to pay to cast it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, fixing Path of the Berserker is pretty simple. Literally the only thing that needs to change is the usage limitations on Frenzy. By changing the cost to use it, the Berserker immediately becomes both playable and exciting. Consider one of the following changes to Frenzy as a solution:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Using Frenzy costs an additional Rage, so instead of spending 1 daily Rage usage the player can spend a total of 2 to also activate Frenzy. This makes Frenzy an occasional buff which yields rewards now but strains the player&#8217;s limited resources.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow the Berserker to recover from one level of Exhaustion whenever they take a Short Rest. This deters the Berserker from using Frenzy in every encounter, but also curiously makes them immune to the need for food and water. Wizards of the Coast didn&#8217;t seem to mind that weird rules hiccup when they introduced Deft Explorer (Tireless) for the Ranger, so there&#8217;s some precedent in the official rules.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limit Frenzy to once per Short Rest. Nice an simple. This keeps Frenzy as an occasional buff rather than a constant improvement to Rage, but it&#8217;s accessible often enough that players won&#8217;t stress over using it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Remove the usage limitation entirely. Yes, Frenzy is a 50% damage boost for the Barbarian, but it&#8217;s still just an additional weapon attack. Many other barbarian subclasses have similar damage boosts (Zealot&#8217;s Divine Fury, Storm Herald&#8217;s Storm Aura, Battlerager&#8217;s spiked armor attack), and have no limitations beyond the Bonus Action to activate them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add a Constitution saving throw at the end of a Frenzy with a DC of 10 + the number of rounds. On a failure, the Berserker suffers one level of Exhaustion. This adds a risk-reward mechanic to each Frenzy, and it encourages the Berserker to end fights quickly or potentially end their Rage early. However, as the Barbarian&#8217;s save bonus increases the risk diminishes, so at low levels Frenzy may be very risky, while at high levels it may be little risk at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Frenzy<\/span>: When you absolutely, positively\n\t\thave to kill every living thing in a room, and don&#8217;t care about the cost. An\n\t\textra attack as a bonus action gives you the action economy of two-weapon\n\t\tfighting with the damage output of a single two-handed weapon, effectively\n\t\tadding 50% to your damage output (100% until you get Extra Attack, but that\n\t\tonly applies at levels 3 and 4 so 50% is a better explanation).\n\t\t<p>However, Exhaustion can debilitate you for days at a time. Use this\n\t\t\tsparingly, and be sure to note what penalties you get for each level of\n\t\t\texhaustion (PHB pg. 291). Recovering from multiple levels of Exhaustion\n\t\t\twill take several days, which makes this hard to use more than once in a\n\t\t\tday.

Allies threatening that enemy can already get\n\t\t\t\tAdvantage from you if you selected Wolf for your Totem Spirit, and you\n\t\t\t\tcan already get Advantage from Reckless Attack, so this may not be very\n\t\t\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"zealot\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/barbarian#PathoftheZealot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Path of the Zealot<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>A great choice for players who tend to die a lot or for players who want a mechanically simple build, the Zealot makes surviving and recovering from death considerably easier while still doing decent damage. However, because many of its abilities are tied up in keeping you alive, it doesn&#8217;t have great offensive abilities beyond dealing damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people contact me about this one to contest my thoughts on the matter, so let me elaborate on why I haven&#8217;t given Path of the Zealot a better rating: In essence, the Zealot falls into a weird form the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/the-tank-fallacy\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"13154\">tank fallacy<\/a>&#8220;. The Zealot&#8217;s biggest strength is that they are really good at coming back from death, which is a great thing for a front-line martial character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that makes them an unappealing target for enemy attacks. Why should a monster spend its time hitting your barbarian with a mountain of hit points, frustrating damage resistances, and the ability to reroll a saving throw (Fanatical Focus) when they could simply walk past you to go kill your allies who are doing considerably more damage than you are?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If enemies are ever foolish enough to attack you, you can be raised at no cost and have a good laugh about it later (provided that your party has access to magic options to do so, which isn&#8217;t a guarantee), but none of that actually makes you more of a threat in a fight than a barbarian with no subclass at all. Divine Fury does offer a damage boost, but at best that just motivates creatures to stay away from you and focus on your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/zealot\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14389\">Path of the Zealot Barbarian Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Fury<\/span>: A whole bunch of bonus\n\t\tdamage, and the damage type options are really good. You only get to use\n\t\tthis once one each of your turns (you can&#8217;t use it outside of your own\n\t\tturn), so if you&#8217;re using Reckless Attack you likely don&#8217;t need to scramble\n\t\tfor additional attack attempts to guarantee that you&#8217;ll deal this damage\n\t\treliably.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warrior of the Gods<\/span>: Generally dying is\n\t\tsomething that you work very hard to avoid, but if anyone&#8217;s going to die in\n\t\tcombat it&#8217;s a barbarian. Spells which raise the dead have expensive material\n\t\tcomponents, and this allows you to bypass them. So long as you&#8217;re friends\n\t\twith a sufficiently high-level cleric, you don&#8217;t need to worry about an\n\t\tuntimely death. The lowest-level option is Revivify, but even at high levels\n\t\tRevivify is going to be a better option than spending a higher-level spell\n\t\tslot on something like Raise Dead. Encourage your party members to get\n\t\tRevivify as soon as possible, and do whatever you need to do in order to\n\t\tmake them feel good about that choice. Consider buying them pizza or\n\t\tsomething.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fanatical Focus<\/span>: Excellent for\n\t\tsave-or-suck effects, and since it works once per rage you get to use it\n\t\tnumerous times in a single day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Zealous Presence<\/span>: Once per day, it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t affect you, and it only lasts for one round, but granting allies Advantage on all attacks for a round is still strong. It gets more useful the\n\t\tlarger your party is, so encourage your allies to summon creatures, use\n\t\tpets, etc. If they happen to also need to make saves, we can consider that a bonus as the main purpose of this ability is the Advantage on attack rolls.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rage beyond Death<\/span>: Drink a Potion of\n\t\tHealing right before your rage ends and you&#8217;re functionally unable to die\n\t\tdue to hit points loss while raging. You can&#8217;t go below 0 hit points, so as\n\t\tlong as you get above 0 (again, Potion of Healing) before your rage ends\n\t\tyou&#8217;re fine, so once you hit 0 hit points you no longer need to care about\n\t\ttaking damage. There are effects like Disintegrate and Power Word Kill which\n\t\tbecome very scary, but otherwise you&#8217;re fine.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wild-magic\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/barbarian#PathofWildMagic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Path of Wild Magic<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Much like the Wild Magic Sorcerer, the Path of Wild Magic Barbarian is a choice for players who enjoy some chaos and unpredictability in their game. Expect to roll on the Wild Magic table with increasing frequency as you gain levels, eventually getting to the point where you may roll every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Path of Wild Magic comes with its own Wild Magic table. Many of the original Wild Magic table&#8217;s effects were specific to the Sorcerer. Perhaps more important, <em>all of the effects are beneficial<\/em>, even if they&#8217;re unpredictable. Many of them provide ongoing benefits which last for the duration of your Rage, and many of those benefits are absolutely spectacular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/path-of-wild-magic\/\">Path of Wild Magic Barbarian Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Awareness<\/span>: Basically Detect Magic\n\t\tin a circle. Ideally you&#8217;ll have a spellcaster in the party who can handle\n\t\tthis since you&#8217;re not really suited to do anything about whatever you find out, but it can be a load off of spellcasters who learn spells permanently if they\u2019re the only casters in your party.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Surge<\/span>: Path of Wild Magic&#8217;s Wild\n\t\tMagic table is universally beneficial. What you roll on the table may\n\t\trequire you to reconsider your tactics, but with some quick thinking you can\n\t\tturn any of the effects into a major advantage. Keep in mind that many of\n\t\tthe activated effects use your Bonus Action, so avoid character options that\n\t\tuse your Bonus Action such as two-weapon fighting.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bolstering Magic<\/span>: Adding a d3 to attack\n\t\trolls sounds underwhelming, but it&#8217;s still an average of +2 to all of your\n\t\tattacks, it lasts 10 minutes, and it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration like\n\t\teffects like Bless. Combined with Reckless Attack, you can make it all but\n\t\tcertain that your attacks will hit, even if you&#8217;re taking the penalty from\n\t\tGreat Weapon Master.\n\t\t<p>The option to restore spell slots is neat for allies who don&#8217;t rely on\n\t\t\tattacks, but the impact of another low-level spell slot will diminish as\n\t\t\tyou gain levels (though Warlocks will never complain), while +1d3 to\n\t\t\tattacks will literally always be helpful.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unstable Backlash<\/span>: Using this as your\n\t\tReaction when you take damage or fail a save means that you can likely use\n\t\tthis every round (especially if you intentionally cause damage to yourself). If your current Wild Magic effect doesn&#8217;t appeal to you,\n\t\tgo looking for a better option.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Controlled Surge<\/span>: While none of the\n\t\teffects on Path of Wild Magic&#8217;s Wild Magic table are negative, the ability\n\t\tto choose between two effects (or any of them if you&#8217;re lucky) means that\n\t\tyou can pick whichever option suits your current needs best. This also\n\t\tworks with Unstable Backlash, so you can repeatedly choose to reroll your\n\t\tresult until you finally get one that you&#8217;re happy with.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-pale\">3rd-Party Publishers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT has covered some 3rd-party content from our favorite creators.
