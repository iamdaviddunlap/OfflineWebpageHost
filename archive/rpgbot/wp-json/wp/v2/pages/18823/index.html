Challenges in the core rules make some of the subclass less powerful than intended, but when things work as intended it&#8217;s a fun subclass with some cool ideas, though the unpredictability of Tales From Beyond can be frustrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The whole subclass is built around Tales From Beyond, which allows the Bard to generate a randomly-selected magical effect from a list. This provides a fun but unpredictable mechanic which can be either wildly effective or barely impactful depending on the situation and the Tale drawn. This unpredictability helps to balance some of the more powerful options which amount to save-or-suck effects at the cost of a Bardic Inspiration die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Managing Tales From Beyond and Spirit Session introduces some new bookkeeping to the Bard, which was already a complex class to begin with. I don&#8217;t recommend this for new players or players who already find spellcasters to be a challenge, but veteran players comfortable with managing their character&#8217;s resources won&#8217;t find College of Spirits any more complex than playing a wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, while there&#8217;s a lot to like about College of Spirits, its unpredictability makes it difficult to use to great effect, and Spiritual Focus (which is intended to make your core spellcasting effective enough to carry you when Tales From Beyond isn&#8217;t helping) is almost non-functional due to the Bard&#8217;s limited spell list and 5e&#8217;s rules on when you actually use a spellcasting focus. This appears to be due to the feature assuming that the bonus would apply more broadly, but the RAW rules for how focuses are used limit the spell&#8217;s benefits to a vanishingly small number of bard spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">College of Spirits Bard Features<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#spirit-session-spell-options\">Spirit Session Spell Options<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#1stlevel-spells\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#2ndlevel-spells\">2nd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#3rdlevel-spells\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#4thlevel-spells\">4th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#5thlevel-spells\">5th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#6thlevel-spells\">6th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-spirits-bard-ability-scores\">College of Spirits Bard Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-spirits-bard-races\">College of Spirits Bard Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-spirits-bard-feats\">College of Spirits Bard Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-spirits-bard-weapons\">College of Spirits Bard Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-spirits-bard-armor\">College of Spirits Bard Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-minor-scales-are-creepy\">Example Build &#8211; Minor Scales are Creepy<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

With this, you can help your allies\n\t\tfrom a safe distance, such as by shouting encouragement to a rogue while\n\t\tthey disarm traps or sneak behind your enemies. Verbal components need to be\n\t\tspoken clearly and aloud, so &#8220;whispers&#8221; may be a misnomer, but we don&#8217;t have\n\t\tan official ruling on just how loud verbal components need to be (Jeremy\n\t\tCrawford says\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/651514845834014720\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it&#8217;s up to the DM<\/a>), so maybe whispering is fine.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Spiritual Focus<\/span>: At this level you get the\n\t\tability to use some extra objects as spellcasting foci. This notably\n\t\tincludes crystal balls and skulls, neither of which are options for wizards,\n\t\tso you can rub it in the faces of any diviners or necromancers you come\n\t\tacross. Mechanically it has almost no effect, though you may accomplish some\n\t\tshenanigans by using the skulls of tiny creatures like mice so that you can\n\t\thide your focus easily.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tales from Beyond<\/span>: College of Spirits&#8217;\n\t\tsignature feature. This is really fun, but it&#8217;s unpredictable, and\n\t\tunpredictability in class features makes me nervous. You generally don&#8217;t\n\t\twant to use this in combat because you could spend your Bonus Action to draw\n\t\tsomething that&#8217;s not helpful. Instead, you&#8217;re more likely to use this after\n\t\ta Short Rest and hang onto your Tale until you can use it or it expires.\n\t\t<p>Since this costs an inspiration die and expires when you take a Short or\n\t\t\tLong Rest, it&#8217;s costly at levels 3 and 4, but it gets much much more\n\t\t\tmanageable at level 5 when you pick up Font of Inspiration. Even then,\n\t\t\tsome of the effects may not be worth the inspiration die to get them.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Because you roll a Bardic Inspiration die to get your tale, your options\n\t\t\tare limited by the size of your die. The higher-numbered options are\n\t\t\tgenerally better, so there&#8217;s new stuff to look forward to as you gain\n\t\t\tlevels. Of course, this also means that you&#8217;re less likely to roll your\n\t\t\tfavorites as your die size grows, but, fortunately, Mystical Connection will\n\t\t\tprovide some help once you hit level 14.<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clever Animal<\/span>: Situational. You&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tmost likely to use this in social situations, but it might also be\n\t\t\t\tuseful for Dispel Magic and Counterspell. If you can get this running\n\t\t\t\tbefore a social situation, the benefits are absolutely massive.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Renowned Duelist<\/span>: Decent\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target damage, but it&#8217;s not much better than just casting a\n\t\t\t\tcantrip, especially once you add the damage bonus from Spiritual Focus\n\t\t\t\tat level 6. Weirdly, this works at range but still calls for a melee\n\t\t\t\tspell attack. That usually doesn&#8217;t matter, but sometimes there are\n\t\t\t\tthings which affect melee and ranged attacks differently, like Tale of\n\t\t\t\tthe Avenger.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beloved Friends<\/span>: Nearly always useful.\n\t\t\t\tThe temporary hit points don&#8217;t have a specified expiration time, so they\n\t\t\t\tlast until you rest. If you roll this, use it early when it&#8217;s easy to hit\n\t\t\t\ttwo targets and consider getting another Tale.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Runaway<\/span>: Reposition your entire party.\n\t\t\t\tEscape grapples, bindings, and dangerous positions. You do need to be\n\t\t\t\table to see the destination, but that&#8217;s still enough to solve a lot of\n\t\t\t\tproblems.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Avenger<\/span>: Throw this on your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tDefender. It only works for melee attacks, unfortunately, but the damage\n\t\t\t\tfrom this can add up very quickly.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Traveler<\/span>: Trade the second target\n\t\t\t\tfrom Beloved Friends for a +1 AC bonus and some extra speed. Given the\n\t\t\t\tchoice between the two and no other information I would likely take\n\t\t\t\tBeloved Friends, but in situations where enemies are making large\n\t\t\t\tnumbers of attacks a +1 AC bonus can make a big difference.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beguiler<\/span>: Rob a single target of the\n\t\t\t\timportant parts of their turn. I&#8217;d be excited about this even if it didn&#8217;t deal damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phantom<\/span>: Being invisible will \n\t\t\t\tgive your target Advantage on their attack, which is always welcome, and\n\t\t\t\tmay allow them to avoid things like Opportunity Attacks. Your best bet\n\t\t\t\tis to put this on a rogue, but even if your party doesn&#8217;t include a\n\t\t\t\trogue, the extra damage and Advantage are welcome for any character who\n\t\t\t\trelies on attacks. Making the target of the attack Frightened without a\n\t\t\t\tsave is great, too.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brute<\/span>: Turn an ally into the center\n\t\t\t\tof a fireball. The AOE is big, the damage type is good, and your target\n\t\t\t\tcan pick which creatures take damage. This can&#8217;t match the spell\n\t\t\t\tFireball, but three Bardic Inspiration dice is still a decent pile of\n\t\t\t\tdamage for the cost to get this. If you have melee allies acting soon\n\t\t\t\tafter you in initiative, knocking foes Prone will also provide Advantage\n\t\t\t\ton their attacks.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dragon<\/span>: The damage is slightly\n\t\t\t\thigher than Tale of the Brute, but the AOE is much smaller, doesn&#8217;t omit\n\t\t\t\tyour allies, doesn&#8217;t provide a status condition, and does a much worse\n\t\t\t\tdamage type.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Angel<\/span>: Lesser Restoration plus a bit\n\t\t\t\tof healing. Not always required, but always handy.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mind-Bender<\/span>: Literally just Beguiler\n\t\t\t\tbut better (unless the target is immune to being Stunned).<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Session<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\tMagical Secrets, but considerably more complicated and with some additional\n\t\tlimitations in exchange for the ability to change the spell daily. Because\n\t\tthis only teaches you the spell temporarily, it&#8217;s great for odd, situational\n\t\tspells that you typically can&#8217;t justify learning permanently. However, the\n\t\tlimitation to divination and necromancy spells does narrow your options\n\t\tconsiderably.\n\t\t<p>If you want to simplify this, you can just do the ritual after a Long Rest\n\t\t\tto learn the same spell every day (Revivify and Summon Undead are good\n\t\t\texamples), but at that point just play College of Lore. This is great for\n\t\t\tthings like Lesser Restoration or Raise Dead, but don&#8217;t forget that the\n\t\t\tspell level is capped at your Proficiency Bonus.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You&#8217;re required to include some &#8220;willing creatures&#8221; in the Spirit\n\t\t\tSession, but there&#8217;s no restriction on what those creatures are, what else\n\t\t\tthey&#8217;re doing, their positions, etc. so it&#8217;s entirely possible that having\n\t\t\t5 tamed birds in a cage nearby (or a bag of rats) will suffice. I think\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re intended to use your party members, but if the requirement is just\n\t\t\tfriendly humanoids you could easily find some commoners to hang out with\n\t\t\tyou for an hour.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Spiritual Focus<\/span>: The actually impactful\n\t\tpart of Spiritual Focus comes online at 6th level. Bards don&#8217;t have as many\n\t\toptions for spells which restore hit points or deal direct damage as classes\n\t\tlike the Cleric and the Wizard, which is a huge problem for College of\n\t\tSpirits. The d6 is added to one damage\/healing roll of a spell, so AOE\n\t\tspells (Shatter) and some multi-target spells are great ways to capitalize\n\t\ton the extra effect, but again, the Bard&#8217;s options here are pitifully small.\n\t\tThis works with cantrips in theory, but there are none that qualify.\n\t\t<p>The problem is easy to overlook (I did it on my initial read): Spiritual\n\t\t\tFocus&#8217;s bonus only works for spells which are cast through the focus,\n\t\t\twhich means that it only applies to spells with inexpensive material\n\t\t\tcomponents that aren&#8217;t consumed by the spell. RAW you can&#8217;t choose to use\n\t\t\ta focus when it&#8217;s not needed, so for most spells Spiritual Focus simply\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t apply (see the\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/articles\/sage-advice\/rules-spellcasting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sage Advice on Spellcasting Rules<\/a>). Spells like Shatter work, but spells like Cure Wounds and Healing Word\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t since they don&#8217;t have inexpensive material components and therefore\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t be cast through a focus.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The rules around spellcasting foci are a mess, so discuss how your DM\n\t\t\twants to handle this. RAI I think you&#8217;re intended to be able to use this\n\t\t\tbonus whenever you cast a spell with your focus in hand, but RAW the\n\t\t\tlimitations make this difficult to use. With the RAW restrictions, there\n\t\t\tare no bard cantrips which qualify, the only healing spell on the Bard&#8217;s\n\t\t\tspell list that qualifies is Regenerate, and just five damage spells on\n\t\t\tthe Bard&#8217;s spell list qualify, and the only one that synergizes well with\n\t\t\tthe damage bonus is Shatter. You can fix this somewhat with Magical\n\t\t\tSecrets at high levels by picking up something like Fireball, but that&#8217;s\n\t\t\ttoo little, too late.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mystical Connection<\/span>: By this level you&#8217;re\n\t\trolling a d10 for inspiration, and you get d12 at level 15, so Tales From\n\t\tBeyond is totally unpredictable. Mystic Connection does a lot to address\n\t\tthat, but keeps enough unpredictability to keep Tales From Beyond \n\t\tfun and surprising.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spirit-session-spell-options\">Spirit Session Spell Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Spirit Session is a great way to get short-term access to spells which are only situationally useful, but it&#8217;s also a great way to get access to some powerful staples from other classes&#8217; spell lists.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1stlevel-spells\">1st-Level Spells<\/h4>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Beast Bond<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: For rangers with animal companions.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cause Fear<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Great crowd control, and it scales well with spell level.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Comprehend Languages<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Helpful, but upgrade to Tongues as soon as possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Evil and Good<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHN<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Helpful if you&#8217;re worried about being surprised by extraplanar creatures,\n\t\tbut you won&#8217;t need it consistently enough to take it ahead of time.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Magic<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: You really want this available as a ritual within the party if you can\n\t\tget it, but sometimes you don&#8217;t get a choice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Poison and Disease<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Very rarely useful, and even when it is useful most players rarely think\n\t\tto use this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">False Life<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: A welcome buff on any character, and the spell level scaling is\n\t\tdecent.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Gift of Alacrity<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EGtW<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: If your DM allows Wildemount spells in your game (Chronurgy\/Graviturgy\n\t\taren&#8217;t available to most spellcasters by default), this is a decent buff.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s especially useful for characters who depend on acting early in\n\t\tinitiative like bugbears, assassins, and bugbear assassins.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Hunter&#8217;s Mark<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Only impactful for serious weapon users, and that&#8217;s not you.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Identify<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Only useful when you encounter new magic items.

We&#8217;ll learn Arcana, Religion, Abyssal, and Deep Speech.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll take Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion from our class. We get Arcana and Religion from our background.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At 4 we&#8217;ll take Dragon Fear. That gets us a +1 Charisma increase and turns our breath weapon into a crowd control option that matches our spellcasting DC since it&#8217;s Charisma-based. It&#8217;s like Cause Fear in a lot of ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 8 we&#8217;ll take Telekinetic. It gets us +1 Charisma, and with less need to reserve our Bonus Action for Bardic Inspiration it&#8217;s easy to fit Telekinetic Shove into our tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 12 we&#8217;ll take Fey Touched. Misty Step works great alongside Tales from Beyond because Tales isn&#8217;t a spell. We also get +1 Charisma, and we&#8217;ll learn Heroism with the 1st-level spell choice to synergize with Tales from Beyond (Avenger).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have free space at 16 and 19.

Bane is a great way to bait Legendary Resistances (Do I take -1d4 and be useless? Or do I waste a Legendary Resistance on a 1st-level spell?). Hideous Laughter is almost Hold Monster. Sleep wins encounters at very low levels, then we can retrain it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Jack of All Trades<br>Song of Rest (d6)<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Dissonant Whispers<\/td><td>Use Dissonant Whispers whenever an enemy is in melee with an ally who would enjoy making an Opportunity Attack.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Bard College: College of Spirits<br>Guiding Whispers<br>Spiritual Focus<br>Tales from Beyond<br>Expertise<br>&#8211; Intimidation<br>&#8211; Persuasion<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Shatter<\/td><td>Guiding Whispers gives us Guidance for free with extended range. Spiritual Focus adds some extra power to our damage and healing spells. It doesn&#8217;t suddenly make the bard a blaster, but it&#8217;s still pretty nice.<br><br>Tales from Beyond is an additional resource in addition to our spellcasting. Since it uses our Action to use the Tale, it competes with space in our action economy, but conveniently doesn&#8217;t interfere with Bonus Action spells.<br><br>Shatter is our only decent area damage for a long time.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Dragon Fear (Charisma 17 -&gt; 18)<br>Cantrips<br>&#8211; Mage Hand<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Phantasmal Force<\/td><td>We were never going to use our breath weapon for damage, but it sure makes for good crowd control. When you&#8217;re facing a large number of enemies, jump into the middle and scream.<br><br>Phantasmal Force can shut down single targets very easily, provided that your DM plays along.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Bardic Inspiration (1d8)<br>Font of Inspiration<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Enemies Abound<\/td><td>Font of Inspiration is absolutely crucial both for normal purposes and for Tales from Beyond. Now we can start the day by drawing for Tales from Beyond until we get something that you like, then immediately take a Short Rest to recharge Bardic Inspiration.<br><br>Our inspiration die also improves to 1d8, opening up the Beguiler and Phantom options.<br><br>In encounters with multiple enemies, hit the biggest one with Enemies Abound. Almost nothing has good Intelligence Saves.<br><br>We also get Gem Flight at this level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Countercharm<br>Spirit Session<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Hypnotic Pattern<\/td><td>Spirit Session is immediately awesome. Our Proficiency Bonus is +3 at this level, so we can choose from spells up to 3rd level. Summon Undead is our go-to spell on any day where we expect a fight.<br><br>The only problem is that it competes with our other Concentration spells, so you may need to rely on cantrips and spells like Shatter when you have a summoned undead. We can also think of it as a backup option for when our save-or-suck options are unlikely to work. Our options up to this point target mental saves almost exclusively, so, against enemies with good mental saves, it might make sense to summon an undead and just hit them.<br><br>Spiritual Focus also improves at this level, adding the extra 1d6 damage\/healing on our bard spells. Use it with stuff like Healing Word and Shatter. It even makes the damage from Vicious Mockery decent.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Phantasmal Killer<\/td><td>For spells, we choose a spooky single-target damage option. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Telekinetic (Cha 18 -&gt; 19)<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Raulothim&#8217;s Psychic Lance<\/td><td>We&#8217;re delaying 20 Charisma for some hybrid feats. Telekinetic gives us a good use for our Bonus Action.<br><br>Psychic Lance is for incapacitating our target. Against big single foes with poor Intelligence saves, you can hit them with this every round and essentially negate an entire encounter, though the spell slot cost to do so is steep.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Song of Rest (d8)<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Hold Monster<\/td><td>Our proficiency bonus increases to +4, giving us access to 4th-level spells via Spirit Session. If you&#8217;re not getting much use out of Summon Undead, Arcane Eye might be helpful utility, or you can keep Spirit Session in reserve until you decide that you need something.<br><br>Hold Monster is a staple save-or-suck spell. It does compete for space with Phantasmal Killer (single-target Wisdom save), but don&#8217;t let that stop you, especially since you can upcast Hold Person for more targets.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Bardic Inspiration (1d10)<br>Expertise<br>&#8211; Any 2<br>Magical Secrets<br>Cantrips<br>&#8211; Any 1<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Mind Sliver<br>&#8211; Synaptic Static<\/td><td>Our inspiration die improves to 1d10, opening up the Brute and Dragon options. We pick up two new Expertise options and an extra bard cantrip.<br><br>For spells, we choose Synaptic Static for area damage without Concentration, and Mind Sliver for the -1d4 to saves. Since they&#8217;re bard spells for us we also add the bonus damage from Spiritual Focus. <br><br>Mind Sliver&#8217;s ability to debuff saves cantrip is very useful for spells with ongoing effects like Phantasmal Killer, Hold Person, and Psychic Scream.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Eyebite<\/td><td>Even the name is terrifying.
