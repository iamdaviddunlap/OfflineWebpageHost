You\u2019ve probably already looked at the Assassinate feature and want to capitalize on those guaranteed Critical Hits, but guaranteed is not the same as free. You\u2019ll have to work with your party to <em>Surprise<\/em> your foes in order to earn those Critical Hits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><em>Surprised<\/em> is a simple condition that is much harder to achieve than you might think. If your <em>whole party<\/em>\u2019s Stealth checks beat the Passive Perception of a foe, that foe is Surprised. Yes, even that Paladin waddling around in plate armor. If a foe detects even one of your allies, that foe is not <em>Surprised<\/em>. That\u2019s the official definition for how Surprise works in Dungeons and Dragons 5e. We went into extreme detail on this in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/stealth-and-invisibility-rpgbot-podcast-s2e43\/\">Stealth episode<\/a> which also proposes some fixes if you want too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Things get murky when we consider why the Assassin also has a pair of features designed around Deception and Infiltration. The rules of Surprise only mention Stealth and Perception, but we could (and do) argue that Deception versus Insight should also be a valid method of imposing <em>Surprised<\/em> on a target. That stompy Paladin from earlier certainly has enough Charisma to lie through their teeth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Assassin Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#assassin-ability-scores\">Assassin Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#assassin-races\">Assassin Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#assassin-feats\">Assassin Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#assassin-weapons\">Assassin Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#assassin-armor\">Assassin Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#assassin-multiclassing\">Assassin Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#assassin-party-support\">Assassin Party Support<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-assassin-build-the-killer-rabbit-of-caerbannog\">Example Assassin Build &#8211; The Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Maximize your Dexterity\n\t\tas soon as possible, and consider the Alert feat. If magic items are\n\t\tavailable to you, try to get a Weapon of Warning.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Free Advantage is well and good, but what about those automatic Critical\n\t\t\thits? For those we\u2019ll need to work harder. Surprised can be thought of as\n\t\t\ta Condition and it\u2019s not easy to impose on a foe. By the rules, to\n\t\t\tSurprise a target your whole side has to succeed at Stealth checks versus\n\t\t\ta foe\u2019s Passive Perception. Each foe may or may not be Surprised on an\n\t\t\tindividual basis, but essentially your whole party has to win at\n\t\t\tStealth.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This might sound tough, but the Surprised condition is rather\n\t\t\tdebilitating even without this feature, and will benefit your whole party\n\t\t\timmensely. I don\u2019t suggest you try to force your party into a Stealth\n\t\t\tsetup, but rather see if they want the tactical advantages and are willing\n\t\t\tto try it out. Anyone that can cast Pass Without Trace will do wonders to\n\t\t\tamplify such a party, of course, but even simply having everyone get\n\t\t\tStealth proficiency is helpful.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infiltration Expertise<\/span>: Rules as\n\t\tWritten, Surprised is Stealth versus Perception, but Surprised is also up to\n\t\tthe DM. If you\u2019re playing an Assassin (or if you have an Assassin player in\n\t\tyour game), I would suggest that Deception versus Insight is equally valid\n\t\tfor imposing Surprise. You\u2019re not a band of murder hobos, you\u2019re a humble\n\t\tmerchant and this is your staff. And then you Surprise them with murder.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Obviously this is only useful if your campaign has situations where lying\n\t\t\tlike this will be helpful. Many campaigns just don\u2019t have situations where\n\t\t\tyou can be an operative on the inside.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Impostor<\/span>: Infiltration Expertise is for\n\t\tmaking up a whole new person, but this is for taking over as an existing\n\t\tperson. It should be useful about as often as Infiltration Expertise, which\n\t\tis to say that it very heavily depends on the campaign.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Death Strike<\/span>: If Surprised is so hard to\n\t\tpull off, why is this rated so highly? Well, if you\u2019re playing such a high\n\t\tlevel Assassin, I would assume your whole party has bought into the Surprise\n\t\tattack way of doing things. With even a small amount of magical support,\n\t\tSurprise is far easier to achieve.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"assassin-ability-scores\">Assassin Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Assassin\u2019s primary scores will follow the scores in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#ability-scores\">Rogue Handbook<\/a>, but our features do steer us towards Face skills as a secondary concern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: It\u2019s always technically an option to use Strength as a Rogue, but typically impractical.

First, the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/trickery-domain\/\">Trickery Cleric<\/a>, who could almost compensate for anything else by virtue of Pass Without Trace (as could any Druid or Ranger). <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/path-of-the-beast\/\">Beast Barbarian<\/a> because in round two onwards we need somebody next to the targets for Sneak Attacks. And <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/genie\/\">Genie Warlock<\/a> because Sanctuary Vessel is another way to cheese some Stealth and Surprise. We\u2019ll re-run the calculation here at level 8. Still DC 14.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Assassin: This time, with our party fully on board and committed to Surprise tactics, the Trickery Cleric is running Pass Without Trace so our bonus is now +20.

At eleventh level something special happens: previously our lowest possible initiative was a 15 by rolling a natural 1, but once we have Reliable Talent our floor becomes 24. At this point, many monsters simply cannot beat our initiative check, so we will always have Advantage on the first round to open with a sneak attack without having to wait for an ally to get into position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice I haven&#8217;t mentioned <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-s2e27-initiative\/\">Surprise<\/a> at all yet. Reliably surprising your foes requires the whole party\u2019s involvement and commitment to getting the drop. If your party wants to do this occasionally, that\u2019s great. We\u2019ll mostly assume getting Surprise is a bonus some of the time and focus on the free Advantage we can control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We start with point buy and put 15s in Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma. Then we choose to add +1s to each of those for 16s in everything we care about. Truth be told, you could just ignore the face skills if you wanted to have a different set such as picking Wisdom for Perception and Insight boosts. We\u2019re not doing that here, but it\u2019s an option. Just because you have features for disguising and deceiving doesn\u2019t mean you have to use them if they don\u2019t fit your campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Level 20<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re picking Harengon as mentioned above. Primarily so we can almost guarantee going first in fights. Getting Perception and Rabbit Hop are just bonuses on top of Hare-Trigger. Rabbit Hop might seem redundant with Cunning Action, except it\u2019s like combining Dash and Disengage. When you only need one of those, use Cunning Action, but if you really need to do both in one turn, spend a Rabbit Hop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We take the Faceless background for Deception and Intimidation.

Yes it\u2019s an odd choice, but Rogues gain Wisdom Proficiency at 15th level and just for fun and to lean into being the killer rabbit that nobody can seem to scratch in that scene, why not be proficient in the big three saves?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At 19th level, you might pick Skill Expert so that you can add +1 to Constitution and round that number to 18 while getting a skill and an expertise. You might also pick up Aberrant Dragonmark for the same Con boost, but with weird spellcasting based on Constitution. I\u2019m choosing Durable because we\u2019re already encouraging the team to take more Short Rests with Inspiring Leader and that gets us a floor on our Hit Die rolls. It also plays into the killer rabbit bit more so it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s objectively bad when I\u2019ve already told you the better options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Sneak Attack<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>Sneak Attack<br><br>Thieves&#8217; Cant<br><br>Skills (+ Expertise)<br>-Acrobatics<br>+Deception<br>-Insight<br>-Intimidation<br>-Persuasion<br>+Stealth<br><br>Tools<br>-Thieves\u2019 Tools<br>-Flute<\/td><td>We start like most Rogues.
