One proficiency is not a driving reason to\n\t\tget good with tools, but it can add some non-combat utility to a class which\n\t\tis all about fighting. You also learn to speak Giant, which is weirdly nice\n\t\tbecause runes can give you Advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma\n\t\t(Intimidation) checks, allowing you to serve as a Face without much\n\t\tinvestment in Charisma.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rune Carver<\/span>: 2 runes at 3rd level, and\n\t\teventually you get up to 5. Since there are just 6 runes, that means that\n\t\trather than choosing which runes to learn you get to choose one to ignore\n\t\t(Frost. Skip Frost. ). There are two runes with level requirements, but\n\t\tthanks to the built-in retraining rule you can drop a different rune when\n\t\tyou hit level 7 to get both of the level-locked runes at the same time, then\n\t\tpick up whichever rune you dropped the next time you learn a new rune.\n\t\t<p>Each rune provides a passive effect and an activatable ability. The active\n\t\t\teffect can be used once per Short or Long Rest (that&#8217;s not a rule inherent\n\t\t\tto Rune Carver, but every rune works that way). Saves are\n\t\t\tConstitution-based, which is exciting because it makes it easy to justify\n\t\t\t20 Dex or Strength and 20 Constitution, which many fighter subclasses need\n\t\t\tto postpone or forgo due to their subclass&#8217;s dependence on a mental\n\t\t\tability score or a severe need for feats.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Every rune is tied to a type of giant, so don&#8217;t expect this list to\n\t\t\texpand unless WotC brings back the weird extra giants that they introduced\n\t\t\tlate in 3.5 like Death Giants. Although a high-level Death Rune would\n\t\t\tprobably be really cool. Well shoot, now I want that.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloud Rune<\/span>: Sleight of Hand and\n\t\t\t\tDeception are a weird combination of skills for your typical fighter\n\t\t\t\tsince Charisma is frequently a dump stat and even Dexterity-based\n\t\t\t\tfighters rarely take Sleight of Hand, so don&#8217;t expect to get much use\n\t\t\t\tout of those unless you&#8217;re building yourself with skills similar to a\n\t\t\t\ttypical rogue.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect allows you to retarget a successful attack to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother creature within 30 feet of you. The expectation is that you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\tgoing to redirect and enemy&#8217;s attack to hit an enemy, and that&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tprobably your best bet, but you can also use this to attack an ally\n\t\t\t\t\tand redirect the attack to an enemy which might be out of your reach\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise. Keep in mind that transferring the attack doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tautomatically hit the new target; the attack roll must still be\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared to the new target&#8217;s AC as normal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The difficulty with Cloud Rune is that it competes for space with Runic\n\t\t\t\t\tShield, which you get automatically.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire Rune<\/span>: Expertise in every tool in\n\t\t\t\twhich you&#8217;re proficient. The Rune Knight gets Smith&#8217;s Tools at level 3,\n\t\t\t\tbut you should strongly consider getting other tools, especially crucial\n\t\t\t\tadventuring options like Thieves&#8217; Tools.\n\t\t\t\t<p>While most martial enemies will be big, Strength-based monsters with\n\t\t\t\t\thigh Strength saves, there are many other types of enemies with bad\n\t\t\t\t\tStrength saves. Spellcasters, nimble enemies, and most small enemies\n\t\t\t\t\twill have poor Strength save bonuses. If you manage to keep the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\trestrained, they&#8217;ll take an impressive 20d6 damage, which is pretty\n\t\t\t\t\tgood even by the standards of many spells.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>But while that damage is exciting, the bigger benefit is that the\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget is Restrained. Restrained creatures have 0 speed, suffer\n\t\t\t\t\tDisadvantage on their attacks, grant Advantage on attacks against\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, and suffer Disadvantage on Dexterity saves. That makes the\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget bait for every attack that your party can put out. Throw this\n\t\t\t\t\ton the highest-priority enemy in an encounter and focus on them until\n\t\t\t\t\tthey drop. Consider using Action Surge the same turn in order to\n\t\t\t\t\tmaximize how much damage you can do before the target potentially\n\t\t\t\t\tescapes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frost Rune<\/span>: Animal Handling is very\n\t\t\t\tsituational, but Intimidation is a popular face skill for fighters and\n\t\t\t\tother martial classes despite usually lacking Charisma.\n\t\t\t\t<p>+2 to saves is nice, but Strength saves are extremely rare and +2 to\n\t\t\t\t\tConstitution saves for 10 minutes one to three times a day (remember:\n\t\t\t\t\tAdventuring Day rules encourage two short rests) isn&#8217;t worth a Rune.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you need better Constitution saves, put an ASI into Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bonus also applies to Strength checks, including important checks\n\t\t\t\t\tlike Athletics checks to Grapple or Shove. But remember that Giant&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tMight gives you Advantage on both Strength Checks and Strength Saves,\n\t\t\t\t\tand since both Giant&#8217;s Might and Frost Rune are activated as a Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\tAction, it&#8217;s hard to fit both into the same fight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re really concerned enough about Athletics that you still want\n\t\t\t\t\tFrost Rune, consider the Skill Expert feat. The additional bonus will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe larger than that provided by Frost Rune and it will apply\n\t\t\t\t\tconstantly without the need to activate Frost Rune. If, somehow, you\n\t\t\t\t\thave Expertise in Athletics, high enough Strength that using Athletics\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes sense, and Giant&#8217;s Might to get easy Advantage on Strength\n\t\t\t\t\tchecks, but you still somehow can&#8217;t reliably succeed at Strength\n\t\t\t\t\t(Athletics) checks, it seems likely that an occasional +2 is not going\n\t\t\t\t\tto solve whatever problem you&#8217;re facing. Consider new dice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Rune<\/span>: Spectacular passive\n\t\t\t\teffects. When you&#8217;re building out your initial Ability Scores, you will\n\t\t\t\ttypically max out your Strength or your Dexterity (depending on your\n\t\t\t\tbuild), then ideally you&#8217;ll raise your Constitution as much as makes\n\t\t\t\tsense. After that, Wisdom is a great third-highest ability score both\n\t\t\t\tfor skills and for saving throws. After that, Insight isn&#8217;t much of a\n\t\t\t\tstretch. Perpetual Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) means a +5 bonus to\n\t\t\t\tyour Passive Insight, which is a boon for your whole party. You also get\n\t\t\t\t120 ft. Darkvision, which is great for races like the Dragonborn and the\n\t\t\t\tHuman which don&#8217;t get it naturally. Even races with Darkvision tend to only have 60 ft range.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect is a Wisdom-based save-or-suck charm effect used as\n\t\t\t\t\ta Reaction. It&#8217;s not quite as good as Hold Monster, but it&#8217;s close,\n\t\t\t\t\tand like Hold Monster the target can repeat their save at the end of\n\t\t\t\t\teach of their turns. If you pair this with Fire Rune, you have one\n\t\t\t\t\tpowerful single-target crowd control effect which can affect big dumb\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies (Stone Rune) and one for smart, frail enemies (Fire Rune).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hill Rune<\/span> (7th level): Poison is\n\t\t\t\tcommon across the full level range, and resistance to it is excellent.\n\t\t\t\tMany races like dwarves already have this, so this rune does lose some of its appeal for\n\t\t\t\tthem, but the active effect is still very good.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect is a powerful defensive buff that you should\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely employ when facing the prospect of significant weapon\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage. It&#8217;s one of those abilities where you&#8217;ll always wonder if you\n\t\t\t\t\tmight need it more later, but if a fight looks like any significant\n\t\t\t\t\tthreat and your enemies are relying on weapon damage types, use this\n\t\t\t\t\tas soon as attacks come your way. Resistance to weapon damage also\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes it easier to justify using two-handed weapons since your AC is\n\t\t\t\t\tless important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Storm Rune<\/span> (7th level): Arcana isn&#8217;t a\n\t\t\t\tskill that you&#8217;ll be good at (you likely dumped Intelligence since you\n\t\t\t\thave no other usage for it built into the class), but never being\n\t\t\t\tsurprised is great on any character.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect turns your Reaction into a reroll on any d20 roll\n\t\t\t\t\twhich happens within 60 feet of you. You do need to use the Reaction\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the roll happens, but that&#8217;s probably fine. Use this to support\n\t\t\t\t\tsave-or-suck effects (yours or someone else&#8217;s), to protect your allies\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom save-or-suck effects, and potentially to grant Advantage on\n\t\t\t\t\thigh-damage attacks from you or your allies. Keep in mind you can take\n\t\t\t\t\treactions on your own turn and consider imposing Disadvantage on a\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget\u2019s save or check, such as the save against Fire Rune&#8217;s active\n\t\t\t\t\teffect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Giant&#8217;s Might<\/span>: Similar to casting\n\t\tEnlarge\/Reduce as a Bonus Action, though the damage bonus isn&#8217;t as good.\n\t\tBeing large makes it harder for enemies to get around you since you take up\n\t\tmore space, and Advantage on Strength checks makes it very easy to use\n\t\tAthletics to Shove and Grapple your enemies.\n\t\t<p>The bonus damage only applies once per turn on your own turn, which\n\t\t\tconsidering the Fighter&#8217;s famously high number of attacks feels totally\n\t\t\tout of place and unremarkable. Weirdly, the d6 grows to a d10 over time\n\t\t\tbut never becomes a significant part of your damage output since it&#8217;s\n\t\t\tstill just once on each of your own turns.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The precise wording in the feature is important. If you are not Large or larger, your size becomes Large. This is important because Enlarge\/Reduce cast upon the Rune Knight <em>after<\/em> using Giant\u2019s Might further increases the knight to Huge size, but not if Enlarge\/Reduce is cast beforehand.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Runic Shield<\/span>: This is a great way to\n\t\tnegate critical hits. You force the attacker to reroll the specific d20 used\n\t\tand use that result, so even if they have Advantage they still just roll one\n\t\td20 and use whatever comes up. The number of uses per day is plenty if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t try to negate every hit that comes toward your party; save it for\n\t\tcritical hits or for allies who have a passable chance of a reroll missing.\n\t\tIf an enemy is attacking your 12 AC wizard with a +10 attack bonus, don&#8217;t\n\t\twaste the effort.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Great Stature<\/span>: The 3d4 inches is amusing,\n\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re a small race, but it has absolutely no mechanical\n\t\teffect on the game. Height is a purely cosmetic portion of your character.\n\t\tUpgrading the damage die on Giant&#8217;s Might from 1d6 to 1d8 is such a minor\n\t\timprovement that if you forgot to make the adjustment you would probably\n\t\tnever notice. On average, that&#8217;s 1 point of damage per round. At level 10\n\t\twhen you and your enemies can easily have 200 hit points, 1 damage is not\n\t\tnoteworthy.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master of Runes<\/span>: Double how often you can\n\t\tuse all of your rune&#8217;s active effects. You also gain your fifth and final\n\t\trune at this level, so this is just a really fantastic level. With 10 active\n\t\teffects to use between short rests, you can afford to use two or more active\n\t\trune effects in each combat and you may find that you have runes to spare\n\t\twhen you make it to your next Short Rest.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Runic Juggernaut<\/span>: The extra damage is\n\t\tnot significant, especially at this level. But the ability to become Huge\n\t\tand get a little more reach can be helpful in some cases. Being Huge notably\nmeans that you can grapple gargantuan creatures, making you big enough to grapple any creature\nin the game.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rune-knight-ability-scores\">Rune Knight Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: We&#8217;re going to hit things like we mean\n\tit.

As mentioned above, this stacks on top of\n\tGiant&#8217;s Might.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fairy<\/span>: While it might seem unusual for a\n\tsmall race to be part of a grapple build, but Giant&#8217;s Might doesn&#8217;t care what\n\tsize we started as and Fairy gives us access to Enlarge\/Reduce.

Moving your grapple check to\n\t\tthe bonus action means that you could, once you have just one extra attack\n\t\tat fifth level, Shove-&gt;Kick-&gt;Grapple all on a single turn. With the\n\t\treworks to natural weapons in Monsters of the Multiverse, those weapons all\n\t\tcount as unarmed attacks, further improving this for those races.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Aberrant Dragonmark<\/span>: This here is a\n\t\tsleeper feat that people don&#8217;t consider much since it&#8217;s setting specific,\n\t\tbut\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spellcasting-feats\/#aberrant-dragonmark\">it&#8217;s really good.<\/a>\n\t\tYou gain a sorcerer cantrip and 1st-level spell, which is kinda neat, but\n\t\tthe real kicker here is that they will use your Constitution, and we&#8217;re\n\t\talready pushing that up. The feat is also a hybrid feat granting +1\n\t\tConstitution. If you do take this, I suggest either a ranged cantrip for\n\t\tthings flying out of reach, or some kind of melee shenanigan to pull on\n\t\ttargets, such as Thunderclap.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient<\/span>: By the nature of our point buy\n\t\tspread, Wisdom or Dexterity ends up odd, and this is a fine way to increase\n\t\twhichever of the pair you left odd and patch up a hole in your saves.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Chef<\/span>: There&#8217;s a lot to love about this\n\t\tfeat.

How you flavour the snacks is up to you,\n\t\tand the benefits of additional temp hp you or allies can scarf down as a\n\t\tbonus action is fun. Also, it is a hybrid with +1 to Constitution or Wisdom,\n\t\tand as discussed above you might end up with an odd Wisdom score.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Healer<\/span>: So you&#8217;ve heard of the tank\n\t\tfallacy, that whole notion that enemies will just walk around you and stab\n\t\tyour squishy allies. Well, what if that was all a clever ruse? What if you\n\t\tcould just reach over with your giant hands and massive hit points to prop\n\t\tallies back up? What if I told you that you require no actions to maintain\n\t\tyour grapple so your job is still getting done while you prop up the cleric?\n\t\tSome would argue you could use a potion to do the same thing, however:\n\n\t\t<p>Healer allows us to simply prop up an ally for the cost of a single use\n\t\t\tof a healer&#8217;s kit.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>A Potion of Healing costs 50 gold, has one use, and restores 7 HP on\n\t\t\taverage.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>A healer&#8217;s kit costs 5 gold, has ten uses, and with this feat restores 1\n\t\t\tHP.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>When your ally is at 0, 1 HP and 7 HP will do the same thing.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Elven Accuracy<\/span>: Not for us because it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t work on Strength attacks, however we&#8217;re going to be in a good\n\t\tposition to generate Advantage by grapple shoving, so if you&#8217;re friends with\n\t\tan Elf of some sort, they might find it appealing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rune-knight-weapons\">Rune Knight Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unarmed Strikes and Natural Weapons<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\t\tGrappling requires a free hand\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">and some well written explanation.<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat this really means is if you&#8217;re some kind of fisticuffs ruffian or\n\t\t\t\t\tclawed beast-person, you always have two free hands for twice the\n\t\t\t\t\tgrappling.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spear<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/media.wizards.com\/2018\/dnd\/downloads\/PH-Errata.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Errata in 2018<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\tadded Spear to Polearm Master, giving us a one-hander with the bonus\n\t\t\t\t\tbonk.

I can do that?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>In the Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide, starting on the bottom of page 277 and continuing onto page 278, are rules for what happens when a weapon is larger than usual. When we grow larger, so too do our weapons. Following this logic, our weapons <em>should<\/em> increase in base damage whenever we activate Giant\u2019s Might, but there\u2019s a huge debate on whether that\u2019s actually true. I think it\u2019s true, Tyler thinks it wasn&#8217;t intended to work that way, you do what works for your table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the sake of fun, there are at least two ways to go about this. We can either just assume that our weapons just do additional base damage per step above medium (2d6 Medium Maul would do 4d6 when Large) when we transform, or if we want to have a hard delineation between Large weapons and magically Enlarged weapons we can just stuff an already Large Maul into a Bag of Holding to pull out when bigger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, this costs resources. We can only use Giant\u2019s Might PB times per Long Rest. If you as a DM have a Rune Knight and during play you think this is too strong and the RK is doing this in every fight all the time, maybe you\u2019re letting the party take a long rest too often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rune-knight-armor\">Rune Knight Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Full Plate<\/span>: We won&#8217;t really have the\n\t\tDexterity for Light Armour and it&#8217;s hard to be Stealthy when you&#8217;re bigger\n\t\tthan a house anyways.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rune-knight-multiclassing\">Rune Knight Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The main handbook is more or less already correct about dips into <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/#multiclassing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other classes<\/a>, but I want to call something out here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Barbarian Dipping 3 Fighter Levels for RK<\/span>:\n\t\tWhile we don&#8217;t benefit much from Barbarian abilities, a Barbarian could\n\t\tcertainly do fun things with getting Large.

Now when we claw as\n\tpart of an attack, we can grapple with our bonus action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eight, we start crushing skulls, or rather, we grab the Crusher feat which\n\tallows us to perform minor adjustments to where our grapple target is around\n\tus, while also adding +1 to Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When twelfth level comes around, we have a few options, but as we are the\n\tmountain, the solid foundation upon which our party is built, Resilient\n\t(Wisdom) will give us the edge we need against all sorts of dangerous effects.\n\tSpecifically, our Wisdom save goes from a +1 to a +6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fourteenth level we&#8217;re going to diversify our skillset a little bit.\n\tWe&#8217;re going to pick up the Healer feat.

This is great, and just\n\t\t\t\t\tgets better as we level and find new ways to use that action.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Subclass: Rune Knight<br>Bonus Proficiencies (Smith&#8217;s Tools, Giant\n\t\t\t\t\tLanguage)<br>Giant&#8217;s Might (1d6)<br>Rune Carver (2): Stone Rune,\n\t\t\t\t\tFire Rune<\/td><td>Now we can get bigger. Specifically we can become Large for one\n\t\t\t\t\tminute as a bonus action. We also gain Advantage to Strength checks\n\t\t\t\t\tand saves for the duration which include the checks to grapple and\n\t\t\t\t\tshove.<br><br>The bonus proficiencies are cool flavour, we speak\n\t\t\t\t\tGiant now.<br><br>The runes we gain access to are Fire and Stone.\n\t\t\t\t\tFire allows us to attempt to restrain a target after landing an attack\n\t\t\t\t\twith a Strength save for the target to resist. Stone gives us a\n\t\t\t\t\tReaction to attempt to charm a target into a dreamlike state when they\n\t\t\t\t\tend a turn within 30 feet of us. These are both great action economy\n\t\t\t\t\tvalues because one is a free rider on an attack and the other is our\n\t\t\t\t\tReaction.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Skill Expert:<br>&#8211; Expertise: Athletics<br>&#8211; Skill: Sleight of Hand<br>Strength 17 -&gt; 18<\/td><td>Now things are starting to really come together for us. Our Strength\n\t\t\t\t\tbecomes an 18, giving us a +4, and with Expertise in Athletics, our\n\t\t\t\t\tcheck for grappling has a +8 bonus. If we&#8217;re using Giant&#8217;s Might for\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvantage we&#8217;re likely to succeed in most of these attempts.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<\/td><td>100% More attacks per attack action. You could even grapple a target\n\t\t\t\t\tand shove them prone in one Action if that&#8217;s a thing you want.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Tavern Brawler: Strength 18 -&gt; 19<\/td><td>With extra attack from the previous level we can now perform a\n\t\t\t\t\tdevastating manoeuvre thanks to Tavern Brawler.<br><br>Assuming we\n\t\t\t\t\tdidn&#8217;t already use our Bonus Action on this turn for other abilities,\n\t\t\t\t\twe can now declare the Attack Action, replacing the first attack with\n\t\t\t\t\ta check to Shove. Assuming it succeeds we can follow up with an\n\t\t\t\t\tUnarmed Attack with Advantage. Thanks to Tavern Brawler we are then\n\t\t\t\t\table to follow that attack with an attempt to Grapple as our Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\tAction.<br><br>If everything goes right for us, our opponent is\n\t\t\t\t\tnow Prone and Grappled. This will give the target Disadvantage to\n\t\t\t\t\tattacks and prevent them from standing up unless they waste their\n\t\t\t\t\taction making an attempt to escape.<br><br>At this point we&#8217;ll be\n\t\t\t\t\trolling with a +10 for our Grapples and Shoves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Runic Shield<br>Rune Carver (3): Hill Rune<\/td><td>Other tanky peeling builds will be using Reactions for Opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\tAttacks such as the popular Polearm Master and Sentinel combo, but\n\t\t\t\t\twe&#8217;ve got other uses for ours.<br><br>At this level we gain access\n\t\t\t\t\tto Runic Shield. This is a forced reroll on an attack that hit within\n\t\t\t\t\t60ft of us. Sometimes an enemy thinks they can land a lucky crit on\n\t\t\t\t\tone of our friends, but we laugh and bet they can&#8217;t do it again.<br><br>We\n\t\t\t\t\talso gain Hill Rune at this level, another Bonus Action (we do have a\n\t\t\t\t\tlot of those to juggle), this one granting us a minute of resistance\n\t\t\t\t\tto B\/P\/S damage once per short rest.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Crusher: Strength 19 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>Crusher is very convenient to have. It gives us a little bit of fine\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrol over exactly which adjacent square our grappled target is in.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis adjustment is made in five foot increments, once per turn, by\n\t\t\t\t\tpunching them in the face. Also the +1 Strength puts us to the maximum\n\t\t\t\t\tof 20 Strength.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Indomitable<\/td><td>Nothing fancy here.

As a\n\t\t\t\t\tbonus action to activate, for a minute we can spend our Reaction to\n\t\t\t\t\tgrant Advantage or Disadvantage to attacks, saves, or checks we can\n\t\t\t\t\tsee.<br><br>While the combat uses are somewhat obvious, either\n\t\t\t\t\tgranting Advantage to an ally attack (maybe a Rogue trying to get some\n\t\t\t\t\tSneak Attack) or save, or Disadvantage to an enemy&#8217;s save or attack,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere&#8217;s some nuanced usage as well.<br><br>Suppose there&#8217;s a skill\n\t\t\t\t\tcheck our party needs to overcome, like picking a lock with Thieves&#8217;\n\t\t\t\t\tTools, we could activate the Rune and assist by granting Advantage on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe check if Help isn&#8217;t an option for some reason.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Extra Attack (2)<\/td><td>50% More attacks per attack action.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient: Wisdom 13 -&gt; 14<\/td><td>This right here is our way of ensuring the safety of our friends.

By taking this feat at this level, we&#8217;re pushing\n\t\t\t\t\tour bonus from a +1 to a +6 (remember that our Wisdom modifier\n\t\t\t\t\tincreases, thus the +5 total change).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Indomitable (2)<\/td><td>Oh neat, we can do that \u201creroll a failed save\u201d thing twice now each\n\t\t\t\t\tday.<br><br>And just like last time, our PB went up at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime.
