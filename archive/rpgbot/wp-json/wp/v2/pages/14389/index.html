Playing one is a careful balance of pushing out more damage without being too much of a burden on your party. Don\u2019t go bleeding your healing resources dry without reason because, make no mistake, you are no tank, just a heavy damage dealer that will not stop. So unleash your (un-)holy rage upon your foes and follow the Path of the Zealot in the name of [insert deity of choice here]!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While Zealots only have one feature for damage, Divine Fury, this feature scales well with Barbarian levels. Attacking twice with Reckless Attack, if we\u2019re following <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">fundamental math<\/a>, we will apply that damage 98.5% of the time, 87% with Great Weapon Master. Features like Fanatical Focus and Rage Beyond Death, instead of directly increasing damage, make it nigh impossible to halt a Zealot\u2019s rage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>By far the oddest feature of the Zealot is the Warrior of the Gods. The reward for devotion is to stay away from the gods as long as possible, freely called back to the life that one may never have to know the peaceful rest of death. Quite humorous, but also quite useful. If victory can be obtained through recklessness, then the price of victory may be as little as a 3rd-level spell slot, given an ally knows Revivify of course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Our example build, the Starbarian, doesn\u2019t do anything too fancy. The most radical departure from a typical barbarian is that we\u2019ve chosen Astral Elf as the race because the flavor is too good. Astral Elves are elves that went to space to get closer to their gods, so of course a Zealot Barbarian is a great fit. Aside from the fun racial choice, we\u2019ve got an approachable build that doesn\u2019t have to make broad strategic decisions in most combat encounters. Divine Fury just automatically works while Raging and Astral Elves\u2019 Starlight Step gives some fun tactical options in combat allowing for some really approachable hack and slash meat grinder fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Path of the Zealot Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-zealot-ability-scores\">Path of the Zealot Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-zealot-races\">Path of the Zealot Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-zealot-feats\">Path of the Zealot Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-zealot-weapons\">Path of the Zealot Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-zealot-armor\">Path of the Zealot Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-path-of-the-zealot-build-starbarian\">Example Path of the Zealot Build &#8211; Starbarian<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

You only get to use\n\t\tthis once one each of your turns (you can&#8217;t use it outside of your own\n\t\tturn), so if you&#8217;re using Reckless Attack you likely don&#8217;t need to scramble\n\t\tfor additional attack attempts to guarantee that you&#8217;ll deal this damage\n\t\treliably.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warrior of the Gods<\/span>: Generally dying is\n\t\tsomething that you work very hard to avoid, but if anyone&#8217;s going to die in\n\t\tcombat it&#8217;s a barbarian. Spells which raise the dead have expensive material\n\t\tcomponents, and this allows you to bypass them. So long as you&#8217;re friends\n\t\twith a sufficiently high-level cleric, you don&#8217;t need to worry about an\n\t\tuntimely death. The lowest-level option is Revivify, but even at high levels\n\t\tRevivify is going to be a better option than spending a higher-level spell\n\t\tslot on something like Raise Dead. Encourage your party members to get\n\t\tRevivify as soon as possible, and do whatever you need to do in order to\n\t\tmake them feel good about that choice. Consider buying them pizza or\n\t\tsomething.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fanatical Focus<\/span>: Excellent for\n\t\tsave-or-suck effects, and since it works once per rage you get to use it\n\t\tnumerous times in a single day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Zealous Presence<\/span>: Once per day, it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t affect you, and it only lasts for one round, but granting allies Advantage on all attacks for a round is still strong. It gets more useful the\n\t\tlarger your party is, so encourage your allies to summon creatures, use\n\t\tpets, etc. If they happen to also need to make saves, we can consider that a bonus as the main purpose of this ability is the Advantage on attack rolls.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rage beyond Death<\/span>: Drink a Potion of\n\t\tHealing right before your rage ends and you&#8217;re functionally unable to die\n\t\tdue to hit points loss while raging. You can&#8217;t go below 0 hit points, so as\n\t\tlong as you get above 0 (again, Potion of Healing) before your rage ends\n\t\tyou&#8217;re fine, so once you hit 0 hit points you no longer need to care about\n\t\ttaking damage. There are effects like Disintegrate and Power Word Kill which\n\t\tbecome very scary, but otherwise you&#8217;re fine.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"path-of-the-zealot-ability-scores\">Path of the Zealot Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Like most Barbarians, we want Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity, and don\u2019t care too much for the other stats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: We do damage.

The legend of an approachable Barbarian subclass that doesn\u2019t ask much of the player beyond doing all the normal Barbarian things like Rage. Some other Barbarians have to worry about positioning to help allies or using a bonus action to activate extra powers, but we forgo complexity for simple bonus damage once per turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We start with an atypical spread, with 15s in Strength and Constitution, but 14 in Dexterity, with leftover points in a 10 Wisdom to remove penalties for Perception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Level 20<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The extra points in Wisdom aren\u2019t necessary for anything special, so they can go into any of the mental scores of your choice.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have the option of taking a different route. If we instead put a 15 in Dexterity and leave Wisdom at an 8, we can put 3 +1s into our Physical stats. Taking this option, we would have to forgo the hybrid feat we planned for eighth level in favor of an ASI for +2 Strength, but in return our AC would be a point higher going forward and we could rely on Unarmored Defense from the start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re using Astral Elf as our race for flavor and because the bonus action teleport is nice. AElves get a choice out of three cantrips and we\u2019re taking Light because we can make use of the utility, Darkvision can\u2019t see color in the darkness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to play this race almost exactly the same but with different Elves, Shadar-Kai and Eladrin work just fine too. Harengon also have a bonus action movement option, but it&#8217;s not a teleport. Space elf sent by gods from space is just too fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re taking the Marine background. While it normally gives Athletics and Survival, we\u2019ll be picking those from the Barbarian list which allows us to choose any skills to replace the duplicates from our Background. This enables us to gain Insight and Religion, keeping on theme with a Warrior of the Gods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t use setting backgrounds in the example build but if you are able to, take the Wildspacer background from Spelljammer instead. The skills are identical, but the background grants the Tough feat.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Astral Elf grants Perception proficiency and a floating proficiency that can be changed every Long Rest. We\u2019ll just say Stealth for now. It\u2019s useful. From Barbarian, we take Athletics and Survival. From Marine (or Wildspacer) we take Insight and Religion.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we take the Great Weapon Master feat. With Reckless Attack, we can more reliably land the attack with the penalty. Alternatively, we could take Polearm Master and swing a glaive. Thanks to easy Advantage from Reckless Attack, the difference in DPR between the two options is rather small. We have several important things that need to use a bonus action, including activating Rage, so the real output actually depends on how often the PAM reaction is triggered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we take the Slasher feat, putting the +1 into Strength. Slowing down foes when we fight is very useful to spoil their positioning. If you\u2019re taking the alternate ability scores discussed above, this would instead be an ASI for +2 Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, we take an ASI for +2 Strength to reach 20. We catch back up with <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">the Fundamental Math<\/a> so we can do our best at doing damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we take an ASI for +2 Constitution. Because Unarmored Defense gives us AC from Constitution, this is a great way to boost HP and AC together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At nineteenth level, we take another ASI for +2 Constitution. Same as the previous one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Rages\/Damage<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>2\/+2<\/td><td>Rage<br><br>Unarmored Defense<br><br>Skills<br>-Athletics<br>-Insight<br>-Perception<br>-Religion<br>-Stealth<br>-Survival<br><br>Tools<br>-Vehicles (Land)<br>-Vehicles (Water)<br><br>Cantrip<br>-Light<br><br>Starlight Step<\/td><td>We grab a greatsword and swing it around.<br><br>With Unarmored Defense, we start at 15 AC, which is fine for this level.
