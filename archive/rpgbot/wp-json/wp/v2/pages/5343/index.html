If you want to play a Rogue, they already have a class for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skills<\/span>: Disguise is situational, but\n\tStealth is nice. Losing Diplomacy hurts if you want to play a Face, but you\n\twon&#8217;t miss Perform or Profession. If you still want to play a Face, spend a\n\ttrait to get it as a class skill.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Feats which provide bonuses\n\tto skills are rarely taken, and for good reason. While the bonuses are\n\tcertainly tempting, they can be easily replaced with skill ranks or\n\tfantastically cheap items.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick-Tongued<\/span> (Ex): The Swashbuckler&#8217;s\n\tCharisma should be good enough that they should be good at Bluff. This bonus\n\twon&#8217;t see much use unless you plan to Feint frequently, and the Swashbuckler\n\thas very little reason to do so. Giving up Charmed Life is disappointing, but\n\tnot difficult to overcome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deeds<\/span>: All of the new deeds are\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clandestine Expertise<\/span> (Ex): Situational,\n\t\tbut the static skill bonuses for yourself are nice. Not as nice as a bonus\n\t\tto initiative, but still nice.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Silence Is Golden<\/span> (Ex): This is a\n\t\tfantastic way to disable enemy spellcasters. The vast majority of spells\n\t\tinclude verbal components, so preventing their use largely prevents enemies\n\t\tfrom casting spells. You need to trip or grapple the target to trigger this,\n\t\tso be sure to invest in Trip.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Authoritative Bluff<\/span> (Ex): Situational.\n\t\tRerolls are great, but Bluff still doesn&#8217;t see a ton of use.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: skill list (altered), bonus feats (altered), charmed life, Deeds (swashbuckler initiative, menacing swordplay, bleeding wound)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Musketeer, Mysterious Avenger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"flying-blade\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/swashbuckler\/archetypes\/paizo-swashbuckler-archetypes\/flying-blade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flying Blade<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flying Blade is a fun archetype executed very well. Thrown weapon builds typically require a combination of Two-Weapon Fighting and archery feats, but Precise Throw adds a big pile of precision damage which bridges the gap between single-weapon and TWF builds without the expensive feat chain. The Swashbuckler&#8217;s abilities are fantastic and a lot of run, and Flying Blade modifies several essential Deeds to be extremely viable at range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Panache<\/span>: This shouldn&#8217;t really be a\n\tproblem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deeds<\/span>: The Flying Blade&#8217;s deeds rework the\n\tdefault Swashbuckler deeds so that they work with daggers and starknives. Many\n\tof the deeds are great, and really contribute to a dagger-centric character\n\tconcept.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Subtle Throw<\/span> (Ex): You don&#8217;t want to rely\n\t\ton this too much, but it&#8217;s excellent if you get into a bad spot.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Disrupting Counter<\/span> (Ex): You get a free\n\t\tattack, and the -4 penalty might prevent your enemy from hitting you.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Throw<\/span> (Ex): This will be your\n\t\tprimary source of damage output. With 60 foot range you have better range\n\t\tthan a rogue, and increasing the range increment for your daggers is great,\n\t\tespecially if you take Long Shot. Since it modifies Precise Strike you are\n\t\tunable to use it with two-weapon fighting, which is a great option for most\n\t\tthrown weapon builds, but the damage from Precise Strike is excellent, and\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t need an expensive feat chain.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Targeted Throw<\/span> (Ex): Targeted Strike\n\t\toffers some great tactical options.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bleeding Wound<\/span> (Ex): Even better for the\n\t\tFlying Blade than for normal Swashbucklers, Bleeding Wound is fantastic for\n\t\thit and run attacks. With no need to get into melee, the Flying Blade can\n\t\tinflict bleed damage on enemies and retreat to safety while they bleed to\n\t\tdeath.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perfect Throw<\/span> (Ex): This is a cool\n\t\toption, but your attack bonus should be good enough to hit anything which\n\t\tyou&#8217;re fighting, and you should be able to bypass the DR of most enemies\n\t\twith a bit of forethought.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flying Blade Training<\/span> (Ex): The bonuses to\n\tattack and damage are nice, and improved critical is fantastic considering\n\tthat you get it three levels earlier than anyone else can.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flying Blade Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Your daggers now\n\thave 17-20\/x3 criticals, which is fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Panache (altered), Deeds (Dodging Panache, Kip-Up, Menacing Swordplay, Targeted Strike, Bleeding Wound, Perfect Thrust), Swashbuckler Weapon Training, Swashbuckler Weapon Mastery<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mysterious Avenger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"inspired-blade\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/swashbuckler\/archetypes\/paizo-swashbuckler-archetypes\/inspired-blade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inspired Blade<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inspired Blade is a lateral step from the base Swashbuckler. The biggest problem is that the Inspired Blade can&#8217;t take Slashing Grace. If that&#8217;s acceptable to you, the Inspired Blade can be a very interesting option. If your DM is nice enough to let you take Fencing Grace (which goes beyond my typical content restrictions), the Inspired Blade is absolutely fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspired Panache<\/span> (Ex): Investing a little\n\tbit in two abilities is much cheaper than investing a lot in one ability.\n\tHowever, losing the ability to gain Panache points from killing blows can hurt\n\tthe Swashbuckler&#8217;s sustainability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspired Finesse<\/span> (Ex): If you weren&#8217;t\n\tplanning to use Slashing Grace, the rapier is the Swashbuckler&#8217;s best weapon\n\toption, so you&#8217;re essentially getting Weapon Focus for free.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deeds<\/span>: One option and it&#8217;s bad.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspired Strike<\/span> (Ex): Too costly, and much\n\t\tof the Swashbuckler&#8217;s damage comes from Precise Strike and thus isn&#8217;t\n\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit. Critical hits aren&#8217;t important to the\n\t\tSwashbuckler for their damage; they are important for the free Panache\n\t\tpoints.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapier Training<\/span> (Ex): Remember that Weapon\n\tFocus gives you an additional +1 to attacks on top of this. Improved Critical\n\tmakes it easier to fuel the ever-important Panache pool, and you get it three\n\tlevels earlier than anyone else.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapier Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): 15-20\/x3\n\tcritical hits with rapiers. Weapon Mastery is always fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Panache (altered), Deeds (Bleeding Wound), Swashbuckler Weapon Training, Swashbuckler Weapon Mastery<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Musketeer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mouser\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/swashbuckler\/archetypes\/paizo-swashbuckler-archetypes\/mouser\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mouser<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swashbuckler is a fantastic class for small characters looking to get into melee. The Mouser attempts to further emphasize this by allows the Swashbuckler to better engage foes larger than the Swashbuckler. However, the Mouser gives up several great Swashbuckler Deeds for some very situational options. Underfoot Assault is a great ability, and is certainly worth a class dip for small characters looking to fight in melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deeds<\/span>: Most of the options are\n\tsituational. Underfoot Assault could be good for a class dip into Mouser\n\tSwashbuckler, but you can live without the other Deeds, and the Deeds replaced\n\tare much better than what the Mouser gets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Underfoot Assault<\/span> (Ex): This is a\n\t\tfantastic way to force your target to attack you, which is one of the most\n\t\timportant functions of a Defender. Be sure that your AC is good and that you\n\t\thave enough hit points to survive combat in such close quarters.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Steal<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but\n\t\tallows you to Steal without wasting a feat on Improved Steal.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hamstring<\/span> (Ex): Dirty Trick is a\n\t\tfantastic maneuver with a lot of excellent options. You get none of them.\n\t\tInstead you can stagger the target. Staggering enemies can be very useful\n\t\tbecause it prevents iterative attacks, but you give up Targeted Strike which\n\t\toffers a lot of useful tactical options for the Swashbuckler.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cat&#8217;s Charge<\/span> (Ex): Giving up Bleeding\n\t\tWound is disappointing, but this vastly improves the Mouser&#8217;s mobility.\n\t\tCharging to the far side of your enemy is a great way to get into position\n\t\tfor flanking.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Deeds (Opportune Parry and Riposte, Menacing Swordplay, Targeted Strike, Bleeding Wound)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Musketeer, Mysterious Avenger<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"musketeer\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/swashbuckler\/archetypes\/paizo-swashbuckler-archetypes\/musketeer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Musketeer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swashbuckler is a hybrid of the Gunslinger and the Fighter, and takes the Gunslinger&#8217;s Grit ability and brings it into melee. Instead of trying to play the Swashbuckler as a Gunslinger, just go play a Gunslinger. This archetype is bad, ridiculous, and pointless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Proficiency<\/span>: Firearms are complex,\n\tbut can be very effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Musketeer Instruction<\/span> (Ex): You don&#8217;t get\n\tto use your Charisma modifier in place of Intelligence for combat feats, but\n\tin exchange you get Rapid Reload (Musket). If you plan to use a musket, Rapid\n\tReload is required.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deed<\/span>: Misfires are a problem for any\n\tfirearm user, and Quick Clear significantly mitigates the issue.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Quick Clear<\/span> (Ex): Misfires are a problem,\n\t\tand this roughly replicates the Gunslinger&#8217;s Quick Clear Deed.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Weapon Proficiency, Deeds (Dodging Panache)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Daring Infiltrator, Inspired Blade, Mouser<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mysterious-avenger\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/swashbuckler\/archetypes\/paizo-swashbuckler-archetypes\/mysterious-avenger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mysterious Avenger<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Slow down there, Zoro. (Do people still know who Zoro is?) The Mysterious Avanger is a combination of a secret identity and a penchant for whips. Proficiency with whips and the ability to use whips with Swashbuckler Deeds gives the Swashbuckler the ability to be an Area Control Defender if you take Improved Whip Mastery. The flavor of the archetype is cool, but the abilities are slightly worse than what they replace, so you really need to capitalize on the ability to use whips in order to make this archetype functional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Alignment<\/span>: This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem in\n\tmost campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skills<\/span>: Disguise is very situational,\n\tbut it makes a lot of sense for this archetype.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: The whip is\n\thard to use in melee, but can be great for combat maneuvers. If you plan to\n\tuse it consistently, pick up Whip Mastery and Improved Whip Mastery. Losing\n\tproficiency with bucklers means nothing: you can get masterwork buckler with\n\tno armor check penalty and never notice that you&#8217;re not proficient.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Avenger Finesse<\/span> (Ex): This allows you to use\n\tDexterity for your attacks with whips, which is essential to a\n\tSwashbuckler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Secret Identity<\/span> (Su): Very situational, and\n\tNimble provides a much-needed bonus to AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Charmed Life<\/span> (Ex): This will help\n\tto overcome the loss of AC caused by giving up Nimble, but it makes you very\n\tdependent on your limited uses of Charmed Life in a day. Remember that this\n\tadds 3 additional uses, so the Mysterious Avenger gets a total of 6 uses per\n\tday at level 4.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Avenger&#8217;s Target<\/span> (Ex): Swashbuckler\n\ttraining is nice because it doesn&#8217;t require an action and you can use it on\n\tmultiple targets. However, Avenger&#8217;s Target also increases the DCs of your\n\tdeeds. I would call that an even trade, especially once you hit level 10 and\n\tcan study targets as a swift action.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAt 10th level, a mysterious avenger can study an opponent as a move or swift\n\taction. This ability replaces swashbuckler weapon training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Proficiency, swashbuckler finesse (altered), Nimble, Bonus Feats (4th)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Daring Infiltrator, Flying Blade, Mouser, Musketeer, Picaroon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"picaroon\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/swashbuckler\/archetypes\/paizo-swashbuckler-archetypes\/picaroon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Picaroon<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wish that this archetype was good, because the fighting style is very flashy and exciting. Unfortunately, the Picaroon eats Panache points too quickly to be useful in any sort of fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Proficiency<\/span>: Firearms are complex,\n\tbut can be very effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache<\/span>: Normal Panache, plus you can use\n\tfirearms.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deeds<\/span>: The Picaroon&#8217;s deeds do a bit to\n\tfix firearms for the Swashbuckler, but they eat Panache points too quickly to\n\tbe useful.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Melee Shooter<\/span> (Ex): You don&#8217;t want to use\n\t\tthis often because it will eat your Panache pool too fast. If you take\n\t\tSignature Deed it can be useful.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Quick Clear<\/span> (Ex): Essential for any\n\t\tfirearm user.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gun Feint<\/span> (Ex): The Swashbuckler gets\n\t\tvery little from making an enemy flat-footed.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Lightning Reload<\/span> (Ex): This will eat\n\t\tthrough your Panache too quickly, and you can&#8217;t use it with a weapon in your\n\t\tother hand.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Two-Weapon Finesse<\/span> (Ex): While this looks\n\tabsurdly cool, it doesn&#8217;t work mehcanically. Two-Weapon Fighting and Firearms\n\tare very feat-starved builds, and adding both on one character is a recipe for\n\tdisaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Weapon Proficiency, Panache (altered), Deeds (Opportune Parry and Riposte, Kip-Up, Superior Feint, Bleeding Wound)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mysterious Avenger<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Swashbuckler is a Striker and potentially a Face.
