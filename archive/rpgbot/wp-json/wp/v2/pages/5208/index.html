Fortunately, you\n\twon&#8217;t need it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Saves<\/span>: Will is the Arcanist&#8217;s only good save,\n\tand with no real dependency on any ability score which contributes to saving\n\tthrows, Arcanists need to make a point to enhance their saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: No armor, but access to all\n\tsimple weapons offers plenty of options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Despite receiving only 2+ skill\n\tranks, the Arcanist actually gets a lot of skills because of their dependency\n\ton Intelligence. Access to all Knowledge skills makes the Arcanist a good\n\tLibrarian, and access to Use Magic Device opens up a lot of interesting\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: If you&#8217;re familiar with 5th Edition\n\tDnD, this should look familiar. Arcanists have the most versatile parts of\n\tboth prepared and spontaneous casting, but get new spell levels at the same\n\trate as Sorcerers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellbooks<\/span>: Identical to the Wizard class\n\tfeature.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Reservoir<\/span> (Su): Even without exploits\n\tto use your Arcane Reservoir, the ability to boost your caster level or DC\n\tgive you some fantastic options. Boost DCs for your save-or-suck spells, and\n\tboost caster level for damage spells or spells with short durations.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcanist Exploits<\/span>: Arcanist Exploits add a\n\tlot of cool customization options to the Arcanist, and can really supplement\n\tthe Arcanist&#8217;s spellcasting. Some exploits rely on Charisma, but if you avoid\n\tthem you can dump Charisma to 7 and not notice the difference. For help with\n\tExploits, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/arcanist\/exploits\">Arcanist Exploits Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Cantrips are fantastic and\n\tversatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Consume Spells<\/span> (Su): This is a fantastic way\n\tto make use of your large number of low level spell slots, and a great way to\n\tfuel your Arcane Reservoir. However, the limited uses per day means that you\n\tcan&#8217;t just grab a Ring of Wizardy I to turn your 1st-level spells into a\n\treservoir source.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Exploits<\/span>: Greater Exploits often\n\timprove on regular Exploits, but unfortunately they aren&#8217;t as impactful as\n\tregular Exploits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Supremacy<\/span> (Su): Eat all of your low\n\tlevel spells and turn them into 9th-level spells with boosted caster level and\n\tDC. Go ruin someone&#8217;s day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Like the Sorcerer and Wizard, the Arcanist is a primary caster, and is very SAD.

I still\n\twouldn&#8217;t put a ton of resources into this because the returns on your\n\tinvestment are small, but certainly don&#8217;t dump it unless you plan to forgo\n\tExploits which use Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 18<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 17<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 16<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 15<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 13<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>A bonus to Intelligent is key, but bonuses to Charisma and defensive abilities are nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarf<\/span>: Nothing really useful to the\n\tArcanist, and a penalty to Charisma, but Dwarfs are very durable. The favored\n\tclass bonus makes the Dwarf very good at arcane barrier and arcane weapon,\n\twhich can be great for a Blade Adept Arcanist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Much like the Wizard, Elves are\n\tfantastic Arcanists. Their bonus to Intelligence and their racial abilities at\n\tleast match whatever a Human could select. The Elf&#8217;s favored class bonus\n\tallows you to increase the capacity of your Arcane Reservoir, which is nice if\n\tyou want to walk into fights with a huge reservoir to draw on.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: The bonus to Charisma helps with\n\tArcanist Exploits, but none of the Gnomes other abilities are particularly\n\tuseful. The favored class bonus gets you a few more Arcane Reservoir points,\n\tbut considering you can eat a 1st-level spell to get a single point, the most\n\teffect you can get from the Gnome&#8217;s favored class bonus can be matched by 3\n\t1st-level spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Flexible ability bonus goes into\n\tIntelligence, and consider some alternate racial abilities. The favored class\n\tbonus is bad.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Flexible ability bonus goes into\n\tIntelligence. Darkvision is always nice, but consider replacing the Half-Orc&#8217;s\n\tother abilities. The favored class bonus is bad.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: The bonus to Charisma helps with\n\tArcanist Exploits, and the Halfling is great if you want to be stealthy. The\n\tfavored class bonus gets you some extra exploits, which is a great way to\n\tcapitalize on the Charisma bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always a fantastic option, Humans\n\tmake great Arcanists. The favored class bonus is terrible (you can just buy\n\tspells to put in your spellbook), but don&#8217;t let that dissuade you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): +1 to a weak\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): +2 initiative is\n\t\thuge.

It&#8217;s a bit more expensive than your typical +2 shield, so it may\n\t\tnot be worth the cost compared to a mithral buckler. However, it allows you\n\t\tto perform somatic components with the hand holding the shield, which means\n\t\tthat you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue, and because it\n\t\thas no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone can use it without\n\t\tissue.

If you are a 3.5 native, go read Pathfinder&#8217;s rules for staffs because they have improved dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staffs are a reliable, rechargeable source of extra spellcasting that can give spellcasters easy and reliable access to spells from their spell list which they might not want to learn, or which they might like to use so frequently that they can&#8217;t prepare the spell enough times in a given day. On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reduce Person<\/span>: Reducing your size offers\n\t\tseveral useful benefits.
