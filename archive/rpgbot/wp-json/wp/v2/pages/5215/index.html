Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rage-powers\">Rage Powers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abyssal Blood<\/span> (Su): If this was more than\n\tonce per day it would be fantastic. Enlarge Person is an essential buff for\n\tnearly all Barbarians, and limiting it to one rage per day really limits your\n\tusefulness. This will be totally useless if your Rage Cycle.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Abyssal Blood, Greater<\/span> (Su): Not a ton of\n\tresistance, but it covers several types.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abyssal Blood, Lesser<\/span> (Su): Barbarians are\n\ttypically better off using a two-handed weapon, but you do get to apply your\n\tfull strength bonus to damage on both attacks, which makes this a great option\n\tuntil you hit BAB +6 and get iterative attacks.<\/p>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Fury<\/span> (Ex): Extra attacks are nice,\n\tbut this won&#8217;t benefit from a magic weapon, it won&#8217;t bypass DR, and it doesn&#8217;t\n\teven apply your full strength bonus to damage. Unless you&#8217;re building a\n\tgrappler, skip this power.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Auspicious Mark<\/span> (Su): This is great for\n\tfailed saves, missed critical hit confirmations, and other high value rolls.\n\tDon&#8217;t use this for damage. Of course, it&#8217;s a swift action so you can only use\n\tit on your own turn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Battle Roar<\/span> (Su): Pitifully small damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast Totem<\/span>* (Su): This scales at the same\n\tlevels as power attack, which makes the math easy to remember. AC is a\n\tconstant problem for barbarians, and this adds a fairly impressive bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast Totem, Greater<\/span>* (Su): This power is\n\tabsolutely fantastic. Pounce makes melee characters miles better, and\n\tBarbarians especially benefit from charging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beast Totem, Lesser<\/span>* (Su): Natural weapons\n\taren&#8217;t very useful for barbarians, since you will typically be using a\n\ttwo-handed weapon. However, rules as written, you can make a claw attack as a\n\tnatural attack, use a free action to place your off-hand on your two-handed\n\tweapon, and continue your full attack with your weapon. This is a somewhat\n\tquestionable interpretation of the rules, but if Thunderstriker fighters can\n\texist, then it&#8217;s technically correct. And that&#8217;s best kind.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bestial Climber<\/span> (Ex): You must be in a very\n\tweird fight if you need a climb speed while raging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bestial Leaper<\/span> (Ex): Barbarians don&#8217;t need\n\tSpring Attack, and they don&#8217;t need this. Grab your weapon, put it in someone&#8217;s\n\tface, and end your charge adjacent to your enemy like a real Barbarian.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bestial Swimmer<\/span> (Ex): You must be in a very\n\tweird fight if you need a swim speed while raging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bleeding Blow<\/span> (Ex): You can only use powerful\n\tblow once per rage, which means you can only use this once per rage. The\n\tdamage, even with both powers, isn&#8217;t great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boasting Taunt<\/span> (Ex): Unless you have a way\n\tto get free attempts to demoralize a creature, it will be hard to justify this\n\tpower. Making the target shaken for the duration of your rage is pretty nice,\n\tbut it doesn&#8217;t benefit you very much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Body Bludgeon<\/span> (Ex): Hillarious, but not very\n\tgood.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Brawler<\/span>: If you planned to fight unarmed, you\n\tprobably took improved unarmed strike.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Brawler, Greater<\/span>: This lets you two-weapon\n\tfight using an unarmed strike as your off-hand weapon. Monks will be jealous\n\tof your strength damage, but not much else..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Celestial Blood<\/span> (Su): Not a lot of\n\tresistance, and acid and cold aren&#8217;t particularly common types.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Blood, Greater<\/span> (Su): Ignore the\n\tability\/skill check reroll. You can reroll a saving throw. If you can Rage\n\tCycle, that means you can reroll a saving throw every round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Celestial Blood, Lesser<\/span> (Su):\n\tSituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Chaos Totem<\/span>* (Su): The escape artist bonus\n\twill probably never come up, and the resistance to sneak attacks and critical\n\thits isn&#8217;t very big.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Chaos Totem, Greater<\/span>* (Su): The DR is\n\tfantastic, but remember that DR from multiple sources don&#8217;t stack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Chaos Totem, Lesser<\/span>* (Su): If your\n\tcampaign features a lot of lawful enemies, the bonuses are pretty nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Clear Mind<\/span> (Ex): Barbarians&#8217; biggest\n\tweakness is their lousy will saves, but Eater of Magic is considerably better\n\tbecause it applies to a much wider range of abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Come and Get Me<\/span> (Ex): I hope you have decent\n\tdexterity and took Comabt Reflexes. This gives you a potentially huge number\n\tof additional attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crippling Blow<\/span> (Ex): Ability damage is\n\tscary, and the DC to resist this is going to be absurdly high, but it&#8217;s only\n\tusable once per rage, and the ability damage scales very slowly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deadly Accuracy<\/span> (Ex): Barbarians, due to\n\ttheir absurd strength, have slightly higher attack roles than Fighters. With\n\tthe added bonus to attacks from Surprise Accuracy, you should be so likely to\n\thit that this won&#8217;t be needed to confirm critical hits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Disruptive<\/span>: The disruptive feat is a really\n\tfantasic way to lock down enemy spellcasters, and this is one of very few ways\n\tto get it without being a fighter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Draconic Blood<\/span> (Su): A tiny bit of energy\n\tresistance and some natural armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Draconic Blood, Greater<\/span> (Su): The save is\n\tdecent, but the damage is poor, and you can only use it once per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Draconic Blood, Lesser<\/span> (Su): Barbarians\n\tare typically better off using a two-handed weapon, but you do get to apply\n\tyour full strength bonus to damage on both attacks, which makes this a great\n\toption until you hit BAB +6 and get iterative attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dragon Totem<\/span>* (Su): Considering you need two\n\tprevious rage powers and you need to be level 6 to select this totem, it\n\treally doesn&#8217;t give you much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dragon Totem Resilience<\/span>* (Su): The\n\tresistances won&#8217;t be very large because the Barbarian DR doesn&#8217;t scale very\n\tquickly, but you get to add 4 more resistance because you already have Dragon\n\tTotem and Dragon Totem Resilience. Even so, the Energy Resistance power is\n\tlikely better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"ed\">Dragon Totem Wings<\/span>* (Su): By level 10, your party\n\tshould have enough spellcasting available that someone else can provide you\n\twith a means of flight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eater of Magic<\/span> (Su): The temporary hit\n\tpoints are cute, but this would probably be blue just for the free save\n\treroll.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Blood<\/span> (Su): 10 resistance is\n\tnice, but you need to be raging to use it, so don&#8217;t get surprised by a\n\tfireball.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Blood, Greater<\/span> (Su): Did you pick\n\tElectricity? Because you probably should have picked Electricity. 60 foot fly\n\twhile raging is excellent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Blood, Lesser<\/span> (Su): 3 rounds per\n\tday won&#8217;t get you much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Rage<\/span> (Su): Add a free energy\n\teffect to your weapon. The d6 damage won&#8217;t be much compared to your crazy\n\tbarbarian strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Rage, Greater<\/span> (Su): Pretend all of\n\tyour attacks have an elemental burst property.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Rage, Lesser<\/span> (Su): Once per rage,\n\tyou get 1d6 energy damage on an attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Energy Absorption<\/span> (Su): This is garbage. It\n\tapplies to a single <em>attack<\/em>, meaning that RAW spells and special\n\tabilities like breath weapons (the two biggest sources of energy damage) are\n\texcluded, and you can only use this once per rage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Energy Eruption<\/span> (Su): Very situational, and\n\tthe damage won&#8217;t be very good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Energy Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Permanent, scaling\n\tenergy resistance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Energy Resistance, Greater<\/span> (Ex): Once per\n\trage, but it gets considerably better the more times you take Energy\n\tResistance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Fearless Rage<\/span> (Ex): Rage gives you a +2 bonus\n\tto your will saves, and fear effects are among the least lethal in the\n\tgame.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ferocious<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Mount<\/span> (Ex): If you are a mounted charger\n\tBarbarian, this is a must. Adding rage to your mount gives your mount\n\tadditional strength to increase its combat maneuver checks to overrun\n\tenemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ferocious<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Mount, Greater<\/span> (Ex): Add Energy Resistance,\n\tclaws and natural armor from Beast Totem, etc. to your mount.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ferocious<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Trample<\/span> (Ex): Great for mounted charger\n\tBarbarians. Combined with Ferocious Mount, your mount will have fantastic\n\tstrength, which will make the Trample damage very impressive. Of course, your\n\tmount has to make an overrun attempt as a full round action ot use this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ferocious<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Trample, Greater<\/span> (Ex): This allows you to\n\toverrun and use trample as a normal part of a charge or movement, which allows\n\tthe mount to trample while the barbarian is charging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Fey Blood<\/span> (Su): Too situational. Take the\n\tNimble Moves feat instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fey Blood, Greater<\/span> (Su): Blur is\n\texcellent, especially because you can get it so easily, but most Barbarians\n\twill be standing and making full attacks on most of their turns.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Fey Blood, Lesser<\/span> (Su): You have to crit,\n\tthen they get a save, then they might still act normally because Confused is a\n\tgarbage status effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fiend Totem<\/span>* (Su): The effect is cool, but\n\tthe damage is too small for enemies to really care about it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fiend Totem, Greater<\/span>* (Su): If most of your\n\tenemies are good, and you tend to fight mobs of enemies, this can be fairly\n\teffective. The damage still isn&#8217;t fantastic, but it makes people shaken with\n\tno save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fiend Totem, Lesser<\/span>* (Su): Extra attacks\n\tare nice, but this won&#8217;t benefit from a magic weapon, it won&#8217;t bypass DR, and\n\tit doesn&#8217;t even apply your full strength bonus to damage while you&#8217;re making\n\tother (likely better) attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fierce Fortitude<\/span> (Ex): Disease and Poison\n\tbecome very common at high levels, and a +4 bonus against both is a good\n\tsupplement to the Barbarian&#8217;s already formidable Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Flesh Wound<\/span> (Ex): By level 10 damage rolls\n\twill far exceed your fortitude saves, which will make this incredibly\n\tdifficult to use. The armor check penalty to the save just adds insult to\n\tinjury.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ghost Rager<\/span> (Su): The bonuses are nice,\n\tbut highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Good for What Ails You<\/span> (Ex): Most of those\n\teffects aren&#8217;t problematic enough to justify taking a power.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ground Breaker<\/span> (Ex): This is flashy and\n\texciting, and can be very helpful for preventing enemies from moving out of\n\tyour reach without drawing attacks of opportunity. However, it won&#8217;t be a\n\tgo-to option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ground Breaker, Greater<\/span> (Ex): Increasing\n\tthe effect of groundbreaker is great, but the use of Ground Breaker is\n\tsituational enough that it&#8217;s hard to justify devoting this many resources to\n\tit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guarded Life<\/span> (Ex): One of the scariest\n\tsituations for a Barbarian is falling unconcious while raging. The sudden loss\n\tof constitution is often enough to kill the barbarian. This will offset half\n\tof the suddenly missing hit points, which may be enough to save your life.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guarded Life, Greater<\/span> (Ex): Now when you\n\tfall unconcious while raging, as long as the attack didn&#8217;t already kill you,\n\tyour won&#8217;t die from it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Guarded Stance<\/span> (Ex): There are better ways to\n\tget a bonus to AC which won&#8217;t cut into your murder time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hive Totem<\/span>* (Su): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hive Totem Resilience<\/span>* (Su): The damage\n\tresistance is highly situational, and the bonus to grapple is mediocre.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hive Totem Toxicity<\/span>* (Su): The poison scales\n\treally well, and the poison damage is impressive, but the three powers leading\n\tup to this are all terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Hurling<\/span> (Ex): As lesser hurling, but the barbarian can\n\tincrease the range increment to 20 feet or increase the size of a hurled\n\tobject by one size category. A barbarian must have the lesser hurling rage\n\tpower to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to\n\tselect this rage power.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hurling, Greater<\/span> (Ex): Even when throwing a\n\tHuge object for 6d6, or Gargantuan (you will need Enlarge person) for 10d6,\n\tyour damage for charging is likely better. Plus, good luck finding something\n\tthis large to throw around.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hurling, Lesser<\/span> (Ex): With such a small range\n\tincrement, you would do much better by charging. Plus, the enemy gets a reflex\n\tsave to avoid some of the damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hurling Charge<\/span> (Ex): Basically you get to\n\tthrow a weapon part way through your charge. This supplements you damage a\n\tlittle bit, but making this useful requires devoting feats and resources to\n\tranged combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Increased Damage Reduction<\/span> (Ex): More DR\n\tnever hurts, but 1 more point won&#8217;t do a lot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infernal Blood<\/span> (Su): Situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infernal Blood, Greater<\/span> (Su):\n\tSituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infernal Blood, Lesser<\/span> (Su): 3 rounds per\n\tday won&#8217;t get you much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspire Ferocity<\/span> (Ex): This might be a good\n\tuse for your surprise round since you can&#8217;t charge, but most players probably\n\tdon&#8217;t want to sacrifice AC for attack bonus for a full combat. Without\n\tbarbarian hit points to fall back on, I can&#8217;t really blame them. The duration\n\tis determined by your Charisma, which you probably dumped.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Internal Fortitude<\/span> (Ex): Sickened and\n\tNauseated are very rare.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intimidating Glare<\/span> (Ex): This is\n\tconsiderably better than intimidating as a Standard action. If you really want\n\tto demoralize a foe, this will allow you to intimidate and attack in the same\n\tround, or intimidate twice. Unfortunately, the duration is tied to your\n\tCharisma, which you probably dumped<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knockback<\/span> (Ex): This is useful for getting\n\tenemies away from weak allies, or for preventing enemies from full attack. It\n\tmay also be helpful to set up the target to be charged on the following round.\n\tIt&#8217;s only usable once per range, which considerably limits the utility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Knockdown<\/span> (Ex): This is considerably better\n\tfor Barbarians than improved trip. You only get it once per rage, but it&#8217;s\n\tuseful for enemies with a lot of AC..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lethal Accuracy<\/span> (Ex): This is hard to\n\tjustify considering how infrequently it will come up. You need to use surprise\n\taccuracy, roll a critical threat, (30% chance with a keen falchion), and then\n\tmanage to confirm the crit. You have a 30% chance per rage to\n\t<em>maybe<\/em> get the benefits of this power.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Linnorm Death Curse, Cairn<\/span> (Su): Amusing and\n\tflavorful, but useless when you&#8217;re actually trying to kill someone. Plus, you\n\tneed to be knocked unconscious to trigger the effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Linnorm Death Curse, Crag<\/span> (Su): Amusing, but\n\tyou need to be knocked unconscious to trigger the effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Linnorm Death Curse, Fjord<\/span> (Su): Amusing, but\n\tyou need to be knocked unconscious to trigger the effect. Even then, this is\n\treally only useful underwater.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Linnorm Death Curse, Ice<\/span> (Su): Amusing, but\n\tyou need to be knocked unconscious to trigger the effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Linnorm Death Curse, Taiga<\/span> (Su): Amusing, but\n\tyou need to be knocked unconscious to trigger the effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Linnorm Death Curse, Tarn<\/span> (Su): Amusing, but\n\tyou need to be knocked unconscious to trigger the effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Linnorm Death Curse, Tor<\/span> (Su): Amusing,\n\tbut you need to be knocked unconscious to trigger the effect. Permanently\n\tstaggering the target is easily the best of the Linnorm curses, but even a\n\tstaggered target can kill you while you&#8217;re unconcious.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Liquid Courage<\/span> (Ex): To charge bonus, you\n\thave to spend precious rage rounds spending a standard action to drink. If you\n\ttook the Drunken Brute archetype, this shoots up to green.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Low-Light Vision<\/span> (Ex): Nice, but\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mighty Swing<\/span> (Ex): Your critical hits will\n\tbe devastating. Your attack bonus should be high enough that you can confirm\n\treliably, but it&#8217;s nice to be absolutely certain once per rage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Moment of Clarity<\/span> (Ex): Once you can rage\n\tcycle at level 17 (no more fatigue from rage, so you can start and stop rages\n\tevery round), this means that you can permanently remove the penalties for\n\traging. Until then, this is garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Night Vision<\/span> (Ex): Nice, but situational.\n\tFew fights will take place in the dark.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">No Escape<\/span> (Ex): Hillarious and good, but\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Overbearing Advance<\/span> (Ex): Good for shoving\n\tpast your enemies&#8217; front line to reach their squishy allies at the rear.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Overbearing Onslaught<\/span> (Ex): If there are\n\tenough enemies in the way that you need to overrun several of them, you should\n\tprobably stop to kill a few of them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Perfect Clarity<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Powerful Blow<\/span> (Ex): The damage doesn&#8217;t scale\n\tquickly, and you can only apply the bonus once per rage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Primal Scent<\/span> (Ex): Tracking while raging\n\tdoesn&#8217;t happen. It takes too long. Locating invisible creatures is helpful,\n\tbut highly situational, and there are plenty of other ways to find invisible\n\tcreatures.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Reflexes<\/span> (Ex): Take Combat Reflexes\n\tinstead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Raging Climber<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raging Flier<\/span> (Su): Interesting, and great\n\tif you can Rage Cycle, but you probably need a more reliable source of\n\tflight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raging Leaper<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational,\n\tbut jumping is required for some charge mechanics. In such a case, this might\n\tbe green or even blue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Raging Swimmer<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reckless Abandon<\/span> (Ex): This offsets your\n\tpenalty to attack rolls from power attack. Your AC is going to be truly awful,\n\tbut you&#8217;re going to hit everything, and you&#8217;re going to hit everything very\n\thard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Reflexive Dodge<\/span> (Ex): I assume that the power\n\tonly applies to the dodge bonus from Rolling Dodge. Otherwise, things like the\n\tDodge feat would apply, and that would be silly. If you need reflex save\n\tbonuses this bad, take Lightning Reflexes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Regenerative Vigor<\/span> (Ex): Fast healing is\n\tvery nice, and this functionally makes you immune to ongoing bleed effects.\n\tHowever, this only activates after you waste a standard action on Renewed\n\tVigor. It also stops working if you rage cycle, which makes this useless at\n\thigh levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Renewed Life<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational. If you\n\tare getting enough negative levels to justify this power, your DM is using too\n\tmany negative levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Renewed Vigor<\/span> (Ex): The amount of healing can\n\tvery easily be replaced with a potion or two. At high levels where a potion of\n\tCure Light Wounds won&#8217;t keep up, you should have several much better healing\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Renewed Vitality<\/span> (Ex): Ability damage is a\n\tgood way to weaken a barbarian, and many enemies use it. However, this\n\trequires to powers to get, and is situational. Have someone in the party carry\n\ta few scrolls of lesser restoration if you are this worried about ability\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Roaring Drunk<\/span> (Ex): To charge bonus, you have\n\tto spend precious rage rounds spending a standard action to drink. If you took\n\tthe Drunken Brute archetype, this still only goes up to orange.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Rolling Dodge<\/span> (Ex): The bonus is situational,\n\tusing this costs a move action, it scales very poorly, and it only lasts for a\n\tfew rounds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Roused Anger<\/span> (Ex): This lets you rage cycle\n\tonce for free, which resets all of your once-per-rage powers. Keep in mind\n\tthat being exhausted will really cut into your murdering, so make sure you\n\thave enough rage rounds left to get you through the rest of the fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Scent<\/span> (Ex): Finding invisible foes is a\n\tpain, and this is a great way to do it without dumping a ton of ranks into\n\tPerception.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sharpened Accuracy<\/span> (Ex): Surprise Accuracy\n\tis bad, and this would be situational even if you could use it more than once\n\tper rage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Smasher<\/span> (Ex): If you care about sundering,\n\tyou should be using an adamantine weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell Sunder<\/span> (Su): This is situational, hard\n\tto do reliably, and the DC is awful. Even against squishy casters, it&#8217;s going\n\tto be hard to reliably beat their CMD by 10 to dispel a single effect. Oh, and\n\tit only affects a single effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Spellbreaker<\/span>: When raging, the barbarian gains\n\tSpellbreaker as a bonus feat. A barbarian must have the disruptive rage power\n\tand be at least 12th level to select this rage power.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spirit<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Steed<\/span> (Su): For mounted charger barbarians,\n\tthis is essential starting in mid levels when enemies start having DR. Your\n\tmount&#8217;s trample attacks won&#8217;t be very helpful if they can&#8217;t bypass DR.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Totem<\/span>* (Su): You will need to use a\n\treach weapon to keep this useful, but a percentage miss chance is pretty great\n\twhen your AC is as low as it typically is for a Barbarian.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spirit Totem, Greater<\/span>* (Su): By this level,\n\tthat amount of damage is laughable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spirit Totem, Lesser<\/span>* (Su): What Barbarian\n\thas enough Charisma to make this useful? Even if you had 20 charisma, this\n\twould stop being good after about level 5.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Sprint<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational, and your\n\tspeed is already impressive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Staggering Drunk<\/span> (Ex): To charge bonus, you\n\thave to spend precious rage rounds spending a standard action to drink. If you\n\ttook the Drunken Brute archetype, this shoots up to green.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Strength Surge<\/span> (Ex): This opens up a lot of\n\tcombat maneuver options with a fairly minimal investment of resources. If you\n\tare already good at combat maneuvers (and every barbarian is), this can make\n\tyour maneuvers do crazy things like bull rush people 30 feet off of a\n\tbuilding.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sunder Enchantment<\/span> (Su): Highly\n\tsituational. It can be very powerful if you focus heavily on sundering.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Superstition<\/span> (Ex): Spells make up a huge\n\tportion of the things you will save against over the course of your career,\n\twhich makes this a very good option. However, not being able to be the willing\n\trecipient of magical healing is very dangerous. The bonus is a Morale bonus,\n\tso it won&#8217;t stack with the saving throw bonus from Rage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Surprise Accuracy<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s unfortunate\n\tthat this can only be used once per rage, but it&#8217;s great to use with your\n\topening charge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Swift Foot<\/span> (Ex): Fleet is better. This\n\tenhancement bonus won&#8217;t stack with items or spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Terrifying Howl<\/span> (Ex): The DC will be very,\n\tvery high, and panicking all of the enemies in a fight makes a fight very\n\teasy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ultimate Clarity<\/span> (Su): Useless unless you can\n\tRage Cycle, and you need two really bad Rage powers as prerequisites.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Undead Blood<\/span> (Su): Situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Undead Blood, Greater<\/span> (Su): Situational<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Undead Blood, Lesser<\/span> (Su): Making the\n\ttarget Shaken with no save is pretty great, and the duration is decent, but\n\tbecause you can&#8217;t stack it with other fear effects like you usually can, this\n\tisn&#8217;t very useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unexpected Strike<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s only usable\n\tonce per rage, but that&#8217;s one free attack once per rage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Witch Hunter<\/span> (Ex): Situational, and it scales\n\tslowly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">World Serpent Totem<\/span>* (Su): Very situational\n\tbonus, and it scales very poorly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">World Serpent Spirit<\/span>* (Su): This helps to\n\tbypass the DR of many outsiders, but it is still veri situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">World Serpent Totem Unity<\/span>* (Su): Highly\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Instead of the fighter&#8217;s feats, Barbarians get Rage Powers.
