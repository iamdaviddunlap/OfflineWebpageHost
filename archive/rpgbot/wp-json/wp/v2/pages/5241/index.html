With a clever combination of feats, you can eventually threaten a 15 foot area around you with your bow, and fire in melee without drawing attacks of opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hawkeye<\/span> (Ex): The bonus on perception\n\tchecks is nice since Perception is so important, but the range increment bonus\n\tdoesn&#8217;t matter much since bows already have extremely good range.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Trick Shot<\/span> (Ex):\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Disarming<\/span> and\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Sundering<\/span> with a ranged weapon is a pretty\n\tcool trick. Feinting much less so. At higher levels you get\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">bull rush<\/span>,\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">grapple<\/span>, and\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">trip<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Expert Archer<\/span> (Ex): Identical to weapon\n\ttraining with the Bow weapon group. Bonuses to your attacks and damage are\n\tnice since your normal strategy is to use Rapid Shot and Deadly Aim.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Safe Shot<\/span> (Ex): This lets you tank while\n\tstill using a bow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Evasive Archer<\/span> (Ex): At this level, most\n\tenemies making ranged attacks won&#8217;t be using actualy projectiles, and the\n\tdodge bonus to AC is helpful against rays and touch attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Volley<\/span> (Ex): This is really nice when facing\n\tmultiple foes, and there isn&#8217;t a limit on how many times you can use it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranged Defense<\/span> (Ex): The DR is highly\n\tsituational, but the Snatch Arrows effect is highly abusable. Grab a level 1\n\tcommoner with a bow, have him shoot at you, and you get a free attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Auto-confirming crits\n\twon&#8217;t come into play much with a 20\/x4 crit, but when it happens it will feel\n\tvery good.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Bravery,<br>\n\tWeapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"armor-master\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/armor-master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Armor Master<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Armor Master makes you very durable, but really the only meaningful contributions are the DR and Fortification. You give up all of the weapon training abilities, which means your class has no offensive abilities. So you&#8217;re a very durable road block with no damage output. With no damage output, you must depend entirely on your feats to make you a meaningful threat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflective Shield<\/span> (Ex): A typeless bonus to\n\tyour touch AC is cute, but it&#8217;s <em>only<\/em> to your touch AC. It&#8217;s highly\n\tsituational, and the bonus is pretty lackluster. On top of that, it requires\n\tthat you use a shield, which limits your options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Armored Defense<\/span> (Ex): DR is pretty nice,\n\tbut I don&#8217;t know why they even bothered listing bonuses for light and medium\n\tarmor. You&#8217;re an armor master, so you should be wearing Full Plate. DR 3\/- no\n\tand 12\/- later. Oh, and it stacks with adamantine, which can bring you up to\n\t15\/-.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fortification<\/span> (Ex): This replicates a very\n\texpensive set of armor abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indestructible<\/span> (Ex): Ummunity to critical\n\thits is nice, and immunity to sneak attacks is occasionally useful.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Bravery, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training<br>(1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"brawler\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/brawler-%28archetype%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brawler<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Brawlers specialize in uding the Close weapon group, which doesn&#8217;t feature a lot of good options. However, the archetype provides a lot of very interesting abilities to increase damage output, and a whole mess of tricks for forcing enemies to remain in melee. These abilities also make Brawlers an incredible mage hunter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Fighters are proficient with\n\tbasically everything except exotic weapons. Some Close weapons are exotic, but\n\tthey are generally not worth a feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Fighters get 2+ skills, and have a\n\tvery short skill list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Close Control (Ex)<\/span>: Bull Rush, Drag, and\n\tReposition are only situationally useful, and all do effectively the same\n\tthing: move the enemy from point A to point B. If you spend the feats, you can\n\tforce the enemy to draw attacks of opportunity when you move them. Unless your\n\tparty is full of rogues with combat reflexes, you&#8217;re probably better of just\n\thitting things instead of dragging them around between your party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Close Combatant (Ex)<\/span>: The bonus to attacks\n\tis basically the same as weapon training. The +3 damage is two points higher\n\tthan the normal weapon training bonus, which makes Close weapons roughly\n\tequivalent to most one-handed weapons in terms of damage. The close weapon\n\tgroup has very few fantasic options, which is unfortunate. I&#8217;m still confused\n\twhy Daggers aren&#8217;t a Close weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Menacing Stance (Ex)<\/span>: This is the first\n\tsignature ability for the brawler. It makes it hard to hit you in melee, and\n\tmakes you very effective at locking down spellcasters. Combined with the Step\n\tUp and Disruptive feats, you are going to be very problematic for\n\tspellcasters. The scaling penalties keep this ability relevant into higher\n\tlevels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">No Escape (Ex)<\/span>: Combined with Step Up, this\n\tability is absolutely fantastic. Not only can people not get away from you,\n\tyou get an attack of opportunity when they try. If they try to withdraw, make\n\ta trip attempt. If they do manage to withdraw, just charge them next round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Stand Still<\/span>: You should already have Combat\n\tReflexes and Stand Still by now, so this is basically another combat feat. The\n\treal benefit here is the bonus on combat maneuver checks when using Stand\n\tStill.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Mastery (Ex)<\/span>: Decent, but\n\tconsidering no close weapon has a threat range greater than 20, it&#8217;s not going\n\tto see a lot of use. Your CMD should be insane by level 20, so being disarmed\n\treally shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/brawler\">Brawler Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Gladiator<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cad\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/cad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cad<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cad is the master of the Dirty Trick maneuver. They are fairly difficult to play, but when paired with a decent striker the Cad is a brutally effective option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Cad gives up proficiency\n\tin medium armor, heavy armor, and tower shields. It may be worth spending a\n\tfeat on medium armor proficiency so that you can use mithral breastplate, but\n\twithout Armor Training, you won&#8217;t be able to move at full normal speed in\n\tmedium and heavy armor. You need to get into combat quickly, so your movement\n\tspeed is important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: The Cad add Acrobatics, Bluff,\n\tEscape Artist, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth to their skill list. These fit the\n\tflavor of the Cad well, but the fighter&#8217;s limited skill points don&#8217;t give him\n\ta lot of room to enjoy these bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dirty Maneuvers<\/span>: This is the Cad&#8217;s\n\treplacement for bravery, and fits the flavor of the archetype perfectly.\n\tDisarm and Dirty Trick are crucial for the Cad, and this provides an extremely\n\trare bonus to the Dirty Trick maneuver. Steal can be situationally useful, but\n\tI find that there are generally more important things to do in combat than\n\tpick people&#8217;s pockets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catch Off-Guard<\/span>:\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/feats.html#catch-off-guard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Catch Off-Guard<\/a>\n\tis a weird feat, but can be very powerful in a Cad&#8217;s hands. Proficiency with\n\timprovised weapons is fairly dull, but treating unarmed opponents as\n\tflat-footed opens up some options for the Cad, especially once he gets Deadly\n\tSurprise at level 7. This is particularly useful against NPC wizards\/sorcerers\n\twho don&#8217;t typically need weapons. Keep in mind that natural weapons count, so\n\tthis isn&#8217;t particularly useful against most monsters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Payback<\/span>: While certainly in keeping with\n\tthe flavor of the archetype, this is strictly worse than Weapon Training. The\n\tCad is good at locking down enemies and preventing them from attacking you (or\n\tdoing anything else interesting). If payback comes into play frequently, the\n\tfight likely isn&#8217;t going well for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadly Surprise<\/span>: Level 7 is basically\n\tchristmas. At this point you should have all of the Dirty Trick feats, which\n\tis great because Deadly Surprise is probably the best thing that has ever\n\thappened to the Dirty Trick maneuver. Dirty trick is, by default, a Standard\n\tAction. With\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/ultimateCombatFeats.html#quick-dirty-trick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quick Dirty Trick<\/a>, you can make a single dirty trick attempt per turn in place of your attack\n\twith highest base attack bonus, a limitation which isn&#8217;t placed on other\n\tcombat maneuvers like Trip and Disarm. However, your foe needs to be denied\n\ttheir dexterity bonus to use this ability. Use Quick Dirty Trick to blind your\n\tfoe, then use Deadly Surprise to pile on other status effects.<\/p>\n<p>If you are planning to multiclass into other classes, now is the time to do\n\tit. Deadly Surprise is easily the defining feature of the Cad archetype, and\n\tthe higher level features do little to improve your maneuvers further.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Razor-Sharp Chair Leg<\/span>: Changing the damage\n\ttype for your improvised weapons is cute, but rarely necessary. The 19-20\n\tthreat range with improvised weapons is nice, but isn&#8217;t a game changer. It&#8217;s\n\tmarginally more important when you get Treacherous Blow later, but still not a\n\thuge bonus.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Craven Combatant<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to have\n\tCombat Expertise for your combat maneuver feats, and you will likely be using\n\tit to compensate for your lack of medium and heavy armor. If you are using\n\tcombat expertise, this effectively becomes Improved Uncanny Dodge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sweeping Prank<\/span>: At this point, you should\n\tbe getting to use dirty trick frequently due to Deadly Surprise, which makes\n\tSweeping Prank only useful on surprise rounds in which you start adjacent to\n\ttwo foes or in rounds in which you need to move. Even then, you could simulate\n\tthis effect by using Cleave and have the added benefit of dealing damage. At\n\t17th level you can use this ability against 2+dex modifier targets. This is\n\tmarginally better, but still only situationally useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Treacherous Blow<\/span>: Because you&#8217;re limited\n\tto a single immediate action per round, this won&#8217;t let you use Dirty Trick\n\tmore often, it simply provides a way to use it when your target isn&#8217;t denied\n\ttheir attack bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ultimate Payback<\/span>: This is a great\n\timprovement on Payback, but isn&#8217;t going to be particularly helpful unless your\n\tbuild focuses on critical hits.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/cad\">Cad Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Bravery, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crossbowmen\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/crossbowman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crossbowman<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crossbowman is a very difficult build. Instead of falling on Rapid Shot to deal damage, the Crossbowman uses sniping and prepared actions to make single shots. With some careful feat selection, this might be a workable build, but you likely won&#8217;t match the Archer archetype&#8217;s damage output. This may be the only archetype in the game where Vital Strike is actually an expected choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strongly recommend reading my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/vital_strike\">Practical Guide to Vital Strike<\/a>\n\tif you plan to play a Crossbowman.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deadshot<\/span> (Ex): This ability defines how the\n\tarchetype will be played. Essentially, the Crossbowmen depends on readied\n\tactions. Applying half of your dexterity to damage is nice, but it&#8217;s hard to\n\tmake it match up to the huge damage gap provided by using a composite bow with\n\trapid shot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Crossbow Expert<\/span> (Ex): Weapon training with\n\tcrossbows. If you&#8217;re only going to get one attack off of a prepared action,\n\tyou had better hit with it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Deadshot<\/span> (Ex): Very few enemies\n\tdepend on dexterity for AC, so this will rarely help you hit. If you had sneak\n\tattack, this would be nice, but after 7 levels a dip into Rogue won&#8217;t be very\n\thelpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Sniper<\/span> (Ex): The bonus to sniping is\n\tnice, but Stealth isn&#8217;t a class skill for you, and the archetype doesn&#8217;t add\n\tit. The ability to return fire is situationally useful, but it also unloads\n\tyour crossbow so that you can&#8217;t take your prepared action shot unless you&#8217;re\n\tusing a repeating crossbow or have Rapid Reload.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Deadshot<\/span> (Ex): Finally. This is a\n\tsmall damage boost for Deadshot. Crossbow damage still isn&#8217;t great, but every\n\tlittle bit helps. By this point your Dexterity should be fairly impressive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Safe Shot<\/span> (Ex): Saves you the trouble of\n\ttaking Point Blank Master.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pinpoint Targeting<\/span>: Pinpoint Targeting is\n\ta tempting feat, especially against high AC enemies. Armor, Natural Armor, and\n\tShields are the sorts of bonuses which a typical tank relies on, and this will\n\tlet you get past their AC. However, it prevents you from using things like\n\tVital Strike, which might mean you sacrifice damage for reliability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Meteor Shot<\/span> (Ex):\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Bull Rush<\/span> or\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Trip<\/span> with a ranged attack. Neither help you\n\tmuch, but they might help your allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Penetrating Shot<\/span> (Ex): I certainly hope\n\tyou took Improved Critical. This makes critical hits with crossbows really\n\texciting, but it&#8217;s fairly difficult to set up, and it&#8217;s certainly not reliable\n\tuntil you get Weapon Mastery.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): With 19-20&#215;3 crit,\n\tyour critical hits won&#8217;t be spectacularly often, but they will be better than\n\twith a bow. Combined with Penetrating Shot, this might see a fair bit of\n\taction.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/crossbowman\">Crossbowman Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Gladiator<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dragoon\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/dragoon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragoon<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another attempt at a mounted charger archetype. The Dragoon is really bad past a level 1 class dip. The extra Weapon Training damage with spears is nice, but none of the other class abilities are particularly useful or interesting. If you want a mounted character, Cavalier is a much better option, or the Mounted Fury Barbarian archetype or the Horse Lord Ranger archetype. Basically anything but this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: You won&#8217;t\n\tneed Tower Shields.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skilled Rider<\/span> (Ex): Two bonus feats that\n\tyou&#8217;re going to want anyway.

Even then, it&#8217;s\n\tprobably not worth it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: Crits with lances are\n\tinfrequent and lackluster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bonus Feats (1st), Armor Training (2, 3, 4) Tower Shield Proficiency, Weapon Training<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"free-hand-fighter\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/free-hand-fighter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Hand Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Free Hand Fighters give up the sheer power of using both of your hands at once for the excitement of having one of your hands empty and useless.

One of the Fighter&#8217;s biggest problems is that it tends to be pigeon-holed into one trick in combat because Fighters typically need to specialize in order to be effective at their one trick. This means that the Fighter shines when his trick works (&#8220;Killing Stuff&#8221; is a good trick in a game like Pathfinder), but is completely useless when his trick doesn&#8217;t apply. The Martial Master addresses this issue by allowing the Fighter to gain some new Feats on the fly, allowing some small amount of ability to adapt the Fighter&#8217;s abilities to whatever challenges present themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want another Fighter Archetype, you would be a fool not to take\n\tthis.

You get 3 + 1\/2 level\n\tuses per day, and the duration is only one minute, but that&#8217;s likely 3 + 1\/2\n\tlevel fights per day if you do things right. Remember that selecting more than\n\tone Feat uses one daily use per Feat selected, so don&#8217;t feel inclined to\n\tselect more Feats than you actually want.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>5th level<\/strong>: One feat as a Move action. It&#8217;s not much, but\n\t\tit adds a bit of versatility. You could take Toughness for some extra hit\n\t\tpoints, or Iron Will to boost your low Will saves when fighting a\n\t\tspellcaster, or you could take Exotic Weapon Proficiency with a weapon that\n\t\tworks particularly well in the current situation.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>9th level<\/strong>: Now you can get two Feats, which really gives\n\t\tyou some options. You can select one Feat as a Swift Action, but remember\n\t\tthat if you use Martial Flexibility you lose all of your previous Feat\n\t\tchoices. If you need both Feats, you&#8217;ll have to spend a Move Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>14th level<\/strong>: Three Feats gives you a ton of options, and\n\t\tyou can use a Free\/Swift\/Move Action to get different numbers of feats,\n\t\twhich gives you a whole lot of options.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>17th level<\/strong>: Selecting one feat as an immediate action\n\t\tseems odd, but you could select Toughness to keep yourself alive, or a feat\n\t\tto boost a save that you&#8217;re probably going to fail. Three feats as a swift\n\t\taction is the real draw. Rearrange your whole combat strategy at a moments\n\t\tnotice.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>20th level<\/strong>: Get all of your Feats as a Swift Action. Tons\n\t\tof options, and you can switch very easily.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mutation Warrior<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-fighter\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/mobile-fighter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mobile Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mobile Fighter fixes the issue of movement for fighters, who typically have to stand in place and make full attacks. By using your feats, you can get away with a wide range of fighting styles. Make sure to take traits to get Acrobatics as a class skill, and take the Dodge and Mobility feats so that you can move around the battlefield safely. However, since you are moving around more, you sacrifice much of your ability to defend the party by standing in front of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Agility<\/span> (Ex): Situational.

The 10\n\tminutes\/level duration is annoying for Fighters who can usually spend all day\n\tfighting as long as their hit points stick around, but since most of your\n\tparty members will likely also need to take breaks between encounters you\n\tshould have time to prepare additional mutagens periodically throughout the\n\tday.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mutagen Discovery<\/span> (Su): Discoveries are a\n\tfantastic way to supplement your Mutagen, but you only get 4 (7, 11, 15, 19),\n\tso choose wisely. Because of the timing of the Discoveries, you will have\n\ttrouble getting Greater\/Grand Mutagen at their earliest possible levels (12\n\tand 16, respectively), so you may want to take Extra Discovery to get them\n\tearly.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">feral mutagen<\/span>: Unless you are building\n\t\tspecifically to use natural weapons, you will be better with something\n\t\tmanufactured.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">grand mutagen<\/span>: Linear improvement to your\n\t\tMutagen.

Reach weapons are already great for area control, and Pole Fighting prevents enemies from getting inside their reach. The whole of the archetype works well together, and synergizes well with obvious feat choices like Step Up and Combat Reflexes. However, the archetype doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of damage output, which can make your opportunity attacks somewhat lackluster unless you devote other resources to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to play a polearm master, read my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/area_control_defender\">Area Control Defender Handbook<\/a>\n\tfor general advice on the tactics that make polearm users so effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pole Fighting<\/span> (Ex): Doing this is as an\n\timmediate action is nice. You can take an attack opportunity as someone enters\n\tyour reach, shorten your grip as an immediate action, then take more attacks\n\tof opportunity as they attempt to move past you. However, using armor spikes\n\tmakes this ability redundant since you can continue to threaten the are inside\n\tyour polearm reach without taking your hands off of your polearm.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Steadfast Pike<\/span> (Ex): A bonus to attacks of\n\topportunity and readied attacks really addresses the purpose of the archetype:\n\tStand between the bad guys and your friends, and kill anyone who tries to get\n\tpast you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Polearm Training<\/span> (Ex): Weapon training with\n\tthe Polearm weapon group.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flexible Flanker<\/span> (Ex): Not terribly\n\timportant for you, but your rogues will be very happy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sweeping Fend<\/span> (Ex): Bull rush is\n\tsituational, and if you want to trip you have plenty of options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Step Aside<\/span> (Ex): Basically the opposite of\n\tStep Up, this ensures that you can always keep enemies in your weapon reach,\n\tbut out of theirs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Polearm Parry<\/span> (Ex): Nice for protecting\n\tyour allies, but not particularly exciting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Critical hits aren&#8217;t\n\ta priority, but this never hurts to have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Bravery, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"roughrider\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/roughrider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roughrider<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roughrider archetype is a weird idea. It&#8217;s a mounted character concept, but it doesn&#8217;t get a mount ability like cavaliers or paladins. You can armor your mount much better than other classes, which seems like it would make the roughrider a good tank. However, the archetype&#8217;s abilities don&#8217;t really lend anything to sitting in place on a horse, or to the normal Spirited Charge strategy. In addition, the extra cost of arming and armoring your horse enough to be relevant is hugely expensive. Overall, the roughrider is a good concept, and the abilities are great individually, but the archetype itself doesn&#8217;t quite work. If you really want a mounted character, play a Cavalier. Still better than the dragoon though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Steadfast Mount<\/span> (Ex): Since you don&#8217;t get\n\tan actual mount ability, it&#8217;s important to keep your mount alive. This ability\n\thelps with that somewhat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armored Charger<\/span> (Ex): Protecting yourself\n\tand your mount is a crucial part of fighting while mounted, but armor check\n\tpenalties add up quickly. Removing the armor check penalty not only makes it\n\teasier for you to ride, but it increases your bonus for mounted combat, which\n\tmakes you better able to protect your mount. Allowing your mount to wear\n\tmedium barding without losing speed is also a great benefit, but your horse\n\tlikely isn&#8217;t proficient with medium armor, so you need to maker a concious\n\ttrade between defense or offense. At low levels, a warhorse&#8217;s attacks are\n\tbrutally effective. At higher levels, you&#8217;re going to want that armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mounted Mettle<\/span> (Ex): Weapon training bonuses\n\tfor you and your mount as long as you&#8217;re mounted or adjacent to your mount,\n\twhich should be all of the time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Leap from the Saddle<\/span> (Ex): This is a weird\n\tability. It&#8217;s basically pounce, which is fantastic, but it removes you from\n\tthe saddle. Since you&#8217;re no longer mounted, you don&#8217;t get to do bonus damage\n\twith lances or with Spirited Charge. It also works on your mount&#8217;s single move\n\tinstead of a charge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless Steed<\/span> (Ex): Full plate barding\n\twithout losing speed, and you can reroll a ride check once per day. Save that\n\treroll for Mounted Combat on those rare occasions when your horse&#8217;s full plate\n\tisn&#8217;t cutting it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ride Them Down<\/span> (Ex): If your mount is\n\tbetter at doing damage than you (it shouldn&#8217;t be), this is a great ability.\n\tOverrun is a good combat maneuver to get through mobs of enemies, and Trample\n\tlets you do some damage as you go by, but this shouldn&#8217;t be your go-to combat\n\toption. You&#8217;re likely better off using Spirited Charge to lance things to\n\tdeath.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unavoidable Onslaught<\/span> (Ex): Charge lanes\n\tare critical to mounted characters, especially once you get Spirited Charge.\n\tThis lets you freely charge through your allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Indomitable Steed<\/span> (Ex): DR 5\/- is amazing at\n\tany level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Bravery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"savage-warrior\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/savage-warrior\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Savage Warior<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your race has natural weapons and you want to play a fighter, this archetype has some nice tricks to offer. However, it gives up armor training and a lot of durability in exchange for reliable charges. Since most fighters prefer full attacking over charging, this class also doesn&#8217;t offer anything exciting offensively either. If you want to use natural attacks, Barbarian is likely a better choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spark of Life<\/span> (Ex): I would take this over\n\tbravery any day of the week.

If you&#8217;re using Power Attack (and\n\tyou should be), this can be a pretty good way to start a combat. However, you\n\tdon&#8217;t have the Barbarian&#8217;s hit points to fall back on when you drop your AC,\n\tso don&#8217;t plan to spend all of your time charging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Careful Claw<\/span> (Ex): There aren&#8217;t a lot of\n\tenemies which this ability will cover.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Savage Charge<\/span> (Ex): Now that you&#8217;re\n\tdropping your AC proportionately less, charging becomes less risky for you.\n\tAllowing you to charge through your allies also makes charging much easier in\n\tcrowded combats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Natural Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Natural\n\tweapons typically have 20\/x2 critical threat, and bumping it to 20\/x3 isn&#8217;t\n\tgoing to be very exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bravery, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mutation Warrior<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"shielded-fighter\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/shielded-fighter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shielded Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shielded fighters play to the modern interpretation of the classic sword-and-board fighter, which is essentially &#8220;board-and-board&#8221;. Dual-wielding spiked light shields or madus is likely your best bet to capitalize on Shield Fighter and Shield Master. With some decent feat choices, you can really fill the fighter&#8217;s key role as Tank and still have some reasonable damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Active<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Defense<\/span> (Ex): Dodge bonuses to AC are great,\n\tbut they don&#8217;t apply when you&#8217;re flat-footed and you don&#8217;t have a way to get\n\tUncanny Dodge. In addition, you need to be Fighting Defensively, using Combat\n\tExpertise, or using Full Defense to get the benefit. Your AC will be great as\n\tlong as you&#8217;re not flat-footed, but you&#8217;ll be giving up potentially crucial\n\tattack bonus. If you spend a feat to gain exotic weapon proficiency with the\n\tmadu, this moves up into green territory. A -2 to attack for a +2 to AC is a\n\tgood trade for fighting defensively, and reducing the Combat Expertise penalty\n\tby 1 is pretty good too. Being able to use both at once can make you\n\tspectacularly durable. Spending a swift action to extend this bonus to your\n\tallies is occasionally nice, but shouldn&#8217;t be a frequent decision.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Fighter<\/span> (Ex): Weapon training with\n\tshields. The portion of the wording which mentions freely alternating between\n\tyour weapon and your shield on attacks is a trap: your shield <em>is<\/em> your\n\tweapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Shield<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Buffet<\/span> (Ex): The initial version of this\n\tability is totally useless. A move action to apply modest penalties to\n\tfighting <em>only you<\/em> is a waste of time when you could be full attacking\n\tand making 4 attacks. The 13th level version allows you to do this as a swift\n\taction, which is considerably better in one-on-one fights. Fighters have very\n\tfew uses for a swift action, and this functionally gives you a +2 to attacks\n\tand a +2 to AC against one target. Keep in mind that Active Defense also\n\trequires a swift action to protect your allies, so you can&#8217;t use both at\n\tonce.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Guard<\/span> (Ex): This makes flanking you\n\tvery difficult. Most enemies won&#8217;t need flanking to be scary, but this can be\n\tgreat if you fight a lot of rogues. Keep in mind that you should never be\n\tusing a tower shield because you can&#8217;t shield bash with it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield Mastery<\/span> (Ex): DR 5\/- is great, and\n\tyou basically don&#8217;t exist without a shield.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Ward<\/span> (Ex): This is a really\n\tlackluster capstone.

However, this makes you dependent on all 6\n\tability scores, which is a recipe for disaster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Skill focus isn&#8217;t really\n\timportant, but adding Teamwork feats to your feat options is fairly useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tactical Awareness<\/span> (Ex): Inititiative\n\tbonuses are always nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tactician<\/span> (Ex): Tactician is a cool way to\n\ttake advantage of a teamwork feat.

In theory, you could do this so many times that the friction of your repeated motion causes the atmosphere to combust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, the Thunderstriker&#8217;s key mechanic is to shield bash with\n\ta buckler, then use a free action to use their primary weapon two-handed, then\n\treturn to holding their weapon one handed in order to use their buckler as a\n\tshield. While this may seem like a fairly abusive tactic, it is technically\n\tallowed by the rules as written, and the Thunderstriker seems to actively\n\tembrace it. This makes the Thunderstriker a perplexing fusion of two-handed\n\tand two-weapon fighting styles.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Strapped Shield<\/span> (Ex): Removes the -1\n\tpenalty for using a buckler while weilding a weapon two-handed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hardbuckler<\/span> (Ex): This gives away how the\n\tclass should actually be played.

Shield Master specifies the\n\tbonus to work &#8220;as if it was an enhancement bonus&#8221;, but Knockback Smash makes\n\tno such statement, so its bonus is typeless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hammer and Anvil<\/span> (Ex): Effectively a +1 to\n\tattacking while using two-weapon fighting. Nice, but not particularly\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Buckler Defense<\/span> (Ex): This is essentially the\n\tTwo-Weapon Shield feat, which is awful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Balanced Bashing<\/span> (Ex): Another +2 to\n\tattacks. Wee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Buckler Defense<\/span> (Ex): This allows\n\tyou to keep your shield bonus to ac from your buckler while still using your\n\tweapon two-handed. This really only matters for attacks of opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Bravery, Weapon Training (1, 2)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Gladiator<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tower-shield-specialist\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/tower-shield-specialist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tower Shield Specialist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with the tower shield specialist is that it doesn&#8217;t actually do anything. You are very good at turtling behind your shield, but you don&#8217;t have any offensive abilities, and you give up Weapon Training. Your AC is going to be stellar, but since you don&#8217;t do any damage, no one is going to try to kill you. If everyone is ignoring you, you&#8217;re not much of a tank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Burst Barrier<\/span> (Ex): AOE effects are far\n\tmore common than fear effects, so this will see a lot of use. Plus, it adds\n\tsome value to a Ring of Evasion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tower Shield Training<\/span> (Ex): The wording\n\tonly mentions the maximum dexterity bonus on armor. I would reasonably assume\n\tthat this also applies to the tower shield max dex, but check with your DM to\n\tbe sure. Assuming your DM is a reasonable person, this means that the max\n\tdexterity on a tower shield goes up to +4, and scales with level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tower Shield Specialist<\/span> (Ex): Removes that\n\tpesky -2 attack penalty from your shield.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tower Shield Defense<\/span> (Ex): Your tower\n\tshield gives you a +4 bonus when it&#8217;s a non-magical piece of wood. As you\n\tenhance it, this gets progressively better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Immediate Repositioning<\/span> (Ex): You can&#8217;t\n\tuse it to interrupt an attack, but you can use it to interrupt blast effects,\n\tgiving you total cover.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tower Shield Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Evasion at\n\tlevel 16 isn&#8217;t great since you probably should have evasion on a ring by then.\n\tImproved Evasion at 20 is nice, but not very exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bravery, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mutation Warrior<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"two-handed-fighter\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/two-handed-fighter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Two-Handed Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-handed fighters give up all pretence of being a tank in favor of hitting things with a really big weapon. Their strategy is conceptually simple: Power Attack this thing until it dies, then find something else to kill. The abilities are almost purely numerical bonuses, so the Two-Handed Fighter is essentially just a very scary ball of numbers. Many players may find this boring due to the lack of mechanical complexity, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with this archetype&#8217;s sheer damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shattering Strike<\/span> (Ex): If you like to\n\tsunder things, this is nice. However, when you&#8217;re sundering you&#8217;re not killing\n\tsomeone. And you should always be killing someone.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Overhand Chop<\/span> (Ex): Your strength bonus\n\tshould be huge (20 at first level is a good starting point), so this makes\n\tyour charges and single attacks a bit more powerful. At third level you only\n\thave one attack, so this applies to all of your attacks (unless you use\n\tCleave) until you hit level 6.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Training<\/span> (Ex): It works just like\n\tthe normal class feature, but you have to use two-handed weapons. So basically\n\tit&#8217;s just the normal fighter class feature.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Backswing<\/span> (Ex): 6th level is a little lonely\n\twithout Backswing, but now you get to add double your strength on all of your\n\tattacks. Buff your strength and get swinging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Piledriver<\/span> (Ex): Since you likely don&#8217;t\n\thave Combat Expertise, this is a good way for you to trip things. However, you\n\tdon&#8217;t get a whole lot for doing it. You can also bull rush, which can prevent\n\tthe enemy from full attacking.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Power Attack<\/span> (Ex): Even with absurd\n\tstrength, Power Attack is a huge chunk of your damage output. This makes it\n\teven better. When you get this ability, it nets +4 damage. At level 16, it\n\tnets +5.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Devastating Blow<\/span> (Ex): This ability is\n\tabsolutely phenomenal. I never thought I would ever want to use a scythe until\n\tI saw this. With the fighter&#8217;s impressive attack bonus, you can generally\n\texpect to confirm the crit. So basically, you take a -5 to your attack rolls,\n\tand most likely do x4 damage. Then at level 20 you get Weapon Mastery and\n\tauto-confirm crits with the selected weapon. So you take -5 to\n\t<em>definitely<\/em> deal x4 damage. With your insane strength and Power\n\tAttack, that is a truly scary chunk of numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Bravery, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"two-weapon-warrior\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/two-weapon-warrior\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Two-Weapon Warrior<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-weapon fighting is often left to Rogues, and for good reason. The TWF Fighter depends very heavily on full attacking, and lacks built-in options to get him into place to full attack. The Two-Weapon Warrior adds abilities which allow the Fighter to make additional attacks after moving, dramatically improving the Fighter&#8217;s mobility. With the Fighter&#8217;s excellent attack bonuses and respectable damage, this can turn the Two-Weapon Warrior into an excellent Striker. However, you lack abilities which make you a good Defender, so your effectiveness depends heavily on your feat selection and your party&#8217;s composition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defensive Flurry<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s a bit cruel\n\tthat this isn&#8217;t just a normal dodge bonus to AC when you full attack. Still,\n\tmost attacks against you will be melee attacks, and you will (hopefully) be\n\tfull attacking most of the time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Twin Blades<\/span> (Ex): Basically weapon\n\ttraining when you full attack. It&#8217;s unfortunate that it doesn&#8217;t apply to\n\tattacks of opportunity, charges, or Doublestrike, but it works when you need\n\tit most.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Doublestrike<\/span> (Ex): This slightly alleviates\n\tyour issue with movement, but still limits you to a single move. You don&#8217;t get\n\tthe attack and damage bonus from Twin Blades, so try to full attack as much as\n\tpossible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Balance<\/span> (Ex): If you&#8217;re using a\n\tlight weapon in your off hand, this is a +1 to your attacks. If you choose to\n\tuse two one-handed weapons (excluding Sawtooth Sabres) this is a +2 to both of\n\tyour attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Equal Opportunity<\/span> (Ex): You effectively get\n\ttwo attacks on an attack of opportunity, which is absolutely fantastic. This\n\tis also your only Defender ability, so be sure to capitalize on this as much\n\tas possible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perfect Balance<\/span> (Ex): If you&#8217;re using a\n\tlight weapon in your off hand or using a double weapon, you no longer have\n\ttwo-weapon fighting penalties. If you&#8217;re using a one-handed weapon in your off\n\thand, you don&#8217;t get anything new.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deft Doublestrike<\/span> (Ex): A free disarm,\n\tsunder, or trip attempt is nice, but you&#8217;re probably not built for it. At this\n\tlevel, your chances of success with trip or disarm aren&#8217;t great unless you&#8217;re\n\talready built for it, and sunder isn&#8217;t useful often enough to matter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deadly Defense<\/span> (Ex): I hope you brought\n\tcombat expertise. To capitalize on this, you may actually want to drop your\n\tAC, but dropping your AC may make you worse as a Defender. It&#8217;s a weird\n\ttrade-off, and it&#8217;s difficult to introduce this late in the game because of\n\tits implications for your build and tactics.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/two_weapon_warrior\">Two-Weapon Warrior Fighter Handbook<\/a>\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Gladiator<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"unarmed-fighter\"><a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/unarmed-fighter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unarmed Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the fighter trying to be a Monk. In 3.5, this was actually the best way to be a Monk since the Monk class was fairly horrible. Now, the Unarmed Fighter is a master of grappling, and gets to use the Dirty Trick maneuver for free several times at high levels. They don&#8217;t grapple quite as well at the Tetori Monk, but they&#8217;re a very interesting character concept, and a great way to abuse the Dirty Trick maneuver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Monk weapons\n\tare weird and unique, but they do have a good selection of weapons which give\n\tbonuses to combat maneuvers, including Grapple. Giving up all but light armor\n\tis dissappointing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unarmed Style<\/span>: Unarmed strike is basically a\n\tgiven, but the free style feat is fantastic since &#8220;he unarmed fighter need not\n\tmeet all the prerequisites of the style feat he chooses&#8221;. This means you can\n\ttake the capstone feat for a monk style and skip the garbage pre-requisite\n\tfeats. Keep in mind that some of the style feats rely on the abilities\n\tprovided by earlier abilities, so take care to select a feat which will\n\tfunction.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Harsh Training<\/span> (Ex): Bonus to saves\n\tagainst a very rare set of things.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tough Guy<\/span> (Ex): The DR against non-lethal\n\tdamage is irrelevant, but the DR against grapple damage is pretty\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Training<\/span> (Ex): Weapon training with\n\tmonk weapon and natural weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clever Wrestler<\/span> (Ex): You can continue to be\n\ta meaningful presence on the battlefield while grappled, which means you can\n\tboth pin one target and continue to take attacks of opportunity and tank for\n\tthe party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trick Throw<\/span> (Ex): Dirty Trick can apply some\n\tvery nasty status effects (such as entangled, which lowers their CMD\n\tconsiderably), so taking the time to trip people is worth the effort to throw\n\tthis ability around. Plus, if they&#8217;re entangled they can&#8217;t stand back up.\n\tEnjoy that +4 to attacks on prone targets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Takedown<\/span> (Ex): Drag them, then trip them,\n\tthen hit them with a dirty trick. At higher level, Grapple them, then trip\n\tthem, then hit them with a dirty trick. This requires a lot of combat maneuver\n\tfeats to use, but having lots of feats is sort of your thing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eye Gouge<\/span> (Ex): Conveniently, you begin your\n\tturn grappled even if you started the grapple. A swift action to apply the\n\tbest Dirty Trick status effect is pretty fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sucker Punch<\/span> (Ex): More free dirty\n\ttricks!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sheer Toughness<\/span> (Ex): Immunity to fatigue,\n\texhaustion, and subdual damage won&#8217;t see a lot of use, especially at this\n\tlevel. Immunity to staggered is considerably better, but still situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): crits with unarmed\n\tstrikes are pretty boring. And you can&#8217;t crit while grappling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Mastery, Armor Training (1, 2, 3, 4), Bonus Feat (1st), Bravery, Weapon and Armor Proficiencies, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"unbreakable\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/unbreakable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unbreakable<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unbreakable Fighters are very good at saving throws and resisting mind-affecting effects. While these abilities are tempting, the archetype doesn&#8217;t offer any offensive abilities or area control abilities. You&#8217;re very good at soaking spell effects, but since there isn&#8217;t anything to make you scary, your enemies may just ignore you in favor of targets who are doing something more exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: You were&#8217;t\n\tgoing to use a tower shield anyway.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tough as Nails<\/span>: Endurance is fairly\n\tuseless, but Diehard is passable, and you get two feats for the price of 1.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unflinching<\/span> (Ex): Mind-affecting effects\n\tmake up most will save effects, so this will get a lot of mileage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heroic Recovery<\/span> (Ex): You can use Heroic\n\tRecovery to recover from poison or disease or a number of other effects.\n\tOccasionally useful<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heroic Defiance<\/span> (Ex): You can delay the\n\teffects of status effects for one round. This would be cool to delay the\n\teffects of Flesh to Stone or Hold Person, but it&#8217;s not going to see a lot of\n\tuse on anything really important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Recovery<\/span> (Ex): When are you ever\n\tfatigued?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stalwart<\/span> (Ex): Evasion for both Fortitude\n\t<em>and<\/em> will saves. This makes you considerably more durable, and with\n\tsome feats and a ring of evasuion you can become practically immune to spells\n\tand spell-like abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Unlimited Endurance<\/span> (Ex): When are you ever\n\texhausted? The most common way for you to become exhausted is from a spell,\n\tand now you have Stalwart.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Miraculous Recovery<\/span> (Ex): At high levels,\n\tpoison becomes more common on many monsters. This allows you to better resist\n\tthose effects, and help withs stuff that Stalwart doesn&#8217;t cover.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unbreakable Mind<\/span> (Ex): Wow. Wholly immune to\n\talmost all will saves. This makes Unflinching totally irrelevant, but I don&#8217;t\n\tthink anyone minds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Training (1, 2), Bonus Feat (1st), Bravery, Weapon Mastery, Weapon Training (1, 2, 3, 4)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"weapon-master\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/fighter\/archetypes\/paizo-fighter-archetypes\/weapon-master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weapon Master<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This archetype does very little to focus on using a single weapon. It has a couple of abilities which make you very marginally better at critical hits, but they don&#8217;t come until very high level. Vanilla fighter is strictly better in every way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Guard<\/span> (Ex): Not a lot of enemies\n\tare going to use disarm or sunder against you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Training<\/span> (Ex): Weapon training with\n\tonly one weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Reliable Strike<\/span> (Ex): Rerolling one roll\n\twith your weapon is pretty nice, but it&#8217;s not game changing, and the uses are\n\tvery limited.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Mirror Move<\/span> (Ex): The odds of enemies using\n\tyour chosen weapon are laughable, especially if you use an interesting\n\tweapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deadly Critical<\/span> (Ex): I don&#8217;t understand why\n\tthis isn&#8217;t just a static bonus. As it stands, this is absolutely awful. It&#8217;s\n\tnot meaningful enough to make you focus on critical hits, and it&#8217;s not\n\tfrequent enough to be helpful if you don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Critical Specialist<\/span> (Ex): Suddenly you need\n\tto be good at critical hits. The +4 DC is pretty great, but very little in the\n\tarchetype has led up to this ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unstoppable Strike<\/span> (Ex): Making your attack\n\ta touch attack essentially makes it unstoppable at this level. Ignoring DR is\n\tabsolutely brutal. However, you give up full attacks to use it, so to do\n\tmeaningful damage you need to find ways to add a ton of damage to single\n\tattacks.
