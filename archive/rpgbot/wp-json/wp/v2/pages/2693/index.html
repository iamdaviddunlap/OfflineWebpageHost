Historically, this\n\trole has been considered on of the primary functions of clerics, a tragic\n\tstereotype that clerics have been railing against since at least 2nd edition\n\tAD&amp;D.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In this competition (for lack of a better word) we&#8217;ll be examining available\n\tclasses and subclasses to assess them for their ability to heal their party\n\tmembers in order to judge which class makes the best Healbot.

While their healing options aren&#8217;t as good as the Cleric&#8217;s, College of Lore offers access to spells outside of the Bard&#8217;s spell list which may make up the difference.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-life\">Cleric (Life Domain)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>So iconic that it&#8217;s in the SRD, the Life Domain Cleric is the iconic healbot,\n\tand they&#8217;re favored to win across the board.
