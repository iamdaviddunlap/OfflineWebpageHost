We see this archetype everywhere: in stories, in movies, in video games, and in DnD 5e as the Beast Master Ranger. This subclass has a troubled past as, on release, it was practically unusable. Requiring your action every turn to perform the basic function of your identity is a crippling design decision, and it took WotC a long time to do something about that. Fortunately, they finally did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Primal Companion \u201coptional\u201d feature is essentially a complete replacement of the mechanics of the subclass that fixes the entire problem.

Unlike summoned pets which\n\t\tother classes might use (Dancing Item, Wildfire Spirit, etc.), your pet\n\t\tsticks around all the time. You don&#8217;t need to summon it or whatever.\n\t\tHowever, like any other member of your party it needs food, healing,\n\t\tetc.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exceptional Training<\/span>: Making your\n\t\tcompanion&#8217;s attacks magical is the only thing you actually benefit from\n\t\there, but it&#8217;s crucial. Resistance to non-magic weapon attacks is common and\n\t\tbecomes more common as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestial Fury<\/span>: Your beast gets two attacks\n\t\tand it still only costs you a Bonus Action (or half of an Attack action) to command them.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Share Spells<\/span>: This is a fantastic way to\n\t\tshare buff spells, especially those which require Concentration.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master-primal-companion\">Primal Companion Options<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything presents a replacement mechanic for the Beast Master&#8217;s Companion feature. Rather than selecting an animal with a published stat block, you pick from one of three generic beasts and you can describe it however you like. If you want a sabretooth tiger, a dinosaur, a komodo dragon, or just a dog, you&#8217;re using the same stat block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More important than simplifying the challenges of picking a companion, the\n\tnew Companion feature also corrects the action economy issues which were the\n\tfundamental problem which made the Beast Master such a poor option. Commanding\n\tyour companion is now done as a Bonus Action, allowing you to do interesting\n\tthings on your turn like attacking or casting spells without leaving your pet\n\tto stand adjacent to your enemies and Dodge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raising your companion from the dead now takes a spell slot (so long as you\n\tdo so within an hour of its death), allowing you throw your companion into\n\tcombat with little regard for its safey confident in the knowledge that you\n\tcan bring it right back to life good as new. Obviously that&#8217;s a horrible way\n\tto treat an animal that you&#8217;re supposed to be emotionally bonded with, but\n\tthis is a game, your companion is a class feature, and as a DM I wouldn&#8217;t make\n\ta fighter spend 8 hours feeding a wild longsword table scraps until they were\n\tfriends, so no one should hold rangers to the same standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing your companion is also much easier now. If you suddenly find\n\tyourself on a boat trip and want a suitable aquatic companion, you can change\n\tyour companion after a Long Rest. This may be hard for players who want to\n\tbond with a single animal, but you might choose to think of your ranger as\n\tmaster of <em>all<\/em> beasts rather than a master of just one beast that you\n\tdrag around everywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only shortcoming of the Primal Companion feature is the limited set of\n\tcompanion choices. None of them appear to work as mounts (though your DM might\n\tstill allow it), and no matter how you dress up the stats any two beast\n\tmasters are going to feel very similar to one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Beast of the Land<\/span>: Simple and iconic.\n\t\tWith 40 ft. land and climb speed, this thing can get around very quickly.\n\t\tThe damage will match or exceed a weapon, and Charge allows your companion\n\t\tto knock foes prone if they can get a running start. Unfortunately, since\n\t\tyour beast only gets one attack until you get Bestial Fury at level 11, it\n\t\tcan&#8217;t capitalize on knocking enemies prone on its own for half of the level\n\t\trange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beast of the Sea<\/span>: Only viable in aquatic\n\t\tcampaigns. 5-foot land speed is not enough for your sharktopus to hobble\n\t\taround on land and be effective in combat. If you can somehow get its speed\n\t\tup to reasonable amount (look for spells like Longstrider with long\n\t\tdurations which don&#8217;t require Concentration), you may be able to make this\n\t\twork on land. If you can do it, the Beast of the Sea&#8217;s attacks grapple when\n\t\tthey hit, which is a powerful option not normally available to players.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast of the Sky<\/span>: 60-foot fly speed and\n\t\tFlyby. Less hit points than the other options, but with the ability to\n\t\tremain perpetually out of melee reach that&#8217;s less of a problem. The damage\n\t\tis also slightly lower than Beast of the Land, but Beast of the Land deals\n\t\t6.5+PB on average and the Beast of the Sky&#8217;s 5.5+PB isn&#8217;t noticably lower.\n\t\tHaving a flying companion discourages you from using your companion as a\n\t\tDefender by interposing itself between you and your enemies, but Beast of\n\t\tthe Sky&#8217;s AC is just as good as the other options and if your companion&#8217;s\n\t\thit points are looking problematic it can use Flyby to withdraw to\n\t\tsafety.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master-ability-scores\">Beast Master Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No change from any other Ranger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Powers our attacks and a skill.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Con<\/span>: Everything likes more Con.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Powers our spells, our Primal Companion, and the rest of our skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Standard Array<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master-races\">Beast Master Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from other Rangers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master-feats\">Beast Master Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different from other Rangers.

Really quick, I\u2019m going to call out that, thanks to the TWF fighting style, either dropping one attack for the Attack command or dropping your bonus action to command are completely identical unless you have different swords (i.e. one is magical).<br><br>Please trust me and the 15 minutes I spent doing math when I say that, even with Hunter\u2019s Mark running, in every case except a turn where you have your cat attack without getting to Pounce, it\u2019s either a wash or slightly in the favor of swinging the cat. With Mark running, and advantage, and no Pounce, attacking alone comes out 10% ahead. But that doesn\u2019t take into account the turn or spell slot setting up Hunter\u2019s Mark, and fights last an average of 3 turns, so that\u2019s actually only 6.67% ahead, which probably isn\u2019t worth keeping the spell known.<br><br>That lets us pick up Pass Without Trace, probably the single best spell on the Ranger list. We also grab Lesser Restoration in case the healer gets paralyzed.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Deft Explorer (Roving)<br><br>Favored Foe (damage increase)<\/td><td>Roving is a neat ability but, since we\u2019re a melee character, it\u2019s not going to see a lot of combat use. Still, it means you\u2019re rarely going to be stopped by terrain and can clamber up to places and drop a rope down.<br><br>Favored Foe\u2019s damage goes up to match Hunter\u2019s Mark, which is nice if we find ourselves in a fight where we can\u2019t use our cat for some reason. Perhaps it\u2019s been transformed into a tiny statue a la <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=L7KI-i20v4g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Smash Brothers<\/a>, or perhaps it\u2019s just incapacitated or lost somewhere.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Exceptional Training<br><br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Darkvision<\/td><td>Practically a dead level thanks to the Primal Companion changes, but at least its damage is magical now. This may swing the calculation in the cat\u2019s favor if you only have one (or heavens forbid, none) magical weapons. Even the joy of picking up a new spell is somewhat squashed by it being utility to help our friends see in the dark.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase (Dex 18 -&gt; 20)<br><br>Land\u2019s Stride<\/td><td>Land\u2019s Stride is almost a ribbon with how few things are going to try to stop you with damaging natural terrain.<br><br>Is it table time again? It sure is. Dex goes up and Wisdom doesn\u2019t, meaning our Companion has an even lower bonus to hit than the scaling says it should. Pounce once again keeps things pretty even anyway.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>New Spell known:<br>&#8211; Water Breathing<\/td><td>Why not put that swim speed to some use by also being able to breathe water for a whole day?<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Deft Explorer (Tireless)<br><br>Hide in Plain Sight<\/td><td>Tireless\u2019s ability to grant yourself temp hp is one of the rare ones that doesn\u2019t list a duration which means it lasts until you take a long rest. What this means is that you should do it once when you wake up in the morning and again at the end of every fight for as long as you have uses left. Other than that, it\u2019s not really worth using. The other half of the ability though is amazing if you\u2019re not being allowed to sleep normally.<br><br>Not nearly as good as the ability of the same name from 3.5, Hide in Plain Sight is still yet another +10 to stealth we can stack on top of Pass Without Trace.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Bestial Fury<br><br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Speak with Plants<\/td><td>We can now stop checking DPR forever because the additional attack from Bestial Fury means that swinging the cat wins in every case, even with its lower attack bonus.&nbsp;Now your Land\u2019s Stride ability is even less useful as you can use a spell slot to simply ask the plants to move out of your whole party\u2019s way.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Fighting Initiate (Blind Fighting)<\/td><td>Did you want yet another way to get advantage? Here you go. Drop Darkness on your scimitar and walk around, confident that hardly anything can see you. Does this make Feral Senses almost completely irrelevant? Yes. But it\u2019s also better enough than Feral Senses to still be worth the feat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Freedom of Movement<\/td><td>Finally, a way to get rid of those penalties for attacking underwater! Now you\u2019re exactly as functional in the ocean as you are on land. Or\u2026 something. One nice benefit is that we get to share the spell with our companion starting next level, so it can join us on our diving expedition.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Favored Foe (Damage Increase)<br><br>Vanish<\/td><td>You might finally think that the die increase is where the Ranger attacking alone might win out in DPR, but no. Because our proficiency bonus has gone up to +5 in the interim (which, as a reminder, the cat uses in its damage calculation), it\u2019s still neatly in the cat\u2019s favor<br><br>Vanish is a neat trick, but we use our bonus action every turn for damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Share Spells<br><br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Guardian of Nature<\/td><td>Or, just turn into a tree. Doubling the value of Guardian of Nature is pretty incredible. For reasons I can\u2019t pretend to understand, your Companion\u2019s attacks are described as melee weapon attacks.These combine to let us cast the Tree version on ourselves and the Primal Beast version on our\u2026 primal beast, letting us take advantage of Elven Accuracy and giving it extra damage per hit. Unfortunately, since it\u2019s a melee weapon attack that uses your spell attack modifier, it doesn\u2019t count as strength-based. But you\u2019re probably flanking with it anyway, so don\u2019t worry too much about it not getting advantage from the spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase (Wis 16 -&gt; 18)<\/td><td>Several skills get better, as does cat damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Conjure Volley<\/td><td>Your DC is nearly capped and will get there in just a few levels, and besides, many things don\u2019t have great Dex saves. Here\u2019s your answer to Area of Effect damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Feral Senses<\/td><td>We are now vaguely aware of anything 15-30 feet away from us which is otherwise invisible.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase (Wis 18 -&gt; 20)<br><br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Tree Stride<\/td><td>Several skills get better again, as does cat damage.Also, you can now walk yourself through trees. Not like we were doing 8 levels ago, but like actually <em>into<\/em> the trees and then out of different trees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Foe Slayer<\/td><td>I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just not going to run the same 8 calculations twice with the two versions of this ability to compare it to cat because, honestly, if playing through 20 levels of Beast Master hasn\u2019t convinced you that putting the cat to good use is more important than maybe eking out a tiny bit more DPR, I don\u2019t think anything will.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction A character and their animal companion acting in almost supernatural unison as a fighting style.
