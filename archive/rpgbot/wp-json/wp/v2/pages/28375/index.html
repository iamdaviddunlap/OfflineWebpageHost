Summon Aberration is great, offering three\n\t\t\t\tvery effective choices to suit your needs.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 5<\/span>: Two excellent utility\n\t\t\t\toptions. Rary&#8217;s Telepathic Bond feels like a weird choice since you get\n\t\t\t\tTelepathic Speech at first level, but Telepathic Speech is extremely\n\t\t\t\tlimited so Rary&#8217;s Telepathic Bond is a big upgrade.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telepathic Speech<\/span>: A useful utility, but\n\t\tvery limited compared to most forms of telepathy. You can communicate, but\n\t\tyou still need to share a language, the duration is short, and you can only\n\t\tconnect to one creature. That&#8217;s enough to send your party&#8217;s Scout off on\n\t\ttheir own with a way to remain in contact, but beyond stealth and subtlety\n\t\tthere are few meaningful ways to use this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Psionic Sorcery<\/span>: This saves you one or\n\t\ttwo Sorcery Points (depending on the spell level) when you spend Sorcery\n\t\tPoints to get extra spell slots with Font of magic, you don&#8217;t need to spend\n\t\tthe Bonus Action to convert Sorcery Points into spell slots, and you also\n\t\tget to cast the spell without verbal or somatic components (and some\n\t\tmaterial components), so you get the benefits of Subtle Spell for free. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re getting a lot of use out of your subclass spells, this is very\n\t\tefficient.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Defenses<\/span>: Psychic damage is rare,\n\t\tbut charm and fear effects are very common.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelation in Flesh<\/span>: For a single Sorcery\n\t\tPoint, every one of these effects is excellent. Replicating any of these is\n\t\tat least a 2nd-level spell, so the effects aren&#8217;t just good, they&#8217;re also\n\t\tcost-efficient. Note that since the fly and swim speeds are based on your\n\t\twalking speed, it&#8217;s easy to boost your new movement speed with buffs like\n\t\tLongstrider or Haste.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Personal note: Tyler finds the term &#8220;writhing sensory tendrils&#8221;\n\t\t\tupsetting.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warping Implosion<\/span>: Great for setting up\n\t\tcombos with Quicken Spell. Follow this with a quickened AOE damage spell\n\t\tlike Meteor Swarm or area control spell like Force Cage and you can\n\t\teliminate whole encounters in one turn even at this high level. The saving\n\t\tthrow is Strength, though, and, with the exceptions of enemies who rely on\n\t\tmagic in combat, many enemies will have high Strength saves.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clockwork\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Clockwork Sorcery<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Where Wild Magic Sorcery is chaos, randomness, rerolls, and wacky fun chaos, Clockwork Sorcery is order, no rerolls, numerical minimums, and straight order and efficiency. It offers tools to solve a variety of problems in orderly fashion, including spell options borrowed from the Cleric and Wizard. However, the Clockwork Soul leans heavily on its spell list, and the other subclass features are often only situationally useful, leaving the player to wait for these features to matter from time to time in between casting spells every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clockwork Spells<\/span>: Several excellent\n\t\tspells, including some cleric options like Aid and wizard options like\n\t\tSummon Construct and Wall of Force. Not everything on the list is a gem, of\n\t\tcourse.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 1<\/span>: Protection from Evil and\n\t\t\t\tGood is a staple buff at any level, covering a wide range of dangerous\n\t\t\t\tcreatures. Alarm is useful as a ritual.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 2<\/span>: Two staple cleric\n\t\t\t\toptions.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3<\/span>: A staple utility option and\n\t\t\t\tan important defensive buff. Not glamorous or flashy, but hard to go\n\t\t\t\twithout.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Freedom of Movement is\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but helpful against enemies which like to grapple.\n\t\t\t\tSummon Construct is a Wizard exclusive, and it&#8217;s a decent summon option\n\t\t\t\tif you need a pet Defender.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5<\/span>: Greater Restoration isn&#8217;t as\n\t\t\t\timportant as Lesser Restoration, but it&#8217;s still very important. The\n\t\t\t\tconditions which it fixes are miserable and in many cases borderline\n\t\t\t\tlethal. Wall of Force (another Wizard exclusive) is one of the best area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol effects around, especially if you have another spellcaster in\n\t\t\t\tthe party who can drop some ongoing area damage before you put your\n\t\t\t\tenemies inside the impenetrable hemisphere.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Restore Balance<\/span>: This solves a lot of\n\t\tproblems. Creatures which have Advantage on saves against specific\n\t\tconditions are common, and a Sorcerer encountering those resistances can\n\t\thinder you a great deal. Similarly, if your allies have Disadvantage on a\n\t\tsave (such as because they are Restrained or Poisoned), you can help protect\n\t\tthem. The usage pool is limited, so save this for when it really\n\t\tmatters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Bastion of Law<\/span>: This is similar in many\n\t\tways to Temporary Hit Points (though you can notably apply this on top of\n\t\tTHP). The duration is great, and allowing the target to choose when to use\n\t\tthe ward allows you to take a little damage when you know that there&#8217;s a\n\t\tShort Rest coming so that you can spend some Hit Point Dice to manage your\n\t\tlimited resources.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Compare this to casting False Life. False Life is a 1st-level spell, so\n\t\t\tyou can spend 2 Sorcery Points to get a spell slot with which to cast\n\t\t\tFalse Life. False Life lasts for grants 2d4+4 (average 9) THP. Each\n\t\t\tadditional spell level adds 5 more THP. For those same 2 Sorcery points,\n\t\t\tyou can give a creature a ward with 2 dice, which will prevent an average\n\t\t\tof 9 damage. Each additional Sorcery Points adds 4.5 more damage\n\t\t\tprotection, compared to 1 or 2 Sorcery Points for 5 more temporary hit\n\t\t\tpoints from False Life. The two are roughly equivalent both in cost and\n\t\t\teffectiveness.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trance of Order<\/span>: The\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\">Fundamental Math<\/a> of DnD 5e\n\t\tassumes that players will succeed on attack rolls against a typical\n\t\tCR-appropriate AC if they roll an 8 or better (provided that your primary\n\t\tability scores hits 16, 18, and 20 at levels 1, 4, and 8), giving players a\n\t\t65% chance of hitting an attack against an average, CR-appropriate enemy.\n\t\tGiving you a minimum guaranteed roll of 10 on attacks, saves, and ability\n\t\tchecks means that you&#8217;re mostly guaranteed to hit with attacks, pass on any\n\t\tsaves in which you&#8217;re proficient and have a decent ability score, and pass\n\t\tany ability checks with skills in which you&#8217;re well-suited. With a 1-minute\n\t\tduration, this is enough to get through one combat or to perform a series of\n\t\tskill checks if you move quickly.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This is a great ability on almost any other class, but on the Sorcerer\n\t\t\tits usefulness is extremely limited. Spells which require attack rolls\n\t\t\t(with the exception of cantrips) mostly vanished around 2nd-level spells\n\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re upcasting low-level spells like Scorching Ray. Sorcerers are\n\t\t\tproficient with Constitution saves so this helps with Concentration, so\n\t\t\tthis helps a lot with that. Since Sorcerers are Charisma-based, most of\n\t\t\tyour skills will be, too, and using Persuasion in combat doesn&#8217;t work\n\t\t\tparticularly well. So the three best uses for this are cantrips, upcasting\n\t\t\tlow-level spells like Scorching Ray, and Concentration. That&#8217;s\n\t\t\tunderwhelming for an ability which costs 5 Sorcery Points to recharge.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clockwork Cavalcade<\/span>: Even with three\n\t\teffects, this is still only situationally useful.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Heal<\/span>: The 100 points of healing will\n\t\t\t\tbe the most consistently useful option for adventurers, allowing you to\n\t\t\t\tget allies back on their feet and restore a nice chunk of hit points.\n\t\t\t\tBut at this level, healing options like Mass Cure Wounds and Heal have\n\t\t\t\tbeen around for a while, and Clerics are casting Mass Heal to do the\n\t\t\t\tsame thing with a pool of 700 points.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Repair<\/span>: Neat, but rarely useful. This\n\t\t\t\tcould be used to solve some puzzles, though: Picture the\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/23\/Rosetta_Stone.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rosetta Stone<\/a\n\t\t\t\t>.

But even\n\t\t\t\tthen, it&#8217;s rare that you&#8217;ll face more than a small handful of enemies\n\t\t\t\twith magic effects on them, so in most cases you can just upcast Dispel\n\t\t\t\tMagic to level 6 to get the same effect if you don&#8217;t want to risk making\n\t\t\t\tthe ability checks.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li><\/ol\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"draconic\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Draconic Sorcery<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The iconic Sorcerer, Draconic Sorcery perfectly complements the core of the\n\tclass, providing tools to close gaps in the Sorcerer&#8217;s defenses and staple\n\tspells to address a wide variety of challenges.

The free summoning won&#8217;t be\n\t\tespecially impressive in combat, but since you&#8217;re not using a spell slot, you\n\t\tcan cast another spell with a spell slot on the same turn, such as casting\n\t\tMisty Step as a Bonus Action.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Casting Summon Dragon without Concentration leaves room for you to do a lot\n\t\t\tof other cool stuff at the same time.

Instead, expect to trigger surges by using Tides of Chaos.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The effects of Wild Magic are mostly benign, but there are a few options\n\t\t\tlike Polymorphing yourself into a goat or casting Fireball on your party.\n\t\t\tBut, since those options are in the minority, Wild Magic is usually\n\t\t\tsafe and frequently helpful, though the unpredictable effects mean that\n\t\t\tyou can&#8217;t count on it to be consistently useful.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tides of Chaos<\/span>: Use this on any ability\n\t\tcheck or saving throw where the outcome matters more than a handful of hit\n\t\tpoints. Easy Advantage that you can recharge this easily is incredibly\n\t\tpowerful.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you&#8217;re not expecting many fights on any given day, you can use level 1\n\t\t\tspell slots to easily recharge this, then inexpensively replenish the\n\t\t\tslots with Font of Magic. This can be fantastic for social situations and\n\t\t\tfor exploration, though Enhance Ability will be less expensive for\n\t\t\tnumerous ability checks of the same type in quick succession.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bend Luck<\/span>: When your allies fail a save\n\t\tagainst death by 1 or two, it&#8217;s heart-breaking. Spend the Sorcery Points and\n\t\tbe everyone&#8217;s best friend. 2 Sorcery Points is expensive, but your allies&#8217;\n\t\tlives are worth it.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Conversely, if an enemy narrowly passes a save against a level 1+,\n\t\t\tspending 2 Sorcery Points to turn that into a failure is absolutely worth\n\t\t\tthe cost. 2 Sorcery Points could get you a level 1 spell slot, but it will\n\t\t\tnever recover the Action you spent to cast a spell unsuccessfully.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Controlled Chaos<\/span>: This considerably\n\t\treduces the threat of the Wild Magic table and makes it more of a source of\n\t\tunpredictable buffs and comic relief.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tamed Surge<\/span>: Many of the Wild Magic\n\t\teffects can be very beneficial if you can predict when they&#8217;ll occur. For\n\t\texample: Misty Step behind your enemies, make all creatures within 30 feet\n\t\tvulnerable to Piercing damage, then Dash and fly to safety. Unfortunately,\n\t\tyou only get this once per Long Rest with no way to recharge it early.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Sorcerers are defined thematically by their subclass, and their subclass&#8217;s spells also greatly determine their play style. While any Sorcerer can fill any of the Sorcerer&#8217;s roles in the party by selecting appropriate spells, your subclass will provide you with options that might predispose you to one or more roles by giving you the tools to succeed with little further effort.
