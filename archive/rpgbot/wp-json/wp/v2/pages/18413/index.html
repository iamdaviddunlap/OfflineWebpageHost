Its defining feature is the ability to score critical hits more often than most characters by widening the range of die rolls that trigger one. By itself, this is just a DPR boost.

If\n\t\tyou combine this with the Grapple+Shove combo to keep enemies prone, you&#8217;ll\n\t\tscore critical hits 27.7% of the time thanks to Advantage and your high\n\t\tcritical hit rate.

The quickest solution is a level of Warlock for <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/hexblade\/\">Hexblade<\/a>, because of course it is. Using Charisma to attack automatically makes Elven Accuracy much easier to trigger, plus the dip gives you Magic Stone natively and, if you take it to level 3, even gives you the familiar to start the goofy dance I\u2019m about to describe which saves on a feat later and therefore stat budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Druid or Ranger with Druidic Warrior are also both good choices since they will also be able to walk out with Shillelagh and Magic Stone. This means you give up your bonus action at the start of each fight, but that\u2019s not strictly a problem if you haven\u2019t given yourself some other way to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel like picking up 3 levels in Rogue and have access to the optional feature Steady Aim, you can do that instead and turn your bonus action into advantage on one attack. Of course, at that point you can also just become an assassin and have the first turn be straight advantage anyway.If none of those are your speed, picking up 3 levels of Artificer for either <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/subclasses\/battle-smith\/\">Battle Smith<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/armorer\/\">Armorer<\/a> will let you use Intelligence to attack by default. Doing either of those is just going to make you feel like an Artificer more than an Champion though, so that\u2019s very much another case of optimization vs. character identity.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>For only the second time on one of these builds, I have to insert some conversation before getting to the build. Dear reader, I sat and I thought for hours about ways to reliably trigger Elven Accuracy on any target without relying on outside assistance. I finally boiled it down to this convoluted summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation: The Help action requires you to be adjacent to your target to use it. It does not require you to <em>stay <\/em>adjacent to your target until the advantage is used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The setup: Archery fighting style so we can ignore stat progression for a minute. Elven Accuracy at Level 4, Ritual Caster at Level 6 to get Find Familiar, Crusher at Level 8, Artificer Initiate at Level 12 to finally get Magic Stone. Magic Stone doesn\u2019t require concentration and has a minute-long duration, so you\u2019re constantly juggling 30 magical rocks until you start a combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The payoff: Familiar prepares Help when adjacent to an enemy. You walk next to said enemy, triggering help action. You then continue your movement and walk away, maintaining the advantage on the first attack against them (and removing the disadvantage from ranged attacking in melee). First one has a 27.7% chance to crit, triggering Crusher and making all other attacks this round against them have advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this fashion, you end up (slightly more than a quarter of the time) making all of your attacks in a round with Elven Accuracy advantage against any target regardless of their size or any of their actions and without multiclassing. At last, the holy grail. Except I then put it through the DPR calculator and, at every level, it\u2019s worse than the build in the base class handbook that takes no feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, instead, I\u2019m just going to give you something that relies on Strength and Dex and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E_lmtYPw6ro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">holding things still so you can stab them repeatedly<\/a>. Because this relies on grappling, you should definitely read our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">practical guide<\/a> on that. Notably, <strong><em>this only works against targets up to one size larger than you.<\/em><\/strong> You have been warned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have easy access to advantage because your table uses the Flanking optional rule or you have a Wolf Barbarian friend, please do not follow this build. Grab Elven Accuracy, Piercer, and a rapier or longbow, and deal huge exploding crit damage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-lord-forestwalk\">Example Build &#8211; Lord Forestwalk<\/h2>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>\u201c\u2026 and then I target your land with Gaea\u2019s Liege and declare combat.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We need enough strength to power grappling, but we can leave it at 16 and fake the rest with Skill Expert to get double our proficiency bonus on Athletics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Any flavor of elf will do.

Normally we advocate for the grapple+shove combo, but the intent of this build is to spend as many attacks as possible actually attacking, so spending one to Shove will cut into our DPR heavily.<br><br>So, you walk up, start a grapple with a +11 Athletics modifier (which goes up to +13 at next level), then spend two attacks stabbing with Elven Accuracy. This is finally a DPR increase over just stabbing something three times, leaving us at 27, a solid 25% over target DPR for this level while also being a decent controller by holding things in place.<br><br>It\u2019s also, finally, higher DPR than the Dueling number in the base handbook. Important to remember, too, is that this is assuming we have to give up one attack every round to start a grapple. Of course, this is also assuming it succeeds. If we get to spend all three attacks wailing on something we\u2019ve held the whole time, our actual DPR for the fight will be 35, halfway between target DPR and high DPR.<br><br>I\u2019m going to call out here that we care about when we Action Surge more than most fighters. If you manage to get a grapple going, you should probably Action Surge immediately to get the most out of it. That\u2019ll be an additional 40 DPR for the round, averaging out to an additional 13.5 for the whole fight, bringing us up nearly into high DPR territory for the fight, just because we managed a resource carefully. Of course, that also assumes something is both grappleable and will survive being stabbed five times, which is a pretty small overlap.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Indomitable (2 uses)<\/td><td>Rerollin\u2019 rollin\u2019 rollin\u2019 rollin\u2019 (come on)!<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Gift of the Chromatic Dragon<\/td><td>You know what\u2019s really good on crit-fishing builds?

It has no buttons to press, barely one decision point to make, and is generally so easy to pick up that it\u2019s the default subclass used in the base Fighter Handbook. Its defining feature is the ability to score critical hits more often than most characters by widening the range of die rolls that trigger one. By itself, this is just a DPR boost. Of course, if we\u2019re looking at something by itself, that\u2019s not really optimizing.
