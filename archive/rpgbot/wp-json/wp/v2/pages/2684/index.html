They&#8217;re all enchantments or\n\t\tillusions, so be cautious about creatures immune to those effects.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Faerie Fire makes\n\t\t\t\tthings very easy for any Rogues in the party, and it&#8217;s a great way to\n\t\t\t\thandle invisible foes. Sleep is usually an option which Wizards dump\n\t\t\t\tafter low levels because it&#8217;s not good enough to spend high-level spell\n\t\t\t\tslots on, but Warlocks cast every spell with their best spell slot, so\n\t\t\t\tthere&#8217;s no reason why Sleep can&#8217;t remain a go-to option for a\n\t\t\t\tWarlock.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Two decent\n\t\t\t\tsave-or-suck options. Calm Emotions can handle crowds, and Phantasmal\n\t\t\t\tForce can handle single targets. Unfortunately neither benefit from\n\t\t\t\tspell level scaling.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Blink is an\n\t\t\t\teffective defensive buff which doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, but Shadow\n\t\t\t\tof Moil comes online at 4th-level spells, and if you&#8217;re going to spend a\n\t\t\t\tspell slot and an Action for a 1-minute buff, you want it to be Shadow\n\t\t\t\tof Moil. Plant Growth isn&#8217;t always useful, but when it works it&#8217;s excellent.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Dominate Beast is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational, especially since you won&#8217;t be running into many beasts\n\t\t\t\tby the time you can cast 4th-level spells. Greater Invisibility is an\n\t\t\t\tabsolutely fantastic spell for many reasons, but in combat Shadow of\n\t\t\t\tMoil may be more appealing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Dominate Person is\n\t\t\t\tamong the best single-target control\/debuff spells in the game, but it\n\t\t\t\tis single-target and only works against a single creature type. Humanoid\n\t\t\t\tenemies in combat at this level are uncommon, and when they do appear\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;re typically major antagonists, but you can still use Dominate\n\t\t\t\tPerson in non-combat situations to accomplish numerous goals by\n\t\t\t\tdominating NPCs. Seeming is basically a mass version of Disguise Self\n\t\t\t\twith a huge duration, and while that&#8217;s very situational, the 8-hour\n\t\t\t\tduration means that you can cast it early in the day and immediately\n\t\t\t\ttake a Short Rest to recover your spell slot. The ability to target\n\t\t\t\tunwilling creatures opens up some hilarious tactical options like\n\t\t\t\tdisguising everyone in the room (including enemies) as the same\n\t\t\t\tcreature, and if that doesn&#8217;t scream &#8220;archfey&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what\n\t\t\t\tdoes.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fey Presence<\/span>: A 10-foot cube originating\n\t\tfrom you means that you need to be nearly adjacent to whatever you want to\n\t\taffect, and you&#8217;re unlikely to effect more than one or two targets at the\n\t\tsame time. The effect is helpful if you get caught in melee and don&#8217;t want\n\t\tto be because you can make targets Frightened before running away\n\t\t(Frightened imposes Disadvantage on their Opportunity Attack), but try your\n\t\tbest to never need this.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Misty Escape<\/span>: This is a great way to get\n\t\taway from a big enemy with multi-attack or from damage-dealing area effects\n\t\twhich leave lingering effects. Or, if you don&#8217;t have a good teleportation\n\t\toption, have your party members slap you around a little and &#8220;escape&#8221; from\n\t\tthem.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beguiling Defenses<\/span>: Situational by\n\t\tdesign, but charm effects are common, and turning them back upon the\n\t\tcreature can be both powerful and hilarious. Imagine turning a vampire&#8217;s\n\t\tCharm back upon the vampire.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Dark Delirium<\/span>: This is almost a\n\t\tsingle-target save-or-suck, but the target can still act freely for the most\n\t\tpart (within the confines of the Charmed or Frightened condition). The\n\t\teffect ends if the target takes damage, so if your allies are going to pile\n\t\tin on the target they should try to make all of their attacks occur before\n\t\tthe target gets another chance to act. You could use this to briefly charm a\n\t\ttarget and have a nice conversation with them, but one minute is a short\n\t\tduration so you need to work fast.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"celestial\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/warlock#TheCelestial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Celestial<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re desperate for healing but also need to be a warlock for some reason, the Celestial is fine.

Cure Wounds is tempting, but you get Healing Light which\n\t\t\t\twill provide comparable healing without eating your extremely limited\n\t\t\t\tspell slots. You can still use Cure Wounds right before a short rest to\n\t\t\t\tget some healing out of any leftover spell slots, but I&#8217;ve never seen a\n\t\t\t\twarlock make it to a short rest with remaining spell slots.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Both good options,\n\t\t\t\tbut Lesser Restoration should be left to your party&#8217;s divine spellcaster\n\t\t\t\tif possible. Flaming Sphere looks tempting with Radiant Soul, but\n\t\t\t\tRadiant Soul only applies to one damage roll for a given spell, so you\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t get to apply it every time your sphere hits something. Still, it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\ta decent area control option, and you get a lot of use out of a single\n\t\t\t\tspell slot.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Get Revivify. Let\n\t\t\t\tme clarify: <em>you should really get Revivify. It&#8217;s really good<\/em>.\n\t\t\t\tThe one concern is that you only have two spell slots until 11th level\n\t\t\t\tand it&#8217;s hard to reserve one of them so that you always have revivify\n\t\t\t\tready. Get a Pearl of Power if you can.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Wall of Fire is one\n\t\t\t\tof the most iconic area control spells, and it works very well in the\n\t\t\t\tWarlock philosophy of spending one spell slot to massively reshape an\n\t\t\t\tencounter before reverting to cantrips. You can use invocations to\n\t\t\t\tpush\/pull enemies through the wall, too. Unfortunately you still only\n\t\t\t\tget to apply Radiant Soul once each time you cast it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Flame Strike is\n\t\t\t\tfine, but it does less damage in a smaller AOE than Fireball and Radiant\n\t\t\t\tSoul&#8217;s bonus damage only affects one target. In general, spending a\n\t\t\t\tspell slot to deal instantaneous AOE damage is rarely a good use of a Warlock&#8217;s  resources compared to other damaging options like Hunger of Hadar.\n\t\t\t\tRestoration is a situational but important healing option. If you can,\n\t\t\t\tleave high-powered healing to your party&#8217;s divine spellcaster.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Cantrips<\/span>: Warlocks don&#8217;t have a way\n\t\tto create light with a cantrip, so Light is nice. Sacred Flame won&#8217;t matter\n\t\toften since Eldritch Blast will outpace Sacred Flame&#8217;s damage (especially\n\t\twith Agonizing Blast), but more cantrips never hurt and sometimes you need\n\t\tto keep zombies down or deal with creatures that have high AC but low Dexterity\n\t\tsaves.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Light<\/span>: Roughly equivalent to\n\t\tHealing Word, but without eating into your spell slots. This provides enough\n\t\thealing that the Celestial Warlock made a solid showing in the\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/healbot-olympics\">Healbot Olympics<\/a>.\n\t\tHowever, it&#8217;s the Celestial&#8217;s only healing option and doesn&#8217;t solve problems\n\t\tbeyond hit point restoration, so you still need to look elsewhere for options\n\t\tto handle status conditions.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Radiant Soul<\/span>: Warlocks deal the vast\n\t\tmajority of their damage with Eldritch Blast and Agonizing Blast. Celestial\n\t\twarlocks get Sacred Flame, which is probably the best way to make use of\n\t\tthis feature, but If you pick up Agonizing Blast (you should, it&#8217;s amazing), this\n\t\twill almost never matter while using cantrips because Eldritch Blast will\n\t\tmassively outpace any other cantrip&#8217;s damage output, even with the damage\n\t\tboost from Radiant Soul. If you don&#8217;t take Agonizing Blast, Sacred Flame\n\t\twill do slightly more damage than Eldritch Blast.\n\t\t<p>The Celestial&#8217;s expanded spell list offers a handful of extra spells that\n\t\t\tdeal radiant\/fire damage, but most of them aren&#8217;t a great use of your\n\t\t\twarlock spell slots and the damage still only affects one target on one\n\t\t\tdamage roll (e.g. one target of Flame Strike).<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Resilience<\/span>: This will save a ton\n\t\tof your party&#8217;s healing resources. It&#8217;s not quite as good as the Inspiring\n\t\tLeader feat since it only works after a rest and your allies don&#8217;t get as many temporary hit points, but it&#8217;s very close, and you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need to give your party a 10-minute pep talk to make it work.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Searing Vengeance<\/span>: There is no save to\n\t\tresist the blinding effect, so you can stand up and safely walk yourself to\n\t\tsomewhere safe before going back to lasering stuff to death. Since creatures\n\t\tthat you damage are blinded, you get Advantage on attacks against them, so\n\t\tit&#8217;s a great time for Eldritch Blast.\n<p>But, like anything that only triggers while you&#8217;re dying, it&#8217;s entirely possible that you will never need this because you&#8217;re doing such a good job at staying conscious.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fathomless\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/warlock#TheFathomless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Fathomless<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Fathomless is a servant of some sort of an aquatic creature, and the subclass&#8217;s features reflect that theme very effectively. However, much of the subclass is dedicated to functioning in and around water. If your patron sends you onto dry land to do its bidding, big chunks of the subclass dry up (see what I did there) and cease to be useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an aquatic or naval campaign, this is a good subclass. I could see a Fathomless Warlock fighting on the deck of a ship, or facing down tritons and merfolk while raiding a submerged dungeon, but in a typical land-based campaign you&#8217;re going to spend a lot of time wishing that you were elsewhere. From the list of current published campaigns, that means Ghosts of Saltmarsh is basically the only one where The Fathomless is a good fit, and considering that there are 8 published campaigns as I&#8217;m writing this paragraph (December of 2020), fitting into one of 8 campaigns isn&#8217;t a good success rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/fathomless\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14992\">Fathomless Warlock Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Expanded Spell List<\/span>: A lot of\n\t\tsituational options, and the combat options aren&#8217;t great. The spell list\n\t\tgets a little better if you&#8217;re underwater frequently, but even then there&#8217;s\n\t\tnot a lot to be excited about.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Two situational\n\t\t\t\toptions. Thunderwave is fine if you get stuck in melee or need to break\n\t\t\t\ta grapple, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider it a go-to damage option because\n\t\t\t\tgetting close enough to hit multiple targets often means getting into\n\t\t\t\tmelee by choice.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Gust of Wind is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational, but Silence is a huge problem for enemy spellcasters,\n\t\t\t\tespecially if your party can keep them inside the area by grappling\n\t\t\t\tthem, hitting them with a tentacle which applies a speed reduction, or\n\t\t\t\totherwise inhibiting their movement.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Lightning Bolt is\n\t\t\t\tfine damage, but hitting more than two targets with line effects is hard\n\t\t\t\tregardless of the line&#8217;s length. Sleet Storm is decent area control but\n\t\t\t\tvery hard to use effectively, doesn&#8217;t scale with spell slot level, and\n\t\t\t\trequires Concentration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Control Water is very\n\t\t\t\tsituational in non-aquatic campaigns, and limiting Summon Elemental to\n\t\t\t\twater elementals similarly handicaps the spell unless you&#8217;re in an\n\t\t\t\taquatic campaign.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Bigby&#8217;s Hand is a\n\t\t\t\tgreat, versatile spell. Cone of Cold is decent if unremarkable AOE\n\t\t\t\tdamage, but if you need area damage you&#8217;ll have better results with\n\t\t\t\tHunger of Hadar.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Tentacle of the Deeps<\/span>: At 1st level, this\n\t\tmatches the effects of Ray of Frost (at least in terms of damage and the\n\t\tsecondary effect. With a 1-minute duration it will get you through a single\n\t\tencounter each time you use it, provided that the encounter doesn&#8217;t move too\n\t\tfar away from the tentacle to reasonably bring the tentacle back into range.\n\t\tThis reduces your reliance on Hex at low levels, allowing you to use your\n\t\tone or two spell slots elsewhere without sacrificing damage output. However,\n\t\tsince the daily usage limit is tied to your Proficiency Bonus, you won&#8217;t be\n\t\table to use this as often as you could use Hex. Consider the two options\n\t\tcomplements to each other: use Hex if you just need to Eldritch Blast stuff,\n\t\tand use Tentacle of the Deeps when you need to use Concentration on\n\t\tsomething other than Hex.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gift of the Sea<\/span>: Great in an aquatic\n\t\tcampaign, but otherwise very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Oceanic Soul<\/span>: Damage resistance is great,\n\t\tand, in an aquatic campaign, the ability to speak to all submerged creatures\n\t\twill make it much easier for you to play a face. However, outside of aquatic\n\t\tcampaigns you may find it difficult to convince creatures to talk to you\n\t\twhile underwater unless you already share a language.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guardian Coil<\/span>: You likely don&#8217;t have any\n\t\tinteresting ways to use your Reaction, so using it to reduce damage to\n\t\tyourself or an ally is an excellent addition to your capabilities. With a\n\t\t1-minute duration on your tentacle, you could reduce up to 10d8 (20d8 at\n\t\tlevel 10) damage every time you use it, dramatically improving your party&#8217;s\n\t\tability to handle damage without resorting to in-combat healing.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grasping Tentacles<\/span>: Evard&#8217;s Black\n\t\tTentacles is a good spell. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s better than Hunger of Hadar,\n\t\tbut the added benefits from this feature certainly help. You get to cast\n\t\tthis once per day for free, which helps with the Warlock&#8217;s tiny pool of\n\t\tspell slots, and any time you cast it (free or otherwise), you get temporary\n\t\thit points. Being unable to lose Concentration on black tentacles due to\n\t\ttaking damage also helps quite a bit in combat, making this an easy go-to\n\t\toption in dangerous situations.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fathomless Plunge<\/span>: With a 1-mile range,\n\t\tthis isn&#8217;t exactly a long-distance teleportation option. Rather, this is a\n\t\tpanic button. When things are going poorly, grab your friends and retreat to\n\t\ta nearby body of water. However, keep in mind this feature has very strict\n\t\tlimitations. You can bring 5 other willing creatures, so if your party is\n\t\tbigger than that you&#8217;re in trouble. There&#8217;s also some debate over whether\n\t\tunconscious allies can be &#8220;willing&#8221;, so if allies are down you might not be\n\t\table to save them. The 1-mile range is small, so you need to be very careful\n\t\tto stay near a suitable body of water, which is hard when you&#8217;re delving\n\t\tdungeons or wandering the planes. Of course, it&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re in an\n\t\tocean because you can just pop out in a different part of the ocean.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fiend\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/warlock#TheFiend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Fiend<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Straightforward and effective, The Fiend offers mostly offensive options which improve the Warlock&#8217;s ability to kill stuff, but also offers some extremely potent defensive abilities.

The Fiend&#8217;s spell list offers several excellent options\n\t\tto address this.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Burning Hands is a\n\t\t\t\tdecent AOE, especially at low levels, and since Warlocks get armor and\n\t\t\t\tmore hp than Sorcerers and Wizards, you can survive\n\t\t\t\tbeing close enough to melee to use it, however, I wouldn&#8217;t use it beyond\n\t\t\t\tvery low levels. You&#8217;ll get more total damage out of Hex or other spell\n\t\t\t\toptions despite Burning Hands&#8217; scaling. Command is a great\n\t\t\t\tcontrol\/debuff effect and scales really well with your spell slots.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Blindness\/Deafness\n\t\t\t\tis a powerful debuff, but allowing repeated saves can make it\n\t\t\t\tunreliable. Scorching Ray is a bit redundant with Eldritch Blast, but it\n\t\t\t\tscales very well and benefits from the same tactics.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: A good AOE blast\n\t\t\t\tand a good area control effect. Fireball remains the best instantaneous\n\t\t\t\tAOE damage spell at every spell level until around spell level 8, and,\n\t\t\t\twhile the Warlock can&#8217;t cast Fireball past 5th level, it still remains a\n\t\t\t\tperfect go-to AOE blast option. However, remember that you will often\n\t\t\t\tget better results out of spells with ongoing effects like Hunger of\n\t\t\t\tHadar, and with so few spell slots you need to squeeze as much out of\n\t\t\t\tthem as you can. Stinking Cloud is an ongoing AOE save-or-suck effect,\n\t\t\t\tbut creatures within the area are Heavily Obscured so it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\t\t\tattack them. Hunger of Hadar is likely a better choice in most\n\t\t\t\tcases.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Fire Shield is fine\n\t\t\t\tfor &#8220;gish&#8221; builds, but, if you&#8217;re going for a Warlock gish you&#8217;re probably going\n\t\t\t\tto play a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/hexblade\/\">Hexblade<\/a>. Fire Shield also seems redundant with Armor of\n\t\t\t\tAgathys, which notably lasts longer, provides temporary hit points,\n\t\t\t\tdeals more damage to attackers, and scales with spell level. Wall of\n\t\t\t\tFire is one of the best area control spells in the game and with the\n\t\t\t\tright invocations you can push and pull enemies through it to repeatedly\n\t\t\t\tcapitalize on the guaranteed damage dealt when a creature passes through\n\t\t\t\tthe wall.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Flame Strike is\n\t\t\t\tFireball, but a smaller AOE and worse damage. Sure, some of the damage\n\t\t\t\tis radiant, but if damage resistance is a problem, you should be using\n\t\t\t\tEldritch Blast since nearly nothing resists Force damage. Hallow is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dark One&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: This makes Fiendish\n\t\tVigor considerably less important. It also makes it important that you\n\t\toccasionally pick off weak foes to ensure that your temporary hit points are\n\t\tup before you focus on more important foes. RAW the creature just needs to\n\t\tbe hostile, so a permissive DM might allow you carry around a bag of angry\n\t\trats and kill one whenever you need temporary hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck<\/span>: Adds an average of\n\t\t5.5 to your roll, which is mathematically much better than what you get from\n\t\tAdvantage (Advantage is worth slightly more than +3). Save this for crucial\n\t\tsaving throws or if you&#8217;re desperate need to escape a grapple but can&#8217;t\n\t\tteleport or something.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiendish Resilience<\/span>: This doesn&#8217;t specify\n\t\trestrictions on the damage type, so if you want to do Slashing for a while\n\t\tthen switch to Radiant, you can do it. This is one of very few ways to get\n\t\tresistance to Force damage, but you still want to use this for common damage\n\t\ttypes like fire, poison, and slashing.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hurl Through Hell<\/span>: Only works once per\n\t\tday, but 10d10 damage is pretty great on top of whatever your attack was\n\t\t(let&#8217;s be honest: it was Eldritch Blast). The creature is also removed from\n\t\tthe game until the end of your <em>next<\/em> turn, allowing you to temporarily\n\t\tbanish the creature, and potentially place hazards in and around its space\n\t\tsuch as Hunger of Hadar, Wall of Fire, or the rest of your party.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"genie\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/warlock#TheGenie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Genie<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely fantastic, the Genie is a spectacular spellcasting-focused option for the Warlock.

Sanctuary has a Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAction casting time, so you can attack or cast a cantrip in the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturn, then follow it with Sanctuary. However, since Sanctuary allows\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe attacker to retarget their attack, Sanctuary isn&#8217;t as effective\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst ranged attacks, and if you try to hurt your enemies while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s running the spell ends early.

You might consider learning another attack\n\t\t\tcantrip like Fire Bolt specifically for use with Entropic Ward, but, unless\n\t\t\tyou go Pact of the Tome it&#8217;s hard to justify spending one of your few\n\t\t\tcantrips known on a combo that you can use once per Short or Long Rest.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thought Shield<\/span>: Both effects are\n\t\tsituational.

Access to better armor, shields, and better weapons solves many issues which warlocks (expecially Pact of the Blade users) have faced since 5e first released. But beyond mere proficiency improvements, the Hexblade has a lot to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hexblade&#8217;s Curse is amazing, and the ability to use Charisma for attack and damage with your favorite weapon makes the class very SAD without detracting from the Warlock&#8217;s excellent spellcasting capabilities. Combining all of the Hexblade&#8217;s features, including its expanded spell list, the Hexblade is a truly fearsome threat with a weapon, often meeting or exceeding damage from Eldritch Blast+Agonizing Blast, though the dependence on spell slots for buffs means that the Hexblade&#8217;s best damage output may be more &#8220;bursty&#8221; than other warlocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/hexblade\">Hexblade Warlock Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Expanded Spell List<\/span>: While several\n\t\toptions on this list are very good, many of them require Concentration. In\n\t\tparticular, even though all the smites are Bonus Actions (good for your\n\t\taction economy), they require Concentration to ensure that you&#8217;re able to\n\t\tactually get the effect off as long as you hit sometime during the next\n\t\tminute, but this prevents you from running other excellent Concentration\n\t\tbuffs like Blur and Elemental Weapon from the very same expanded list.\n\t\tFurthermore, since the smite spells don&#8217;t scale well (if they scale at all),\n\t\tthey&#8217;re often a poor use of your limited Warlock spell slots. Consider using\n\t\tthem for a level or two when you first get them, but replace them after that\n\t\twhen better spells become available (even if it&#8217;s just the next smite\n\t\tspell).\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Shield is\n\t\t\t\tfantastic&#8230; on any other spellcasting class. It costs a precious spell\n\t\t\t\tslot, and offers no benefits for upcasting, so it&#8217;s only helpful until\n\t\t\t\tyou get access to 2nd-level slots for Armor of Agathys. If you aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\trunning another Concentration spell, Wrathful Smite into Booming Blade\n\t\t\t\tis staggeringly good damage at low levels, assuming the target moves and\n\t\t\t\ttriggers the secondary damage. The Wisdom save for fear is a nice touch,\n\t\t\t\tthough your defenses aren&#8217;t really turned on yet so maintaining\n\t\t\t\tConcentration can be a challenge in melee. To summarize: tempting\n\t\t\t\toptions at low levels, but you&#8217;ll abandon them in favor of other options\n\t\t\t\talmost immediately.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Blur is just a\n\t\t\t\tsuperb spell. Turn it on if you have more than one thing attacking you\n\t\t\t\tand\/or your Armor of Agathys doesn&#8217;t look up to the job. Branding smite\n\t\t\t\tfills some excellent niches, but is not otherwise overly helpful. It&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tprobably the only way you&#8217;re going to be able to deal radiant damage\n\t\t\t\t(you&#8217;ll be very grateful if you ever come across zombies) and it also\n\t\t\t\tprevents invisibility if your party can&#8217;t cast Faerie Fire, Invisibility\n\t\t\t\tPurge, or something else along those lines.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Blink would be\n\t\t\t\tinteresting if it wasn&#8217;t random in the fashion it is. Elemental weapon&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tprimary benefit is making a weapon magical if for some reason you aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\trunning Pact of the Blade, and I&#8217;m not sure why you would skip Pact of\n\t\t\t\tthe Blade (and the Invocations which require it like Thirsting Blade)\n\t\t\t\tand still use a weapon. It still runs into the Concentration problem,\n\t\t\t\tinterfering with smites and defensive buffs, but it adds a small amount\n\t\t\t\tof extra damage (which will increase when your spell slot levels\n\t\t\t\tincrease). Keep in mind that the Pact Weapon granted by Pact of the\n\t\t\t\tBlade counts as a magic weapon\n\t\t\t\t<em>for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance and immunity<\/em>.\n\t\t\t\tIt&#8217;s technically not a magic weapon unless you bind a specific magic\n\t\t\t\tweapon, so you <em>can<\/em> use your Pact Weapon with Elemental\n\t\t\t\tWeapon.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Phantasmal Killer\n\t\t\t\tis still an excellent spell, although the fact that it never scales past\n\t\t\t\t5th level for warlocks is disappointing at higher levels. Staggering\n\t\t\t\tSmite would be much better if the effect lasted more than one round.\n\t\t\t\tBoth spells cause the creature to suffer Disadvantage on attack rolls,\n\t\t\t\tbut Phantasmal Killer works at range and lasts longer.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Banishing Smite is a\n\t\t\t\tbig pile of damage on a Bonus Action and the rider effect doesn&#8217;t allow\n\t\t\t\ta saving throw. 50 hit points is a reasonably large window, and\n\t\t\t\tbanishing the target could dramatically affect the outcome of an\n\t\t\t\tencounter. Cone of Cold is a helpful way for you to do area of effect\n\t\t\t\tdamage, but apart from being a big pile of damage does little else for\n\t\t\t\tyou.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hexblade&#8217;s Curse<\/span>: Are you ready to confuse\n\t\tliterally every new player by being the only thing that gets proficiency to\n\t\tdamage? Then Hexblade is for you. Note that you can both Curse and Hex\n\t\tsomeone if you like to track several effects at the same time. In all\n\t\tseriousness though, this is a fantastic ability.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You only get this once per Short or Long Rest, so be sure to use it where\n\t\t\tit will matter. You want to make as many attack rolls as possible while\n\t\t\tthis is running, so at high levels this will frequently work best when\n\t\t\tcombined with Eldritch Blast since Warlocks can&#8217;t get more than three\n\t\t\tattacks (assuming Thirsting Blade and either two-weapon fighting or\n\t\t\tCrossbow Expert). However, since this only works once per Short or Long\n\t\t\tRest, remember that you may still have better results focusing on other\n\t\t\tparts of your build, and focusing on being effective with weapons is often\n\t\t\ta better choice for the Hexblade than Eldritch Blast even though you may\n\t\t\tget fewer attacks.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since this comes in at 1st level and scales based on your proficiency\n\t\t\tbonus, it&#8217;s very tempting for class dips into Warlock, totally\n\t\t\tdisregarding how good Hex Warrior is.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Warrior<\/span>: This is probably why you\n\t\tpicked the subclass. You get medium armor and shields so that you&#8217;re able to\n\t\texist in the front line without dying immediately, but far more importantly\n\t\tyou get to be a melee character and still have Str and Dex be dump stats.\n\t\tYou do still need enough Dexterity to fill out Half Plate&#8217;s Dexterity cap,\n\t\tbut that&#8217;s not hard.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Using your Charisma for attack and damage rolls in place of Strength is\n\t\t\tcrazy powerful. Not only does it make Pact of the Blade considerably\n\t\t\teasier for the Warlock, it makes Paladin\/Warlock multiclass builds\n\t\t\tmassively more effective. Keep in mind that by default Hex Warrior&#8217;s\n\t\t\tweapon effect works on a weapon which you touch at the end of a long rest,\n\t\t\tbut if you later take Pact of the Blade the effect extends to that weapon\n\t\t\ttoo, so you can affect have two weapons with which to attack using\n\t\t\tCharisma. This is important if you plan to explore two-weapon fighting or\n\t\t\tif you want a backup weapon or something.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Accursed Specter<\/span>: Not only does it have\n\t\tto be a humanoid, but you personally have to get the killing blow. That\n\t\tsaid, if you can get one, Specters are a phenomenal companion to have with\n\t\tyou. They are effective in combat (although they never scalebeyond the tiny\n\t\tamount of temporary hit points and the attack bonus which you give them)\n\t\tand, while they can&#8217;t speak, they will follow your verbal commands allowing\n\t\ta creative person to use one for scouting and have it report back.

Death Ward is a powerul defensive buff, and with an 8-hour\n\t\t\t\tduration you can use all of your spell slots to cast it one multiple\n\t\t\t\tmembers of your party, then immediately take a Short Rest to regain your\n\t\t\t\tspell slots and get right back to adventuring. Greater Invisibility is\n\t\t\t\tan absolutely fantastic spell for many reasons, but Shadow of\n\t\t\t\tMoil may be more appealing in combat.\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Both decent\n\t\t\t\toptions. Antilife Shell can make it easy to corner and eliminate foes\n\t\t\t\twith limited reach and no ranged options. Cloudkill is decent, but\n\t\t\t\tHunger of Hadar will frequently be both easier to use and more\n\t\t\t\teffective.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Form of Dread<\/span>: A great combat buff, and, as\n\t\tyou add subclass features, you&#8217;ll gain additional benefits. At this level it\n\t\tadds temporary hp (the temporary hit points expire when Form of Dread ends\n\t\tsince you get them &#8220;while transformed&#8221;) and the ability to make the target\n\t\tFrightened of you, allowing you to repeatedly debuff one creature per turn.\n\t\tThe target does get a save, and, weirdly, the text doesn&#8217;t specify a save DC,\n\t\tso I assume that it uses your spell save DC like everything else.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>With a Bonus Action activation time, it&#8217;s easy to turn this on when you\n\t\t\tneed it without cutting into your Eldritch Blast time. Since it grants\n\t\t\ttemporary hit points and immunity to fear, it&#8217;s a great option after\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ve taken damage or if you&#8217;re currently Frightened (becoming immune to\n\t\t\ta condition removes the condition). If you&#8217;re not worried about those\n\t\t\tconditions, it&#8217;s great to activate it early in a fight to keep\n\t\t\tan enemy perpectually Frightened.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since your number of uses per day for Form of Dread is tied to your\n\t\t\tProficiency Bonus, you can technically use it back-to-back, reactivating\n\t\t\tit immediately after it expires, or using it in back-to-back encounters. I\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t recommend this until your Proficiency Bonus improves a bit,\n\t\t\totherwise you&#8217;ll get through the first few encounters in a day and find\n\t\t\tyourself short on resources.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Grave Touch<\/span>: While not using Form of\n\t\tDread, Grave Touch is minimally impactful. Changing the damage type of one\n\t\tattack per turn usually won&#8217;t make a big difference, especially if you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing Eldritch Blast (while necrotic damage isn&#8217;t as good as Force damage,\n\t\tit&#8217;s still one of the best damage types in the game). If you&#8217;re using a\n\t\tweapon, changing your damage type from slashing etc. to necrotic can help\n\t\tovercome common damage resistances to weapon damage types, but resistance to\n\t\tmagic weapon damage is almost non-existent, and with Improved Pact Weapon\n\t\tyou&#8217;re guaranteed to have a magic weapon if you&#8217;re building around Pact of\n\t\tthe Blade.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The improvement to Form of Dread is more significant. An additional\n\t\t\tdamage die once on one each of your turns is only a minor boost. An\n\t\t\textra d10 once per turn with Eldritch Blast is a reliable damage\n\t\t\timprovement to your DPR, especially as you add additional attacks because\n\t\t\tyou have more opportunities to apply the once-per-turn damage boost, but\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s still only 1d10 per turn. The damage boost is worded as &#8220;extra\n\t\t\tdamage&#8221;, so it&#8217;s multiplied on critical hits like Divine Smite, Sneak\n\t\t\tAttack, and other similar damage boosts. Since you only benefit from this\n\t\t\tboost while using Form of Dread (which you can only use a few times per\n\t\t\tday), you&#8217;re working with core Warlock class features the rest of the\n\t\t\tday.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The ability to change an attack&#8217;s damage type once per turn appears to\n\t\t\taffect all of the attack&#8217;s damage types, so if you have multiple damage\n\t\t\ttypes, such as Force from Eldritch Blast and Fire from Spirit Shroud, you\n\t\t\twould change both damage types to Necrotic. Since this options is once per\n\t\t\tturn, you can also use it for Opportunity Attacks.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Necrotic Husk<\/span>: The damage resistance is\n\t\tnice, but necrotic damage isn&#8217;t especially common unless you&#8217;re facing a lot\n\t\tof undead enemies. The second half of the feature is more interesting: The\n\t\tdamage is decent, though not enough to win a fight, but the AOE is respectable, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s enough that you may be able to eliminate weakened foes. The 1d4-long-rests\ncooldown is odd, but probably not a problem unless you&#8217;re frequently\n\t\tbeing reduced to 0 hit points. If that&#8217;s the case, you should reconsider\n\t\tyour tactics. You&#8217;re not a Defender. The Exhaustion is annoying, but one\n\t\tlevel of Exhaustion is minimally impactful for most spellcasters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Projection<\/span>: Where Form of Dread is\n\t\ta dedicated combat buff with a small usage pool, Spirit Projection is a\n\t\tonce-per-day combination of defense, utility, and combat buff. It provides a\n\t\tcombination of exciting effects with a variety of uses, and combining Spirit\n\t\tProjection with Form of Dread can be exceptionally powerful.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While using Spirit Projection, you need to keep track of both your body\n\t\t\tand your spirit. Your spirit doesn&#8217;t duplicate your equipment, which I\n\t\t\tthink RAW means that your spirit is a spiritual projection of yourself in\n\t\t\tthe nude. Fortunately, I think you can loot your own body to get your\n\t\t\titems, though it&#8217;s not totally clear to me if that&#8217;s intentional. Just\n\t\t\tkeep in mind that you have a time limit, so it may save you time to strip\n\t\t\tyourself naked before activating Spirit Projection. Remember when facing\n\t\t\tinclement conditions like extreme cold, your spirit doesn&#8217;t get any sort\n\t\t\tof protection, so your body and your spirit may both need separate outfits\n\t\t\tto keep yourself from suffering the effects of the climate.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You don&#8217;t need to breath thanks to Grave Touch, so you can shove your\n\t\t\tbody into a bag of holding if you need a safe place to store it. If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tlow on hit points or otherwise need to get out of a bad spot, you can\n\t\t\tteleport back to your body to escape to safety.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While projected, you have resistance to weapon damage types, making you\n\t\t\texceptionally resilient. Combined with resistance to necrotic damage and\n\t\t\tpotentially damage resistances from other sources (your race, items, etc.)\n\t\t\tyou can be alarmingly durable for a warlock. However, you need to maintain\n\t\t\tConcentration to maintain Spirit Projection, and without proficiency in\n\t\t\tConstituton saves that&#8217;s a hard prospect even with damage resistances.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You effectively have a built-in spellcasting focus for Conjuration and\n\t\t\tNecromancy spells, though if you looted your body that&#8217;s probably not\n\t\t\timpactful. You can fly and move through objects similar to the Etheralness\n\t\t\tspell, allowing you to scout, inflitrate, and escape in ways that normally\n\t\t\trequire extremely high-level spells. With proficiency in Stealth, you can\n\t\t\tbe an extremely effective scout.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The final bullet provides a way to heal yourself by dealing damage, but\n\t\t\tit only works while combining both Spirit Projection and Form of Dread.\n\t\t\tYou heal for half of the necrotic damage dealt, so use Grave Touch to\n\t\t\tchange the damage type and add extra damage like Eldritch Smite if you\n\t\t\tneed more healing in a hurry. If you&#8217;re close to the end of Spirit Projection\n\t\t\tand you&#8217;re short on hit points, consider activating Form of Dread and digging\n\t\t\tout your bag of rats to give you easy targets to farm hit points.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"undying\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/warlock#TheUndying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Undying<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Undying seeks to make the Warlock survivable, but hardly manages to do so any better than other patrons.

Legend Lore is situational, but it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tessentially &#8220;Ask the DM About the Plot&#8221; as a spell, which makes it very\n\t\t\t\tpotent.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Among the Dead<\/span>: A free cantrip (albeit a\n\t\tbad one), and perpetual Sanctuary against a common creature type.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Defy Death<\/span>: This is really cool, but only\n\t\tworks once per Long Rest.
