Much like the Cleric and the Oracle, the classes fill the same roles with a distinctly different feel. Because they are spontaneous caster, Sorcerers have a limited number of spells available to them. This can be supplemented with Pages of Spell Knowledge, but no Sorcerer can match the versatility of a Wizard. Sorcerers also receive new spell levels one level behind other full casters. Sorcerers make up for these shortcomings by being able to cast considerably more spells in a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Sorcerer Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#rings\">Rings<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#staffs\">Staffs<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

If\n\t\tyou want the higher-level abilities from a bloodline with a poor low-level\n\t\tability it may be a good idea to delay this feat as long as possible so you\n\t\tcan use your feats on more important options,\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Eldritch Heritage<\/span>: The\n\t\t\t\tbetter Bloodline powers offer better options, but not all options are\n\t\t\t\tequally good.

Unfortunately you can only take the feat\n\t\tonce, so you need to be <em>really<\/em> sure about the spell you choose. I\n\t\trecommend selecting a spell of 5th level at most so that you can quicken it,\n\t\tbut 6th level has some great options for Maximize Spell. Be sure to pick a\n\t\tversatile spell that you can reliably use in almost any situation like one\n\t\tof the Shadow Conjuration\/Evocation spells or Summon Monster.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Crossbow<\/span>: A decent backup weapon at\n\t\tlow levels when you run low on spells, but you will be more reliable with\n\t\tcantrips because your attack rolls will be so low.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you need AC, you&#8217;re doing something wrong.

I believe can that you <em>can<\/em> replace\n\t\tthe spell with reasonable certainty. Page of Spell Knowledge has largely the\n\t\tsame function, but costs much less and is slotless. If you use the custom\n\t\tmagic item rules, the effect of Page of Spell Knowledge has a base cost of\n\t\t500 gp for 1st-level spells, just a third of the cost of Ring of Spell\n\t\tKnowledge I. Being rewritable would justify that cost difference. With that\n\t\testablished, this is an amazing item. There is no limitation on the spell\n\t\tbeing on your spell list or even whether or not it&#8217;s arcane or divine! Want\n\t\tto learn magic missile? Go for it. The rings go up to 4th level, but I think\n\t\tthe peak usefulness is 3rd-level because that gets you access to most of the\n\t\timportant healing\/utility spells on the cleric\/oracle spell list.\n\t\t<p>How you teach spells to the ring is also important. The item description\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t specify an action, so I would default to either a standard action\n\t\t\tor 1 hour to match the rules for\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/Magic\/#TOC-Adding-Spells-to-a-Wizard-s-Spellbo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spells Copied from Another&#8217;s Spellbook or a Scroll<\/a>. The easiest way to get access to spells is in &#8220;written form&#8221;. This\n\t\t\ttypically means a scroll or a spellbook, so if the spell isn&#8217;t on the\n\t\t\twizard spell list you&#8217;ll need to get a scroll. A generous DM might let you\n\t\t\tcopy the spell from an Alchemist&#8217;s Formula Book, but I don&#8217;t think that\n\t\t\tmakes sense. Alchemists can learn wizard spells from spellbooks, but\n\t\t\twizards can&#8217;t learn spells from formulae books. The item description also\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t specify what happens if you fail the spellcraft check. I would\n\t\t\tdefault to the Spells Copied from Another&#8217;s Spellbook or Scroll rules,\n\t\t\twhich means that using the scroll to teach the spell discharges the\n\t\t\tscroll. If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s cheaper to pay an NPC to cast the spell\n\t\t\tonce than it is to buy a scroll, though it&#8217;s obviously less portable. The\n\t\t\tend result is that a wizard&#8217;s spellbook becomes a treasure trove of\n\t\t\tutility. Spend an action or an hour, learn a spell out of the spellbook,\n\t\t\tcast it as needed, then trade it out later.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"staffs\">Staffs<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to recommend specific staffs without knowing your individual character, so instead I want to make a general endorsement of the concept of magic staffs in Pathfinder. If you are a 3.5 native, go read Pathfinder&#8217;s rules for staffs because they have improved dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staffs are a reliable, rechargeable source of extra spellcasting that can give spellcasters easy and reliable access to spells from their spell list which they might not want to learn, or which they might like to use so frequently that they can&#8217;t prepare the spell enough times in a given day. On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\tforego.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of Alluring Charisma<\/span>: Get it\n\t\tearly, enhance it often.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mnemonic Vestment<\/span>: Allows you to cast one\n\t\tspell which you don&#8217;t already know from a written source, such as a\n\t\tspellbook.

I think Ring of Spell Knowledge is better for\n\t\tanything that you can find in a Wizard&#8217;s or Magus&#8217;s spellbook, but for\n\t\tdivine spells that you might need on a regular basis Page of Spell Knowledge\n\t\tmakes more sense because you don&#8217;t need to pay NPC&#8217;s to cast the spell for\n\t\tyou and you don&#8217;t need to consume scrolls.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Robe of Arcane Heritage<\/span>: Many high-level\n\t\tSorcerer bloodline powers are excellent, and getting them 4 levels early\n\t\toffers a huge power boost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sorcerer&#8217;s Robe<\/span>: Unless your 1st-level\n\t\tbloodline power is truly amazing, this just isn&#8217;t good enough to justify the\n\t\tcost with only three uses per day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reduce Person<\/span>: Reducing your size offers\n\t\tseveral useful benefits. Dexterity improves your poor Reflex saves, you get\n\t\ta size bonus to AC, and you get a net +2 to your ranged touch attacks for\n\t\tgreat spells like Disintegrate. The Strength penalty doesn&#8217;t matter. You\n\t\tcould reduce your size to tiny if your race is normally small, and it still\n\t\twon&#8217;t have a significant negative effect. Even if you like to use polymorph\n\t\tspells, this won&#8217;t handicap you since most of your polymorph forms aren&#8217;t\n\t\thumanoid and thus won&#8217;t be affected by Reduce Person.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Sorcerer is the spontaneous caster equivalent of the Wizard. Much like the Cleric and the Oracle, the classes fill the same roles with a distinctly different feel. Because they are spontaneous caster, Sorcerers have a limited number of spells available to them. This can be supplemented with Pages of Spell Knowledge, but no Sorcerer can match the versatility of a Wizard. Sorcerers also receive new spell levels one level behind other full casters. Sorcerers make up for these shortcomings by being able to cast considerably more spells in a day.
