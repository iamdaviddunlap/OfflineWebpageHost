Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Ninja Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points is low, but it&#8217;s\n\tnormal for stealth classes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: At 2\/3 BAB the Ninja\n\twon&#8217;t keeup up with Fighters in a stand-up fight, but Ninjas aren&#8217;t intended\n\tfor a stand-up fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Ninjas have one good save (Reflex),\n\tand depend on Dexterity, but don&#8217;t get Evasion until at least 10th level.\n\tBecause they don&#8217;t need Wisdom like a Monk, their Will saves are likely poor\n\tas well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: With light armor, the Ninja\n\tneeds to rely on Dexterity to improve their AC. Because they need Dexterity,\n\tit is typically best to rely on Dexterity for attacks as well. The best\n\tweapons available to the Ninja are the Wakizashi, Shuriken, and shortbow. The\n\tother weapon proficiencies are flavorful, but are mostly only good for combat\n\tmaneuvers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: 8+ skill ranks, and an almost\n\tidentical skill list to Rogues. Unfortunately, the Ninja doesn&#8217;t get\n\tTrapfinding, which reduces the Ninja&#8217;s effectiveness as a Scout, but because\n\tthey need Charisma to fueld their Ki Pool, the Ninja is better equipped to\n\tserve as a Face than the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Use<\/span>: Poison is expensive, difficult\n\tto use, and unreliable. If you plan to use it, do so sparingly and with plenty\n\tof forethought.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span>: The Ninja&#8217;s main resource in\n\tcombat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Pool<\/span> (Su): The Ki Pool fuels the Ninja&#8217;s\n\tabilities. At start, the biggest draw is spending one point for an extra\n\tattack. When you are in an advantageous position, this is an excellent way to\n\tget an extra pile of Sneak Attack damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ninja Tricks<\/span>: The primary means of\n\tcustomizing your Ninja.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Acrobatic Master<\/span> (Su): Very situational.\n\t\tYour Acrobatics modifier should be good enough without this that you can\n\t\tsafely tumble in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bleeding Attack<\/span>* (Ex): Bleed effects are\n\t\talways tempting, but rarely worthwile. This could be useful for hit-and-run\n\t\tattacks, but you would be better served outright killing someone instead of\n\t\twaiting for them to bleed to death. At higher levels the bleed damage can\n\t\tbecome very scary, but fast healing and regeneration become more common.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Choking Bomb<\/span> (Ex): Excellent Crowd\n\t\tControl, and the DC is respectable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Trick<\/span>: Many Ninja Tricks are\n\t\tbetter than many feats you may want, but this is great for getting\n\t\tTwo-Weapon Fighting early.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Darkvision<\/span> (Su): Darkvision is crucial\n\t\tfor Scouts trying to move around unnoticed, but Ki points are precious.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deadly Range<\/span> (Ex): Buy Sniper&#8217;s\n\t\tGoggles.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflect Arrows<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fast Stealth<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but very\n\t\tcool and thematic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Feather Fall<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Stars<\/span> (Ex): Did you roll the\n\t\thighest Initiative? Are your enemies flat-footed? Time for Flurry of Stars.\n\t\tCombined with Two-Weapon Fighting, you can throw a dizzying number of\n\t\tshurikens to deal a huge amount of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Forgotten Trick<\/span> (Ex): Hugely improves the\n\t\tNinja&#8217;s versatility, especially in combat, but costs a ton of Ki.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hidden Weapons<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">High Jumper<\/span> (Ex): Or you can find a way to\n\t\tfly<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Block<\/span>* (Su): Hugely situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Charge<\/span> (Su): Very cool, but the damage\n\t\tis terrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Poison Bomb<\/span> (Ex): A great way to get some\n\t\tmore mileage out of your expensive poisons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pressure Points<\/span>* (Su): Combine this with\n\t\tmultiple sneak attacks in a given round, and you can really cripple your\n\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue Talent<\/span>: While many Rogue Talents and\n\t\tNinja Tricks overlap, there are a few good Rogue Talents which Ninjas don&#8217;t\n\t\tget access to. Read my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/talents\">Rogue Talents Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\tfor help selecting a Rogue Talent. If you plan to make use of poisons, the\n\t\tRogue has several excellent options to supplement the Ninja&#8217;s Poison\n\t\tUse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Clone<\/span> (Su): Fantastic when fighting\n\t\tenemies who can easily overcome your AC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slow Metabolism<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Slow Reactions<\/span>* (Ex): Fantastic for\n\t\tescaping and for Scout archetype Ninjas who need to keep moving to Sneak\n\t\tAttack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Smoke Bomb<\/span> (Ex): Or you could just buy a\n\t\tsmokestick. This is only good if you want Poison\/Chocking Bomb.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snatch Arrows<\/span>: Awful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Style Master<\/span>: Many Monk styles are very\n\t\tgood, and will benefit a Ninja greatly. Panther Style is especially\n\t\tinteresting for Scout archetype Ninjas, and Snake Style can help solve your\n\t\tAC issues. See the\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk#style-feats\">Style Feat<\/a>\n\t\tsection of my Monk Handbook for help selecting a style feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sudden Disguise<\/span> (Su): Situational, but\n\t\tpotentially hillarious.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unarmed Combat Training<\/span>: Weapons will\n\t\talmost always be a better option for the Ninja, but some feats and abilities\n\t\trely on using unarmed strikes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Undetected Sabotage<\/span> (Ex): Situational, and\n\t\tyou can usually do this with a normal Disable Device check.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vanishing Trick<\/span> (Su): Absolutely\n\t\tfantastic. This is a guranteed way to get Sneak Attack for at least one\n\t\tround.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ventriloquism<\/span> (Su): Hugely situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wall Climber<\/span> (Su): Hugely situational, and\n\t\teasily replicated or replace by Spider Climb or anything that lets you\n\t\tfly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Training<\/span>: Ocasionally useful to\n\t\tboost your relatively low attack bonus, but you can get many more\n\t\tinteresting options from other tricks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">No Trace<\/span> (Ex): Situational, and the\n\tbonuses are small.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but it\n\tallows you to do silly things like using Full Defense outside of combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Light Steps<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but very\n\tcool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Hugely\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Tricks<\/span>: A considerably improvement on\n\tNinja Tricks.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Talents<\/span>: The rogue has several\n\t\texcellent Advanced Talents. You can only take one, so choose carefully.Read\n\t\tmy\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/talents\">Rogue Talents Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\tfor help selecting an Advanced Talent.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Assassinate<\/span> (Ex): Save or die.\n\t\tConsiderably better than the Assassin&#8217;s version.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blinding Bomb<\/span> (Ex): Blinding enemies is\n\t\tvery effective crowd control, and allows you to Sneak Attack the\n\t\ttargets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deadly Shuriken<\/span> (Ex): Absolutely awful. You\n\t\tonly get to apply Sneak Attack once. Why would you ever do this instead of\n\t\tmaking multiple attacks?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Excellent, but very late in\n\t\tthe game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Feat<\/span>: Many Master Talents are better than\n\t\tfeats, so only take this when you run out Master Talents that you want.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ghost Step<\/span> (Su): Excellent for escaping\n\t\tand infiltration, but this will burn through your Ki very quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisible Blade<\/span> (Su): Absolutely\n\t\tessential. Ninjas will likely use this in every combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Master Disguise<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">See the Unseen<\/span> (Su): This isn&#8217;t nearly good\n\t\tenough to justify a Master Trick. By now your party should have plenty of\n\t\toptions for detecting invisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shadow Split<\/span> (Su): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unarmed Combat Mastery<\/span>: Only useful if\n\t\tyou devote resources to fighting unarmed, which is rarely a good choice for\n\t\ta Ninja.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unbound Steps<\/span> (Su): Too expensive for one\n\t\tround of Air Walk, which your Cleric can cast on you by now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hidden Master<\/span> (Su): Invisible Blade is much\n\tless costly, but imposing a -10 penalty to constitution is going to be much\n\tmore effective than an average of 35 damage from one attack.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compatible-archetypes\">Compatible Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Alternate classes can take archetypes for the base class so long as they have the same class features altered or replaced by the Archetype.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bandit<\/span>: Good for ambushes, but not\n\t\tcompatible with Scout.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Burglar<\/span>: You still don&#8217;t get\n\t\tTrapfinding<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sanctified Rogue<\/span>: The sacred bonuses to\n\t\tbad saves are nice, and Augury can be very useful, but this doesn&#8217;t help the\n\t\tNinja do any Ninja things, and it&#8217;s not compatible with Scout.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scout<\/span>: Uncanny dodge is terrible, and\n\t\tScout provides some great ways to get guranteed Sneak Attack without help\n\t\tfrom your allies.

The reduced damage and\n\tspeed are annoying, but can be easily overcome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Because Ninjas are typically\n\ttwo-weapon fighters they tend to be feat-starved, so the Human bonus feat is\n\tcrucial. The favored class bonus grants a few bonus Talents (remember that the\n\tNinja is an alternate class for Rogues, so logically you should be able to\n\ttake the same favored class bonus) which can get you Combat Trick or Weapon\n\tTraining to help with the feat requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anatomist<\/span> (Combat): Critical hits are not\n\t\tfor Sneak Attack classes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Armor Expert<\/span> (Combat): Don&#8217;t be tempted by\n\t\tthis.
