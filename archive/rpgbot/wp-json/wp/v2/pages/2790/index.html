It attempts to guide you through the process of\n\tplanning, writing, formatting, and publishing documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind: I am not an expert on this subject. This guide was written as I\n\twent through this process for the first time while publishing my\n\t<a href=\"\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/product\/230312\/Monstrous-Races?affiliate_id=389627\">Monstrous Races<\/a>\n\tdocument. While I was immensely successful, I can&#8217;t guarantee that replicating\n\tmy process will result in comparable success, even for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot make any guarantee as to the success of your product, and I won&#8217;t\n\tmake any attempt to do so. This is purely a walkthrough of how I got my\n\tcontent published on DMsGuild. It is not a guide on how to successfully write\n\tand sell an RPG product. Like selling anything, success is a complex mix of\n\tquality, marketing, timing, and luck. It&#8217;s difficult to predict, and I do not\n\thave the expertise to guide you on how to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-0-read-the-rules\">Step 0 &#8211; Read the Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>DM&#8217;s Guild has rules. Before you consider publishing content there, you\n\tshould read the sections on the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/support.dmsguild.com\/hc\/en-us\/categories\/202531048-DMs-Guild-General-Information\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">General Information<\/a>\n\tpage under &#8220;About Dungeon Masters Guild&#8221; and &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions&#8221;.\n\tThese sections explain what content is allowed, file formats, etc., as well as\n\tnumerous other points critical to the success of your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you understand the rules of DM&#8217;s Guild, think very carefully about\n\twether or not DM&#8217;s Guild is the right place for your product. While it has\n\tadvantages, it also restricts what you can do with your own content, and other\n\tauthors are allowed to reuse anything you&#8217;ve posted to DM&#8217;s Guild in their own\n\tproducts under the Open Gaming License (OGL).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this is a two-way street. You are also free to make use of other\n\tpeople&#8217;s DMsGuild content, so long as you abide by the &#8220;Create, don&#8217;t copy&#8221;\n\tguidelines on the Content Guidelines page. As suggested under the &#8220;Ownership\n\tand License (OGL) Questions&#8221; article, please be sure to provide links in your\n\tdocuments to the original source material. If someone&#8217;s material is worth\n\tborrowing, it&#8217;s worth giving them credit.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1\">Step 1 &#8211; Planning<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>What do you want to make? The vast majority of content on DMsGuild is\n\tcharacter options (races, feats, etc.), adventures, and monsters.\n\tSetting-specific material is fairly rare, but don&#8217;t let that discourage you.\n\tCreate whatever excites you. Think about what it&#8217;s going to include. How big\n\twill it be? How long will it take?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my first piece of content, I was overly-ambitious. I decided to convert\n\tthe entirety of the Monster Manual into playable races. Since this was my\n\tfirst time attempting to publish anything on DM&#8217;s Guild, this was probably a\n\tmistake. I encourage you to start with something more compact.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2\">Step 2 &#8211; Research<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s entirely likely that someone else has had a similar idea to yours, or at\n\tleast has published something similar enough that you can learn from it.\n\tSearch the site as best you can. The filters on the left-nav menu can go a\n\tlong way. Keep in mind that the titles you are primarily competing with will\n\tbe listed under &#8220;Community Created Titles&#8221;, which typically appears near the\n\tbottom of the page underneath all of the stuff which Wizards has posted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn whatever you can from the existing content. If there are free options,\n\tdownload a couple and see what other people have published. Note price points,\n\tvolume, quantity of art, and other details of existing submissions. When you\n\tgo to the page for a specific product, the bar on the right-hand side of the\n\tpage contains one or more icons. One will typically be the &#8220;Community Content&#8221;\n\ticon, but products which have sold especially well will have a &#8220;<a href=\"\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/metal.php\">Metal<\/a>&#8221; icon. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these products are published by\n\tWotC or professional RPG authors, so the competition is stiff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While researching for my Monster Manual race conversion, I examined the huge\n\tnumber of documents which include new race options. Most documents which\n\tappeared were single races, typically with a &#8220;Pay What You Want&#8221; price. The\n\tfew documents which asked for money fell into two categories: people who wrote\n\tgarbage and expect to be paid for it anyway, and people who wrote stuff that\n\tis more than a single race. The first category is rare and easily identified,\n\ttypically by really bad cover art and a really absurd price point. The second\n\tcategory is similarly identified by decent, thematically appropriate cover\n\tart, and often a price point which reflects a fairly large page count.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3\">Step 3 &#8211; Gather Resources<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Search through the DM&#8217;s Guild\n\t<a href=\"\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/browse.php?filters=45469_0_45476_0_0_0_0_0&amp;word_variants=3&amp;keywords=DMs%20Guild%20Creator%20Resource&amp;sort=0d\">Creator Resources<\/a>. Wizards published several documents including folders of art taken from\n\tprevious editions of Dungeons and Dragons for use in DM&#8217;s Guild products. I\n\tsuggest download everything available and looking through it all. It&#8217;s free\n\tand won&#8217;t take very long, and you may find several pieces that you like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also recommend downloading the\n\t<a href=\"\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/product\/170830\/DMs-Guild-Creator-Resource--Adventure-Template?filters=45469_0_45476_0_0_0_0_0\">Adventure Template<\/a>. It&#8217;s a Word document that you can use as a template for writing DM&#8217;s Guild\n\tdocuments, if you prefer to work in Microsoft Word. If you use a different\n\teditor, look around on DM&#8217;s Guild and several people have published templates\n\tfor other software which should look the same as the official Word template.\n\tKeep in mind that you&#8217;re under no obligation to match the template&#8217;s\n\tappearance, but I found it helpful to have a pre-built template and not need\n\tto worry about making my document look passable.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4\">Step 4 &#8211; Write<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You have a plan. You have some resources. You know what else exists, and\n\thopefully you&#8217;ve read a bit of it to see what you&#8217;re up against. It&#8217;s time to\n\tget to the fun part: It&#8217;s time to start writing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have a ton of guidance to provide here. I don&#8217;t know\n\tyou. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re writing. I don&#8217;t know what will and won&#8217;t work.\n\tThe best advice I can give you is to learn from the professionals. Look at the\n\tofficial rulebooks and your other official content, and try to replicate what\n\tyou see there, at least in terms of quality and organization.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5\">Step 5 &#8211; Edit and Proofread<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If your document includes text, you need to proofread. If people are reading\n\tyour document and it contains spelling or gramatical errors, they will\n\timmediately lose respect for your product. That means bad reviews, which means\n\tbad sales. Most products won&#8217;t get more than a handful of reviews, so even one\n\tbad review can ruin your product. Don&#8217;t give anyone a reason to dismiss your\n\tproduct out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6\">Step 6 &#8211; Art<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If your product is small (a single race, a single item, etc.), you may not\n\tneed to include any art. A piece of cover art can be a good way to grab the\n\tattention of possible buyers, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be huge, detailed, or\n\tfancy. Larger products should strongly consider art of some kind, as it&#8217;s a\n\tgreat way to break up big chunks of text, and it can provide helpful\n\t&#8220;landmarks&#8221; in large documents which players frequently need to locate\n\tspecific content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where you find your art is largely up to you. You can use the creator\n\tresources which I suggested above, you could purchase art packs on DM&#8217;s Guild,\n\tyou could use creative commons art, or you could seek out art elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re investing heavily in art for your product, you might comission an\n\tartist to create art for you. Keep in mind that good art is expensive. Unless\n\tyou can realistically expect a lot of revenue from your product, I don&#8217;t\n\trecommend spending a lot on art.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7\">Step 7 &#8211; Finishing Touches<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>All of the content is in your file. Add a table of contents if you think it&#8217;s\n\tnecessary. Double-check your title, your description, and make sure that\n\tadding art didn&#8217;t make the layout look weird, or break up chunks of text in a\n\tway that will confuse your readers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your product is finalized, export it as a PDF document. Be sure to open\n\tthe document and look through it to ensure that it saved nicely, and that\n\teverything looks exactly how you want it to look. If you added a table of\n\tcontents, ensure that the links work and go to the right places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are writing in Microsoft Word (I am), make sure that you select\n\t&#8220;Export&#8221; from the menu instead of &#8220;Save As&#8221;. &#8220;Export&#8221; allows you set some\n\timportant options for how the PDF will be generated, including adding\n\tbookmarks to the PDF. If you have a large file, you <em>need<\/em> bookmarks. I\n\tsuggest using the &#8220;Headings&#8221; option to generate the bookmarks because\n\tMicrosoft Word&#8217;s Navigation Pane will exactly match the resulting bookmarks in\n\tthe PDF.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save a copy of your cover page as a .jpg file. You&#8217;ll need it when you submit\n\tyour product. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the document while\n\tit&#8217;s open, and crop it in an image editor like Microsoft Paint or something.\n\tThe DM&#8217;s Guild submission form has some additional guidelines:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Cover images should be 350 to 900 pixels wide (larger images, closer to 900\n\t\tpixels wide, are better), in JPG format, and in 8.5 x 11 or A4 portrait\n\t\taspect ratio. For quicker load times of your cover images, please try to\n\t\tkeep their file size under 200kb.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8\">Step 8 &#8211; Publishing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>None of this is easy to follow or especially well layed out on the site, so\n\tdo your best here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have an account with DriveThruRpg.com yet, you will need one.\n\tDriveThruRPPG runs DMsGuild.com, and they share accounts. If you have\n\tpublished content on DriveThruRPG before, remember that the tools for DMsGuild\n\tare slightly different. Read the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/support.dmsguild.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/217029048-DriveThruRPG-Publisher-Account-Questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Publisher Account Questions<\/a>\n\tarticle for some information on how pubishing works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your account is created and you&#8217;ve logged in, go to your\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/account.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Account<\/a> page, and find the\n\t&#8220;My Content&#8221; section in the middle section of the page. Click the &#8220;Enter New\n\tCommunity Created Title&#8221; link under the &#8220;My Content&#8221; heading. This will open\n\tthe form to submit your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fill in the form as well as you possibly can. Set the Title field to match\n\tthe title of your document. If you&#8217;re not selling your product as &#8220;Pay What\n\tYou Want&#8221;, be sure to pick a price point that will make it competetive with\n\tsimilar products (remember the reasearch you did in Step 2).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think long and hard about how you want to handle the preview. A preview of\n\tyour contant is a much better indication of what&#8217;s in the product than\n\twhatever text description you could provide. If you have a single-page\n\tproduct, you can probably skip a preview. If you have multi-page product like\n\ta 300-page sourcebook, a preview is a really good idea. If possible, make the\n\tpreview start at the beginning of a section, and end the preview at the end of\n\ta section. Trailing bits of text at the beginning or end of the preview seem\n\tfrustrating and sloppy. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of putting your cover page or\n\tyour page of legal disclaimers into the preview. Unfortunately the preview\n\tneeds to be one continuous set of pages within your document, so you can&#8217;t\n\tpick-and-choose from multiple sections throughout the document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;In-page Flash Preview&#8221; is the preview which loads on the page with the\n\tproduct. The pages are converted to .jpg images. They&#8217;re high-resolution\n\tenough that people can read them if they open the image by itself, but on the\n\tpage they&#8217;re too small. The full preview is reachable by clicking the\n\t&#8220;Full-size Preview&#8221; link below the product cover image (the PDF you uploaded).\n\tThis preview is a PDF that opens in a pop-up. I recommend making these\n\tpreviews overlap, but the flash preview should be the fun stuff to look at and\n\tthe full preview should be the informational stuff like your table of contents\n\tand the first few pages of the book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, scroll to the bottom, read and agree to the ToS, then submit the\n\tform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that&#8217;s done, there will be some confusing pages where you need to upload\n\tthe actual file. Do that, then go to the &#8220;Edit a Title Listing&#8221; form and look\n\tfor the &#8220;Make Public&#8221; button to activate it for sale. The button is hidden\n\ttoward the top of the page in a table labeled &#8220;Product status&#8221;. Do not click\n\tthe &#8220;Update Product&#8221; button at the bottom of the page unless you made other\n\tedits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once this is done, your product is listed. There seems to be some delay\n\tbefore your product will appear in searches, but the product page will be\n\tlive. Unfortunately, there also doesn&#8217;t appear to be a link to your own\n\tproduct anywhere in your account. So to find your product, look at your\n\tbrowser&#8217;s address bar while on the &#8220;Edit a Title Listing&#8221; form. Somewhere near\n\tthe end of the URL, you should see some text that looks like\n\t&#8220;&amp;products_id=230312&#8221;. That&#8217;s your product&#8217;s unique ID number, which is\n\thow the software identifies it. Copy that number (230312 in my case), and go\n\tto this URL: \/\/www.dmsguild.com\/product\/230312, replacing 230312 with\n\tyour own product&#8217;s ID. This is the live store page for your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations! Your product is now listed for sale. There&#8217;s very little\n\tfanfare, unfortunately. You don&#8217;t get so much as a confirmation email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that the previews worked as expected, and that your product\n\tdescription looks good. If they don&#8217;t, go back into your Account and look for\n\tthe &#8220;Edit Title&#8221; link in the middle section of the page under My Content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also suggest scrolling to the bottom of the product page and checking the\n\t&#8220;Follow this discussion&#8221; checkbox. It&#8217;s nice to see what people are saying\n\tabout your product.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9\">Step 9 &#8211; Affiliate Program<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Sign up for the affiliate program. Go to your Account page, and find\n\t&#8220;Affiliate Program&#8221; toward the bottom of the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full instructions on the site, but here&#8217;s the highlights on why you\n\tshould both doing this: You get a URL parameter (mine is ?affiliate_id=389627,\n\tfor example) to add to links to OneBookShelf&#8217;s websites, and any time someone\n\tuses it you get a 5% cut of anything that they buy for the next 15 days. Even\n\tif it&#8217;s not the product you linked to. Even if it&#8217;s your own product. I&#8217;m\n\tlooking at my own affiliate sales report as I write this and there&#8217;s credit\n\tfor selling my own product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering if it&#8217;s okay to get affiliate credit for selling your\n\town product. I&#8217;m not 100% certain if it&#8217;s intentional (I&#8217;m never sure if\n\tanything is intentional with OneBookShelf because their websites are confusing\n\tand frustrating and full of bugs, incomplete features, and horrifying design\n\tdecisions), but think of it this way: You could throw your product on the site\n\tand forget about it, collect your 50% royalties, and call it a day. Or, you\n\tcould go the extra mile, put some effort into selling more copies, and earn\n\tyourself another 5%. If you didn&#8217;t sell those extra copies, OneBookShelf\n\twouldn&#8217;t get anything. Instead, they get 45% of some extra sales, and you get\n\ta bit of extra cash as a reward for going to extra mile. Everybody wins.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10\">Step 10 &#8211; Advertise<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>DMsGuild.com isn&#8217;t built to make your specific product rise to the top. It&#8217;s\n\tbuilt to generate revenue for Wizards of the Coast. That means that what sells\n\tgets the most real estate on the front page of the site. If you want people to\n\tbuy your product, you need to help them find it first, and then you need to\n\tencourage people to buy it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know much about professional advertising, but there are still some\n\tbasic steps you can take to generate visibility. If you have friends who play\n\tDungeons and Dragons, talk to them about it. Post links on Facebook, Twitter,\n\tReddit, and other social media sites which you frequent and where you have an\n\tinterested audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to ask people to review your product. Many people (myself included)\n\tare reluctant to pay money for a product with no credible reviews. You want\n\treviews on your product to be specific, impartial, useful, and interesting.\n\tIdeally you also want the reviews to be positive, but that requires that your\n\tcontent is good (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m sure that whatever you write will be\n\tfantastic!). Positive but useless reviews don&#8217;t offer much for a savvy\n\tconsumer. Having 10 reviews that all have variations on &#8220;I know the author and\n\the&#8217;s great&#8221; is useless, but one or two reviews which discuss specific parts of\n\tyour product which the customer liked will give other customers an idea of\n\twhat&#8217;s inside and wether or not it&#8217;s worth time and money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have uploaded a product, check your Account page for the &#8220;Send\n\tComplimentary Copy&#8221; link under &#8220;My Content&#8221;. Use this to send complimentary\n\tcopies to people and ask for reviews on the product.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11\">Step 11 &#8211; Maintenance<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need to make edits or improvements to your product\n\tafter releasing it. The larger your product is, the more likely you&#8217;ll find\n\terrors. Once you have an updated version of your product, go to your Account\n\tpage and click the &#8220;Upload\/Update Files&#8221; link under &#8220;My Content&#8221;. Select the\n\tproduct you want to update from the dropdown, and it will take you to a form\n\tto upload updated files. Try not to do this too often, or your customers might\n\tget annoyed with frequent insignificant updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to update your product&#8217;s description or any of the other things\n\tyou set on the &#8220;Enter New Community Created Title&#8221; form, look for the &#8220;Edit\n\tTitle&#8221; link under &#8220;My Content&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering updates to your products, consider how people consume\n\ttabletop roleplaying games. RPG products don&#8217;t work like software. People\n\texpect the initial release to be complete, functional, and stable, and they\n\texpect to be able to use that product for several years without significant\n\tchanges. Errata to correct errors or to explain confusion is expected, but it\n\tshould be infrequent. You can&#8217;t reasonably expect your customers to sit around\n\ton the DM&#8217;s Guild site watching the &#8220;Updated Products&#8221; page, and there&#8217;s no\n\tautomated notification when a product is updated, so you need to make sure\n\tthat whatever you&#8217;ve uploaded is complete and stable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch for responses on the Reviews and the Discussion portions of your\n\tproduct page. If people have questions or comments, respond politely and\n\tthoroughly. But keep in mind that not every review or comment needs a\n\tresponse. As nice as it is to see positive responses to your product, you\n\tdon&#8217;t need to thank every person who comment. My general rule is that if they\n\task a question, it needs an answer. If they offer criticism, acknowledge it\n\tand explain your thoughts behind whatever they&#8217;re criticizing. If they point\n\tout mistakes, correct it and let them know that it will be fixed in the next\n\tupdate to the product.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12\">Step 12 &#8211; Collecting Royalties<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you set a non-free price for your product and you&#8217;re fortunate enough to\n\tsell copies, you&#8217;ll accumulate credit with OneBookshelf. You can use that\n\tcredit to buy stuff on their websites, including DMsGuild.com,\n\tDriveThruRPG.com, etc., or you can be paid real-world money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be paid, go to your account page and click &#8220;Get Paid&#8221; under\n\t&#8220;My Money&#8221;. There is a $2 transaction fee every time you transfer money out of\n\tyour account, and you need to transfer to a PayPal account.
