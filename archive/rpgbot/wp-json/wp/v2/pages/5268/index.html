You get one a 1st level, and you don&#8217;t get another until 7th level. The choice between an energy blast and physical blast is an important strategic choice. If you go for energy blasts, you&#8217;ll face increasingly common energy resistances after low levels, but you get to make ranged touch attacks, largely guaranteeing that you will hit afte rlow levels. If you go for physical, you&#8217;ll do more damage, but you&#8217;ll face damage reduction which you may be unable to bypass since &#8220;magic&#8221; weapons don&#8217;t bypass things like DR\/adamantine, and you need to make regular ranged attacks instead of ranged touch attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Air Blast<\/span> (Sp): Only deals bludgeoning\n\tdamage, so it can&#8217;t compete with Earth Blast or Telekinetic Blast. Regular\n\tranged attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cold Blast<\/span> (Sp): Cold damage is fine, but\n\tit&#8217;s resisted by many creature types. Ranged touch attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth Blast<\/span> (Sp): You can choose among any\n\tof the three physical damage types, allowing you to bypass many forms of\n\tdamage reduction with ease. It&#8217;s the best basic physical blast, but it&#8217;s also\n\ta regular ranged attack, so it&#8217;s not as reliable as an energy blast.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Electric Blast<\/span> (Sp): The least commonly\n\tresisted type of energy blast. Ranged touch attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire Blast<\/span> (Sp): Fire is the most commonly\n\tresisted type of energy damage. However, it&#8217;s also extra effective against\n\tplants and it affects wooden objects easily. Ranged touch attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Blast<\/span> (Sp): The most complex\n\tof kinetic blasts. The basic usage is functionally identical to Earth Blast\n\texcept that you need to launch a pre-existing object (oh look, convenient\n\trocks on the ground). The complex usage of the blast involves real weapons.\n\tHowever, this method is largely useless. It allows you to use the special\n\tproperties of weapons, which could be helpful for bypassing DR, but by the\n\ttime this would be useful you will deal more damage using the basic version of\n\tthe blast and suffering the damage reduction. Either way, it&#8217;s still a regular\n\tranged attack so it won&#8217;t be as reliable as an energy blast.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Blast<\/span> (Sp): Essentially identical to\n\tair blast, but with water. Regular ranged attack.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"composite-blasts\">Composite Blasts<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At 7th level you get access to composite blasts, which double your damage dice (and the +x bonus for physical blasts). However, most composite blasts also have a Burn cost. Until you pick up Supercharge or Composite Specialization, there&#8217;s no good way to get around this Burn cost without pointlessly wasting turns on Gather Power, so your Composite Blasts represent more of an occasional spike in damage output and less of a spammable option than your Basic Blasts. Unfortunately, almost all of the composite blasts are physical, so your options are extremely limited if you want to stick to reliable ranged touch attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the blasts do multiple damage types (like Blizzard Blast dealing cold and piercing). Since this damage is split between the two types, you may suffer twice as many issues with damage reduction and energy resistance. However, it also means that you won&#8217;t be shut down by a single damage immunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aetheric Boost<\/span> (Sp): The bonus damage is\n\tfar too small to justify two points of burn. In theory this is a way to keep\n\tthe utility of whatever Basic Blasts you&#8217;ve chosen while boosting their\n\tdamage. In reality, your choice of Composite Blasts is limited based on your\n\tBasic Blasts, so you&#8217;re still dealing the same types of damage. Even when you\n\tget the 15th-level advancement, the Burn cost may still be too high to justify\n\tusing this frequently.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Blizzard Blast<\/span> (Sp): There is no reason for\n\tthis to exist. It has identical effects to Ice Blast but worse\n\tprerequisites.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blue Flame Blast<\/span> (Sp): It&#8217;s literally the\n\tsame as Fire Blast, but with more damage. It&#8217;s really boring, and doesn&#8217;t add\n\tany of the versatility that you&#8217;ll sorely need to deal with the fact that fire\n\tis the most commonly resisted energy type. Ranged touch attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Charged Water Blast<\/span> (Sp): Half bludgeoning,\n\thalf electricity. A fun combination of damage types, but it&#8217;s a physical\n\tblast, so it&#8217;s a regular ranged attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Force Blast<\/span> (Sp): Force damage is amazing,\n\tbut this only does as much damage as a basic blast. You need the extra damage\n\toutput more than you need to be able to hit ghosts. Ranged touch attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ice Blast<\/span> (Sp): Identical to Blizzard Blast,\n\tbut you don&#8217;t also need Air Blast to use it. Half cold, half piercing.\n\tSkeletons will be a serious problem, and it&#8217;s still a regular ranged\n\tattack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Magma Blast<\/span> (Sp): Half bludgeoning, half\n\tfire. A fine combination of damage types, but it&#8217;s still a regular ranged\n\tattack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Metal Blast<\/span> (Sp): Any of the three\n\tphysical damage types. Regular ranged attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Mud Blast<\/span> (Sp): Only bludgeoning\n\tdamage.Regular ranged attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Plasma Blast<\/span> (Sp): Half bludgeoning, half\n\tfire. Functionally identical to Magma Blast. Regular ranged attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sandstorm Blast<\/span> (Sp): Piercing\n\t<em>and<\/em> slashing means that it&#8217;s automatically treated as the most\n\teffective of the two. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s still a regular ranged attack<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Steam Blast<\/span> (Sp): Half bludgeoning, half\n\tfire. Functionally identical to Magma Blast. Regular ranged attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderstorm Blast<\/span> (Sp): Half bludgeoning,\n\thalf electricity. Functionally identical to Charged Water Blast. Regular\n\tranged attack.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"defense-wild-talents\">Defense Wild Talents<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>You only get one of these most of the time, and it&#8217;s a crucial defense on top\n\tof your armor class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enveloping Winds<\/span> (Su): Once you pick up\n\tWings of Air this becomes very useful. Enemies shouldn&#8217;t be able to reach you,\n\texcept with ranged attacks, spells, or considerable effort. Of course, this\n\toffers no protection against melee attacks and non-ray spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Flesh of Stone<\/span> (Su): DR\/Adamantine is among\n\tthe best forms of DR in the game. Almost nothing bypasses it except Iron\n\tGolems and manufactured weapons, so it should work nearly any time you&#8217;re\n\tattacked.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Force Ward<\/span> (Su): Even better than normal\n\ttemporary hit points, and they regenerate fast enough that you can easily\n\trecover all of them between fights without needing to waste Burn to accelerate\n\tthe recharge rate. You get to treat hits as misses if they don&#8217;t pierce your\n\tbubble, which is especially useful against things like poison. You can also\n\trapidly refill the pool any time you accept Burn, so you can reliably get\n\tthrough an entire day without taking a serious amount of actual damage\n\tprovided that you manage your bubble well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Searing Flesh<\/span> (Su): Kineticists usually do\n\tnot do well in melee, and this is only useful if you&#8217;re getting hit or\n\tgrappling. You should be avoiding being hit, and you should probably never be\n\tgrappling.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shroud of Water<\/span> (Su): Pick the shield\n\toption. It&#8217;s basically a free animated heavy shield with no armor check\n\tpenalty. The armor bonus option can be easily and inexpensively replicated\n\twith a modestly enhanced chain shirt, and you can massively outpace the bonus\n\tif you pick up heavier armor.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"infusion-wild-talents\">Infusion Wild Talents<\/h3>\n<p>Infusions are what make your blasts interesting. Remember that you can\n\tcombine one form infusion with one substance infusion, though the Burn cost\n\tfor doing so many be difficult until you have Infusion Specialization.<\/p>\n<p>This section is organized by effective spell level to help selecting the best\n\toptions at each spell level. Remember that Infusions may be limited to certain\n\telements, and they only work with the specified &#8220;Associated Blasts&#8221;, so your\n\toptions may be more limited than you think. Be sure to thoroughly check the\n\toriginal entry for any Infusion you&#8217;re considering.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-level-1\">Spell Level 1<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Burning Infusion<\/span>: An excellent boost to\n\tyour damage output, especially at low levels, setting a creature on fire can\n\tbe a death sentence. The target is forced to waste a turn extinguishing itself\n\tonly for you to set it on fire again the next turn, or it can continue to\n\tslowly burn to death.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Draining Infusion<\/span>: A fantastic way to\n\tovercome damage resistances if you went for energy blasts. You deal full\n\tdamage (though I think this may be an error), or 1\/4 damage if the target\n\tsuccessfully saves (which is why I think that the full damage is an error). On\n\ttop of that, you get a free point of Burn to spend on the following turn.\n\tCombined with Gather Power you could get two free points of Burn on the\n\tfollowing turn, or 4 once you pick up Supercharge. Unfortunately, it requires\n\tthat the target have the subtype of your energy damage, which means that many\n\tcreatures with resistances, including those with resistances from spells,\n\twon&#8217;t be affected.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Extended Range<\/span>: As a class focused very\n\theavily on ranged combat, additional range is excellent. When you have the\n\tspace, stay as far away as you can manage. Use Gather Power to offset the Burn\n\tcost and wear your foes down from afar.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fan of Flames<\/span>: Cones are great low-level\n\tAOEs, but at 15 feet you&#8217;re not going to hit more than one or two creatures at\n\tmost. If you pick this infusion, retrain it as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gusting Infusion<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Kinetic Blade<\/span>: Tempting, but risky. You\n\tcan make a full attack, potentially allowing you to apply your blast multiple\n\ttimes in one turn. However, with 2\/3 BAB this will take quite a while to get\n\tadditional attacks. You can&#8217;t use this with two-weapon fighting because the\n\tInfusion specifies that you create &#8220;<em>a<\/em> light or one-handed weapon&#8221;, so\n\tyou can&#8217;t create two weapons or a double weapon. Elemental Overflow will grant\n\ta crucial bonus to your attack rolls, but you don&#8217;t get the damage bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Kinetic Fist<\/span>: Kinetic Fist provides\n\tadditional damage on top of your unarmed strike damage. Since kineticists\n\tdon&#8217;t have built-in unarmed strike bonus, this is objectively worse than\n\tKinetic Blade for a vanilla kineticist. If you want to use this, take the\n\tElemental Ascetic archetype. You&#8217;ll get it for free, its burn cost will be\n\tremoved, and its effectiveness will be improved.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Pushing Infusion<\/span>: You&#8217;re still stuck using\n\tyour 2\/3 BAB, and the 5-foot push limit without spending additional Burn is\n\tabsurd.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Quenching Infusion<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Thundering Infusion<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 2<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bowling Infusion<\/span>: Tripping an enemy can be\n\tvery useful if you have melee allies, but you&#8217;re bad at it. With only 2\/3 BAB\n\tyou can&#8217;t compete with a fighter. You do get to use your Constitution bonus,\n\twhich is nice, but it&#8217;s still not enough.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Entangling Infusion<\/span>: An excellent\n\tcrowd-control effect with a good duration, especially if you combine it with a\n\tForm infusion that makes your blast an AOE.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 3<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Eruption<\/span>: The AOE is excellent, but the\n\tdamage is halved for physical blasts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Extreme Range<\/span>: Fights rarely take place at\n\tdistances great enough that this will be useful. The Burn cost is low enough\n\tthat with Infusion Specialization 1 and Gather Power you can use this every\n\tround at no Burn cost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Flurry of Blasts<\/span>: Do not combine this with\n\tComposite Blasts: it&#8217;s a huge waste of Burn. This is a hard infusion to use.\n\tIt sets your effective level to 1st for damage purposes, so your best bet is\n\tto use a physical blast to deal 1d6+1+Con damage to each target. If you hit\n\tthe same target you don&#8217;t get the +1 or your Constitution bonus, so you&#8217;ll\n\tdeal 2d6+1+Con total with two hits. Unless you&#8217;re trying to get around spell\n\tresistance or trying to force the target to fail a save, an AOE Infusion would\n\tbe a much better way to handle multiple targets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Foe Throw<\/span>: Damage two targets, knock one of\n\tthem prone <em>and<\/em> reposition it. This can be very powerful if you&#8217;re\n\tclever. However, it allows a save <em>and<\/em> requires an attack roll so you\n\thave two chances to fail, and if you miss the attack roll the target has a lot\n\tof flexibility to position themselves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Force Hook<\/span>: Melee is very hard for\n\tkineticists, but this is a great way to move around.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Impale<\/span>: Functinally a line AOE, but you\n\tneed to successfully attack and damage everything in the line to get the full\n\teffect.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Kinetic Whip<\/span>: If you&#8217;re building for melee,\n\tthis is a must. By the time you can pick it up, you have Infusion\n\tSpecialization 2 so the Burn cost is negligible, allowing you to make full\n\tattacks with two attacks at no Burn cost. The reach doesn&#8217;t prevent you from\n\tattacking adjacent enemies, so there&#8217;s little reason to use Kinetic Blade\n\tunless you want to mix in other Infusions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magnetic Infusion<\/span>: If you have melee allies,\n\ta +4 bonus is extremely significant. The bonus is untyped, too. This is an\n\texcellent go-to Infusion option if you don&#8217;t need anything else because it&#8217;s\n\talmost always useful and the Burn cost is low enough that Geather Power and\n\tInfusion Specialization can offset the cost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mobile Blast<\/span>: This both increases your\n\tper-round damage output and provides a small area denial effect. However, it\n\thas some strict limitations. If you want infinite duration, you&#8217;re limited to\n\tunmodified Basic Blasts, and the damage will be poor. In addition, the move\n\taction usage will mean that you can&#8217;t rely on Gather Power to reduce your Burn\n\tcosts every round. Your default usage should be to create a Mobile Blast based\n\ton your Basic Blast and walk around with it all day. If you have a good reason\n\tto do so, spend some Burn to throw a Substance Infusion onto your Mobile Blast\n\tand use it for a few rounds. If you can hold enemies in place by tripping\n\tand\/or entangling them, you can set the Mobile Blast on top of them and deal a\n\thuge amount of damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Rare-Metal Infusion<\/span>: Critical for melee\n\tkineticists and for physical blast users. This allows you to bypass any DR\n\texcept DR\/- and aligned DR.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Snake<\/span>: Amusing, but too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Torrent<\/span>: Unlike Impale, this is a real line\n\teffect. However, it deals half damage with physical blasts, so physical blast\n\tusers may want to use Impale instead.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 4<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cyclone<\/span>: Half damage, and you need to be\n\treally close to multiple enemies for this to be appealing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flash Infusion<\/span>: Blinding an enemy is\n\tmassively crippling. By the level you get this, you can use Gather Power and\n\tInfusion Specialist to reduce the Burn cost to 0, allowing you to use this\n\tevery round. You won&#8217;t be able to use a Form Infusion for free until you get\n\tInfusion Specialist 3 at 11th level, but blinding a single foe every round is\n\tan excellent use of your time, especially if you have other allies to\n\tcapitalize on the handicap.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spray<\/span>: A 30-foot cone is considerably more\n\tmanageable than the 15-foot cone allowed by Fan of Flames.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-level-5\">Spell Level 5<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chain<\/span>: Nothing about the blast rules\n\tdictates that your targets need to be creatures, so if you need to bridge a\n\tgap wider than 30 feet you can target a square or object in the intervening\n\tspace and &#8220;bounce&#8221; the chain closer to the target at the expense of a die of\n\tdamage. Because you&#8217;re attacking in a chain, this is a great way to affect\n\tmultiple foes without worrying about things like hitting your allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Chilling Infusion<\/span>: A fantastic debuff for\n\tenemies that rely on full attacks, but often worthless against enemies that\n\trely on spells or special abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grappling Infusion<\/span>: This is fantastic,\n\tthough very difficult to use. You need to combine this with one of the three\n\tlisted Form infusions, making the Burn cost high, and the Form infusions are\n\tall at least as high level as Grappling Infusion so you&#8217;ll probably need to\n\tspend a feat on Extra Wild Talent to pick up Wall if you want to use this as\n\tsoon as it&#8217;s available. If you can get over the hurdles it takes to bring this\n\tonline, it&#8217;s absolutely amazing. You use your class level and Constitution\n\tinstead of your 2\/3 BAB and your Strength, and the Blast is treated as a Huge\n\tcreature, making your total CMB very impressive. You don&#8217;t get to apply\n\tSearing Flesh because the blast is doing the actual grappling, but you could\n\tin theory jump into the grapple yourself if you wanted to do so. Grappling the\n\ttarget would also allow you to plant Mobile Blast on top of them for easy\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unraveling Infusion<\/span>: A weird way to add\n\tutility to your blast. Even out of combat, this is really fantastic. Need to\n\tget through ongoing magical effects? Stand around and blast them until you\n\tmanage to pass the caster level check. Out of combat you can afford to use\n\tGather Power for a full turn to allow yourself a bunch of free Burn. In combat\n\tyou&#8217;ll likely reserve this for occasional use against spellcasters and their\n\tallies, but in those cases it&#8217;s pretty fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall<\/span>: AOE, area control, and you can add in\n\tSubstance Infusions to make the effect really scary. Grappling Infusion is an\n\tobvious combo, but there&#8217;s lots of room for creativity. You&#8217;ll want to use an\n\tenergy blast for the most damage, of course. A lot of people have trouble\n\tgetting their head around the placement for effects like this because of the\n\t&#8220;appears within 30 feet&#8221; wording. You can&#8217;t place a 120 ft. line within a 60\n\tft. diameter circle. It&#8217;s not possible. The description of the effect doesn&#8217;t\n\tsay that the wall can change direction, so I would assume that it can&#8217;t. The\n\tway I read it, you only need to have one square of the wall&#8217;s area within the\n\t30 ft. range. A cautious GM might reasonably require that the middle square of\n\tthe wall is used to place the effect, which seems like a reasonable\n\tcompromise.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 6<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Brilliant Infusion<\/span>: Extremely situational,\n\tand the Burn cost is ridiculous. Since it&#8217;s effectively a 6th-level spell it\n\twill overcome most magical Darkness effects, but they&#8217;re rare enough that you\n\tprobably can&#8217;t justify spending one of your extremely limited Infusion\n\tslots.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadly Earth<\/span>: A decent AOE, good range, and\n\tit causes difficult terrain. The 1\/4 damage is disappointing, but it doesn&#8217;t\n\tallow a save. If you can force enemies to remain in the area, you can brings\n\tfoes down very quickly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disintegrating Infusion<\/span>: Force Blast&#8217;s\n\tbiggest problem is that it does half as much damage as other Composite Blasts.\n\tThis brings its damage in line with other Composite Blasts and adds the\n\tnon-damage benefits of the Disintegrate spell. However, the Burn cost is\n\textremely high and it allows a save to reduce the damage.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 7<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloud<\/span>: The same radius as Deadly Earth, but\n\tit&#8217;s spherical, can be placed in the air, and does more damage to creatures\n\tstuck inside the effect. It lacks the difficult terrain component, but it also\n\tblocks line of sight. Combine this with Deadly Earth, and you can do an absurd\n\tamount of damage to foes who will have a lot of trouble doing anything about\n\tit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explosion<\/span>: No frills, no complications. Just\n\tan AOE Blast with a Reflex save for half damage. Allowing you to alter the AOE\n\tmeans that you can select the size you need to hit as many foes and as few\n\tallies as possible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fragmentation<\/span>: If you want a 20-foot AOE,\n\tExplosion will cover that need. Adding Fragmentation&#8217;s attack mechanic\n\tintroduces an additional point of failure and reduces the potential damage you\n\tcould deal.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Pure-Flame Infusion<\/span>: You need to take Spell\n\tPenetration. If you take Spell Pentration and Greater Spell Penetration, you\n\tshould be reliable enoguh that this is a massive waste of resources.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 8<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Many Throw<\/span>: This only works with your basic\n\tTelekinetic Blast, which is unfortunate, but it&#8217;s still pretty good. Aether\n\thas almost no area effect options, so this is a must.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"utility-wild-talents\">Utility Wild Talents<\/h3>\n<p>A lot of the Kineticist is built around their Blast abilities. In fact,\n\teverything on this page until this point is about using Blasts to kill stuff.\n\tWhile blasts are neat, many problems can&#8217;t be solved with damage. That&#8217;s where\n\tutilities come in.<\/p>\n<p>This section is organized by effective spell level to help selecting the best\n\toptions at each spell level. You get a talent at every even numbered class\n\tlevel, so expect to have one talent of each spell level, plus your &#8220;basic&#8221;\n\tutility talent(s).<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-level-1\">Spell Level 1<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aerial Adaptation<\/span>: Altitude sickness almost\n\tnever comes up in a campaign, but electricity resistance is nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air Cushion<\/span>: Falling damage is an annoyance\n\tat any level, and this makes you permanently immune to it. It&#8217;s also a\n\tprerequisite for Wings of Air.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Air Shroud<\/span>: Unless your campaign involves a\n\tlot of time underwater, this is too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Air&#8217;s Leap<\/span>: Potions of Jump cost 50gp and\n\tprovide a much better bonus. Alternatively, get Wings of Air.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Air&#8217;s Reach<\/span>: The 30-foot range on blasts\n\tcan be a problem, and locking yourself into Form Infusions which extend range\n\tgreatly limits your options. 60 ft. range is enough to keep you relatively\n\tsafe from enemies at no Burn cost. However, this requires that you use blasts\n\twhich include Air, so your options may be limited if you have access to\n\tmultiple elements.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Basic Aerokinesis<\/span>: Both options are very\n\tsituational, though I admittedly love the idea of having your hair constantly\n\tblowing in the wind despite a complete lack of actual wind.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Basic Geokinesis<\/span>: Situational. If you pick\n\tup Seismic Master, you can use this to unbury things you kill so that you can\n\tloot them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Basic Hydrokinesis<\/span>: Situational, but the\n\tability to create water at will can be extremely useful if you&#8217;re clever.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Basic Pryokinesis<\/span>: Light is extremely\n\tuseful, but the fact that this version produces heat may actually make it\n\tworse. No more casting light on your hat unless you enjoy the smell of burning\n\thair.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Basic Telekinesis<\/span>: Mage hand is great, and\n\tthis adds some interesting uses and a scaling weight limit. This is the only\n\tbasic utility that scales, too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cold Adaptation<\/span>: Crucial in cold climates,\n\tand cold resistance is really nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Walk<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Fire Sculptor<\/span>: If this doesn&#8217;t work on magical fire,\n\tit&#8217;s garbage. If it does work on magical fire, you can use to reshape things\n\tlike Wall of Fire or blasts which use the Wall Infusion. Unfortunately, I\n\tthink the intent is that it only works on natural fires.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire&#8217;s Fury<\/span>: Who needs utility? Get more\n\tdamage! This won&#8217;t do anything until 3rd level, unfortunately.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Heat Adaptation<\/span>: Useful in deserts, but the\n\treal draw is fire resistance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Icewalker<\/span>: Too situational, unless you start\n\tmaking lots of wet or icy surfaces on your own using Slick, or your campaign\n\ttakes place in frozen climates.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Kinetic Cover<\/span>: This does not appear to have\n\ta duration, and does not appear to end if you use it again. Throw it up to\n\tprevent enemies from getting an attack of opportuntiy on a retreating ally.\n\tUse it to force enemies to move if they want to attack. Use it to box in\n\tenemies and prevent them from moving. There are a lot of options here, so get\n\tcreative.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skilled Kineticist<\/span>: The class skills\n\tgranted by your choice of Element are almost all terrible, with the exception\n\tof the Knowledge skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Slick<\/span>: Grease is pretty great at any level.\n\tFew creatures are decent at Acrobatics checks, especially big lumbering\n\tmonsters, so this can grant you an excellent tactical advantage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Telekinetic Finesse<\/span>: &#8220;Any sort of fine\n\tmanipulation&#8221; is an exceptionally vague description. Can you use magic items\n\tlike wands? How about weapons? I honestly don&#8217;t know how flexible this is, so\n\tI can&#8217;t asses its value.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Voice of the Wind<\/span>: Situational. This\n\tallows you to replicate a 2nd-level spell as a 1st-level spell-like ability,\n\twhich is weird, but not especially interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-level-2\">Spell Level 2<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth Climb<\/span>: If you can&#8217;t get flight, a\n\tClimb speed is a close second. Unfortunately, limiting you to earthen surfaces\n\tis a serious handicap in most campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Kinetic Healer<\/span>: The healing scales nicely\n\tsince it follows the same progression as your Blast damage. Being able to\n\toffload the Burn cost onto your allies also means that you can continue to use\n\tthis without cutting into your own daily resources. Of course, you could also\n\tget a wand of cure light wounds and fill the same need without spending a\n\ttalent slot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Searing Flame<\/span>: Fire is the most common\n\tresistance in the game, so you need every opportunity you can find to get past\n\tresistances. This may take some time to build up, and it won&#8217;t work on\n\tcreatures with immunity. Tracking the effects become a problem pretty quickly,\n\tespecially in encounters with multiple enemies, because you need to track the\n\tdurations of each round in which the reduction is applied to know when each\n\t&#8220;stack&#8221; of the effect expires. Once you have enough class levels that the\n\tduration is passable, this will allow Burning Infusion to kill enemies who\n\twould otherwise ignore it, provided that they die before Searing Flame expires\n\tor that you are able to re-apply the effect periodically.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skilled Kineticist, Greater<\/span>: Kineticists\n\tare sorely lacking for useful class skills, and Knowledge (Planes) really\n\tmakes sense for such an elemental-focused class. The additional skill to\n\treceive the Skilled Kineticist bonus can be any of your class skills,\n\tincluding those gained from traits or multiclassing. I suggest Use Magic\n\tDevice or a Knowledge Skill unless you picked up some class skills from\n\toutside the class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Haul<\/span>: No serious combat\n\tutility, but the ability to lift hundreds or even thousands of pounds of\n\tobjects is massively useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Veil of Mists<\/span>: Buy a Hat of Disguise.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 3<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aerial Evasion<\/span>: Spend a point of Burn to\n\tget Evasion for the day. It&#8217;s roughly equivalent to taking Evasion as a feat\n\tsince 1 point of Burn will offset the effects of the Toughness feat, but you\n\tcan get Evasion from a ring, and damage is easily fixed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celerity<\/span>: Haste is one of the best buffs in\n\tthe game, and if you don&#8217;t want to take the Burn you can still use this to\n\thelp your allies in fights where your blasts aren&#8217;t effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cold Snap<\/span>: -4 to Dexterity is a minor\n\tannoyance to most creatures. You might be able to use it freeze bodies of\n\twater, but that&#8217;s extremely situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Grip<\/span>: Due to the subtype\n\trequirement, this is too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Engulfing Wings<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Firesight<\/span>: The sight mechanic is\n\tsituational, but the ability to ignore concealment against creature that are\n\ton fire is deceptively useful. If you apply Burning Infusion to your blast and\n\thit a concealed creature, it&#8217;s no longer concealed to you. Can&#8217;t find the\n\tcreature? Use an AOE. The ability to see through smoke will also be useful if\n\tyou buy an Eversmoking Bottle, granting you a constant tactical advantage as\n\tlong as you keep the bottle unstoppered. Your allies will be really annoyed,\n\tbut you&#8217;ll be effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Jet<\/span>: Buy a potion of Jump if you need\n\tvertical movement. If you need horizontal movement, you can run. If it&#8217;s\n\tavailable to you, Wings of Air is clearly better. If you can&#8217;t get Wings of\n\tAir, you&#8217;ll want to pick this up so that you can get Greater Flame Jet\n\tlater.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heat Wave<\/span>: Better than cold snap,\n\tespecially since it doesn&#8217;t affect your allies unless they&#8217;re adjacent to you.\n\t120 degrees is miserable for extended periods of time, but for the duration of\n\ta fight it&#8217;s not going to matter much. The real draw is 20% miss chance. You\n\tcan&#8217;t use this to hide, unfortunately, but a 20% miss chance is still an\n\texcellent defense.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Jagged Flesh<\/span>: Couldn&#8217;t decide between Flesh\n\tof Stone and Searing Flesh? Here&#8217;s the compromise. It&#8217;s really bad. The damage\n\tdoesn&#8217;t scale and only triggers when enemies attack\/grapple you, so it&#8217;s\n\tdifficult to bring it into play reliably.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Self Telekinesis<\/span>: Flame jet minus the neat\n\tfire visual.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Smoke Storm<\/span>: Combine this with Firesight\n\tand you have an easy tactical advantage. Sickened is a good debuff, too. If\n\tyou&#8217;re worried about your allies, use Greater Air Shroud and they&#8217;ll be immune\n\tto the sickening effect. They&#8217;ll still have trouble seeing, unfortunately.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Invisibility<\/span>: In combat you\n\tstill get all of the benefits of Invisibility, though it&#8217;s easier to locate\n\tyour position. You can also hide from some creatures with blinsight and\n\tblindsense, which is nice since those creatures typically negate the\n\tadvantages of invisibility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Touchsight<\/span>: One of the Kineticist&#8217;s only\n\tways to get around invisibility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tremorsense<\/span>: One of the Kineticist&#8217;s only\n\tways to get around invisibility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Manipulator<\/span>: Too situational unless\n\tyou&#8217;re in an aquatic campaign.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Waterdancer<\/span>: Situational. The 10 foot\n\tspeed bonus is nice, but probably not enough to justify taking this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Windsight<\/span>: Situational, and extremely\n\tdependent on the DM and how much they care about weather.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings of Air<\/span>: If you can get this and you\n\tdon&#8217;t, you are a foolish person and you should strongly reconsider the way you\n\tgo about living your life. This is just insanely good. Persistent Fly with no\n\tBurn cost. I would happily pay a point of Burn every day for this and still\n\trate it blue.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-level-4\">Spell Level 4<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Enduring Earth<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t a lot of earth\n\ttalents with durations for which this matters, but many of your Infusions can\n\tbenefit greatly from this in long fights.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expanded Defense<\/span>: Many of the defense\n\ttalents are absolutely amazing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ice Sculptor<\/span>: Unless your campaign takes\n\tplace in cold climates or you do some shenanigans, this may be hard to bring\n\tinto play. If you&#8217;ve got time for some suggestions, here&#8217;s what I suggest: Use\n\tBasic Hydrokinesis to create water, then use Cold Snap to gradually freeze it,\n\tthen use Ice Sculptor to shape it into something useful. At the -10 degree\n\ttemperature cap for Cold Snap, water freezes very quickly. Not\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/xkcd.com\/526\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;spit goes clink&#8221;<\/a> quickly, but still very\n\tquickly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Shift Earth<\/span>: Usable in a wide variety of\n\tenvironments. Basically anywhere that isn&#8217;t a worked structure or in the air,\n\tyou should have some usable ground that you can raise.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Telekinetic Maneuvers<\/span>: Telekinesis is worded\n\tso that it&#8217;s not immediately clear, but you do not apply your own size\n\tmodifier to the CMB check here. You use caster level instead of your CMB (CMB\n\tnormally includes a size modifier), and add an ability modifier on top of\n\tthat. This means that you&#8217;re doing combat maneuvers as effectively as a\n\tFigher, assuming neither of you have related feats. The ability to do Dirty\n\tTrick at range if you have Telekinetic Finesse is massively useful, adding a\n\tlong list of potent status effects which you can apply.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Watersense<\/span>: This would be really great\n\tunderwater, but unless your campaign is heavily aquatic, it&#8217;s too situational\n\tto consider.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 5<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aether Puppet<\/span>: Pets are great. This has no\n\tburn cost, no maximum duration, and there&#8217;s nothing preventing you from having\n\tmore than one except the action economy. Animate an object, make it carry you\n\taround, and animate another one to fight. Spend two move actions on your turns\n\tto make both of them do stuff. You barely need to participate. The one\n\tlimitation is finding an appropriate object to animate, which isn&#8217;t always a\n\tguarantee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Air Shroud, Greater<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Earth Glide<\/span>: Flight is the best movement\n\ttype, but it has the annoying issue of being blocked by solid objects like the\n\tground. Earth Glide resolves this greatly by allowing you to move through the\n\tground. You won&#8217;t be able to breathe, but the rules for holding your breath\n\tare absurdly generous and by now you have well over 20 Constitution, and can\n\thold your breath for insane amounts of time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flame Jet, Greater<\/span>: If you can&#8217;t get wings\n\tof air, this is a close second. You can only move up to 60 feet, and it needs\n\tto be in a straight line, but even crude flight is better than walking.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flame Shield<\/span>: This is only tempting if\n\tyou&#8217;re built for melee, and even then it still carries all of the problems of\n\tSearing Flesh. You need to be hit for the effect to trigger, and you really\n\tneed to invest a lot of effort into not getting hit if you want to survive in\n\tmelee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Force Barrier<\/span>: This is unfairly good. If\n\tyou&#8217;re in a pinch, you can walk away from enemies, put up a force barrier, and\n\tbe largely unassailable for the round. Next round, walk a little further and\n\tput up a fresh sphere. Unless you spent your turn attacking, there&#8217;s\n\tessentially no reason for you to be targetable in a given round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Kinetic Form<\/span>: There is very little reason\n\tto use this for most kineticists. Large size makes you a bigger target and\n\tgives you an attack penalty. The big draws are the CMB bonus and Strength, but\n\tyou don&#8217;t get the Strength bonus. Unless you&#8217;re grappling, skip this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Self Telekinesis, Greater<\/span>: See Flame Jet,\n\tGreater.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shimmering Mirage<\/span>: 20% miss chance all day\n\tlong.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spark of Life<\/span>: All of the best parts of\n\tAether Puppet, but you don&#8217;t need to worry about finding an object to\n\tanimate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Sculptor<\/span>: Stone Shape is one of my\n\tfavorite spells, and its limited only by a spellcaster&#8217;s spell slots per day.\n\tYou face no such limitation. There isn&#8217;t even a Burn cost. Render a mountain\n\tinto neat blocks. Dismantle a castle. Burrow through dungeon walls. If your GM\n\tisn&#8217;t furious, you&#8217;re not being creative enough.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Touchsight, Reactive<\/span>: Basically a bad version\n\tof Uncanny Dodge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trail of Flames<\/span>: Wall of Fire is a fine\n\tdeterrent, but the 1-round duration won&#8217;t get you much. You could make\n\tyourself tiny and run through enemy&#8217;s squares to get the most damage possible,\n\tbut at that point just get the Wall Infusion and use a blast.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Tremorsense, Greater<\/span>: Too situational and too\n\tlimited.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Waterdancer, Greater<\/span>: Too situational unless\n\tyou&#8217;re in an aquatic campaign.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Windsight, Greater<\/span>: Seeing and hearing at a\n\tsafe distance is very useful, especially if you can see around obstacles.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-level-6\">Spell Level 6<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ice Path<\/span>: Quick, make a Frozone joke. You\n\tknow you want to. The ability to walk in the air is functionally flight. Air\n\tusers get Wings of Air, and Aether\/Fire users can use Greater Flame Jet and\n\tGreater Self Telekinesis (both of which require you to sink two talents). Ice\n\tPath costs less than Greater Flame Jet since it only takes one talent, but\n\tit&#8217;s also not as good because you can&#8217;t move as quickly and you get it\n\tlater.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ride the Blast<\/span>: This is essentially\n\tteleportation. Combine this with an Infusion which extends your Blast&#8217;s range,\n\tand you can cover great distances in one shot. Melee Kineticists absolutely\n\twant this to close large distances and get themselves into melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Suffocate<\/span>: The slow suffocation mechanic is\n\tbad. The rules for holding your breath are too generous, and you&#8217;ll spend\n\tminutes chasing enemies around trying to maintain line of effect. However, if\n\tyou spend a point of Burn this becomes a save-or-suck effect. Even if they\n\tonly fail the first save, they&#8217;re at 0 hit points. One of your allies can\n\tsurely manage to deal 1 point of damage to finish off your target.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wind Manipulator<\/span>: Create the eye around\n\tyourself and your allies, and turn up the wind force high enough to push your\n\tenemies out of attack range. Maintain the effect until your enemies fall\n\tunconcious.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 7<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shift Earth, Greater<\/span>: Situational. Unless\n\tyou&#8217;re in a war campaign, I can&#8217;t think of a case where you would need this on\n\ta regular basis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Deflection<\/span>: I wouldn&#8217;t use this\n\tunless you&#8217;re willing to accept the Burn cost to extend the duration. Using\n\tthis without the Burn cost is a waste of a turn, and the chances of actually\n\tturning a spell are random and unpredictable.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-level-8\">Spell Level 8<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reverse Shift<\/span>: Being ethereal is fantastic.\n\tWalk through walls, spy on enemies, look inside chests. Get creative; you&#8217;re\n\tbasically a ghost. Unfortunately you can&#8217;t attack into the material plane,\n\teven with Force Blast, so this won&#8217;t have offensive applications in combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Deflection<\/span>: This could be\n\tuseful if you&#8217;re in melee and have a really good AC, but most Kineticists\n\tcan&#8217;t make good use of this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Globe<\/span>: The sphere is really\n\tsmall, unfortunately, but it can still be useful. Use this to trap an enemy,\n\tlift them as high into the air as you can manage, and drop them to their\n\tdeath. If your party needs to get around and not everyone can fly, use this to\n\tcarry your party around in a nice safe bubble.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weather Master<\/span>: Situational. You could\n\tprobably use this to get some complicated benefits in certain situations, but\n\tthat&#8217;s heavily dependent on both your DM and the style of campaign you are\n\tplaying.<\/p>\n<h4>Spell Level 9<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">From the Ashes<\/span>: This will absolutely save\n\tyour life. Be sure to leave space for 2 points of Burn to use this in a\n\tpinch.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Seismic Master<\/span>: Cast an 8th-level spell at\n\twill. It&#8217;s not always usable, but when it&#8217;s usable it&#8217;s very exciting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tidal Wave<\/span>: A fairly good 9th-level spell at\n\twill, though it carries a modest Burn cost. This can clear whole encounters,\n\tnot to mention cities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The most important feature of a Kineticist is their &#8220;Wild Talents&#8221;.
