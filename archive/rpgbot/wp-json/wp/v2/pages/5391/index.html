You will have enough spell slots that you can comfortably cast spells every combat round all day long and will only rarely run out. However, this comes with its own problem: By splitting your focus you&#8217;ll fall behind on both caster level and spell DC. Because of this, Mystic Theurges need to rely on spells which don&#8217;t allow saving throws to make their huge pool of spell slots meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"class-features\">Mystic Theurge Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: d6 hit points means that you&#8217;re\n\tvery squishy. Most of the arcane spellcasting classes you&#8217;ll use can&#8217;t cast\n\tspells in armor, which further compounds your defensive issues.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 1\/2 BAB, but don&#8217;t expect\n\tto use a weapon at any point.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Only strong Will saves, but\n\tfortunately you&#8217;re working from two base classes so you&#8217;ll have strong save\n\tbonuses before you enter the prestige class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: 2+ skill points and a tiny skill list\n\twhich you&#8217;ll almost certainly already have as class skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: You&#8217;re not here for armor\n\tor weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells per Day<\/span>: This is why you play a\n\tMystic Theurge. Remember that classes like Witch and Wizard will need to find\n\tother ways to learn new spells, typically by copying them from other\n\tspellcasters&#8217; familiars\/spellbooks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Combined Spells<\/span> (Su): This is perhaps the\n\tgreatest incentive to combine a prepared caster and a spontaneous caster\n\tclass. If you use only prepared caster classes you can still prepare spells\n\tfrom one class using the other class&#8217;s spell slots, but you gain very little\n\tby doing so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Synthesis<\/span> (Su): Even with handicapped\n\tspell levels, this is more powerful than Quicken Spell and you can do it\n\twithout raising the effective level of your spells.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"base-classes\">Qualifying Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You need two base classes: an arcane class, and a divine class. Pathfinder&#8217;s list of base classes is dizzyingly long, so you have a lot of options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined Spells has some interesting interactions for combining spontaneous and prepared spellcasting, but beyond that the only significant difference is how quickly you can get into Mystic Theurge levels. Personally I prefer to stick to prepared classes because you can start Mystic Theurge at level 7, but there are some excellent reasons to wait until 8th or 9th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can qualify for Mystic Theurge using partial spellcasters like Bard and Magus, I do not recommend doing so. You&#8217;ll already be several levels behind full casters in terms of your highest spell level, and using partial caster classes further compounds the issue. These classes typically get other class features instead of spellcasting, and your Mystic Theurge levels don&#8217;t advance those features. I&#8217;ll ignore all classes except 2\/3 classes for these reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcane-classes\">Arcane Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcanist<\/span>: Intelligence-based with a\n\t\tunique preparation\/casting mechanic. The Arcanist&#8217;s unique spellcasting has\n\t\ta weird interaction with the Mystic Theurge&#8217;s Combined Spells feature. As\n\t\tfar as I can tell, you prepare Arcanist spells, and if your divine class is\n\t\tspontaneous you can use those spell slots to cast any of your prepared\n\t\tArcanist spells. Aside from this amusing interaction, the Arcanist is\n\t\tbasically just a worse version of Wizard with the Exploiter Wizard\n\t\tarchetype. You get one more Arcanist Exploit than a Wizard could, but you\n\t\tget spells a level later and you enter Mystic Theurge a level later. If you\n\t\twant more exploits, take Extra Arcanist Exploit. Because Arcanists need\n\t\tCharisma for their exploits, consider pairing the Arcanist with the\n\t\tOracle.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Charisma-based spontaneous. You\n\t\tget your first and second bloodline powers before you switch into Mystic\n\t\tTheurge.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline: Celestial (Wildblooded: Empyreal)<\/span>: This options switches the Sorcerer&#8217;s spellcasting ability to Wisdom.\n\t\t\tEvery divine spellcasting class is Wisdom-based except the Oracle.\n\t\t\tSuddenly all of your spellcasting is Wisdom-based, which makes it much\n\t\t\teasier to boost your spell DCs, bonus spells slots, etc.<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Witch<\/span>: Intelligence-based prepared. You\n\t\tget two hexes and a familiar. Your familiar is going to spend a lot of time\n\t\thiding because its abilities won&#8217;t advance, and many Witch hexes depend on\n\t\tWitch class levels to remain effective. However, there are some notable\n\t\texceptions like Evil Eye, Fortune, and Misfortune which remain useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wizard<\/span>: Intelligence-based prepared.\n\t\tWizard spellcasting is among the best in the game, but you won&#8217;t get much\n\t\tout of other class features. Arcane Bond&#8217;s item option will work great, but\n\t\tavoid familiars and pick a school with a good 1st-level ability.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Archetype: Exploiter Wizard<\/span>: Arcane\n\t\t\t\tPool can be a helpful way to boost your problematic caster level and\n\t\t\t\tspell DCs. You only get one Arcanist Exploit, but a few are still\n\t\t\t\tworthwhile. Potent Magic will double the effectiveness of using your\n\t\t\t\tArcane Pool to boost your caster level and spell DCs, which is nice\n\t\t\t\tsince you won&#8217;t get more than 4 points.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Archetype: Spell Sage<\/span>: The ability to\n\t\t\t\tboost your caster level will work better as an Exploiter Wizard, and\n\t\t\t\tSpell Study is pointless since you&#8217;re already going to be taking a\n\t\t\t\tdivine spellcasting class.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divine-classes\">Divine Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cleric<\/span>: Wisdom-based prepared. Your cleric\n\t\tclass features aside from spellcasting will do very little for you, but the\n\t\tspell list is the real draw. It&#8217;s interesting to note that because your\n\t\tdomain spells are prepared, you can use spell slots from your arcane casting\n\t\tclass to cast those spells more than you might be able to if you were a\n\t\tsingle-class cleric.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Archetype: Ecclesitheurge<\/span>: You won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tbe able to wear armor or shields or use weapons anyway, so giving them\n\t\t\t\tup costs you nothing. You don&#8217;t get a lot back that the Mystic Theurge\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t already do, unfortunately.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Druid<\/span>: Wisdom-based prepared. Druids\n\t\thave a really neat spell list with a lot of really interesting options, but\n\t\ttheir low-level class features aren&#8217;t helpful and they&#8217;re really dependent\n\t\ton having high-level spells to make their spellcasting effective. I would\n\t\ttake a Cleric with the Animal domain long before considering druid.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Oracle<\/span>: Charisma-based spontaneous. The\n\t\tprimary reason to choose Oracle over Cleric is for Revelations. Some of them\n\t\tare fantastic without needing to scale based on Oracle class levels.\n\t\tHowever, you&#8217;re still going to be a spell level behind cleric, which may be\n\t\ta deal-breaker for you. If you want to rely on a single ability score,\n\t\tOracle-Sorcerer is an option.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dual-Cursed Oracle<\/span>: The Mistfortune\n\t\t\t\trevelation is <em>insanely<\/em> good, and it could help compensate for\n\t\t\t\tyour relatively poor save DCs.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shaman<\/span>: Wisdom-based prepared. The\n\t\tShaman is a weird class. Their spell list looks like the Druid&#8217;s, and they\n\t\tget hexes like the Witch. The spell list is still the primary draw here, so\n\t\tthe Shaman has all the same problems that the Druid does.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your ability scores are going to vary depending on your base classes. Generally you want to start with 16 or better in each of your spellcasting abilities, and put whatever you have left into Dexterity and Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of race depends entirely on your base casting classes. If you can find a race which works well for both of your base classes, you&#8217;ve found a great race. If you find a race that works for at least one of your base classes, you&#8217;ve found a good race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mystic Theurge is among the only builds where I recommend the Human variant racial trait which gives you two flexible +2 ability score increases. There are very few races with +2 to two mental ability scores, which is what you want most from a race.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Knack<\/span> (Magic): You&#8217;re going to\n\t\tgive up 3 or 4 caster levels from two classes, and this is one of very few\n\t\tways to recover the missing caster levels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your skill options vary too much for me to meaningfully address. Your list of skills and your ranks will vary wildly depending on your choice of base classes. Skills are secondary to the class&#8217;s function, and I fully believe that you are capable of sorting out your skill ranks based on what you know of your base classes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Penetration<\/span>: Late in the game a lot\n\t\tof monsters will have Spell Resistance. You will need this feat at some\n\t\tpoint.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Spell Penetration<\/span>: Spell\n\t\t\t\tPenetration is likely plenty, but another +2 never hurts if you have a\n\t\t\t\tfree feat.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Stop.
