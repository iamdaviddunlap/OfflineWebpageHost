It fixes the Fighter&#8217;s issues with mobility, and makes the Fighter one of the most mobile characters in the game. Even with this improvement, the Mobile Fighter doesn&#8217;t sacrifice the Fighter&#8217;s excellent build versatility, and in many ways enhances the Fighter&#8217;s already formidable capabilities as a Defender and Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Taking inspiration from the Mobile Fighter&#8217;s abilities, we can divine Mobile Fighter builds into three options: TWF builds (lots of movement and lots of attacks), Two-Handed builds (a little movement, few attacks with high damage, and whirlwind attack), and the Switch Hitter (Double weapons to fight like TWF, but Whirlwind and make Attacks of Opportunity Two-Handed).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 hit points like nearly\n\tevery other front-line class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Full BAB.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Good fortitude saves, but many\n\tfighters have major problems with Reflex and Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: All armor and shields,\n\tinclude Tower shields, and martial weapons. The fighter has a huge variety of\n\toptions, and with plenty of bonus feats they can supplement these options with\n\texotic weapon proficiency.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Likely the worst skill list in the\n\tgame, and Fighters often dump intelligence to 7. 2+ skill ranks is almost\n\tnothing, but many fighters still can&#8217;t find a good way to use all of their\n\tskill ranks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Bonus feats are why most people\n\tplay a Fighter (or at least take a class dip). With a feat at level one and\n\tanother at every even-numbered class level, the Fighter gets a total of 22\n\tfeats by level 20 (23 for humans), giving you a dizzying number of options. On\n\ttop of this, the fighter gets a free retraining option every 4 levels which\n\tallows you to pick up feats with high prerequisites by trading in low-level\n\tfeats which aren&#8217;t paying off anymore. Do silly things like trade in Toughness\n\tfor Improved Critical at level 8.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Training<\/span> (Ex): This greatly reduces\n\tthe need for Mithral armor, and makes Dexterity much more important for\n\tFighters than it is for other heavily armored characters. Unfortunately you\n\tonly get the first two steps, but the ability to move at full speed in armor\n\tworks very well for the mobile fighter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Mastery<\/span> (Ex): A bit late in the game,\n\tbut DR\/- is always welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetype-features\">Mobile Fighter Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Agility<\/span> (Ex): Situational. About as useful\n\tas Bravery.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Leaping Attack<\/span> (Ex): Use your 5 foot step,\n\tand get weapon training with any weapon. This is great if you like to use\n\tdifferent weapons to fit the situation, or if you&#8217;re avoiding weapon\n\tfocus\/specialization.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapid Attack<\/span> (Ex): Like a beautiful\n\tcombination of pounce and spring attack. You give up one attack at your\n\thighest attack bonus, but you could run around with two weapons and attack\n\teveryone in the room if you felt the need to do so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fleet Footed<\/span> (Ex): Very suddenly you&#8217;re fast\n\tand good at acrobatics. Acrobatics isn&#8217;t a class skill, which is annoying, but\n\tyou can fix that with a trait.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Whirlwind Blitz<\/span> (Ex): Almost as good as\n\tpounce if you just want full attacks, and it makes Whirlwind Attack\n\tconsiderably better.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compatible-archetypes\">Compatible Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Mobile Fighter&#8217;s abilities strongly resemble those of other Fighters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Strength is key for Two-Handed Mobile\n\tFighters, and even TWF Mobile Fighters should consider a bit of Strength to\n\tget Power Attack. Most TWF characters don&#8217;t rely on Power Attack for damage\n\tbecause they can&#8217;t spare the attack penalty, but Fighters get enough bonuses\n\tto hit that Power Attack is viable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity is great for the Mobile\n\tFighter. Two-Handed Mobile Fighters should start with 12 to max out their Full\n\tPlate, but TWF mobile fighters will want considerably more to qualify for\n\tfeats.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are crucial for Fighters\n\tbecause they tend to be the party&#8217;s front line.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: The Fighter&#8217;s skills are garbage, and\n\tyou can&#8217;t get less than one skill rank.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Only needed for Will saves, but don&#8217;t\n\tdump it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Worthless unless you plan to use\n\tIntimidate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 18<\/li>\n<li>Con: 16<\/li>\n<li>Int: 7<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 13<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 18<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 7<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 13<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 17<\/li>\n<li>Con: 16<\/li>\n<li>Int: 7<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Two-Weapon<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 18<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 16<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 18<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 17<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 7<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 15<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Two-Handed<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 17<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 13<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 7<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 13<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Switch Hitter<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Speed is important to a Mobile Fighter, but any race which works for a\n\tFighter can be made to work for the Mobile Fighter. Access to a racial double\n\tweapon can also be helpful for TWF switch-hitter builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: While normally a great Fighter, the\n\tDwarf&#8217;s slow speed limits its effectiveness as a Mobile Fighter, but the Dwarf\n\tcan still be fantastic as a Two-Handed fighter, and the Dwarven Urgrosh offers\n\tan enticing option for a TWF build which can still use Whirlwind Attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The Elf is primarily a spellcasting\n\trace, but with some alternate racial traits the Elf can make a decent finesse\n\tfighter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: The Gnome is not a great Fighter.\n\tWith a penalty to Strength and a bonus to Charisma, the Gnome has very little\n\tto offer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The Half-Elf is versatile,\n\tespecially with some alternate racial traits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Orc<\/span>: A flexible ability bonus and\n\tDarkvision are both great for the Fighter. The other racial bonuses also play\n\twell to the Fighter&#8217;s strengths, and the racial bonus to Intimidate can offset\n\tdumping Charisma. The Half-Orc also gets the Orcish Double-Axe as a martial\n\tweapon, which can be a good option for TWF builds that still want to use\n\tWhirlwind attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Your best bet for a small\n\tFighter, the Strength penalty is offset by the Dexterity bonus, making the\n\tHalfling a great option for TWF Striker builds. The Halfling&#8217;s small size\n\tprovides a bonus to AC and attacks, and with an alternate racial trait you can\n\tfix the Halfling&#8217;s slow speed, making it just as mobile as most medium\n\traces.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: An extra bonus feat gets your build\n\tup and running a level earlier, and the bonus skill rank applies after your 7\n\tintelligence drops your class skill ranks to 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): Only useful for\n\t\tmounted builds, and other classes (like the Cavalier or Paladin) do mounter\n\t\tcombat much better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): The fighter&#8217;s only\n\t\tsocial skill, and some builds can work Intimidate into combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (dungeoneering)<\/span> (Int): One of\n\t\tthe best Knowledge skills.

Kikko is cheaper and\n\t\tless restricting than Scale Mail, but use Scale Mail is eastern armor is\n\t\tprohibited.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield<\/span>: Unless you plan to use TWF with\n\t\tshields, forgo shields. Armor Training will help your armor to make up the\n\t\tAC bonus, and you will get a wonderful return on investment for using your\n\t\tother hand for a real weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Breastplate \/ Lamellar (Steel)<\/span>: A solid\n\t\tbet for TWF builds, Armor Training will further expand the Maximum Dexterity\n\t\tBonus to allow room for your growing Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Breastplate \/ Lamellar (Steel)<\/span>:\n\t\tFor TWF builds you will likely want to upgrade to Mithral because Mobile\n\t\tFighters don&#8217;t get Armor Training 3 and 4. A total Max Dex of +7 should be\n\t\tplenty, and even without a shield your AC should be great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Kikko<\/span>: Slightly more Maximum\n\t\tDexterity than the Breastplate, so if your Dexterity is really good,\n\t\tconsider this instead. Even if your Dexterity goes above +8, don&#8217;t bother\n\t\tswitching to light armor. Thanks to Armor Training, Haramaki is the only way\n\t\tto beat Mithral Breastplate, and you would need a dex bonus of +12 to match\n\t\tKikko. Even at 20th level, that&#8217;s hard to do without becoming very\n\t\texpensive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Full Plate<\/span>: The go-to armor for two-handed\n\t\tbuilds. Armor Training will expand the Maximum Dexterity Bonus, but don&#8217;t\n\t\tfeel compelled to enhance your Dexterity until fairly high level if you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t afford it. The Max Dex will cap at +3, which is fine even with a Belt\n\t\tof Physical Perfection +6 because you will probably want to be permanently\n\t\tenlarged, dropping your Dexterity back down to 16.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Runner&#8217;s Shirt<\/span>: Even before the\n\t\terrata, the Mobile Fighter was one of the terribly few builds which didn&#8217;t\n\t\tsignificantly benefit from the Quick Runner&#8217;s Shirt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Mobile Fighter doesn&#8217;t really need anything from other classes, but if you want to explore other classes I recommend waiting until you pick up Rapid Attack at level 11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Half-Orc Switch-Hitter<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>You&#8217;ve got about three seconds before I kill everyone in the room.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mobile Fighter is good for almost as many builds as the vanilla Fighter, and the double weapon switch-hitter concept is perhaps on the of the most interesting, though perhaps not the most effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build makes the somewhat questionable assumption that you can use a double weapon to make two-handed attacks of opportunity. It&#8217;s not crucial to the build, but the extra damage is an excellent improvement to the build&#8217;s function as a combination Defender\/Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build will use the favored bonus to gain additional hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We will assume the 25-point buy abilities suggested above for switch hitters, but the other suggested abilities can also use this build without any problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we will want 19 Dexterity to fill out the Two-Weapon Fighting feats, we can stop improving Dexterity at 20, but that will still take all of our ability score increases through level 12. With a belt we can expect it to reach 26 at high levels. If you want to be permanently enlarged (I strongly recommend it on this build because reach is great), use Breastplate for your armor. If you&#8217;re happy at medium size, use Kikko.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Half-Orc. In addition to some cool miscellaneous bonuses, the Half-Orc gets the Orc Double Axe as a martial weapon, saving us a feat which we would have to spend as a Human. The Half-Orc racial ability bonus can go into Strength, bringing Strength to 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Half-Orc&#8217;s alternate racial traits offer some interesting options worth of consideration. Chain Fighter allows us to replace the Orc Double Axe with the Dire Flail, which is nice if you want to use combat maneuvers. Sacred Tattoo offers an excellent bonus to saving throws which we can boost further by taking the &#8220;Fate&#8217;s Favored&#8221; trait in place of Indomitable Faith. If you don&#8217;t plan to use Intimidate, consider Shaman&#8217;s Apprentice. Endurance is a terrible feat, but it&#8217;s a prerequisite for some more interesting options. Skilled brings the Half-Orc closer to the human, and because we&#8217;re using the Orc Double Axe makes all of the other Half-Orc racial abilities effectively free compared to the Human. Toothy can get you an extra attack, but be careful not to give up Darkvision if your party does a lot of fighting inside.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With only one skill rank, we have very few options. One rank into Knowledge (Dungeoneering) will let us make occasional checks, but let&#8217;s put the rest of our ranks into Acrobatics.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Reckless and Indomitable Faith. Reckless gets use a total +4 bonus to Acrobatics, and Indomitable Faith helps with the Fighter&#8217;s poor Will saves.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table zebra-striped is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat: Power Attack<\/li>\n<li>Bonus Feat: Weapon Focus (Orc Double Axe)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At level 1, using your axe two-handed will work much better than two-weapon fighting.

If you really like Dexterity you might continue to increase it at level 16 and 20, but that late in the game it&#8217;s an annoying disruption to your build that encourages you to replace the magic armor you have likely been wearing for 10+ levels.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Mobile Fighter is a fantastic archetype. It fixes the Fighter&#8217;s issues with mobility, and makes the Fighter one of the most mobile characters in the game. Even with this improvement, the Mobile Fighter doesn&#8217;t sacrifice the Fighter&#8217;s excellent build versatility, and in many ways enhances the Fighter&#8217;s already formidable capabilities as a Defender and Striker. Taking inspiration from the Mobile Fighter&#8217;s abilities, we can divine Mobile Fighter builds into three options: TWF builds (lots of movement and lots of attacks), Two-Handed builds (a little movement, few attacks with high damage, and whirlwind attack), and the Switch Hitter (Double
