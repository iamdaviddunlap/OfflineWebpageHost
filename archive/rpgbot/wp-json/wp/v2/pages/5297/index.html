Similar to the Fighter, the Paladin makes an effective Defender and Striker, but the Paladin&#8217;s other options also allow them to serve as a Face and as a Healer, though you&#8217;ll need to take traits to get missing class skills to serve as a Face, and a Paladin can&#8217;t match the healing capacity of a full caster like a Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a fairly narrow set of roles, the Paladin&#8217;s natural survivability and self-sufficiency make it an excellent choice for single-character campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Good Fortitude and\n\tWill saves, and Divine Grace adds an enormous bonus that stacks with nearly\n\teverything else.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor, shields, and\n\tmartial weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: 2+ skill ranks and a very sparse\n\tskill list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Aura of Good<\/span> (Ex): Almost never matters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Detect Evil<\/span> (Sp): Not always important, but\n\tI have seen plenty of Paladins walk into social situations with this running\n\tso that they know who they can trust, and who needs a good smiting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Smite Evil<\/span> (Sp): A fantastic offensive\n\toption.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Grace<\/span> (Su): One of the Paladin&#8217;s best\n\tabilities, this adds a huge bonus to your saving throws.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lay on Hands<\/span> (Su): An excellent healing\n\tmechanic. Mercies allow you to remove harmful conditions, and you can use it\n\ton yourself as a swift action so that you don&#8217;t have to cut into your full\n\tattack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Courage<\/span> (Su): Situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Health<\/span> (Ex): Diseases become more\n\tcommon at high levels, which can make this very useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mercy<\/span> (Su): Mercies offer the ability to\n\theal conditions which normally require a Cleric. However, remember that your\n\tpaladin spells can often handle the same conditions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Base\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fatigued<\/span>: Fatigued is one of the least\n\t\t\t\tproblematic conditions in the game for everyone except barbarians.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shaken<\/span>: Frustrating, and effects which\n\t\t\t\tcause you to be shaken can have fairly long durations. Aura of Courage\n\t\t\t\tshould improve your party&#8217;s saves against these effects, but it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\twork for Intimidate and it&#8217;s not 100% effective.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sickened<\/span>: Effects which cause\n\t\t\t\tSickened tend to have fairly short durations, but there are annoying\n\t\t\t\texceptions and being Sickened for a long time can be a significant\n\t\t\t\tdebuff.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>6th-level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dazed<\/span>: Effects which cause Dazed it\n\t\t\t\ttend to have very short durations, but losing a turn always hurts. Of\n\t\t\t\tcourse, if you&#8217;re spending your Standard action to remove Dazed, you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tprobably losing the same amount of actions by spending your turn healing\n\t\t\t\tthe target.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diseased<\/span>: Diseases can be annoying to\n\t\t\t\tdeal with, and some have horrifying secondary effects like Blinding\n\t\t\t\tSickness. Paladins also can&#8217;t cast Remove Disease.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Staggered<\/span>: Staggered still allows\n\t\t\t\tyou to take actions, and effects which cause it tend to have very short\n\t\t\t\tdurations. The exception is being at 0 hit points, which will be\n\t\t\t\tresolved by the healing from Lay on Hands.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>9th-level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cursed<\/span>: Curses are permanent and\n\t\t\t\tdebilitating, but Paladins can also cast Remove Curse.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Exhausted<\/span>: Go take a nap.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Frightened<\/span>: Potions of Remove Fear cost\n\t\t\t\t50 gp. Go buy one.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nauseated<\/span>: Effects which cause\n\t\t\t\tnauseated tend to have very short durations, though exceptions like\n\t\t\t\tStinking Cloud exist.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Poisoned<\/span>: Poison will very rarely\n\t\t\t\tkill your party, but sometimes it gets scary.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>12th-level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blinded<\/span>: Being blind sucks, and it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\toften permanent.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deafened<\/span>: Being deaf is annoying at\n\t\t\t\tworst.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Paralyzed<\/span>: A paralyzed character is\n\t\t\t\tjust waiting for a coup de grace.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stunned<\/span>: Being stunned makes you\n\t\t\t\textremely vulnerable to attack.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Positive Energy<\/span> (Su): Paladins\n\taren&#8217;t great at channeling energy, but if you need to heal more than two\n\tpeople in the party it&#8217;s more efficient than use Lay on Hands on each of them.\n\tIf you insist on using Channel Energy, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/channel_energy\">Practical Guide to Channel Energy<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spells<\/span>: Paladins are 1\/2 casters, and get\n\tvery few spells per day from a limited spell list. However, their spell\n\tselection complements their other abilities really well. They get almost no\n\tutility options, but they get spells which help them serve as healers,\n\tstrikers, and defenders. See the &#8220;Spells&#8221; section, below, for some notable\n\tspells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Sp): Both options are\n\tfantastic. The ability to enhance your weapon can solve a lot of problems,\n\tincluding DR, but a mount is an essential part of any mounted combat build.\n\tFor help with the Paladins&#8217;s Mount, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/animal_companions\">Practical Guide to Animal Companions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spells<\/span>: Paladins only go up to 4th-level\n\tspells, but what little spellcasting they get can be very effective is used\n\tcarefully. Paladins cast spells at a caster level 3 lower than their class\n\tlevel, which seriously handicaps their spells, so consider the Magical Knack\n\ttrait to boost your caster level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Aura of Resolve<\/span> (Su): Charm effects are very\n\trare.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Justice<\/span> (Su): Fantastic, but\n\tremember that allies must still use a swift action to activate Smite Evil.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Faith<\/span> (Su): Fantastic for combating\n\tevil-aligned outsiders, and saves you the trouble of casting Bless Weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Righteousness <\/span> (Su): DR 5\/evil will\n\tprotect you from everything except enemy divine spellcasters and evil\n\toutsiders like demons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Holy Champion<\/span> (Su): Good, but not great.\n\tThe Banishment effect forcibly ends your Smite even if it fails, and you can&#8217;t\n\tchoose to forego the effect. Personally I would rather outright kill the\n\toutsider so that it can&#8217;t come back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Paladin abilities look similar to any other melee martial character, but Divine Grace drastically reduces the need for Dexterity and Wisdom to fix bad saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Paladins are almost exclusively melee\n\tcharacters, so Strength is essential.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: In heavy armor and with Divine Grace,\n\tDexterity isn&#8217;t paticularly important.

The bonuses\n\tto Constitution and Wisdom offset most of the lost bonus from Divine Grace,\n\tand the Dwarf&#8217;s other abilities complement the Paladin&#8217;s natural durability\n\tvery well. Unfortunately the Dwarf favored class bonus adds to Concentration,\n\twhich is nearly worthless for Paladins.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: Nothing useful for the Paladin, and\n\tbonuses to two of the Paladin&#8217;s least important abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: Bonuses to Constitution and Charisma\n\tare enough to offset the penalty to Strength, making the Gnome a solid choice\n\tfor small Paladins. This can be helpful for mounted combat builds because you\n\tcan fit into spaces which are too small for horses. The Gnome favored class\n\tbonus improves the healing\/damage provided by Lay on Hands.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tnice, and the Half-Elf has some nice alternate racial features which can work\n\twell for the Paladin. The Half-Elf&#8217;s favored class bonus expands the area of\n\tthe Paladin&#8217;s auras. Considering the Paladin has 5 auras (not counting Aura of\n\tGood), this can be a fantastic buff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Flexible ability bonus and some\n\tnice racial abilities which complement the Paladin well. Unfortunately, the\n\tHalf-Orc favored class bonus is awful, so take the Human favored class bonus\n\tinstead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: A little less effective than the\n\tGnome because the Dexterity bonus isn&#8217;t as helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always a good option, and the Human\n\tfavored class bonus adds energy resistance to one type of energy. Pick up a\n\tfew points in the four basic energy types (acid, cold, electricity, fire), but\n\tdon&#8217;t worry about sonic. Remember that this resistance stacks with magical\n\tenergy resistance such as the Resist Energy spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (Combat): Paladins spend a\n\t\tlot of time in melee by themselves, so this can pay off frequently if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have any other melee allies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): Reflex saves are\n\t\tyour worst save, though they&#8217;ll still be fantastic thanks to Divine\n\t\tGrace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Birthmark<\/span> (Faith): Charm and compulsion\n\t\teffects are scary, but you have Divine grace and good Will saves. The free\n\t\tholy symbol is neat, but not really necessary.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Omen<\/span> (Faith): Intimidate is one of your\n\t\tmissing Face skills. On top of the usual +1 bonus and free class skill, you\n\t\talso get to Demoralize once per day as a swift action!<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Knack<\/span> (Magic): +2 caster level\n\t\tadds hours to your buffs. Nearly every Paladin should take this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dangerously Curious<\/span> (Magic): A weird\n\t\tchoice for a Paladin, but you have the Charisma to use UMD, and it&#8217;s still\n\t\tthe best skill in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unscathed<\/span> (Magic): If you&#8217;re human, this\n\t\tis a close contender with Magical Knack. The human favored class bonus is an\n\t\teasy way to get a few points of energy resistance in every type, and this\n\t\tcan up to quintuple its effectiveness if you pick up 1 point of resistance\n\t\tto all 5 energy damage types. Even if you skip sonic damage you&#8217;re still\n\t\tgetting 8 levels worth of favored class bonus out of one trait. Normally I\n\t\tdon&#8217;t worry about sonic damage, but I think you can spare one point to get 3\n\t\tpoints of resistance, especially for the smug satisfaction of telling people\n\t\tthat you&#8217;ve got sonic damage resistance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bully<\/span> (Social): Omen is better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Talker<\/span> (Social): Bluff is one of\n\t\tyour missing Face skills, though as a Paladin you may have moral obejctions\n\t\tto lying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Influence<\/span> (Social): Pick up whichever\n\t\tmissing Face skill you didn&#8217;t already get.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Seeker<\/span> (Social): The most rolled skill in\n\t\tgame.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Unpredictable<\/span> (Social): Bluff is one of\n\t\tyour missing Face skills, though as a Paladin you may have moral obejctions\n\t\tto lying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brute<\/span> (Half-orc Racial): Omen is\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any\n\t\tFace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): Helpful for\n\t\ttraining and handling your mount, but you likely won&#8217;t need to maximize\n\t\tit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): A helpful supplement to\n\t\tmagical healing, but Paladins typically dump Wisdom, so they won&#8217;t be as\n\t\teffective as someone with a decent Wisdom score.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (nobility)<\/span> (Int): Situational,\n\t\tand very depenedent on your campaign.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (religion)<\/span> (Int): One of the\n\t\tmost important Knowledge skills in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Useful if you take the Mount\n\t\toption of Divine Bond, but otherwise useless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Helpful for any\n\t\tFace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Situational, and Paladins\n\t\taren&#8217;t particularly suited to do anything with the information which they\n\t\tcould gain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Paladins fight much like a fighter with a similar combat strategy would, so your feats will frequently depend on your combat style.

If you feel absolutely\n\t\tcompelled to pick up additional mercies, buy a Merciful Baldric.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Radiant Charge<\/span>: Consumes all of your\n\t\tremaining uses of Lay on Hands for the day, so you can only use it once per\n\t\tday. The most efficient use is to use it with your final charge of Lay on\n\t\tHands, but that makes it really hard to find time to use the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reward of Grace<\/span>: Probably only useful if\n\t\tyou use Lay on Hands on yourself a lot.

If you plan to use combat maneuvers, the Guisarme is\n\t\tan obvious choice, but beyond that polearms are largely interchangeable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scimitar<\/span>: A slightly low damage die, but\n\t\tthe threat range will pay off better beyond low levels when your bonus\n\t\tdamage eclipses your weapon&#8217;s base damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hide<\/span>: Good, cheap starting armor if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t want to spend the gold to get four-mirror.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Four-Mirror<\/span>: The best AC bonus which you\n\t\tcan afford at level 1.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heavy Shield<\/span>: Unless you plan to use a\n\t\ttwo-handed weapon, a heavy shield is a good choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Full Plate<\/span>: The best armor you can\n\t\tget.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section won&#8217;t address every spell on your spell list, but it will point out some especially notable options. For a complete list of spells, see the <a href=\"http:\/\/legacy.aonprd.com\/indices\/spelllists.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SRD Spell Index<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Challenge Evil<\/span>: Extremely tempting, but\n\t\tsince Paladins don&#8217;t have supremacy-caster Charisma and since they get spell\n\t\tlevels so late the DC is going to be really low. Don&#8217;t expect this to work\n\t\treliably. Even when it does work, it only causes Sickened, which may not be\n\t\tenough of a deterrent to force targets to attack you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Compel Hostility<\/span>: A fantastic option for\n\t\tdefenders. You&#8217;ll have trouble with your spell DC, but since you can use\n\t\tyour Immediate Action every round to try to affect an attack, it&#8217;s likely\n\t\tthat at least some of the saves will fail.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hero&#8217;s Defiance<\/span>: You need this, without\n\t\tquestion. This means that you can afford to spend your swift action on\n\t\tsomething other than healing, even if your hit points are getting low.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Honeyed Tongue<\/span>: Excellent for a Face, but\n\t\tI would only prepare this if you have time to rest before going into a\n\t\tseries of negotiations or something of the sort.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knight&#8217;s Calling<\/span>: More effective than\n\t\tChallenge Evil, but only one round duration and all of the same DC issues.\n\t\tIf it works, it&#8217;s fantastic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire of Entanglement<\/span>: Paladins always have\n\t\ttrouble with spell DCs, but even if the target succeds they&#8217;re still\n\t\tentangled for one round. An absolutely essential way to keep enemies pinned\n\t\tdown. If you can cast this repeatedly, you can hold enemies in place\n\t\tindefinitely.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Litany of Righteousness<\/span>: If paladins didn&#8217;t\n\t\tsuck at spell DCs, this would be an amazing way to boost your charge\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Paladin&#8217;s Sacrifice<\/span>: Only works once per\n\t\tcasting, but as an immediate action you can use this whenever you need it.\n\t\tPaladins are notoriously hard to kill, so this extends that durability to\n\t\tyour allies. Remember that immediate actions cost your swift action in the\n\t\tfollowing turn, so you won&#8217;t be able to spend a swift action to use Lay on\n\t\tHands in the following turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Righteous Vigor<\/span>: Combined with Smite Evil\n\t\tthis is an absolutely amazing option. The temporary hit points will allow\n\t\tyou to focus completely on attacking, and the scaling attack bonus will make\n\t\tyour attacks extremely reliable. Stand toe-to-toe with the scariest enemy\n\t\tyou can find.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saddle Surge<\/span>: Absolutely essential for\n\t\tmounted builds. The damage should be multiplied by Spirited Charge and by\n\t\tusing a lance. Get as far back as you can, boost your mount&#8217;s speed as much\n\t\tas possible, and get a massive damage spike on your charge. A horse has 50\n\t\tbase speed, so you can move 100 ft. on a charge. Horsehsooes of speed add\n\t\tanother 30 feet. Imagine charging 160 feet, adding 32 to your normal damage,\n\t\tthen trippling all of it. Horrifying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Other<\/span>: You have the ability to\n\t\theal yourself as a swift action, so absorbing some damage dealt to an ally\n\t\tmeans that you can effectively heal that damage as a swift action. This\n\t\tmeans that you&#8217;re spending your turns fighting stuff instead of healing your\n\t\tallies. However, it can be difficult to know which ally to use this on. You\n\t\tmay use this and find that it never comes into play.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deadly Juggernaut<\/span>: In an encounter with\n\t\tseveral weak foes to feed into this spell, this is absolutely amazing. Luck\n\t\tbonuses are hard to find, and luck bonuses to damage are even less common.\n\t\tWith minutes per level duration, you may be able to carry it into multiple\n\t\tencounters with a single casting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire of Judgement<\/span>: By this level\n\t\tcreatures should nearly always pass your spell saves, so you&#8217;ll only get one\n\t\tround out of this. Even if the creature fails the save, 1d6 damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tmuch of a deterrant unless the creature has a huge number of attacks. Still,\n\t\ta swift action casting time makes this reasonably viable if you can make the\n\t\t1-round duration work for you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Weapon, Greater<\/span>: With hours per\n\t\tlevel duration, there&#8217;s no excuse to buy a magic weapon with more than a +1\n\t\tenhancement bonus. If you have a full caster willing to cast this for you,\n\t\tlet them do it. If not, plan to cast this spell every day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sanctify Armor<\/span>: Effectively Magic\n\t\tVestments, but with minutes\/level duration and the DR component if you use\n\t\tSmite Evil.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blaze of Glory<\/span>: This is a complicated\n\t\tspell, and I&#8217;m not sure how effective it will be in real play. Generally I\n\t\twould rather use Hero&#8217;s Defiance when I hit 0 hit points, but if you have\n\t\tmultiple allies unconcious this might turn the tide of a fight. The damage\n\t\tis neat, but not significant enough to realistically kill anything. The\n\t\tprayer effect is great, and doesn&#8217;t appear to be affected by a saving throw.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Break Enchanment<\/span>: By this level, other\n\t\tspellcasters will easily outpace the maximum caster level bonus on Break\n\t\tEnchantment, so you&#8217;ll have trouble using this effectively.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fire of Vengeance<\/span>: Swift action, no save,\n\t\tno spell resistance, and 3d8 damage is enough to be a passable deterrant.\n\t\tHowever, it only works on one attack. Fire of Judgement may actually be\n\t\tbetter unless your foe is especially low on hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Sword<\/span>: Really good, but standard\n\t\taction to cast and only rounds\/level duration mean that it will be hard to\n\t\tbring this into play easily without cutting into your normal actions. The\n\t\teffects also overlap the weapon option for Divine Bond, allowing you turn a\n\t\tmundane weapon into a truly terrifying magic weapon in a hurry.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resounding Blow<\/span>: Easy to overlook, but\n\t\twith a swift action casting time Resounding Blow is a great combat buff.\n\t\tRounds\/level duration and 1d6 damage per attack means that you can get an\n\t\timpressive amount of extra damage out of this. The stun effect works even\n\t\tagainst creatures which you&#8217;re not smiting, so strongly consider using a\n\t\tweapon with a high critical threat range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sacrificial Oath<\/span>: A lot like Shield\n\t\tOther, but you can choose to take the effects, and it also works on failed\n\t\tsaving throws. If you&#8217;re prepared to absorb everything that targets a\n\t\tcreature, this is the way to do it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Holy Avenger<\/span>: +5 Holy cold iron is pretty\n\t\tgreat on its own, but the ability to cast Greater Dispel Magic as many times\n\t\tas you want is absolutely astounding. You&#8217;re limited to the area version,\n\t\tbut that&#8217;s still enough to do this like dispel static magic effects or\n\t\tdebuff rooms full of buffed enemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Champion<\/span> (+1): A +2 bonus to AC against\n\t\tthe target of your smite is nice, but a flat +1 will be much more beneficial\n\t\tunless you&#8217;re somehow able to smite in nearly every fight.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection<\/span>: Even though Smite provides a\n\t\tDeflection bonus, a ring of protection is still a good investment since you\n\t\twon&#8217;t be able to smite every enemy you face. You also have Protection From\n\t\tGood\/Law, which can provide the same bonus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rods\">Rods<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic (Any)<\/span>: Metamagic rods in\n\t\tPathfinder are cheap, and since your spellcasting only goes up to 4th-level\n\t\tyou can cover nearly all of your spells with lesser rods. If your party has\n\t\tdedicated spellcasters that used lesser metamagic rods at low levels, you\n\t\tmay be able to buy them off of your allies at a significant discount. For\n\t\thelp with metamagic options, check my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/metamagic\">Practical Guide to Metamagic<\/a>.\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Honeyed Tongue<\/span>: A 1st-level Paladin\n\t\tspell, it has a 10 minute duration at caster level 1. For 15 gp per charge,\n\t\tyou can reroll diplomacy checks for 10 minutes. If you&#8217;re your party&#8217;s face,\n\t\tthis is a fantastic investment.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saddle Surge<\/span>: If you use mounted combat,\n\t\tthis is worth considering. You need to cast Saddle Surge as a standard\n\t\taction anyway and move back to get as much distance as you can. The rounds\n\t\tper level duration will get you a minimum up 5 rounds, but the wand will be\n\t\texpensive since the minimum caster level for the spell is 5 instead of 3\n\t\tlike most 2nd-level spells.\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Belt of Giant Strength \/ Belt of Physical Might<\/span>: You need Strength and Constitution, but most paladins won&#8217;t have a use\n\t\tfor Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bracelet of Mercy<\/span>: Good, but not worth\n\t\t15,000gp. Get Bracers of the Merciful Knight instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bracers of The Avenging Knight<\/span>: Four\n\t\tmore levels of Smite means 4 more damage per hit. Neat, but Bracers of the\n\t\tMerciful Knight costs less and are much more useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bracers of The Merciful Knight<\/span>: Four more\n\t\tlevels of Lay on Hands means 2d6 more healing and 2 more uses per day. The\n\t\tLesser Restoration effect is nice, but it&#8217;s a 1st-level spell for paladins\n\t\tso it&#8217;s not a huge benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boots of Speed<\/span>: At just 12,000gp these are\n\t\ta steal. Activate them as a free action one round at a time, and you can\n\t\teasily stretch their use throughout an entire day. An essential for nearly\n\t\tany melee character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\tforego, even with Divine Grace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crystal of the Healing Hands<\/span>: This is\n\t\tsomething your allies should buy so that you can charge it for them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Insignia of Valor<\/span>: Paladins aren&#8217;t great at\n\t\tChannel Energy unless you build for it, and if you really want to use\n\t\tChannel Energy as a swift action you want to get Quick Channel.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Merciful Vambraces<\/span>: Once per day isn&#8217;t\n\t\tenough. If you&#8217;re using Lay on Hands it&#8217;s rare that you&#8217;ll be removing more\n\t\tthan one condition, so expect to go long periods without these being\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of Alluring Charisma<\/span>: Crucial.\n\t\tBoosts all of your saves, plus the normal benefits of Charisma.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Merciful Baldric<\/span>: You probably won&#8217;t\n\t\tneed this. You get enough mercies for most campaigns, and if you can&#8217;t cover\n\t\teverything it&#8217;s much cheaper to buy scrolls of the spells that will remove\n\t\twhatever status conditions you can&#8217;t cover.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ornament of Healing Light<\/span>: 15 ft. is not\n\t\tenough range to justify 10,000gp. Phylactery of the Shepherd costs 7,500,\n\t\tdoes more, and has twice the range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phylactery of the Shepherd<\/span>: Put the\n\t\tStatus effect on allies (it will last for three hours), then use Lay on\n\t\tHands at 30 ft. range as a swift action when one of them picks up a nasty\n\t\tstatus condition.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pearl of Power<\/span>: Paladins get very few\n\t\tspell slots, but their spells can be more powerful than their spell level\n\t\timplies. A pearl of power 1 on a high level wizard is largely useless; a\n\t\tpearl of power 1 on a Paladin means another use of Hero&#8217;s Defiance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge Person<\/span>: Bonus strength and reach.\n\t\tExcellent for any melee paladin unless you&#8217;re using a mount.
