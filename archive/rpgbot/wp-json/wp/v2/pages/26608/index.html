Fighters get weapon proficiencies one step better than\n\tother characters, making their attacks accurate and their critical hits\n\tfrequent. They also get proficiency with Advanced weapons, allowing fighters\n\tto use such weapons without a racial familiarity feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Fighter is at their best in combat, where their capabilities truly shine. The typical Fighter has fewer skills than most classes and terribly few utility options, but in a fight the Fighter is versatile, capable, and often surprising. The Fighter primarily serves their party as a Defender and a Striker, but despite the narrow scope of their capabilities they still have a ton of room for customization and diversity in how they play and what tactics they choose to employ in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of interesting mechanical things about the fighter. Unlike other classes, the Fighter has no subclasses. Instead, you can totally determine how the Fighter works by your choice of class feats. Even in the limited options of the Core Rulebook there are feats to cater to a dizzying variety of weapon and armor arrangements. Want to use shields? There are options for it. Two-handed weapons? You&#8217;ve got it. Two weapons at the same time? Definitely. Want to have a free hand for high-fives and such? Surprisingly, they found a way to make that viable. Even archery is a viable option, though it takes a few levels to get off the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Fighter is defined almost entirely by their feats and their choice of weapon, Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s retraining rules are absolutely crucial for the Fighter. Expect that any time your party&#8217;s membership changes, or whenever you find a cool magic item, you may need to make some changes to your feats to make yourself as effective as possible. However, your Attributes are difficult to change, so you&#8217;ll be locked into some sets of options depending on whether you choose Strength or Dexterity as your key Attribute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#attributes\">Fighter Attributes<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#strengthbased-fighter\">Strength-based Fighter<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dexteritybased-fighter\">Dexterity-based Fighter<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Fighter Ancestries and Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Fighter Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Fighter Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#varying-skill-feats\">Varying Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Fighter Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#weapons-archery\">Archery Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-single-weapon\">Single-Weapon Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-two-handed\">Two-Handed Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-two-weapon\">Two-Weapon Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-sword-and-board\">Sword-and-Board Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Fighter Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclass-archetype\">Fighter Multiclass Archetype<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Attribute<\/strong>: Your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Choose\n\twhichever caters to your preferences. Strength-based fighters will be largely\n\tlocked into melee, while Dexterity-based fighters can switch between melee and\n\tranged combat but may deal slightly less damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: 10+ hit points, and it&#8217;s easy\n\tfor you to focus on keeping your Constitution high since the Fighter needs so\n\tfew high Attributes.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Good perception, good saves,\n\tgreat armor, and the best weapon proficiencies. Sure, you likely won&#8217;t have a\n\tlot of skills, but you can invest in Intelligence or spend feats if that&#8217;s an\n\tissue.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span>: Expert at 1st level and you\n\t\timprove to Master at 7th and get an additonal +2 to Perception checks for\n\t\tInitiative.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Fortitude and Reflex saves\n\t\twill be good, especially if you emphasized Dexterity, but Will saves are a\n\t\thuge weakness so don&#8217;t dump your Wisdom.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 4+ skills is average,\n\t\tbut Fighters often dump Intelligence so you may find yourself with few\n\t\tskills. Take Athletics if you plan to rely on Strength, and consider\n\t\tAcrobatics if you plan to rely on Dexterity.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Attacks<\/span>: The best attack proficiency in\n\t\tthe game, and fighters are the only class proficient with Advanced weapons\n\t\tby default.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Defenses<\/span>: Second only to the Champion.\n\t\tTrained in all armor and unarmored defense at 1st level, and your\n\t\tproficiency rises to Master so your AC should be higher than nearly any\n\t\tother character.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: Critical specializations can sometimes rely upon\n\t\tyour class DC.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Reactive Strike<\/span>: Very few creatures in\n\tPathfinder 2e have the ability to punish creatures for moving through their\n\treach, so most creatures can simply rush past each other to reach vulnerable\n\ttargets. The ability to make even one additional attack in these cases is a\n\tsignificant deterrent, and the Fighter is the only class that gets this option\n\twithout spending a feat.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield Block<\/span>: It&#8217;s difficult to choose to\n\tuse a shield without this feat, so getting it for free is helpful. Don&#8217;t feel\n\tlike you absolutely need to use it, but remember that shields are always an\n\toption if you find yourself in a tough spot.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>5: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter Weapon Mastery<\/span>: The Fighter&#8217;s\n\tweapon proficiency advances strangely. You choose one weapon group (Brawling,\n\tSwords, etc.) and your proficiency with that group (including Advanced\n\tWeapons) advances at 5th level while your other weapon proficiencies remain\n\tunchanged.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>9: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Flexibility<\/span>: Class feats are the\n\tbest feats, and getting one more of any level offers a ton of great options.\n\tSince you get to change this every day, it&#8217;s a great way to experiment with\n\toptions which you&#8217;re not certain that you&#8217;ll like without spending Downtime to\n\ttrain, and it&#8217;s a great way to bring in material from newly-published\n\tsourcebooks.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>15: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Flexibility<\/span>: Another free class\n\tfeat! Great for all the same reasons that Combat Flexibility is great.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attributes\">Fighter Attributes<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strengthbased-fighter\">Strength-based Fighter<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most fighters will be Strength-based. Dexterity is not the \u201cgod stat\u201d that it\n\twas in Pathfinder 1e. Since you only need three high Attributes, you have some\n\tflexibility. You get 4 Boosts at levels 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20, and you will\n\tlikely put your 4th boost into the same Attribute after boosting Strength,\n\tConstitution, and Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Your key Attribute.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Full Plate has a Dexterity Cap of +0,\n\tand you probably want to be in Full Plate. Once you&#8217;re in Full Plate, the\n\tBulwark trait replaces your Dexterity modifier. But a bit of Dexterity will\n\tmake it easier to attack at range, which can be helpful if you&#8217;re using a\n\tweapon that&#8217;s good for throwing.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points and Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Useful for starting skills and\n\tlanguages. You can only maximize three skills, and you get a total of 4+\n\tskills so dumping Intelligence to 8 means that you&#8217;ll still get three skills\n\tthat you can maximize, but just being Trained in a skill is often enough to\n\tmake it useful.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Essential for Perception and Will\n\tSaves, which are your biggest defensive gap.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Useful if you&#8217;re building for\n\tIntimidation. Demoralize is fantastic, but not every Fighter needs to be built\n\tto use it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dexteritybased-fighter\">Dexterity-based Fighter<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Finesse weapons and ranged weapons make Dexterity-based builds an option, but\n\tkeep in mind that even the most Dexterity-heavy Fighter can still benefit a\n\tlot from high Strength. Unfortunately, needing Strength makes it hard to\n\tinvest in Intelligence or Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: You want some for Propulsive weapons\n\t(bows) and for melee weapons, plus heavier armor provides a higher total AC\n\tbonus, and you still want to avoid check penalties by having enough\n\tStrength.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Your Key Attribute.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Even if you fight at range, you want\n\tthe extra hit points.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: starting skills and languages.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Essential for Perception and Will\n\tSaves, which are your biggest defensive gap.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: useful if you&#8217;re building for\n\tIntimidation.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Fighter Ancestries and Heritages<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Since the Fighter primarily needs boosts to physical Attributes and every\n\tAncestry gets one, nearly any Ancestry works. Strangely, a bonus to Wisdom\n\tfrom an Ancestry is actually a better way to identify Ancestries that work\n\twell. Also look closely at Ancestry Feats, especially those which reduce the\n\tproficiency type on racial Advanced Weapons and grant access to Uncommon\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more help selecting an Ancestry and Heritage, see our\n\t<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-fighter\/ancestries-and-heritages\/\">Fighter Ancestries and Heritages Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Fighter Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Look for backgrounds that offer boosts to Strength, Dexterity, or\n\tConstitution, depending on your build.

If you&#8217;re running around with a longbow, Power Attack won&#8217;t help you. Expect to pick a single weapon that will be your weapon of choice unless a magic item comes along that justifies switching. In some cases you can change your type of weapon with little effort (battle axe to longsword isn&#8217;t a big change), but in other cases you may need to retrain a long list of feats to change weapons effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-archery\">Archery Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of weapon as an archer comes down to two decision points. First,\n\twill your Strength score be 14 or higher? If so (and there&#8217;s little reason why\n\tit shouldn&#8217;t), get a composite bow. Second, you need to consider the range at\n\twhich you&#8217;ll be fighting. Shortbows work better within 30 ft. because they\n\taren&#8217;t Volley weapons, but in every other case longbows are better. At low\n\tlevels you can switch between bows easily, but at high levels when you have\n\tmagic weapons you won&#8217;t want to drop your +2 Greater Striking Longbow to use a\n\tmundane shortbow just because and enemy is only 25 ft. away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crossbows are generally worthless due to their poor action economy compared\n\tto bows. Ignore their existence.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-single-weapon\">Single-Weapon Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Single-Weapon builds are a lot of fun, and enable things like holding shields, pushing, and grappling with your free hand. Your first thought might be a nimble, high-dexterity fencer, but that&#8217;s definitely not your only option. Even high-Dexterity fighters still need high Strength for the bonus damage, and a Strength-based single-weapon build may actually be more effective in some ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the weapon traits which you find valuable, as they&#8217;re often more important than your weapon&#8217;s damage die. The gap between a rapier&#8217;s d6 and a longsword&#8217;s d8 isn&#8217;t significant, even when you&#8217;re rolling multiple dice. Agile is great if you plan to make numerous attacks, but if you&#8217;re relying on options like Power Attack, you don&#8217;t need to worry about Agile. Try to get an idea of what feats you want to take as you gain levels, and choose a weapon which works well with those feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a free hand can also help with Athletics-based Actions in combat like Grab and Shove. In the remaster rules, these special attacks take on the traits of the hand or weapon which you use to perform the attack. Since fists have the Agile trait by default, and empty hand means having the Agile trait for your special attacks. Of course, at high levels a weapon with a matching trait (a warhammer for shove, etc.) will be more mathematicaly impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Axe \/ Longsword \/ Pick \/ Warhammer<\/span\n\t\t>: Simple, go-to weapons. The d8 damage die is geat, and Power Attack\n\t\tpresents a significant damage boost, especially at low levels. The Battle\n\t\tAxe&#8217;s Sweep property is helpful against multiple foes, especially if you\n\t\tplan to use Swipe. Longswords are Versatile, which makes it easier to deal\n\t\twith enemy damage resistances. Picks have Fatal, which is like deadly but\n\t\tmore lethal (those are all synonyms), so if you&#8217;re trying to get lots of\n\t\tcritical hits it&#8217;s great. Warhammers have the Shove property, which is\n\t\thelpful if you want to Shove but don&#8217;t have a free hand.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bastard Sword \/ Dwarven Waraxe<\/span>: If you\n\t\tplan to primarily fight two-handed but want the ability to use a free hand\n\t\tfor stuff like shoving, the Bastard Sword and Dwarven War Axe are your best\n\t\toptions. You can also use options like Dual-Handed Assault to get the\n\t\tbenefits of a d12 damage die while still maintaining a free hand. The\n\t\tDwarven War Axe adds the Sweep property, but is otherwise identical to the\n\t\tBastard Sword, so go for the Dwarven War Axe if it&#8217;s convenient to do\n\t\tso.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flail<\/span>: A great option for Fighters willing\nto put a lot of thought into combat maneuvers. You do sacrifice a little bit of damage compared\nto popular weapons like the Longsword, but having both Disarm and Trip on one weapon plus the\nabsolutely amazing Flail Critical Specialization Effect makes flails incredibly effective.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome Flickmace \/ Whip<\/span>: Reach on a\n\t\tone-handed weapon is a huge advantage. You get the most important part of a\n\t\tpolearm, but you can also use your other hand for things like a shield. The\n\t\tGnome Flickmace has a bigger damage die than the Whip and doesn&#8217;t have the Nonlethal\n\t\ttrait, but otherwise the whip is a much better weapon due to its numerous\n\t\tuseful traits. Unfortunately, some creatures are immune to nonlethal damage,\n\t\tso the whip isn&#8217;t always a safe bet. If you&#8217;re building to make attacks of\n\t\topportunity, consider either a flickmace or a whip, and look at feats like\n\t\tCombat Reflexes.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Katana<\/span>: Similar in many ways to the\n\t\trapier, but it&#8217;s an Advanced Weapon so you&#8217;re either spending a feat or\n\t\tlosing attack bonus.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapier<\/span>: The go-to for Dexterity-based\n\t\tmelee builds, but by no means a perfect weapon. Deadly is great, but likely\n\t\twon&#8217;t close the damage gap between d6 and d8, and disarm is only\n\t\tsituationally useful. Finesse is nice at low levels, but your Dexterity and\n\t\tStrength will rarely be more than 2 apart so it&#8217;s not a significant boost to\n\t\tyour attack bonus.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-two-handed\">Two-Handed Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There are two good reasons to use a two-handed weapon: reach, and big damage\n\tdice. No one-handed weapon has a damage die larger than 1d8, and no one-handed\n\tweapons have reach without also having a handicap like the Nonlethal trait or\n\tbeing an Advanced weapon. Two-handed weapons frequently have interesting\n\ttraits like Backswing and Forceful, but otherwise they&#8217;re not much different\n\tfrom one-handed weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Elven Curve Blade<\/span>: I can&#8217;t think of a case\n\t\twhere the Elven Curve Blade is better than a Falchion. Maybe for an elf\n\t\trogue with the Elven Weapon Familiarity feat? For the Fighter, it&#8217;s\n\t\tbasically a worse Falchion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Falchion<\/span>: If you&#8217;re planning to rely on\n\t\tmultiple attacks every turn, the Falchion can be good. Swipe in particular\n\t\tworks very well with the Falchion. The 1d10 damage die is smaller than other\n\t\toptions, but the bonus damage from Forceful is very effective if you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing something like Swipe to make multiple attacks before your Multiple\n\t\tAttack Penalty applies. Otherwise, stick to weapons with a larger damage die\n\t\tlike the Greataxe and Greatsword.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Greataxe<\/span>: Simple and straight to the\n\t\tpoint, the Greataxe has a big damage die and Sweep so it works well with\n\t\tPower Attack for single enemies and Swipe with multiple enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Greatpick<\/span>: Fighters crit more often than anyone else (thanks to PF2 math) and Fatal adds an extra die to crits and the Pick Critical Specialization adds more damage when you crit. Add in Vicious Swing and start deleting your foes. <\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greatclub \/ Maul<\/span>: Backswing is a bad\n\t\ttrait, and Shove isn&#8217;t good enough to make these viable on its own.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Greatsword \/ Halberd<\/span>: Basic, generic\n\t\toptions that have Versatile instead of something interesting. If you don&#8217;t\n\t\tplan to use special maneuvers like Trip or Shove, go for one of these.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Guisarme \/ Ranseur<\/span>: Reach and you can use\n\t\tthem for a special maneuver. I prefer Trip over Disarm, personally.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Horsechopper<\/span>: Low damage die for a\n\t\ttwo-handed weapon, but you get Reach, Trip, and Versatile on a single\n\t\tweapon. I consider it on par with the Guisarme, but I wouldn&#8217;t go to great\n\t\tlengths to find one.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">War Flail \/ Spiked Chain<\/span>: Like the Flail,\n\t\tthe War Flail and the Spiked Chain emphasize special maneuvers like\n\t\tdisarming and tripping over raw damage. The War Flail is the better option:\n\t\tSpiked Chain reduces the damage die and loses Sweep in favor of Finesse.\n\t\tFinesse is most likely no more than +1 to attacks if you&#8217;re maximizing your\n\t\tDexterity, and you need high Strength to Disarm and Trip successfully\n\t\tanyway.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-two-weapon\">Two-Weapon Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Two-weapon builds have twice as much room to choose weapons, but you also\n\tneed to spend more money to enhance those weapons. You also need to consider\n\thow the two weapons interact with each other, and with the feats you plan to\n\ttake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, you&#8217;ll be using two different weapons: a larger primary weapon like a longsword and a smaller Agile weapon like a dagger. Double Slice is your defining class feat at low levels, so having an Agile second weapon is helpful. Of course, with the Fighter&#8217;s unusually high attack bonus, your second attack is still fairly accurate compared to other classes. You have more flexibility with your primary weapon; see Single-weapon builds, above, but keep in mind that you have two weapons which might support things like Disarm and Trip, so you may want to spread those capabilities across your weapons if you plan to use them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to pick up a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=1221\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=1221\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blazons of Shared Power<\/a> <sup>(GaG)<\/sup> to dramatically reduce the cost of putting magic on both of your weapons. They haven&#8217;t made it into the Remaster yet, but Legacy content is still valid unless it gets reprinted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dagger \/ Starknife<\/span>: The Starknife is\n\t\tjust a better dagger, so there&#8217;s little reason to use a dagger except as a\n\t\tbackup weapon. The Starknife&#8217;s damage isn&#8217;t as good as a shortsword, and\n\t\tDeadly isn&#8217;t enough to close that gap, but the ability to throw it is\n\t\ttempting so it&#8217;s worth considering as your second weapon.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Dogslicer \/ Filcher&#8217;s fork<\/span>: Similar to\n\t\tother weapons, but notably the Dogslicer and Filcher&#8217;s Fork add Backstabber.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s a bit of extra damage, but without something like Twin Feint to\n\t\tguarantee an Off-Guard target, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth a feat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Clan Dagger \/ Main-gauche<\/span>: Much like the\n\t\tStarknife, the Clan Dagger and Main-gauche are upgraded daggers, adding the\n\t\tParry trait. Giving up a shield means reduced AC, but with a Parry weapon\n\t\tyou can spend an Action for a +1 Circumstance bonus to AC, making up some of\n\t\tthe gap. If you take Twin Parry at 4th level, this bonus increases to +2 to\n\t\tmatch the bonus from a shield. Even with an Agile weapon, your third attack\n\t\tis still made at -8, so spending your third Action to defend yourself is\n\t\tfrequently a better idea than attempting another Strike. The difference\n\t\tbetween the Clan Dagger and the Main-gauche is Versatile or Disarm. Disarm\n\t\tis situational because monsters don&#8217;t typically use weapons, but the Clan\n\t\tDagger is Uncommon so it&#8217;s not available to most characters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gauntlet \/ Spiked Gauntlet<\/span>: Not a lot of\n\t\tdamage, but combine the best parts of two-weapon fighting and dueling\n\t\tbuilds. A free hand allows you to perform special maneuvers like Disarm and\n\t\tTrip, though admittedly you won&#8217;t get the item bonus to the check that you\n\t\twould from a weapon designed for that maneuver. You may also be able to make\n\t\tuse of the dueling feats like Dueling Parry and Dueling Riposte, which are\n\t\tavailable two levels before the comparable Two-Weapon Fighting feats and\n\t\tfrequently have the same effect. At the very least, a gauntlet is a great\n\t\tbackup weapon.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hatchet<\/span>: Agile, throwable, and 1d6\n\t\tdamage. It has Sweep, too, so if you switch to another target your third\n\t\tStrike in a turn will only be at a total penalty of -7.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sawtooth Saber<\/span>: Tailor-made for\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting, the Sawtooth Saber is the only published weapon with\n\t\tthe Twin property. Twin adds some extra damage to your second attack, which\n\t\tis great motivation to make more attacks each turn. The Sawtooth Saber also\n\t\thas the Agile trait, which is absolutely crucial for Double Slice. However,\n\t\tbecause the Sawtooth Saber is an Advanced Weapon your proficiency bonus will\n\t\tlag behind other weapons unless your take Advanced Weapon training at 6th\n\t\tlevel, and I don&#8217;t know if the tiny bit of extra damage is worth a class\n\t\tfeat when there are comparable options like the shortsword.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortsword<\/span>: Reliable and uncomplicated.\n\t\t1d6 damage and versatile, so if all you need is damage you&#8217;re good to\n\t\tgo.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-sword-and-board\">Sword-and-Board Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For typical sword-and-board builds, see Single-Weapon Builds, above. If you plan to use a shield boss or shield spike to perform two-weapon fighting, see Two-Weapon Builds, above.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Fighter Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t use light armor since Armor specialization effects don&#8217;t apply to light armor. Even if you&#8217;re an archer, it&#8217;s easy (and smart) to have enough Strength to not be impeded by heavy armor. However, Dexterity-based characters should avoid Full Plate because the Bulwark trait may actually reduce your bonus to Reflex Saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This is not a comprehensive list of archetypes which might be useful for this class. For more on archetypes, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/archetypes\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"5142\">archetype handbooks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Alchemist<\/span>: Mutagens are a tempting buff,\n\t\tand other alchemical items can give you a lot of utility and support\n\t\toptions. Alchemical bombs are a martial weapon, so you get your usual\n\t\tproficiency bonus to attacks and your Weapon Specialization damage bonuses\n\t\twith them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aldori Duelist<\/span>: A bit of Swashbuckler flavor\nand some interesting tactical options.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Barbarian<\/span>: Rage is a significant buff for\n\t\ta melee fighter. You have enough AC to absorb the AC penalty, and the\n\t\ttemporary hit points should make up the difference anyway.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Champion<\/span>: Champion&#8217;s Reaction is really\n\t\tgood, but it will conflict with your other Reaction options like Reactive\n\t\tStrike. The biggest benefit is probably access to Focus Spells like Lay on\n\t\tHands which will scale with your level without further investment. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing for a mounted combat build, you might like Divine Ally to get an\n\t\tanimal Companion, but you can also get an Animal Companion from the Druid or\n\t\tthe Ranger so that shouldn&#8217;t be the only thing you want from the Champion if\n\t\tyou choose to multiclass.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: Clerics have a surprisingly\n\t\tlarge amount to offer martial classes like the Champion and the Fighter. The\n\t\tdedication feat doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of proficiencies, but the\n\t\tDivine spell list&#8217;s cantrips include great options like Guidance (easy +1 on\n\t\tbasically anything whenever you want it, with a cooldown) and Shield\n\t\t(no-hand Shield Block with a cooldown, but works great if you don&#8217;t use a\n\t\tshield). Domain Initiate gives you a Focus Pool and access to several useful\n\t\tdomain spells depending on your choice of deity.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid<\/span>: If you want spellcasting, I think\n\t\tthat the Cleric makes more sense. If you want Focus Spells, I think the\n\t\tChampion makes more sense. If you want an Animal Companion, the Ranger\n\t\toffers the same options, plus other feats that cater to the Fighter&#8217;s\n\t\tmartial capabilities. There are some amusing things that you can do with\n\t\tWild Shape and related feats, but sticking to weapons will be more effective\n\t\tand you would need to invest a significant number of class feats to make\n\t\tthose options worthwhile.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monk<\/span>: With the right stance feat your\n\t\tunarmed strikes are as good as some two-handed weapons, but remember that\n\t\tsome stances require you to be unarmored. You can combine many of the Monk&#8217;s\n\t\tcapabilities with Fighter Class Feats which are usually intended for fencing\n\t\tbuilds. Monastic Weaponry gets you access to interesting options like\n\t\tShuriken, as well as several melee options like the Kama and the Sai, both of\n\t\twhich are potential candidates for two-weapon fighting builds. Monks&#8217; Flurry\n\t\tgets you access to Flurry of Blows, but remember that it&#8217;s a Flourish so you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t combine it with things like Double Shot or Two-Weapon Flurry. There&#8217;s\n\t\ta lot to capitalize on here.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ranger<\/span>: A good option for archers and\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting builds. Disrupt Prey is easy to miss, but it essentially\n\t\tadds another version of Reactive Strike that you can use against your Prey\n\t\twhich can also disrupt some actions. You can also get an Animal Companion,\n\t\twhich is crucial for mounted builds.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get to choose a Racket,\n\t\twhich dramatically limits your Rogue Class Feat options, but there are still\n\t\ta few gems.
