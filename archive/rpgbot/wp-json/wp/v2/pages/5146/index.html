The Alchemist&#8217;s\n\trole in the party most closely resembles a Rogue, providing high damage output\n\tand frequently some skill and utility, but the abundance of alchemical items\n\tmeans that a well-prepared and well-equipped alchemist can also feel similar\n\tto the Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the Alchemist is decidedly not a spellcaster, their reliance on\n\talchemical items means that they can feel very similar to a wizard, choosing\n\ttheir alchemical items from a growing collection of formulae. Much like a\n\tspellcaster needs to understand their spell list and select good options to\n\tmeet their needs, you will need to assess the growing roster of alchemical\n\titems and asses which items will meet your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Dependence on disposable items is always a hard prospect, but the Alchemist&#8217;s\n\tInfused Reagents feature gives you access to a pool of free alchemical items\n\tevery day which will meet the vast majority of your item needs. Much like\n\tspell slots, managing and optimizing this resource pool, is crucial to your\n\tsuccess.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using print copies of the Core Rulebook, keep in mind that the Alchemist has received a ton of <a href=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinder\/faq\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinder\/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">errata<\/a> across the now 4+ printings of the Core Rulebook.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Alchemist Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Intelligence. High Intelligence affects save\n\tDCs, improves your Crafting skill, your number of Infused Reagents, gives you\n\tabundant trained skills at level 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+Con per level. Better than a\n\twizard, but don&#8217;t go into melee without padding your AC and your hit points.\n\tMutagenists will typically pad their hp with temporary hit points from their\n\tfavorite mutagen(s).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Alchemist&#8217;s\n\tonly good initial proficiency is their numerous skills.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Only Trained, no dependence on\n\t\tWisdom, and your proficiency doesn&#8217;t increase until 11th level, making you\n\t\tone of the worst in the game at Perception.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Good Fortitude and Reflex\n\t\tsaves, but the absolute worst Will save progression in the game. Don&#8217;t dump\n\t\tWisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 4+int gets you more\n\t\ttotal starting skills than many other classes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attacks<\/span>: Only Trained in simple weapons,\n\t\talchemical bombs, and unarmed attacks. Your proficiency goes up to Expert,\n\t\tbut no higher than that, so even your best weapons won&#8217;t be impressively\n\t\taccurate. Plan to rely on one Strike per turn at most, and look for ways to\n\t\trely on save DC&#8217;s instead if you can. Higher-level bombs will add item\n\t\tbonuses to your attack rolls, which is crucial since you can&#8217;t put runes on\n\t\tthem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defenses<\/span>: Errata added medium armor to\n\t\tthe Alchemist&#8217;s proficiencies. Many alchemists will be fine in light armor\n\t\tdue to their need for Dexterity to throw bombs, but for the Mutagenist,\n\t\tmedium armor is a huge benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: The Alchemist&#8217;s class DC only matters for a few\n\t\tAlchemist class feats, but you want as much Intelligence as possible to get\n\t\textra Infused Reagents so your class DC is going to be fantastic anyway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemy<\/span>: The Alchemist&#8217;s defining class\n\tfeature.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infused Reagents<\/span>: Like spell slots for a\n\t\tspellcaster, these are the limiting factor on your most powerful options,\n\t\tand you can only exceed this capability by spending money on items (more\n\t\talchemical items in your case, or scrolls\/wands\/etc. for a spellcaster). You\n\t\tget a lot, and at 5th level your Field Discovery will allow you to create\n\t\tsome items for free using Quick Alchemy depending on your Research Field,\n\t\tbut these are an essential way to create high-level alchemical items without\n\t\tbankrupting yourself. There aren&#8217;t many ways to get more Infused Reagents\n\t\tper day (a familiar can produce one batch per day), but those options are\n\t\tworthwhile, especially at low levels where you have few Reagents to\n\t\tspend.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Alchemy<\/span>: This is your go-to usage\n\t\tfor your Infused Reagents. You get two items per batch, and even though they\n\t\tneed to be the same item (with some exceptions, depending on your Research\n\t\tField), that&#8217;s a better deal than you get from Quick Alchemy. Prepare any\n\t\tstaple items you know you&#8217;ll need (bombs, elixirs of life, mutagens, etc.)\n\t\tat the beginning of the day, but leave a few batches for Quick Alchemy when\n\t\tyou need something unusual on short notice.\n\t\t<p>Advanced Alchemy notably doesn&#8217;t require the items to be consumable.\n\t\t\tQuick Alchemy was updated to specify that the created items must be\n\t\t\tconsumable, but no such change was made to Advanced Alchemy. This opens up\n\t\t\tpermanent alchemical tools, making expensive permanent items (such as\n\t\t\ttools close to your current level) much more accessible. Getting two of\n\t\t\tthe same item may be unhelpful, but remember that you can share these\n\t\t\titems with your party. Items like the Collar of the Shifting Spider and\n\t\t\tthe Injector Reservoir can be very effective when shared.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Alchemy<\/span>: Until 5th level this is a\n\t\tbackup option for when you didn&#8217;t think to prepare some specific alchemical\n\t\titem that you need in a specific situation. The proliferation of healing\n\t\titems since the release of the Core Rulebook means that there is an\n\t\talchemical remedy for many status conditions. Carrying those around all the\n\t\ttime is silly, but Quick Alchemy means that they&#8217;re perpetually at your\n\t\tdisposal.\n\t\t<p>Once you get Perpetual Infusions, you can use this to create a small\n\t\t\tnumber of items for free depending on your Research Field. These free\n\t\t\titems are a bottomless supply, and depending on your Research Field they\n\t\t\tmay be important enough that you use them every turn. For example:\n\t\t\tBombs.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Formula Book<\/span>: This works much like the\n\tWizard&#8217;s spellbook: You learn a few formulae at first level, then two more at\n\teach level, but you can also copy new formulae from other sources, such as\n\tother Alchemists&#8217; formula books. Like the Wizard, you must learn new version\n\tof the formula for each version of a specific alchemical item, so if you want\n\tAlchemist&#8217;s Fire to be a fixture of your toolkit, you&#8217;ll need to learn each of\n\tthe four versions as you gain levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Research Field<\/strong>: See our\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/alchemist\/research-fields\/\">Alchemist Research Fields Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Field Discovery<\/span>: This presents a significant\n\tjump in power for the Alchemist. The ability to create some alchemical items\n\tfor free every turn allows you to use your signature class feature essentially\n\twithout limit. The effectiveness of this feature varies by Research Field, but\n\tregardless of Research Field, this is a central part of how you play your\n\tcharacter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Powerful Alchemy<\/span>: Mostly useful for\n\tpoisons, which many alchemists may never use, and the Toxicologist already\n\traises the DC for their created poisons to their Class DC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perpetual Infusions<\/span>: A bottomless supply of\n\tsome of the most important items in your arsenal. You may still want to spend\n\tsome of your Infused Reagents on higher-level items and on items which you\n\tcan&#8217;t craft for free with Perpetual Infusion, but you may want to save those\n\tfor when they&#8217;re really important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemical Expertise<\/span>: Always helpful, but\n\tthe Alchemist Class DC is used for very few things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Double Brew<\/span>: Situational. Generally when\n\tyou need to create an item in a hurry you only need one, and if you need more\n\tthan one it&#8217;s one of the items you can create for free with Perpetual\n\tInfusions. It&#8217;s totally unclear how this interacts with Perpetual Infusions,\n\tso I can&#8217;t tell if you can use this to create two items for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perpetual Potency<\/span>: A significant improvement\n\tto the items that you can create with Perpetual Infusions. Going from lesser\n\tto moderate often doubles the numerical effects of the item.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Field Discovery<\/span>: Depending on your\n\tResearch Field, this is the feature that definitively sets you apart from\n\tother Research Fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemical Alacrity<\/span>: Unless you took\n\tEnduring Alchemy this is probably useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemical Mastery<\/span>: Always helpful, but\n\tthe Alchemist Class DC is used for very few things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perpetual Perfection<\/span>: Roughly a 50% numeric\n\timprovement to your favorite alchemical items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Alchemist Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conventional\">Conventional Alchemist<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most alchemists are defined by their Intelligence, but they require Dexterity\n\tto be successful at their attacks with alchemical bombs, and they also require\n\tboth Constitution and Wisdom to compensate for poor Perception and generally\n\tpoor durability. Expect to invest your 4 ability boosts at every fifth level\n\tin those four ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Alchemical items are Light bulk, so you\n\tcan carry a ton of them. You&#8217;re also very good at crafting, so crafting a bag\n\tof holding is a great option. However, you may want 10 so that you can wear\n\tleather armor without worrying about the check penalty.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity will improve your poor AC\n\tand make you more accurate with alchemical bombs and ranged weapons. Even with\n\tmedium armor proficiency, you need Dexterity since bombs are the Alchemist&#8217;s\n\tmost effective offensive option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Your durability is poor. If you have\n\tless than 14, expect to die.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Sets your ability DC and improves your\n\tcrafting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: You need some to boost your poor Will\n\tsaves and your poor Perception, but it&#8217;s the least important of the ability\n\tscores that you care about.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump. Nothing about the Alchemist\n\tinvolves Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mutagenist-abilities\">Mutagenist<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Mutagenists work a bit differently from other alchemists. Mutagens offer\n\tnumerous great ways to improve your durability and to add melee options like\n\tclaws and bite attacks. However, this means that you need to more heavily\n\tinvest in Strength and Constitution, which makes you considerably more MAD\n\tthan other alchemists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: You need it for damage output when you\n\tdive into melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: You need 12 or 14 to fill out the dex\n\tcap for medium armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points and Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: You need it to craft mutagens, but\n\tsince you&#8217;re not relying on it for save DCs and since you need fewer Reagents\n\tthan many other alchemists, you don&#8217;t need to hit 18 at level 1.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: You need it for your terrible Will\n\tsaves and your terrible Perception.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.

But this isn&#8217;t the way to do it.\n\t\tInstead, see if your Ancestry was a weapon familiarity feat. Reducing\n\t\tweapons from martial to simple means that your proficiency will advance\n\t\tautomatically, which is crucial even though the Alchemist&#8217;s weapon\n\t\tproficiency never goes beyond Expert.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Alchemist Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crossbow<\/span>: Often your best bet for\n\t\tlong-range combat. Bombs are great, but their range is only 20 ft. (30 ft.\n\t\tor 60 ft. once you get some feats) and they&#8217;re expensive, so using a\n\t\tcrossbow is a great way to remain effective at extended range.

You can take Diverse Armor Expert at 14th level, but that&#8217;s two\n\t\tfeats to get a total of +1 to AC (assuming that you&#8217;re in heavy armor).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Druid<\/span>: Wisdom-base spellcasting. Wild\n\t\tShape is tempting, but it&#8217;s a Polymorph effect so you can&#8217;t combine it with\n\t\tMutagens.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: Access to martial weapons is\n\t\ttempting for anyone except Bombers, and you can take Diverse Weapon Expert\n\t\tto increase the proficiency to Expert, which will match the best proficiency\n\t\tthe Alchemist normally gets with any weapon.

Flurry of Blows is a great way to\n\t\tget an extra attack every turn, and since Bestial Mutagen and Crane Stance\n\t\tboth add the Agile property to one of your unarmed strike options, either\n\t\toption will help mitigate the multiple attack penalty. Just remember that\n\t\tdrinking your mutagen and adopting a stance both eat Actions, so your first\n\t\tturn may be spent getting ready to fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue<\/span>: The base dedication feat is\n\t\talready really good. Surprise attack, Trained in two new skills, and a Skill\n\t\tFeat is a lot for one feat. Sneak Attacker is tempting, but 1d4 or 1d6\n\t\tdamage per attack simply isn&#8217;t enough extra damage to justify the feat, so\n\t\tthe only major reasons to take this are for Poison Weapon. If you&#8217;re going\n\t\tfor a poisoner build, you definitely want to multiclass into Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Witch \/ Wizard<\/span>: Intelligence-based casting\n\t\tis a great addition to the Alchemist&#8217;s capabilities, especially for\n\t\tnon-Bombers who often lack quality combat options. If you go beyond the base\n\t\tdevotion feat, leveled spells offer you a wide selection of powerful utility\n\t\toptions which you otherwise couldn&#8217;t address with alchemical items alone. If\n\t\tyou take the Basic and Expert Spellcasting feats, your spellcasting\n\t\tproficiency will keep pace with the Alchemist&#8217;s weapon proficiency\n\t\tprogression, making cantrips an easy go-to offensive option. Of course, item\n\t\tbonuses from runes or mutagens can still put your Strikes ahead of spell\n\t\tattacks, but the cost to do so is often high.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclass-archetype\">Alchemist Multiclass Archetype<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Access to free daily alchemical items can be immensely useful for many\n\tcharacters, offering non-magical solutions to a variety of challenges.
