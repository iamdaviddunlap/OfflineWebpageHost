It leans into the Barbarian&#8217;s love of aggressive melee tactics, encouraging you to dive into melee, grab onto an enemy, and make yourself a big, spiky problem. But, with poor durability and terrible scaling, the Battlerager really struggles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Battlerager&#8217;s subclass features center around the use of Spiked Armor. If you can&#8217;t get spiked armor for whatever reason, or if your armor is taken from you somehow (rust monsters, etc.), your Primal Path suddenly becomes worthless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you can get spiked armor, your AC is fixed at 16 (unless you get magic spiked armor or use a shield) and even with d12 hit dice that&#8217;s still a huge problem. The class features give you some nice damage options, but the features aren&#8217;t as useful or as exciting as other subclasses, and, since you&#8217;re stuck in Spiked Armor, you don&#8217;t get to enjoy Unarmored Defense or half-plate like other Barbarians. The racial restriction is also frustrating, but the dependency on Constitution means that a Dwarf would be a good choice anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>As a whole, the subclass is interesting, but, by Barbarian standards, it&#8217;s very vulnerable, especially if you&#8217;re not Raging. If you want a Barbarian who is good at grappling, you can do it with any Barbarian. Path of the Beast is my go-to. But I&#8217;ve been saying for a decade that I would cover every bit of 5e content, so here we go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your DM is going to let you get magic Spiked Armor or if you have allies who can buff you with things like Shield of Faith, that will make a huge difference. Either way, strongly consider feats like Durable and Tough to make yourself more survivable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Some minor numerical adjustments would do a lot to improve the Battlerager. If you want to play a Battlerager, try some or all of these changes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Change Battlerage Armor&#8217;s grapple damage to apply whenever you succeed on a check to Grapple a creature and also whenever a creature successfully grapples you. Change the damage from 3 to damage equal to your Strength modifier.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increase the AC of Spiked Armor from 14 to 15. Consider adding this improvement as a feature at level 10.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Path of the Battlerager Barbarian Build &#8211; The Drop Hawk<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.
