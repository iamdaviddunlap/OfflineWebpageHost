Do not play it. Not only is it weak and not fun to\n\tplay, but it&#8217;s bad in a way that can actually make you a liability for the\n\trest of your party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Oracle&#8217;s Curse is supposed to be the drawback for fantastic power, giving\n\tyou gradually more problems as you call on your mystery&#8217;s fantastic powers.\n\tBut the best parts of the Ancestors mystery are the parts that you borrow from\n\tthe Cleric: Guidance, and the Domain Spells. The benefits of the Ancestors\n\tMystery can be accessed more easily as a cleric with none of the drawbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The funamental problem with this Mystery is the effects of the curse. You are\n\tstuck with the influence of an ancestor of one of three categories (one of\n\twhich is spellcasting, which is the one you want) which is determined the\n\tfirst time your curse kicks in for the day, but is randomized every turn in\n\tcombat. If you do something that your ancestor doesn&#8217;t like (2 of the 3 don&#8217;t\n\tlike spellcasting), you have a percentage chance to simply fail to take an\n\taction that they don&#8217;t like which ranges frm 15% to 35%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you need to cast a 3-Action heal to save your dying party in the heat of\n\tbattle? Too bad, you have the ancestor who only likes making Strikes (yes,\n\tthat&#8217;s one of the three) so you have a 15% chance to just waste the action.\n\tSure, movement isn&#8217;t affected by this nonsense, but skills, spellcasting, and\n\tstrikes are affected, and those are kinda important in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mystery Benefit<\/span>: Two feats over the\n\t\tcourse of your career isn&#8217;t huge, but it offers some exciting build options.\n\t\tIf you take a Versatile Heritage or the Adopted Ancestry feat, you have\n\t\taccess to a wide variety of feat options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Trained Skll: Society<\/span>: <\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Granted Cantrip: Guidance<\/a>: Always useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revelation Spells<\/span>: Underwhelming.\n\t\tThere&#8217;s nothing here that&#8217;s particularly exciting or useful.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Initial: Ancestral Touch<\/a>: Barely better than a cantrip.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced: Ancestral Defense<\/a>: Excellent, especially considering how terrible the Oracle&#8217;s defenses\n\t\t\t\tare.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=743\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Ancestral Form<\/a>: Useful as an escape mechanism, to get past physical obstacles which\n\t\t\t\tmight require flight, or to give you time to go hide, but you can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tattack or cast spells, so this is almost purely a utility spell, and\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s not an especially good one.

A 15% chance to simply waste an Action because your ancestors\n\t\tdon&#8217;t like it means that in any given situation you might have a a 15%\n\t\tchance to be completely useless. You have a 50% chance to either roll the\n\t\tSpellcasting ancestor or to get your choice (you should pick Spellcasting),\n\t\tbut that means that you have a 50% chance to be massively hindered in your\n\t\tmost important capability. Outside of combat you&#8217;re stuck with one ancestor\n\t\tall day. Oh, and the 15% chance gets worse as your curse gets worse, so as\n\t\tyou gain more levels and face larger threats you&#8217;re gradually more likely to\n\t\tbe useless at random.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Minor<\/strong>: 15% chance to fail actions that your Ancestor\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t like.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Moderate<\/strong>: 25% chance to fail, so you&#8217;ll fail one in\n\t\t\t\tevery four actions that your Ancestor doesn&#8217;t like. You get a super tiny\n\t\t\t\tbonus to stuff, but it is nowhere near enough to matter (with the\n\t\t\t\texception of the Spellcasting ancestor, which remains amazing).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Major<\/strong>: 35% chance to fail. That&#8217;s more than one in\n\t\t\t\tthree. If you don&#8217;t roll Spellcasting for any given turn, you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tbasically useless in combat.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"battle\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Mysteries.aspx?ID=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Battle Mystery attempts to turn the Oracle into a front-line martial character similar to a champion or a warpriest, granting proficiency in heavy armor and some focus spells which try to make the Oracle good with weapon. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think the mystery meets its goal. Battle Oracles are no more effective with weapons than any other oracle, but heavy armor does make them more able to stand in melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your best bet is to build the Battle Oracle is a front-line support\n\tcharacter. Support your martial allies with both spells and occasionally with\n\tStrikes or skills, but don&#8217;t bother using a weapon beyond low levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mystery Benefit<\/span>: Heavy armor proficiency\n\t\tis a big boost, effectively adding +4 to your AC and removing the need for\n\t\tDexterity so that you can focus your Ability Boosts elsewhere. Proficiency\n\t\tin weapons does nearly nothing to help you since even with better weapon\n\t\toptions the Oracle is still absolutely terrible with weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trained Skll: Athletics<\/span>: Strength is a\n\t\thard choice for most oracles, but the Battle Oracle typically fights in\n\t\theavy armor, so a bit of Strength makes sense.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=280\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Granted Cantrip: Shield<\/a>: Less work than using and maintaining an actual shield, but if you use the\n\t\tShield Block portion of the spell you lose the spell for 10 minutes. Still,\n\t\ta great defensive option. If you plan to be in melee, you should probably\n\t\tstill carry a mundane shield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Revelation Spells<\/span>: The first two spells\n\t\tare great for an oracle looking to play a front-line support character.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=748\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Initial: Call to Arms<\/a>: +2 to initiative for your whole party will frequently mean that your\n\t\t\t\tallies go before an enemy that barely beat them otherwise. Going early\n\t\t\t\tin combat can put you at a huge advantage, so an easy initiative bonus\n\t\t\t\tis amazing. You also grant a small pool of temporary hit points with a\n\t\t\t\tduration longer than most fights. This is an amazing way to start\n\t\t\t\tcombat, so unless you plan to use something like Warcry I recommend\n\t\t\t\tcasting this every time you roll initiative.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=746\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced: Battlefield Persistence<\/a>: A decent bonus and you can use it on anything, but you need to use it\n\t\t\t\tbefore you make the roll. There&#8217;s a 1 in 5 chance that it will increase\n\t\t\t\tyour degree of success by one step, so it&#8217;s not an awful bet, but save\n\t\t\t\tit for saving throws that you know will be important. It also helps\n\t\t\t\tprevent Incapacitation effects, which is nice for enemy\n\t\t\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Heroic Feat<\/a>: The versatility is nice, but the Action cost is hard and the level\n\t\t\t\tcap of the feat means that you&#8217;ll never get to use anything especially\n\t\t\t\tamazing. This does appear to ignore prerequisites, which is nice.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Related Domains<\/span>: Both spells try to turn\n\t\tthe Oracle into a martial threat, but they don&#8217;t do the job. You could be\n\t\teffective at Athletics and at weapon Strikes for one Action, but one Action\n\t\tis not a build.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/domains\/#might\">Might &#8211; Athletic Rush<\/a>: This can make Athletics-based attacks (grapple, shove) effective\n\t\t\t\tdespite your relatively poor Strength, but you still need to invest in\n\t\t\t\tAthletics to make this worthwhile.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/domains\/#zeal\">Zeal &#8211; Weapon Surge<\/a>: Not nearly impactful enough to justify spending a Focus Point.\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Curse of The Hero&#8217;s Burden<\/span>: If you&#8217;re\n\t\tokay with grabbing a weapon from time to time, this curse is manageable.\n\t\tYou&#8217;ll need to intermingle spellcasting with Strikes in order to avoid (or\n\t\tat least minimize) a penalty to your AC and saves. The fast healing offered\n\t\tby the Moderate and Major versions of the curse will help offset your poor\n\t\tdefenses, but don&#8217;t get complacement. As much as you might dress like one,\n\t\tyou are not a fighter.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Minor<\/strong>: A near-constant -2 penalty to AC and saves. You\n\t\t\t\tcan suppress it for one turn by making a Strike, but the Oracle is\n\t\t\t\tabsolutely terrible with weapons, so you&#8217;ll spend many turns casting\n\t\t\t\tspells instead. Expect to just live with the penalty. At least you get\n\t\t\t\theavy armor to offset the AC penalty.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Moderate<\/strong>: You can no longer remove the penalty from\n\t\t\t\tyour curse, and reducing it by 1 frequently won&#8217;t be worth the effort to\n\t\t\t\tmake a Strike. The damage bonus is a negligible, but the Fast Healing is\n\t\t\t\tactually really nice. You don&#8217;t want to drag out fights to get free\n\t\t\t\thealing, but it will keep you from dying and will prevent things like\n\t\t\t\tpersistent bleed damage. You notably need to be in a &#8220;non-trivial&#8221;\n\t\t\t\tcombat encounter, so you can&#8217;t go pick a fight with a bag of rats to get\n\t\t\t\tfree healing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Major<\/strong>: More fast healing and the damage bonus is\n\t\t\t\tactually meaningful (though still not great). But Stupefied is a huge\n\t\t\t\tpenalty for spellcasters, so if you hit this point you should expect to\n\t\t\t\tspend the rest of the encounter making Strikes until you can\n\t\t\t\tRefocus.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bones\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Mysteries.aspx?ID=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bones<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An excellent healer in a party with Negative Healing, and thanks to easy\n\taccess to temporary hit points and resistance to common damage types, the\n\tBones Oracle is surprisingly durable despite the Oracle&#8217;s poor defenses. There\n\tisn&#8217;t much here that works offensively, so you&#8217;re on your own there, but in a\n\tparty relying on Negative Healing you could easily rely on spells like Harm\n\tboth offensively and to heal your party. The curse is also extremely gentle\n\tand easy to offset with some General Feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mystery Benefit<\/span>: Not every character\n\t\twants negative healing, and how useful it is depends on the composition of\n\t\tyour party. Ideally, you want everyone to have negative healing so that you\n\t\tcan spam Harm spells to both harm enemies and heal allies. If you already\n\t\thave negative healing, the benefit is negligible, so this is primarily for\n\t\tcharacters who couldn&#8217;t get negative healing otherwise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Trained Skll: Medicine<\/span>: Someone in the\n\t\tparty should be good with Medicine, but you likely have neither the Wisdom\n\t\tnor the skill increases to make Medicine effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=35\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Granted Cantrip: Chill Touch<\/a>: Decent cantrip damage of a good damage type, but touch range is dangerous\n\t\tfor oracles.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelation Spells<\/span>: Soul Siphon is great\n\t\tand you should use it all the time. Armor of Bones is an excellent defense\n\t\twith a low Action cost. You don&#8217;t need to both with Claim Undead.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Initial: Soul Siphon<\/a>: The damge isn&#8217;t great, but you get a decent pool of temporary hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints, especially if the target becomes Drained and loses one or two\n\t\t\t\thit points per level. The temporary hit points notably don&#8217;t have a\n\t\t\t\tlisted expiration, so you could use this on an yourself or an ally to\n\t\t\t\tget the temporary hit points, heal the target with Medicine, then go\n\t\t\t\tinto the day with some easy temporary hit points. The classic bag of\n\t\t\t\trats tricks won&#8217;t be much help here since you only get as many temporary\n\t\t\t\thit points as the hit points lost by the target.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=745\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced: Armor of Bones<\/a>: For one Action, this is pretty good. Bludgeoning damage is still a\n\t\t\t\tproblem, but few monsters deal bludgeoning damage. You even get\n\t\t\t\tresistance to some common energy damage types. If you can get resistance\n\t\t\t\tto poison (maybe from your ancestry) you can have resistance to many of\n\t\t\t\tthe most common damage types in the game.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=749\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Claim Undead<\/a>: Only situationally useful, and with a 10-minute duration it&#8217;s not an\n\t\t\t\tespecially good way to handle undead enemies. You might try to use this\n\t\t\t\tfor powerful single undead foes like liches and vampires, but thanks to\n\t\t\t\tthe Incapacitation trait that&#8217;s unlikely to succeed.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Related Domains<\/span>: Both options are good. I\n\t\tlike Death&#8217;s Call better, but if you&#8217;re happy with the temporary hit points\n\t\tfrom Soul Siphon you&#8217;ll do just fine with Touch of Undeath.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/domains\/#death\">Death &#8211; Death&#8217;s Call<\/a>: Death&#8217;s Call feels like a weird choice alongside Soul Siphon since\n\t\t\t\tboth provide temporary hit points, and Soul Siphon&#8217;s temporary hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints don&#8217;t have a duration, while Death&#8217;s Call&#8217;s temporary hit points\n\t\t\t\tonly last one minute. But these spells have different use cases: Soul\n\t\t\t\tSiphon allows you to get temporary hit points that last indefinitely, so\n\t\t\t\tyou can get some temporary hp at the start of the day (or between\n\t\t\t\tfights) and carry them around. Death&#8217;s Call is for use in combat,\n\t\t\t\tallowing you to replenish your temporary hit points long enough to get\n\t\t\t\tthrough the fight. Having both available makes it easy to keep a bubble\n\t\t\t\tof temporary hit points most of the time.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/domains\/#undeath\">Undeath &#8211; Touch of Undeath<\/a>: Decent single-target damage with a 1-Action casting time, but the\n\t\t\t\tTouch range is risky so don&#8217;t rush into melee just to use this.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Curse of Living Death<\/span>: This is incredibly\n\t\tgentle. You take some minor penalties and suffer the inconvenience of\n\t\tMedicine being less effective in exchange for huge bonuses against common\n\t\tFortitude saves, poison resistance, and the ability to automatically succeed\n\t\ton Recovery checks while dying. You can offset most of the penalties by\n\t\ttaking Diehard and Toughness. This is the sort of curse that you keep maxed\n\t\tout as much as possible.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Minor<\/strong>: Sure, Medicine will be less efficient at\n\t\t\t\thealing you, but non-magical healing is mostly reserved for outside of\n\t\t\t\tcombat where you typically have more time to spend.

This\n\t\t\t\tconveniently makes every lore skill available at what is likely your\n\t\t\t\tbest possible proficiency.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greater: Dread Secret<\/a>: The effect is not nearly big enough for a spell of such high level,\n\t\t\t\tand there&#8217;s no scaling of any kind.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Related Domains<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/domains\/#knowledge\">Knowledge &#8211; Scholarly Recollection<\/a>: You&#8217;re going to be making <em>a lot<\/em> of Recall Knowledge checks,\n\t\t\t\tso the ability to get Advantage when it&#8217;s important is helpful but not\n\t\t\t\tessential.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/domains\/#truth\">Truth &#8211; Word of Truth<\/a>: Incredibly situational.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Curse of Torrential Knowledge<\/span>: The\n\t\tpenalties are rugh, but mostly survivable if you plan for it. Consider build\n\t\toptions which improve the benefits of Recall Knowledge, and invest heavily\n\t\tin knowledge skills like Arcana and Occultism. Be sure to plan your Spell\n\t\tRepertoire to avoid spells with Verbal Components as much as possible.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Minor<\/strong>: That&#8217;s a big penalty on a class with terrible\n\t\t\t\tPerception and typically poor Wisdom. Expect to go late in the\n\t\t\t\tinitiative order.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Moderate<\/strong>: A free Recall Knowledge every turn is nice,\n\t\t\t\tespecially if you can find something to give you a specific mechanical\n\t\t\t\tbenefit for it. Being flat-footed perpetually is a huge problem, both\n\t\t\t\tbecuase it gives you a penalty to AC and because it makes you vulnerable\n\t\t\t\tto things which require you to be Flat-Footed. The Recall Knowledge\n\t\t\t\tchecks also work like Assurance, so using the same check for the same\n\t\t\t\tsubject repeatedly won&#8217;t get you anywhere.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Major<\/strong>: A huge number of spells have Verbal components,\n\t\t\t\tso if you plan to hit this stage frequently, be sure to plan your Spell\n\t\t\t\tRepertoire to avoid Verbal components wherever possible.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tempest\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Mysteries.aspx?ID=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tempest<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Less direct and harder to play than the Fire Mystery, but the complexity\n\toffers room to do cool stuff beyond damage.

Team up with a Storm\n\t\tDruid, bring up some fog, and run around basically untouchable in most\n\t\tfights. You also get a little extra damage with certain non-cantrip spells,\n\t\tbut remember that the spell needs to deal physical damage (bludgeoning,\n\t\tpiercing, or slashing) to get the bonus damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trained Skll: Nature<\/span>: A decent knowledge\n\t\tskill, but don&#8217;t feel compelled to go beyond Trained.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Granted Cantrip: Electric Arc<\/a>: Arguably the best damage cantrip, it deals as much damage as most other\n\t\tcantrips but can target two creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Revelation Spells<\/span>: Starts slow and gets\n\t\tbetter as you add spells.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=763\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Initial: Tempest Touch<\/a>: Decent damage and a small debuff, but touch range is dangerous for\n\t\t\t\tthe Oracle, so strongly consider Reach Spell if you want to use\n\t\t\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Spells.aspx?ID=764\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced: Thunderburst<\/a>: Decent damage in a large AOE which scales with spell level.

At that point, this is almost purely beneficial.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Minor<\/strong>: Not a huge drawback. You can offset the damage\n\t\t\t\tvulnerability by casting Resist Energy.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Moderate<\/strong>: You weren&#8217;t going to use missile attacks\n\t\t\t\tanyway, so this is protection from missile attacks and fire. Your\n\t\t\t\tvulnerability to lightning gets worse, but Resist Energy will still\n\t\t\t\tcompletely offset it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Major<\/strong>: Difficult terrain in a 15-foot area around you.\n\t\t\t\tThat&#8217;s a huge impediment for enemies trying to reach you, preventing\n\t\t\t\tthem from Stepping and making it hard to get into melee with you. If\n\t\t\t\tthey do get into melee with you, you&#8217;re free to Step away without issue.\n\t\t\t\tIf your allies are comfortable where they are, you can give your party a\n\t\t\t\thuge advantage by moving around in combat to make it difficult for\n\t\t\t\tenemies to move.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Oracle&#8217;s Mystery is the Oracle&#8217;s subclass.
