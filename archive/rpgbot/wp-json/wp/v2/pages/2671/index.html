While these options can often complement\n\tthe core rogue&#8217;s capabilities, they don&#8217;t replace them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This page applies almost exclusively to Arcane Tricksters. Other rogues who\n\ttake Magic Initiate may also find this section beneficial. Because Arcane\n\tTricksters are mostly limited to Enchantment and Illusion spells, I&#8217;ll focus\n\ton those spells here, but I will note some notable options for the total of 7\n\tspells which you can learn that go beyond the school limitation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>It may be helpful to see my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/spells\">Wizard Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor more advice on spells which go beyond this limitation.

If\n\t\tyou have a barrel of water and this cantrip, you have a solution to most\n\t\tproblems. Honestly the fact that this spell is so much better than its other\n\t\telemental equivalents (Control Flames, Gust, and Mold Earth) is a good\n\t\tindication of just how awful those spells are.

Uncanny Dodge and Shield mitigate damage from attacks, and\n\t\tEvasion mitigates damage from effects which require Dexterity saves, which\n\t\tincludes most energy damage effects like fireballs and most breath weapons.\n\t\tYou can use Absorb Elements to mitigate damage from other sources, but since\n\t\tthere&#8217;s so much overlap with the Rogue&#8217;s other features, it&#8217;s a situational\n\t\tbenefit with not a lot of payoff consider that you only get two unrestricted\n\t\t1st-level spells. The best use cases for this are effects like a green\n\t\tdragon&#8217;s poison breath which calls for a Constitution save, but fortunately\n\t\tthose effects are uncommon.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Disguise Self<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Learning a single spell\n\t\tis cheaper than proficiency in a Disguise Kit, but remember that your Spell\n\t\tSave DC probably won&#8217;t match a dedicated spellcaster so this may not be as\n\t\treliable as using a Disguise Kit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Find Familiar<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Outside of your school\n\t\tlimitations. An owl can move into melee range, then Dash away using its\n\t\tFlyby ability to avoid provoking Opportunity Attacks. This allows you to\n\t\teasily target foes for Sneak Attack with very little effort on top of the\n\t\tother fantastic benefits of having a familiar.

In most cases, this is redundant with Uncanny Dodge. However,\n\t\tShield boosts your AC until your next turn, potentially negating multiple\n\t\tattacks. In situations where you&#8217;re being targeted with numerous attacks,\n\t\tShield will be considerably more protective than Uncanny Dodge. Still, in\n\t\tthose situations ideally you have a tanky ally like a fighter to draw\n\t\tattention, or you&#8217;re using other spells like Blur or Mirror Image to protect\n\t\tyourself.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silent Image<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: While not nearly as\n\t\tpowerful as Major Image, if you just want an object or a visual effect,\n\t\tSilent Image does the job just as well. Throw up a fake wall, door, or\n\t\tportcullis to slow pursuers. Create a piece of furniture like a box or a\n\t\tchest, then hide inside it and stab people when they try to open it like a\n\t\tpointy jack in the box. Illusions are limited more by your creativity (and\n\t\tyour DM&#8217;s willingness to play along) than by the spell&#8217;s text.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silvery Barbs<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Extremely powerful,\n\t\tbut also very complicated.

Even then, you can buy\n\t\tyourself a great deal of time while the target tries to figure out your\n\t\tillusion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Nondetection<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Good, but not totally\n\t\tessential. Divination spells include things like See Invisibility, so if you\n\t\tor your party relies on invisibility of any kind this protects from several\n\t\tmaigcal countermeasures to both stealth and invisibility. However, most\n\t\tenemies aren&#8217;t spellcasters and won&#8217;t have access to those divination\n\t\toptions, so you can&#8217;t justify casting this every day. The spell also has an\n\t\texpensive material component specifically to deter you from casting this all\n\t\tthe time. Still, with an 8-hour duration, if you need this spell it&#8217;s going\n\t\tto do exactly what you need it to do.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Phantom Steed<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: By the time you can\n\t\tcast this, your allies can likely produce much better ways to travel long\n\t\tdistances.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Eye<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Outside of your school\n\t\tlimitations. Scouting safely is important, and it&#8217;s a major part of the\n\t\tRogue&#8217;s role in the party. Still, you&#8217;ve been scouting for 18 levels without\n\t\tthis and you&#8217;ve somehow survived this long.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimension Door<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Outside of your school\n\t\tlimitations. While Misty Step solves the vast majority of your teleportation\n\t\tneeds (especially in combat), Dimenion Door has considerably longer range\n\t\tand doesn&#8217;t require line of sight, thus allowing you to quickly infiltrate\n\t\tor escape an area which might otherwise be impenetrable.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Fabricate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Outside of your school\n\t\tlimitations. I really wish that this spell was better, but it&#8217;s simply too\n\t\tsituational. It only works on raw materials, so you can&#8217;t pull tricks like\n\t\tturning a door into toothpicks or something equally useful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Invisibility<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Probably the most\n\t\timportant spell that anyone can cast on a rogue.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hallucinatory Terrain<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational. Unless you\n\t\tspecifically need the 24-hour duration and the massive area of effect, Major\n\t\tImage will suffice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Polymorph<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Tempting and\n\t\tpotentially very powerful, but you can&#8217;t use Sneak Attack with the natural\n\t\tweapons which you usually gain from being polymorphed and you&#8217;ll deal more\n\t\tdamage with Sneak Attack and a dagger than you will by turning into a\n\t\ttyrannosaurus.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Shape<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is one of the most\n\t\tuseful spells in the game. Castles, dungeons, caves, mountains, and all\n\t\tmanner of other locales include an abundance of stone. The ability to\n\t\treshape that stone to your purposes in an instant is immensely useful. This\n\t\tis a spell limited only by your imagination. A 5-foot cube is plenty of\n\t\tspace to wreak all kinds of havoc if you&#8217;re clever.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e
