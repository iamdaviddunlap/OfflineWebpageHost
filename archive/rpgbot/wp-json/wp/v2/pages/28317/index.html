Early on, the World Tree Barbarian\u2019s protection comes in the form of granting temporary hit points to an ally every round, a solid way to absorb the damage a fellow front-liner might take. Then later, as they grow stronger connections to Yggdrasil, the Barbarian can use their reaction to pull a creature close when the creature\u2019s turn begins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This, at first, might look to be only offensive, a way to be sticky enough to hold a foe close, but it can also be used on an ally (who are now explicitly allowed to fail saves on purpose) to pull them out of danger. The zero speed effect is an optional choice specifically for this purpose, allowing an ally to continue fleeing after being teleported to the safe side of the Barbarian.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If that\u2019s not enough to sway you towards the Path of the World Tree, perhaps the excessive amount of reach these Barbarians are granted will: Any Heavy or Versatile weapon is extended by 10 feet (that\u2019s a total of 15 unless it already had Reach as well, making it 20 feet). You might just never have to move if you don\u2019t want to. These weapons also gain both Topple and Push masteries in this extended state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Do take note, however, that this hyper extension is only during the Barbarian\u2019s turn but it is not contingent on being in Rage. And just for good measure, at level 14, how about Teleporting 60 feet as a bonus action while Raging, once per turn. If that wasn\u2019t enough, once per Rage, teleport yourself and up to six willing companions 150 feet. Just Barbarian things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>I came into this thinking the Path of the World Tree was going to feel like the Warden class from D&amp;D 4e, a mighty Primal Defender that protects their allies and harasses their foes. It certainly has that theme and feeling on a superficial level, but it\u2019s not really the Warden. It is, however, another Defender from D&amp;D 4e: the Swordmage. The Arcane Defender that harasses foes with excessive amounts of Teleportation. So if you want to play the Swordmage in D&amp;D 5e 2024, try the Path of the World Tree Barbarian. Trust me, that feels just as weird for me to type as it does for you to read.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Path of the World Tree Barbarian Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Barbarian Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Path of the World Tree Barbarian Species<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Path of the World Tree Barbarian Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Path of the World Tree Barbarian Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#origin-feats\">Origin Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#epic-boons\">Epic Boons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Path of the World Tree Barbarian Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#versatile\">Versatile<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heavy\">Heavy<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Path of the World Tree Barbarian Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Path of the World Tree Barbarian Build &#8211; The Legendary Super Lumberjack<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#species\">Species<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skill-and-tool-proficiencies\">Skill and Tool Proficiencies<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats-and-ability-score-increases\">Feats and Ability Score Increases<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

This will go an unusually long way when combined\n\t\t\t\twith the damage resistance from Rage, but you should only expect the THP\n\t\t\t\tto absorb 1 or 2 attacks per Rage, especially at low levels.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Life-Giving Force<\/span>: A huge amount of\n\t\t\t\tTemporary Hit Points, but you can&#8217;t use them on yourself, you may not be\n\t\t\t\table to apply them consistently in combat, and they expire when your\n\t\t\t\tRage ends. Fortunately, Rage has a 10-minute duration, so you and your\n\t\t\t\tparty can stand around for a few turns feeling generally angry while you\n\t\t\t\tpass out THP.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Since you apply this at the start of your turn while Raging, you\n\t\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t be able to use this until the turn after you Rage. Combat\n\t\t\t\t\ttypically lasts 3 turns, so, if you Rage on turn 1, you might get to\n\t\t\t\t\tapply the THP twice in an encounter, and the points may not last long\n\t\t\t\t\tenough to have an effect. Allies need to be within 10 feet of you for\n\t\t\t\t\tyou to target them, so encourage them to end their turns nearby. You\n\t\t\t\t\tcan use Branches of the Tree to teleport them to you if necessary, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat occurs at the beginning of their turn, so they may be able to\n\t\t\t\t\twalk to you without eating your Reaction.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>This amount of temporary hp is typically expensive and requires feats\n\t\t\t\t\tlike Inspiring Leader or upcasting spells like False Life. With the\n\t\t\t\t\tdurability provided by this, you can protect relatively frail allies\n\t\t\t\t\tlike horses and familiars which otherwise become a liability early in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe game since their hp doesn&#8217;t scale. You might even try mounted\n\t\t\t\t\tcombat.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Branches of the Tree<\/span>: The obvious use here\n\t\tis to pull enemies adjacent to you and reduce their speed to 0, usually\n\t\tforcing them to spend their turn there. This can usually put your allies out\n\t\tof harm&#8217;s way, and if your target resorts to ranged attacks, they&#8217;ll make\n\t\tthem at Disadvantage since they&#8217;re in your reach.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can also use this to help allies. Creatures can choose to willingly\n\t\t\tfail saving throws, and reducing the target&#8217;s speed to 0 is optional, so\n\t\t\tyou can teleport allies out of dangerous positions, then let them spend\n\t\t\tthe rest of their turn doing whatever they like.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you can fly, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from using Branches of the Tree\n\t\t\twhile airborn. This is dangerous for non-flying enemies because you can hit\n\t\t\tthem with easy falling damage, but the ability to reduce flying enemies&#8217; speed\n\t\t\tto 0 means that you can force them to fall, too, giving you an easy counter to\n\t\t\tenemies which might otherwise be difficult to hold in place. Once enemies have\nfallen, you&#8217;ve reduced their speed to 0, which prevents them from standing for the rest of the turn.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battering Roots<\/span>: A World Tree Barbarian\n\t\twith a Reach weapon like a glaive can attack out to 20 feet, allowing you to\n\t\treach enemies over a huge area. Adding the Push and Topple masteries also\n\t\tdiversifies your tactical options quite a bit. If you&#8217;re using a Push or\n\t\tTopple weapon, now&#8217;s the time to switch. Note that you only get the extra\n\t\tmastery options with Heavy\/Versatile weapons, so you may still want to throw\n\t\ttridents to deal with enemies more than 20 feet away.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that the extended reach only applies on your own turn. It does\n\t\t\tnot allow you to make Opportunity Attacks at crazy distances unless you\n\t\t\tsomehow cause a creature to move during your own turn.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Travel Along the Tree<\/span>: 60 feet is a\n\t\twonderful amount of teleportation. Combined with Battering Roots and just\n\t\tplain walking, almost no enemy is out of reach. You may even be able to\n\t\tteleport into the air to grapple flying enemies. Remember that you can use this\nas part of the Bonus Action to activate Rage.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The group teleportation option won&#8217;t be consistently useful, but using it\n\t\t\tto teleport into combat and ambush your enemies can be very effective. You\n\t\t\tneed to be able to see the target location, and the range isn&#8217;t fantastic,\n\t\t\tbut seeing through a keyhole, a crack underneath a door, or through a\n\t\t\twindow all qualify.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Barbarian Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna start by eliminating the backgrounds that do not help with our primary ability score, Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Artisan<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: While Artisan can increase both Strength and Dexterity, Crafter is often unlikely to matter.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Entertainer<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A boost to Strength and Dexterity are what we like to see, and Musician hands out inspiration to the party at every rest.

Because every Heavy option is a two-handed weapon, the choice first comes down to whether we want to use a Shield or not. Then, because we have Weapon Mastery, we have to consider what properties we might want to use. In addition to that, Battering Roots adds Push or Topple to attacks made on our turn once we\u2019re level 10, not instead of, but in addition to at the same time on the same attack, such as using a Topple weapon and getting to also activate Push.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"versatile\">Versatile<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Quarterstaff<\/span> (Topple): If you want to mix a Shield and Polearm Master, this is one of your two options. With Polearm Master and Shield Master, you can force a creature to make up to four saves against falling Prone in a single turn. Pretty good combo. The base damage is a bit lower than other weapon options, but the flat bonus of Rage damage makes up for that.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spear<\/span> (Sap): Instead of saves against Prone, the target of these attacks gets Disadvantage on their next attack. If we\u2019re using Reckless Attack, this can help us mitigate the penalty while still goading the target to swing at us since now they have to choose between Disadvantage on our allies or a flat roll against us.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battleaxe<\/span> (Topple): Trading out Polearm Master compatibility for higher dice and Slashing damage gives a different synergy: using Slasher to reduce their speed which makes trying to stand hurt more. Good for being a really sticky Defender type.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longsword<\/span> (Sap): Slashing is good, Sap is good, being compatible with Shield Master is good. Solid pick all around.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warhammer<\/span> (Push): Push and Crusher and Shield Master to put someone into the timeout corner.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Warpick<\/span> (Sap): This is a Longsword that does Piercing damage, but versus the Spear we give up Polearm Master access for a die increase. Just go with a Spear over Warpick if you\u2019re looking for Piercing damage instead of having this as a backup for your Longsword.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trident<\/span> (Topple): We can throw it I guess.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"heavy\">Heavy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While Versatile weapons offer the ability to use a shield and potentially the Shield Master feat, Heavy weapons offer the possibility of Reach and potentially the Great Weapon Master feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glaive<\/span> (Graze): Graze is a bit of insurance that even on a miss, we do some small damage. Alone, it\u2019s not that great, but this weapon can use Polearm Master and, once we\u2019re 10th level, this means we can either use Topple or Push on a hit and still Graze on a miss with all of those attacks. While Reckless Attack makes missing much less likely, it does still happen, and once we have Brutal Strike, Reckless Attack no longer makes hitting with attacks a near certainty, so Graze&#8217;s guaranteed damage is helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greataxe<\/span> (Cleave): Cleave is a free extra attempt at a hit on another creature, once per turn. There is hidden synergy here: the extra attack is an attack which means Battering Roots can apply Push or Topple to this bonus attack, and while our ability modifier doesn\u2019t apply, our Rage damage bonus dues. Greataxe is only losing to Halberd in these ratings by lacking Reach and by being incompatible with Polearm Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greatsword<\/span> (Graze): Like Glaive above, except Greatsword can\u2019t use Polearm Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halberd<\/span> (Cleave): It\u2019s a lower die Greataxe with Reach that can Polearm Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lance<\/span> (Topple): I would only use this while mounted so I can have a Shield too, but then I would just use a Battleaxe to still get Topple anyways.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Maul<\/span> (Topple): If we compare this to the Pike, since with Battering Roots both of these weapons will always be able to activate both Topple and Push, we gain a little more damage but we lose Polearm Master access. If you want to Topple before 10 and use Great Weapon Master earlier instead of Polearm Master, then of course use this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pike<\/span> (Push): Polearm Master compatible Push and Topple combo.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Path of the World Tree Barbarian Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Just use Unarmored Defense.

Early on, the World Tree Barbarian\u2019s protection comes in the form of granting temporary hit points to an ally every round, a solid way to absorb the damage a fellow front-liner might take. Then later, as they grow stronger connections to Yggdrasil, the Barbarian can use their reaction to pull a creature close when the creature\u2019s turn begins.
