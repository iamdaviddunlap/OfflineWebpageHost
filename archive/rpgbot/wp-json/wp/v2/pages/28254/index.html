Permanent Advantage on any Performance check involving Dancing is going to feel super satisfying, getting Charisma to AC rewards you for leaning into your spellcasting ability, Bardic Damage is required for the subclass to function, and Agile Strikes is going to do some heavy lifting immediately and then ramp into overtime come level seven.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspiring Movement<\/span>: If this ability had no synergy, it would still be worth rating blue. As it is, it\u2019s also a reliable way to punch something before waltzing away and saving your friend the other squishy for good measure.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tandem Footwork<\/span>: I honestly don\u2019t understand why they thought printing this was fine. Thanks to the edition update, you&#8217;re already getting four d8 dice every short rest and the ability to generate more easily. Giving your whole party an initiative bonus of 4.5 (which will keep increasing over time) is going to provide incredible consistency for whatever opening volley you&#8217;ve put together. Admittedly, this only leaves you three or four Bardic Inspiration dice for the rest of the fight, but that&#8217;s still enough for one per turn if you don&#8217;t burn them on Reactions.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leading Evasion<\/span>: Evasion didn\u2019t really need to be better, but here we are.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"glamour\"><span class=\"rating-green\">College of Glamour<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Glamour focuses on spellcasting, support, and debuffing enemies with mental\n\teffects. While the features are often fantastic, the subclass suffers from\n\tresource starvation, depending on Bardic Inspiration or on your spell slots to\n\tuse most of your subclass features more than once per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Beguiling Music<\/span>: Charm Person is fine.\n\t\tMirror Image is a great defense, though it can be hard to cast in combat.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The ability to charm or frighten an enemy when you cast an enchantment or\n\t\t\tillusion spell is a great boost to your spellcasting. Charmed enemies\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t attack you, andm outside of combatm you can use it to charm other\n\t\t\tcreatures in social situations without the target knowing that you charmed\n\t\t\tit like the target does with Charm Person and similar spells. The Frightened option is\n\t\t\tmore useful in combat, as it prevents enemies from moving toward you and\n\t\t\tdebuffs their ability checks and attacks.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unfortunately, resistance to Charmed\/Frightened is common.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantle of Inspiration<\/span>: Great if your\n\t\tparty finds themselves in a bad situation. The temporary hit points aren&#8217;t\n\t\thuge, but they&#8217;ll still have an impact, and moving as a Reaction will get\n\t\tyour allies out of dangerous positions without cutting into their turns.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mantle of Majesty<\/span>: This will occupy your\n\t\tBonus Action for an entire encounter, but it&#8217;s absolutely worth doing so.\n\t\tCommand can disarm enemies using weapons, force melee enemies to move away,\n\t\tforce ranged enemies to move closer, or force enemies to waste their turns\n\t\tgroveling. The effects only last one turn, but trading your Bonus Action to\n\t\trob an enemy of their whole turn is a good trade in encounters where your\n\t\tparty outnumbers your enemies.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Against powerful enemies with Legendary Resistances, this is a great way\n\t\t\tto burn through their Legendary Resistance charges. On a failed save, the\n\t\t\ttarget is forced to make a horrible choice between losing an entire turn\n\t\t\tor burning a Legendary Resistance to save against a level 1 spell that\n\t\t\tonly cost you a Bonus Action to cast, and which you&#8217;re going to cast again.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that Mantle of Majesty does not cast a spell with a spell slot.\n\t\t\tThis means that it doesn&#8217;t trigger Beguiling Music, but it also means that\n\t\t\tyou can cast a spell with a spell slot on the same turn, leaving your\n\t\t\tAction free for you to do whatever you like.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Unbreakable Majesty<\/span>: This is a great\n\t\tdefense if you&#8217;re drawing a lot of attacks. It may be enough for you to wade\n\t\tinto melee just to draw and then waste your enemies&#8217; attacks. However,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re still a bard in light armor with d8 hit dice, so attacks that get\n\t\tthrough will be a problem. Strongly consider casting Mirror Image to further\n\t\tprotect yourself.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lore\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">College of Lore<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>College of Lore emphasizes and expands the Bard&#8217;s core capabilities: skills,\n\tspellcasting, and using Bardic Inspiration to support your allies and hinder\n\tyour enemies. The features are fantastic and really play to the Bard&#8217;s\n\tfunction as a jack of all trades, and, while it&#8217;s only two more spells,\n\tMagical Discoveries allows the Bard to fill in for basically any other\n\tspellcaster that you might have in the party so that your party never needs to\n\tworry about you choosing to bring a Bard instead of a Cleric or a Wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Additional Proficiencies<\/span>: 3 more skills of\n\t\tyour choice brings your total number of skill proficiencies up to 6 (not\n\t\tincluding those from your Background and possibly from your Species),\n\t\tallowing you to cover multiple skill-based rolls with ease.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cutting Words<\/span>: This excludes saving\n\t\tthrows, so you can&#8217;t force enemies to fail save-or-suck saves, but you can\n\t\tuse it to protect allies from attacks which barely hit, mitigating\n\t\tpotentially huge amounts of damage as a Reaction.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Discoveries<\/span>: Bards can start\n\t\tselecting spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists at\n\t\tlevel 10, but this gets you a taste of that capability earlier than anyone\n\t\telse. Powerful level 3 spell options include Fireball, Revivify, Spirit\n\t\tGuardians, and many others.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Peerless Skill<\/span>: You won&#8217;t be using this\n\t\tfor attacks, but you can use it to rescue failed skill checks, which will\n\t\tonly be useful outside of combat (with very rare exception). By this level\n\t\tyou have Expertise in 4 skills and access to Advantage from Enhance Ability,\n\t\tmaking your skills extremely reliable. Adding the ability to rescue a failed\n\t\tability check with a Bardic Inspiration die makes it very difficult for you\n\t\tto fail ability checks.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t use this with checks that you can&#8217;t fail, so you\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t apply this to initiative rolls.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"valor\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">College of Valor<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A martially-minded Bard may prefer College of Valor. By improving the Bard&#8217;s\n\tability to wade into melee safely, the Bard can fill nearly every role in a\n\tparty. If you&#8217;re in a small party, this is an exciting option. However, in a\n\tfull-sized, the Valor Bard&#8217;s lackluster martial capabilities will be\n\tfrighteningly apparent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valor faces three glaring problems: Valor&#8217;s focus on weapons makes the Bard\n\tMAD for little benefit, the Bard&#8217;s existing features are better than those\n\toffered by College of Valor, and a single level of Fighter provides everything\n\tthat you really need from the subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Combat Inspiration<\/strong>: Two new uses for Bardic Inspiration.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Defense<\/span>: This can block an attack\n\t\t\t\twhich just barely beat your ally&#8217;s AC. It may not be as impactful as\n\t\t\t\tturning a failed save into a successful one, but not every encounter\n\t\t\t\tinvolves saving throws.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Offense<\/span>: A profound waste of a powerful\n\t\t\t\tresource.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Martial Training<\/span>: Medium armor and a\n\t\tshield will significantly improve your AC. With 14 or more Dexterity, a\n\t\tbreastplate, and a shield, you&#8217;re looking at a respectable 18 AC, enough to\n\t\tmatch a fighter in full plate (without a shield). Half-plate will get you\n\t\tmore AC, but you might prefer to avoid Disadvantage on Stealth checks. If\n\t\tyou eventually get to 18 Dexterity, consider switching back to light armor.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You also get access to all martial weapons, which makes weapons\n\t\t\tmarginally more impactful. Grab a rapier for melee and a musket for\n\t\t\trange.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: This needs a different name because there is almost no circumstance under which you should actually make two attacks. In nearly every case you will make one attack and cast a cantrip. This doesn&#8217;t limit you to Bard cantrips, so strongly consider options like Eldritch Blast or True Strike if you can get them from feats or from multiclassing.\n<p>It&#8217;s more helpful to think of this as getting a free attack when you cast a cantrip. As a full caster, there may be entire encounters where you never once use this because you&#8217;re too busy casting level 1+ spells and using your Bonus Action for Bardic Inspiration.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Battle Magic<\/span>: An excellent use of your\n\t\tBonus Action, but your Bonus Action is also used for Bardic Inspiration and\n\t\tmany spells, so there will frequently be turns where you can&#8217;t use Battle\n\t\tMagic. Unfortunately, without True Strike to make the Bonus Action attack\n\t\tuse your Charisma, it&#8217;s likely to be a Dexterity-based attack, so it&#8217;s going\n\t\tto run into MAD issues.\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely certain how this interacts with the Valor Bard&#8217;s version of Extra Attack. This triggers when you cast a spell that has an Action casting time, but when you use Extra Attack you&#8217;re modifying the spell&#8217;s casting time much like a Sorcerer using Quickened Spell. In my opinion, this does not work with Extra Attack, but discuss the matter with your DM.<\/p>\n<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Bard subclasses are a significant factor in determining your character&#8217;s role in the party.
