This emphasis on elemental damage, combined with unusually high durability for a Sorcerer makes Draconic Sorcery a simple and reliable Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer to build and play. It&#8217;s directly comparable to the Evoker Wizard in many ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Draconic Bloodline leans so heavily on elemental damage of your chosen type, the Elemental Adept feat is essentially required. Resistances will be a persistent problem which can negate your most exciting Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer features and render your favorite spells nearly useless. Transmuted Spell Metamagic is another tax so that you can fit more spells into your favorite element.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#species\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Species<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Draconic Sorcery Sorcerer Build &#8211; Chromatic Orb Enthusiast<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#fun-with-chromatic-orb\">Fun With Chromatic Orb<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#chromatic-orb-leap-probability\">Chromatic Orb Leap Probability<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#missing-and-how-to-not-do-that\">Missing and How to Not Do That<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#range-targeting-cover\">Range, Targeting, Cover<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#is-the-damage-worth-all-of-this\">Is the Damage Worth All of This?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#species\">Species<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skill-and-tool-proficiencies\">Skill and Tool Proficiencies<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats-and-ability-score-increases\">Feats and Ability Score Increases<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

These changes made Chromatic Orb a powerful and exciting single-target damage option. We&#8217;re going to lean heavily into Chromatic Orb in this build, seeking to optimize our damage output and our probability to leap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But don&#8217;t worry. This is still a perfectly functional Blaster even if you&#8217;re not spamming Chromatic Orb.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fun-with-chromatic-orb\">Fun With Chromatic Orb<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chromatic-orb-leap-probability\">Chromatic Orb Leap Probability<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Chromatic Orb leaps if we roll doubles (at least two dice match; triples, quadruples, etc. all count) on the damage dice. This becomes increasingly likely as we add additional dice, but we&#8217;re also bounded by a maximum number of leaps so that things don&#8217;t get too out of hand. The designers were smart enough to know that this could turn into a problem. Still, we&#8217;re going to try to maximize our leaps to stretch the spell&#8217;s efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Spell Level<\/th><th>1<\/th><th>2<\/th><th>3<\/th><th>4<\/th><th>5<\/th><th>6<\/th><th>7<\/th><th>8<\/th><th>9<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Damage Dice<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>5d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><td>7d8<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><td>9d8<\/td><td>10d8<\/td><td>11d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leap Chance<\/td><td>34%<\/td><td>59%<\/td><td>79%<\/td><td>92%<\/td><td>98%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Max Leaps<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Math according to Wolfram Alpha.

Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percent.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever started a build and thought &#8220;maybe this wasn&#8217;t necessary&#8221;? I sure have. It&#8217;s not going to stop me, but I&#8217;ve had the thought. I want 100% Leap chance on a level Chromatic Orb!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we boost those probabilities? We reroll the damage dice to give ourselves more chances to get doubles. We have two very easy options for this: Elemental Adept and Empowered Spell. Both of these will allow us to reroll damage dice, and we don&#8217;t need to spend additional Sorcery Points with Empowered Spell once we&#8217;ve decided to use it, so we can reroll dice on each leap in case we don&#8217;t get doubles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When rerolling dice, be sure not to reroll dice that got you doubles. If you have double 1&#8217;s, for example, don&#8217;t reroll them unless you have another set of doubles. Giving up a leap to get a tiny bit more damage on the current target is rarely worth the trade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not qualified to give any more specific advice on when to reroll. The statistics get confusing very quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"missing-and-how-to-not-do-that\">Missing and How to Not Do That<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Chromatic Orb can continue to leap so long as your spell attack hits, and then you roll doubles on the damage for your new target. This means that you need to reliably hit with multiple attacks in quick succession to maximize the value of Chromatic Orb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maximizing our Charisma is essential, just as with any Sorcerer. That&#8217;s table stakes. What we need is additional improvements to our spell attack roll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/2190884-sorcerer#InnateSorcery-10292362\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Innate Sorcery<\/a>. Activate it as a Bonus Action and you get Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast. This means that we don&#8217;t need to rely on stealth, invisibility, etc.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seeking Spell Metamagic. For 1 Sorcery Point, reroll the d20 on a missed attack for a spell. Even if you used Empowered Spell, you can use Seeking Spell even if you&#8217;ve already used a different Metamagic. However, it doesn&#8217;t look like you can use this multiple times on the same spell, so it&#8217;s not enough to guarantee that you will hit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/1789201-spell-sniper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spell Sniper<\/a>. Cover will absolutely be a problem when Chromatic Orb leaps, so ignoring half cover and three-quarters cover will be consistently helpful. It also lets us cast Chromatic Orb safely while in melee, which makes it even more useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spellcasting Focuses. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/magic-items\/34712-wand-of-the-war-mage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wand of the War Mage<\/a> provides a bonus to spell attacks. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/magic-items\/2412091-bloodwell-vial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloodwell Vial<\/a> is preferred, but Wand of the War Mage is much more likely to appear as randomly generated treasure or in a published adventure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"range-targeting-cover\">Range, Targeting, Cover<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/phb-2024\/spells#Effects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spellcasting rules<\/a> specify that &#8220;a spell\u2019s description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else.&#8221; Chromatic Orb doesn&#8217;t. It would be perfectly reasonable to target creatures or objects with Chromatic Orb, so I&#8217;m going to assume that we can do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules for upcasting Chromatic Orb do specify that &#8220;a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell&#8221;, but it says &#8220;a creature&#8221;, not &#8220;a target&#8221;, so you may be able to target the same object multiple times. You do need to leap to another target first, but you could repeatedly hit the same object with other targets between each hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chromatic Orb&#8217;s range is 90 feet, which is comfortably long, but leap targets must be within 30 feet of the previous target. This isn&#8217;t a huge distance, but it&#8217;s typically enough to bounce between several enemies in a typical encounter. Spell Sniper both extends our range and allows us to ignore all but total cover, both of which make attacking easier, but it doesn&#8217;t extend the 30-foot leap range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If 30 feet isn&#8217;t enough range to jump between creatures, use a nearby object as a target to stretch your range. You may be able to target spaces on floors, walls, and ceilings if there isn&#8217;t a convenient piece of furniture or a plan or something, but your DM might give you a funny look. As a DM, I would allow it because you&#8217;re spending one of the limited number of bounces to damage scenery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interaction with total cover is a bit weird. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/phb-2024\/spells#Effects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spellcasting rules<\/a> specify that &#8220;to target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can\u2019t be behind&nbsp;Total Cover.&#8221; This applies to our leap targets, too. So, unfortunately, we can&#8217;t fire Chromatic Orb and then leap it around a corner at targets that we can&#8217;t see. The orb could leap through a space which is behind total cover, but we still need to see the target to attack it.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-the-damage-worth-all-of-this\">Is the Damage Worth All of This?<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Sometings, but only if you have enough targets to justify it, but also can&#8217;t justify using an area damage spell like Fireball or Chain Lightning. It&#8217;s admittedly a narrow use case, but the total damage can be exceptionally high in the right circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at Chromatic Orb alongside some other ranged attack spells:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Spell Level<\/th><th>Chromatic Orb (1 Target)<\/th><th>Max Targets<\/th><th>Chromatic Orb (Max Targets(<\/th><th>Guiding Bolt<\/th><th>Scorching Ray<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>3d8 (avg. 13.5)<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>6d8 (avg. 27)<\/td><td>4d6 (avg. 14)<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>4d8 (avg. 18)<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>12d8 (avg. 54)<\/td><td>5d6 (avg. 17.5)<\/td><td>6d6 (avg. 21)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>5d8 (avg. 22.5)<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>20d8 (avg. 90)<\/td><td>6d6 (avg. 21)<\/td><td>8d6 (avg. 28)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>6d8 (avg. 27)<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>30d8 (avg. 135)<\/td><td>7d6 (avg. 24.5)<\/td><td>10d6 (avg. 35)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>7d8 (avg. 31.5)<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>42d8 (avg. 189)<\/td><td>8d6 (avg. 28)<\/td><td>12d6 (avg. 42)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>8d8 (avg. 36)<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>56d8 (avg. 252)<\/td><td>9d6 (avg. 31.5)<\/td><td>14d6 (avg. 49)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>9d8 (avg. 40.5)<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>72d8 (avg. 324)<\/td><td>10d6 (avg. 35)<\/td><td>16d6 (avg. 56)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>10d8 (avg. 45)<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>90d8 (avg. 405)<\/td><td>11d6 (avg. 38.5)<\/td><td>18d6 (avg. 63)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>11d8 (avg. 49.5)<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>110d8 (avg. 495)<\/td><td>12d6 (avg. 42)<\/td><td>20d6 (avg. 70)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>A level 3 Chromatic Orb hitting 4 targets does more total damage than a level 9 Scorching Ray. Of course, that&#8217;s spread across multiple targets, which isn&#8217;t always as useful as eliminating a single enemy. But if we can hit just 2 targets, Chromatic Orb deals significantly more total damage than a Scorching Ray of the same level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can also compare Chromatic Orb to area damage spells. We&#8217;ll look at Fireball because it&#8217;s the go-to area damage spell and at Chain Lightning because it share&#8217;s Chromatic Orb&#8217;s ability to hit multiple enemies without hurting your allies. It&#8217;s not a perfect comparison, but it&#8217;s still informative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Spell Level<\/th><th>Chain Lightning<\/th><th>Chain Lightning Secondary Targets<\/th><th>Fireball<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>8d6 (avg. 28)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>10d6 (avg. 35)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>12d6 (avg. 42)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>10d8 (avg. 45)<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>14d6 (avg. 49)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>10d8 (avg. 45)<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>16d6 (avg. 56)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>10d8 (avg. 45)<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>18d6 (avg. 63)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>10d8 (avg. 45)<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>20d6 (avg. 70)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s assume that we can hit 4 targets with each spell. With a level 6 spell slot, we&#8217;ll deal 180 damage with Chain Lightning, 196 with Fireball, but just 144 with Chromatic Orb. This shows us that Chromatic Orb doesn&#8217;t make those other spells obsolete: it&#8217;s a precision tool for specific circumstances. If there are more targets that support the orb leaping, Chromatic Orb can quickly outdamage Chain Lightning and Fireball.
