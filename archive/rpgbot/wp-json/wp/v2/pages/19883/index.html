This allows us to restrict an enemy to a small area, preventing them from moving to attack. Against single melee enemies, this can be a death sentence. It only lasts one turn, so you need to refresh the effect every turn. We&#8217;re using a reach specifically so that we can do this without getting many other creatures&#8217; reach, then retreat 10 feet so that our enemy can&#8217;t move far enough to approach us to counterattack. They can still attempt an Athletics check to break the chains, but it&#8217;s opposed by our own check made with high Strength, proficiency in Athletics, and Advantage on the check thanks to Rage.<br><br>Galvanic Heart (Fulgurant Strike) is for handling multiple enemies, but because of the small AOE it&#8217;s only effective against enemies which are adjacent to each other. When you can trigger it, it&#8217;s great, but it won&#8217;t be frequent. We&#8217;re using a reach weapon, so the vast majority of the time you won&#8217;t need to make the save to avoid shocking yourself. When you do, expect to fail despite having Advantage.

Previously we were using a reach weapon so that we could hit an enemy, chain them in place, then withdraw. We can do the same thing with Crusher by moving our target away from us.

Mostly we care about the bonus to initiative.<br><br>Lightning Step once for free each turn means 8 damage guaranteed every turn. However, it leaves us within 5 feet of our target, which is why we abandoned our reach weapon in favor of Crusher. Now we can Lightning Step into melee, use the combos I described at level 8, and get Galvanic heart damage twice per turn.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Relentless Rage<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>ASI: Strength 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>More attack and damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Brutal Critical (2 dice)<\/td><td>A tiny bit more DPR.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Electric Beast<\/td><td>Galvanic Heart&#8217;s damage increases from 8 to 12, which is more of a DPR boost than Brutal Critical.<br><br>Electrified Chains now limits our target to a smaller area, making it easier for us to chain then and withdraw when we&#8217;re in tight quarters.<br><br>Fulgurant Strike&#8217;s larger AOE makes it much easier to hit multiple targets.<br><br>Lightning Step now lets us teleport, allowing us to get angry and move past\/through obstacles.

It also depends heavily on your Constitution modifier, which encourages players to increase their Constitution rather than maxing Strength and then taking nothing but feats for the rest of their career. Because the Lightning Vessel depends so heavily on a single damage type, running into resistance or immunity to lightning is a huge problem.
