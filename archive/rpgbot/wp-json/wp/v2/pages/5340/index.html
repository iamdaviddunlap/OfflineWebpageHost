No two Eidolons look or behave the same way, and with a bit of planning you can make an Eidolon serve nearly any purpose and fill nearly any role in a party. Much like an Animal Companion, Eidolons typically fall into front-line roles as strikers or defenders, but due to their intelligence and ability to communicate, they can serve as very effective scouts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Eidolon Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Eidolon Skills<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#free-skills\">Free Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#selected-skills\">Selected Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#base-forms\">Base Forms<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#evolutions\">Evolutions<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#1point-evolutions\">1-Point Evolutions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#2point-evolutions\">2-Point Evolutions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#3point-evolutions\">3-Point Evolutions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#4point-evolutions\">4-Point Evolutions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#summoner-feats\">Summoner Feats<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Eidolon Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">HD<\/span>: d10 hit points is pretty good, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s important to note that Eidolons don&#8217;t get hit dice at the same rate as\n\t\ttheir Summoner. The hit dice top out at 15<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">BAB<\/span>: Full BAB is pretty great, but due to\n\t\ttheir hit die progression Eidolons&#8217; BAB will generally keep pace with 2\/3\n\t\tBAB.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Good\/Bad Saves<\/span>: Two good saving throws is\n\t\tpretty good, and the variable good saves depending on the Eidolon&#8217;s base\n\t\tform introduces some interesting things to think about.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: By default the Eidolon gets 4\n\t\tskill ranks per hit die, but you can boost its intelligence to get extra\n\t\tranks if you feel the need. See the Eidolon Skills section below for help\n\t\twith skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Feats<\/span>: There doesn&#8217;t appear to be a way\n\t\tto retrain Eidolon feats, so be sure to plan out your feat selections well\n\t\tin advance. See the Eidolon Feats section below for help selecting feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Bonus<\/span>: Take the bonus as a natural\n\t\tarmor bonus every time. There is no case in which armor bonuses are better\n\t\tthan natural armor, and there are several things which bypass armor bonuses\n\t\tbut not natural armor. The bonus is pretty great, and will outpace armor and\n\t\tshield bonuses very quickly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str\/Dex Bonus<\/span>: This will boost your\n\t\tEidolon&#8217;s damage, AC, and Reflex saves. The bonuses might seem small, but\n\t\tthey keep pace with ability score enhancement items.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evolution Pool<\/span>: The Eidolon&#8217;s heart and\n\t\tsoul is its evolutions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Max. Attacks<\/span>: Perhaps the biggest\n\t\tlimitation on Eidolons&#8217; damage ouput. Without this, Eidolons would be fairly\n\t\tridiculous. Note that this is only a limit on the number of attacks that the\n\t\tEidolon can make in a turn, not on the Eidolon&#8217;s number of attack\n\t\toptions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Darkvision (Ex)<\/span>: Excellent on any and\n\t\tevery creature in the party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Link (Ex)<\/span>: The telepathy thing is cool,\n\t\tbut the magic item part of the ability is far more important. Unlike Animal\n\t\tCompanions, it is explicitly stated that Eidolons can use magic items which\n\t\twork in humanoid item slots. Give your Eidolon your belt slot for physical\n\t\tability enhancements, and maybe a ring of protection.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Share Spells (Ex)<\/span>: Cool for some\n\t\tbuffs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion (Ex)<\/span>: Fantastic, especially if\n\t\tyour Eidolon has a decent Reflex save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase (Ex)<\/span>: A few extra\n\t\tability points probably won&#8217;t make a huge difference compared to the free\n\t\tstrength\/dexterity bonus, but you can boost your Eidolon&#8217;s other abilities\n\t\tto get more hit points or skill ranks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Devotion (Ex)<\/span>: Enchantment is a very\n\t\tscary spell school.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Multiattack<\/span>: The rules don&#8217;t specifically\n\t\tstate that your Eidolon can take another feat in place of multiattack, but\n\t\tthe general rules for bonus feats allow you to do so. Multiattack is very\n\t\timportant, and you generally want it long before level 10. Of course, you\n\t\tcan plan your natural attacks so that they are all primary attacks, at which\n\t\tpoint Multiattack is useless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Evasion (Ex)<\/span>: Always\n\t\tfantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Eidolon Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>When picking your Eidolon&#8217;s skills, remember that they do not gain hit dice as quickly as characters do, so even their best skills likely won&#8217;t keep pace with a regular party member. Eidolons get 4 skill ranks per hit die by default, but this can be increased by improving the Eidolon&#8217;s intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"free-skills\">Free Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Why? Are you planning to\n\t\t\tfeint? Eidolons don&#8217;t get sneak attack, and they&#8217;re not terribly\n\t\t\tcharismatic.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Craft<\/span> (Int): Never.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): If your Eidolon can fly (and\n\t\t\tyou want it to fly), one rank here can pay off very well.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (planes)<\/span> (Int): Eidolons have 7\n\t\t\tbase intelligence, so they&#8217;re at a huge disadvantage for knowledge skills.\n\t\t\tCoupled with their slow hit dice advancement, Eidolons will have a lot of\n\t\t\tproblems contributing meaningful amounts of knowledge.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The most rolled skill\n\t\t\tin the game, and even with just a few ranks one more set of eyes in the\n\t\t\tparty could save your life.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Worth 1 rank if\n\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t need the skill ranks, but don&#8217;t expect to keep up with enemy\n\t\t\tbluff modifiers.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Crucial for scouts or\n\t\t\tambushing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"selected-skills\">Selected Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At 1st level, the summoner can choose 4 additional skills to be class skills for his eidolon. These free skills provide a lot of versatility for your Eidolon, so be sure to pick skills which support the role you want your Eidolon to fill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Great for Strikers to\n\t\t\tmove through combat without drawing attacks of opportunity.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Or you could make your\n\t\t\tEidolon fly.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): An Eidolon is not a\n\t\t\tFace.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disable Device<\/span> (Dex): Excellent for\n\t\t\tScouts, but Eidolons don&#8217;t get Trapfinding.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disguise<\/span> (Cha): Good luck disguising your\n\t\t\tpet extraplanar were-draco-pire-lich.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Escape Artist<\/span> (Dex): Very situational,\n\t\t\tand Eidolons tend to be scary in grapples as a side-effect of their\n\t\t\tgeneral combat scariness.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): Save this for the\n\t\t\tDruid.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): Someone with a Wisdom bonus\n\t\t\tshould take Heal.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): An Eidolon is not a\n\t\t\tFace.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge<\/span> (Any) (Int): Eidolons have 7\n\t\t\tbase intelligence, so they&#8217;re at a huge disadvantage for knowledge skills.\n\t\t\tCoupled with their slow hit dice advancement, Eidolons will have a lot of\n\t\t\tproblems contributing meaningful amounts of knowledge.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Linguistics<\/span> (Int): An Eidolon is not a\n\t\t\tFace, and the only thing anyone really uses Linguistics for is to learn\n\t\t\tlanguages.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): You could, in theory, have\n\t\t\tyour Eidolon ride another creature. It could even be effective.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sleight of Hand<\/span> (Dex):\n\t\t\tSituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): With 7 intelligence,\n\t\t\tthis isn&#8217;t going to work well.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swim<\/span> (Str): Just give your Eidolon a Swim\n\t\t\tspeed.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Use Magic Device<\/span> (Cha): Eidolons don&#8217;t\n\t\t\treally have enough Charisma to make UMD reliable, and they don&#8217;t gain Hit\n\t\t\tDice fast enough to offset the lack of Charisma.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"base-forms\">Base Forms<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>All base forms get 5 points worth of free evolutions. The biggest differences are their starting ability scores and their good saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Aquatic<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re in an aquatic campaign, you&#8217;re going to need to spend evolution points to buy your pet fish some legs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quadruped<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Quadruped is a step above other Eidolon base forms solely because it gets the Pounce evolution. As the Eidolon grows and gains additional attacks, Pounce becomes crucial, especially if you intend to use your Eidolon as a Striker. This limitation is somewhat ridiculous because you can easily spend a few evolution points on any other base form to match all of the anatomical features of the quadruped base form. The Quadruped can also serve as a mount, which makes it very easy for the summoner to remain adjacent to the Eidolon to share spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Biped<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Biped is a very versatile option. Arms and good strength make it a great option for an area control defender, especially if you increase its size. Increasing size to Huge and taking the Reach evolution nets you a maximum of 20 foot reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Serpentine<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Serpentine base form is the slowest and has the least strength of all of the base forms. Because it has high base dexterity and starts with Reach, it can make a good Defender, but it will have trouble dealing damage until you enhance its strength. The Serpentine base form can be used as a mount, and because it can take Constrict, it is an excellent grappler.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evolutions\">Evolutions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Evolutions are your Eidolon&#8217;s heart and soul.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1point-evolutions\">1-Point Evolutions<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Basic Magic<\/span> (Sp): All of the listed\n\t\t\tspells are bad or can be cast by the summoner.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bite<\/span> (Ex): If your Eidolon&#8217;s strength\n\t\t\tis really high, improving the strength bonus to 1.5 could be worth an\n\t\t\tevolution point. If your Eidolon is out of limbs to put claws on, a Bite\n\t\t\tis a decent choice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Claws<\/span> (Ex): Two primary attacks, and you\n\t\t\tcan put them on arms or legs. The gold standard of attack type\n\t\t\tevolutions.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Ex): Even more situational than\n\t\t\tSwim.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gills<\/span> (Ex): Really only necessary in\n\t\t\taquatic campaigns.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hooves<\/span> (Ex): Claws are considerably\n\t\t\tbetter, and you don&#8217;t even need Hooves for the Trample evolution.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Damage<\/span> (Ex): Really only good\n\t\t\tif you have a whole bunch of one type of attack, so if you plan to use\n\t\t\tthis be sure to focus on one type of attack.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Natural Armor<\/span> (Ex): Not very\n\t\t\tflashy, but additional armor never hurts.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"pramge\">Low-Light Vision<\/span> (Ex): Occasionally useful,\n\t\t\tbut Eidolons already get Darkvision for free.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Attacks<\/span> (Su): Great for bypassing\n\t\t\tDR, but can be replaced by the Eldritch Claws feat or permanent Magic Fang\n\t\t\tto save evolution points, and gaining DR\/alignment allows your natural\n\t\t\tattacks to bypass DR of that alignment.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mount<\/span> (Ex): Riding your Eidolon is\n\t\t\tawesome, but it can put you a bit too close to your enemies.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, this is limited to quadrupedal and serpentine forms, so you\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t ride your bipedal velociraptor.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pincers<\/span> (Ex): Only take this if you\n\t\t\tplan to make your Eidolon a Grappler. Otherwise Claws are strictly\n\t\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pounce<\/span> (Ex): Crucial for Strikers. Take\n\t\t\tthis as soon as you have two attacks to use it with.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pull<\/span> (Ex): Add this to an attack type\n\t\t\twith reach, can you can use your reach attacks to pull enemies into range\n\t\t\tfor your other attacks. This also allows you to significantly interfere\n\t\t\twith people trying to move past your Eidolon, making this an excellent\n\t\t\tchoice for Defenders.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Push<\/span> (Ex): Why would you want to push\n\t\t\tthings out of your Eidolon&#8217;s reach?<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reach<\/span> (Ex): Crucial for Defenders. Not\n\t\t\tthat this only applies to one attack, not one attack type, so you may want\n\t\t\tto take this twice if you plan to use Pull or similar abilities.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resistance<\/span> (Ex): This is a very cheap\n\t\t\tway to get permanent energy resistance.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scent<\/span> (Ex): Scent is great for chasing\n\t\t\tdown invisible or hidden enemies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skilled<\/span> (Ex): If you want your Eidolon\n\t\t\tto be a Scout, throwing this in Perception or Stealth may be a good\n\t\t\tinvestment.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slam<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s not clear if this\n\t\t\tgives you a slam on both limbs, or if you only get one slam per pair of\n\t\t\tlimbs. I assume that you only get one slam based on the difference in\n\t\t\tdamage between Slam and Claws, but the difference between 1d6 and 1d8\n\t\t\tdamage is not enough to justify giving up a second primary attack.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sting<\/span> (Ex): An extra primary attack is\n\t\t\tnice, but the damage is relatively small, and you need to spend two\n\t\t\tevolution points to get it. Of course, you can add poison to the Sting,\n\t\t\twhich is good despite being expensive to attain.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swim<\/span> (Ex): Very occasionally nice to\n\t\t\thave, but not crucial unless you&#8217;re in an aquatic campaign.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tail<\/span> (Ex): You really only need this\n\t\t\tfor the Tail Slap or Sting evolutions, which aren&#8217;t great.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tail Slap<\/span> (Ex): Two evolution points for\n\t\t\tone secondary attack is a very poor investment. Sting is considerably\n\t\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tentacle<\/span> (Ex): Better than tail slap,\n\t\t\tbut secondary attacks are still not as good as primary attacks. The\n\t\t\tprimary appeal is that you can get this without investing in any other\n\t\t\tevolutions.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unnatural Aura<\/span> (Su): This is very cool,\n\t\t\tbut not very useful, especially for 2 evolution points.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wing Buffet<\/span> (Ex): The attacks are\n\t\t\tsecondary, but you do get two of them for one evolution point.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2point-evolutions\">2-Point Evolutions<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ability Increase<\/span> (Ex): Put this on\n\t\t\tStrength, and potentially Dexterity and Constitution if you feel like you\n\t\t\tneed it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Hugely\n\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Constrict<\/span> (Ex): Essential for\n\t\t\tgrapplers.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Energy Attacks<\/span> (Su): That&#8217;s potentially\n\t\t\ta ton of extra damage if you have enough attacks to attach it to.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flight<\/span> (Ex or Su): Flight is crucial,\n\t\t\tespecially at high levels.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gore<\/span> (Ex): A second primary attack on\n\t\t\tyour head which works alongside your bite attack. For one more point you\n\t\t\tcan get an extra set of arms and claws.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grab<\/span> (Ex): Essential for grapplers.\n\t\t\tChoose Pincers for the extra +2 bonus unless you plan to use Swallow\n\t\t\tWhole.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Head<\/span> (Ex): One head is usually\n\t\t\tplenty.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Keen Scent<\/span> (Ex): This would be fantastic\n\t\t\tif it worked above water.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Immunity<\/span> (Su): Much better than\n\t\t\tresistance. At only two points you can afford to take immunity to several\n\t\t\telements.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Limbs<\/span> (Ex): Essential to meet your\n\t\t\tmaximum number of attacks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Minor Magic<\/span> (Sp): All of the spells\n\t\t\tare fairly weak, and will become insignificant at high levels. Vanish\n\t\t\tmight be the only option which remains useful at high levels.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Poison<\/span> (Ex): The DC scales so it will\n\t\t\tstay good at high levels. Strength damage is pretty good, but spending two\n\t\t\tpoints to change it to constitution damage is extremely tempting.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rake<\/span> (Ex): Rake is normally pretty\n\t\t\tgreat, but you need to be grappling to use this evolution. Quadrupeds tend\n\t\t\tto be more about charging and pouncing than grappling, and for good\n\t\t\treason.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rend<\/span> (Ex): Get a whole bunch of claws,\n\t\t\tget Improved Damage for your claws, and take Rend. Rend things for huge\n\t\t\tpiles of damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trample<\/span> (Ex): The damage isn&#8217;t great,\n\t\t\tand using Trample draws a lot of attacks of opportunity without even\n\t\t\tknocking the target prone.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tremorsense<\/span> (Ex): Blindsense is one\n\t\t\tmore point and considerably better.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trip<\/span> (Ex): A Fantastic addition to\n\t\t\tanything with a bite. Lead your quadruped&#8217;s charges with a tripping bite\n\t\t\tattack, then mess them up with your pile of claws.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Undead Appearance<\/span> (Ex): Really only\n\t\t\tuseful in an evil party.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Training<\/span> (Ex): Your Eidolon&#8217;s\n\t\t\tnatural weapons will do nearly as much damage as any weapon, though their\n\t\t\tcritical hits won&#8217;t be as good, and you can&#8217;t enhance natural weapons. You\n\t\t\tcan also use the Eidolon&#8217;s feats to get weapon proficiency if you really\n\t\t\twant it. If your Eidolon has high enough BAB to get additional attacks,\n\t\t\tremember that you only get iterative attacks with weapons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3point-evolutions\">3-Point Evolutions<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blindsense<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic for\n\t\t\tpinpointing invisible or hidden enemies. Easily worth the three evolution\n\t\t\tpoints.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Burrow<\/span> (Ex): Great for infiltration or\n\t\t\tescape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Damage Reduction<\/span> (Su): DR is always\n\t\t\tnice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Frightful Presence<\/span> (Ex): Making\n\t\t\topponents shaken or frightened makes them quite a bit easier to kill.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Major Magic<\/span> (Sp): Very few of the\n\t\t\tspells are worth taking, and using them once per day is hardly enough to\n\t\t\tjustify 3 evolution points.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">See in Darkness<\/span> (Su): Blindsense is miles\n\t\t\tbetter, and supernatural darkness is extremely rare.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swallow Whole<\/span> (Ex): A great way to take\n\t\t\tenemies out of a fight, especially small and physically weak enemies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Web<\/span> (Ex): Cool, and fairly effective,\n\t\t\tbut can be replaced with a net and a ranged touch attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4point-evolutions\">4-Point Evolutions<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dimension Door<\/span> (Sp): Once per day and you\n\t\t\tneed to invest a ton into improving your Eidolon&#8217;s Charisma.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindsight<\/span> (Ex): Totally negates the\n\t\t\tadvantage of invisibility, and instantly locates enemies. Not strictly\n\t\t\tnecessary, but certainly worth considering.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Breath Weapon<\/span> (Su): The damage and AOE\n\t\t\tare both decent, but 4 points for a once per day breath weapon is just too\n\t\t\texpensive. Extra points for additional uses is nice, a maximum of 3 uses\n\t\t\tis still not fantastic.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fast Healing<\/span> (Su): Take at least one\n\t\t\tpoint on every Eidolon. As long as your Eidolon doesn&#8217;t get dropped to 0\n\t\t\tin a given fight, it&#8217;s back at full strength before the next fight. If\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re a Synthesist Summoney, this makes you nearly unkillable.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incorporeal Form<\/span> (Sp):\n\t\t\tSituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Large<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic for a wide variety\n\t\t\tof builds. Grapplers need it to grapple big creatures, Defenders need the\n\t\t\treach, and every Eidolon benefits from the huge amount of bonus strength\n\t\t\tand constitution. Upgrading to Huge is even better in many cases.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lifesense<\/span> (Su): Blindsight and\n\t\t\tBlindsense are much better.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">No Breath<\/span> (Ex): Too situational to\n\t\t\tjustify the cost.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Greatly reduces\n\t\t\tthe need to worry about saving throws.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ultimate Magic<\/span> (Sp): If you wanted to\n\t\t\tcast spells you should have been a Sorcerer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summoner-feats\">Summoner Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Summoner&#8217;s feat choices are just as important as those for the Eidolon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Eidolon<\/span>: Basically Combat\n\t\t\tExpertise for your Eidolon. Excellent for Defender Eidolons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Evolution<\/span>: More points means a\n\t\t\tbetter monster. The &#8220;special&#8221; section of the feat text appears to be\n\t\t\tincorrect; it should say &#8220;feat&#8221; instead of &#8220;evolution&#8221;. Take this feat as\n\t\t\toften as possible.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Focused Eidolon<\/span>: There are much better\n\t\t\tways to get bonuses on Concentration checks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Share Spell<\/span>: Nice for sharing\n\t\t\tbuff spells, especially those with long durations.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resilient Eidolon<\/span>: The duration is\n\t\t\tfairly short, but this might save your life.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Summoner&#8217;s Call<\/span>: A +2 ehancement bonus\n\t\t\tis nice, but it only lasts for 10 minutes after summoning your Eidolon.\n\t\t\tSince most Summoners will keep their Eidolon around all day long, you\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t see this bonus often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vigilant Eidolon<\/span>: Skill Focus is better,\n\t\t\twhich is pretty sad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Eidolon is a fantastic concept: a pet which you build from the ground up with a pool of &#8220;evolution points&#8221;. No two Eidolons look or behave the same way, and with a bit of planning you can make an Eidolon serve nearly any purpose and fill nearly any role in a party. Much like an Animal Companion, Eidolons typically fall into front-line roles as strikers or defenders, but due to their intelligence and ability to communicate, they can serve as very effective scouts. Eidolon Abilities HD: d10 hit points is pretty good, but it&#8217;s important to note that
