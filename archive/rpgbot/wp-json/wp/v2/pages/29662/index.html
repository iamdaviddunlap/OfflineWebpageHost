The only feature which applies in combat situations or in a dungeon crawl or something is Master of Tactics; everything else is for social situations. You can scrape by on core Rogue class features, but outside of a highly social campaign, the Mastermind is going to struggle compared to other Rogues. Even in campaigns where the Mastermind is well suited, you will need to work to make your features meaningful and your DM will need to tailor the game to your capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Master of Tactics adds a tiny taste of Support to the Rogue&#8217;s capabilities, but using it comes at the cost of things that the Rogue already does well. The Mastermind&#8217;s other tactics support your ability to play a Face, but in the vast majority of campaigns, they my see exceptionally rare use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Mastermind Rogue Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Mastermind Rogue Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Mastermind Rogue Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Mastermind Rogue Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Mastermind Rogue Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Mastermind Rogue Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Mastermind Rogue Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Mastermind Rogue Build &#8211; Criminal Mastermind<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Of course, as a Rogue, no one needs Advantage as much as you.\n\t\tUsing this as a Bonus Action prevents you from using Cunning Action, Steady\n\t\tAim, or two-weapon fighting, so your Bonus Actions will always be a very\n\t\tdifficult trade-off.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>A good use case would be to use Master of Tactics to give your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\tFighter-equivalent Advantage on a check to Shove your enemy prone, then\n\t\t\twait for Advantage on subsequent turns. If the initiative order supports\n\t\t\tit, you could Ready an attack and wait until your target is prone before\n\t\t\tattacking them.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you&#8217;re using this with more of a focus on helping your allies, martial\n\t\t\tallies will get diminishing returns once they pick up Extra Attack at\n\t\t\tlevel 5. Allied spellcasters may get more value for high-damage spell\n\t\t\tattacks, but spell attacks disappear after Vampiric Touch at 3rd level.\n\t\t\tUnless you have someone leaning heavily on Inflict Wounds or Vampiric\n\t\t\tTouch like a Death Cleric, you may not find a spellcaster who actually\n\t\t\tcares.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Insightful Manipulator<\/span>: A fun way to\n\t\tmetagame, but not always useful since in most games you typically won&#8217;t get\n\t\tto spend a minute chatting up enemies before weapons come out. If you&#8217;re\n\t\table to observe your target while hiding, you can trigger this against\n\t\tcreatures will be immediately hostile when they see you.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>In intrigue games this could be a neat way to learn about a creature, but\n\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t get a novel way to make this information mechanically useful, so\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s often little more than trivia and a hint at how the creature is\n\t\t\tbuilt. In combat, knowing the target&#8217;s lowest mental stat can be helpful\n\t\t\tinformation for your party&#8217;s spellcasters so that they can target your\n\t\t\tenemies with save-or-suck spells.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Misdirection<\/span>: I think the intent is to use\n\t\tenemy creatures as cover while you&#8217;re being attacked at range, but that\n\t\tsimply doesn&#8217;t happen. Few enemies rely on ranged attacks, and most which do\n\t\tso can also produce area effects, or they could target one of your allies,\n\t\tsuch as that soft, squishy Wizard over there.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>In the rare situation where you are targeted by a ranged attack, your\n\t\t\tbest bet is to hide behind an ally. It can be a bit rude to shuffle\n\t\t\tattacks onto an ally, but if you&#8217;re using a well-armored ally as cover,\n\t\t\tsometimes your ally may be better suited to absorb the attack, and your\n\t\t\tparty&#8217;s Defender generally goes into combat explicitly hoping that they&#8217;ll\n\t\t\tdraw attacks away from you and your other squishy allies.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Lightfoot Halflings have the ability to hide behind creatures one size\n\t\t\tlarger than they are, which will often also give you cover. Of course, if\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re hidden, you&#8217;re also untargetable, which entirely negates the need\n\t\t\tfor this feature.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Soul of Deceit<\/span>: Very situational.\n\t\tCharacters in a typical campaign might be subject to such effects once or\n\t\ttwice if they run a full campaign from levels 1 to 20, and, even in a\n\t\tintrigue campaign where you might face other sneaky people with options like\n\t\ttelepathy or spells like Zone of Truth, those options are typically limited\n\t\tto powerful characters and won&#8217;t be applied to you so frequently that this\n\t\tis justifiably as a level 17 feature.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Mastermind Rogue Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2669\">typical Rogue<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Mastermind Rogue Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11730\">typical Rogue<\/a>.
