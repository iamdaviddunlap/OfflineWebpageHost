It is extremely durable,\n\t\thas a huge pile of resistance and immunities, it can heal, it can cast a few\n\t\tspells, and you get a cool horse. Paladins are a fantastic class for new\n\t\tplayers because they are simple to play, don&#8217;t require a ton of build\n\t\tdecisions at every level, and the Paladin&#8217;s abilities make it easy to\n\t\trecover from damage and negative status effects. The Paladin has a short\n\t\tskill list and few skill points, but even with these limits the Paladin can\n\t\tstill serve as a very effective Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paladin suffers a few of the same limits as a Fighter. Without the\n\t\tversatility of a large spell list, Paladins typically serve purely combat\n\t\troles (unless they invest skill points to also serve as a Face), and they\n\t\tlack abilities to overcome other challenges. Some of the Paladins feature,\n\t\tlike Turn Undead, have very little function for Paladins. Their wide range\n\t\tof abilities also comes with horrile MAD. These limitations place the\n\t\tPaladin very low on the class tier list, but that certainly doesn&#8217;t make\n\t\tthem useless or boring to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Paladin Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#substitution-levels\">Substitution Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#unearthed-arcana\">Unearthed Arcana<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#non-core-races\">Non-Core Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#divine-feats\">Divine Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells\">Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which tend to be more consistent than 3.5 handbooks. Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Paladin Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 hit points is standard\n\t\tfor martial classes.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Full BAB.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saves<\/span>: Paladins have the best saves in the\n\t\tgame by a wide margin. They have good Fortitude saves, and need both\n\t\tConstitution and Wisdom, giving them good saves in the two most important\n\t\tsaves. On top of that, Divine Grace allows them to add their Charisma bonus\n\t\tto all of their saves. Even with modest Charisma, this is likely at least\n\t\tthe equivalent of Great Fortitude, Iron Will, and Lightning Reflexes for\n\t\tfree.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor, tower shields,\n\t\tand martial weapons.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: 2+ skill ranks is very limiting,\n\t\tand because Paladins are so MAD Intelligence is frequently a dump stat.\n\t\tPaladins get a few important skills, but don&#8217;t expect to use them much.<\/p>\n\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Aura of Good<\/span> (Ex): This essentially never matters.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Evil<\/span> (Sp): Consider so much of the\n\t\tPaladin&#8217;s flavor involves hunting evil, this makes your life a lot easier.\n\t\tUse it to check potentially disguised enemies, or to peek through thin\n\t\tbarriers.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Smite Evil<\/span> (Su): There&#8217;s some debate\n\t\tabout what constitutes a &#8220;normal melee attack&#8221;, so check with your DM. You\n\t\tget very few uses per day, the damage isn&#8217;t huge, and missing wastes your\n\t\talready limited attempts. Smite Evil is also limited to melee attacks\n\t\t(unless you spend a feat), which forces Paladins into melee.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Grace<\/span> (Su): The source of the\n\t\tPaladin&#8217;s insanely good saves, and a good reason for a two-level class dip\n\t\tin some builds.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lay on Hands<\/span> (Su): The pool of points\n\t\tisn&#8217;t huge, but the ability to precisely set the amount of healing you use\n\t\tis useful for getting those last few hit points without wasting more charges\n\t\tfrom your Wand of Lesser Vigor. You can also burn this on undead creatures,\n\t\tpotentially turning Lay on Hands into a huge pile of guranteed damage.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Courage<\/span> (Su): Situational. Fear\n\t\teffects aren&#8217;t terribly common, they&#8217;re easy to mitigate, and if they affect\n\t\tyou the worst thing that generally happens is that you run away.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Health<\/span> (Ex): Diseases, especially\n\t\tsupernatural ones, don&#8217;t become common until high levels. Even then, they\n\t\tgenerally don&#8217;t tale effect for a few days, during which time you have had\n\t\tplenty of time to cast Remove Disease.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Turn Undead<\/span> (Su): Turn Undead is a\n\t\treally boring ability, and Paladins are considerably worse at it than\n\t\tClerics. Your best bet is to use feats to turn your Turn Undead uses into\n\t\tsome other useful ability.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spells<\/span>: Paladins are a half-caster, so\n\t\tthey only get up to 4th-level spells. Their spell list is small, but\n\t\tincludes a lot of really fantastic buffs. You only need 14 wisdom to cast\n\t\teven the best Paladin spells, and you don&#8217;t need to boost your Wisdom much\n\t\tbecause you should never be casting anything with a save DC.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Special Mount<\/span> (Sp): A Paladin&#8217;s mount is\n\t\ttypically just a fancy horse, and frequently gets ignored because it&#8217;s hard\n\t\tto take a horse into cramped dungeons. Despite these issues, the Paladin&#8217;s\n\t\tmount can be a powerful and useful companion, especially when enhanced with\n\t\ta few feats.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Disease<\/span> (Sp): Paladins are\n\t\talready immune to disease, but this is helpful if your party lacks a\n\t\tCleric.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Code of Conduct<\/span>: The Paladin&#8217;s code of conduct is the\n\t\tprimary reason the &#8220;Lawful Stupid&#8221; stereotype exists. It expects that the\n\t\tPaladin be upstanding, honorable, and just at all times, even when it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t make tactical sense to do so. This often requires the Paladin to\n\t\ttake stupid risks like walking into a room full of enemies and demanding\n\t\tsurrender instead of surprise attacking them. Your DM may interpret this in\n\t\tany number of ways, so be sure to consider this when determining how your\n\t\tPaladin will fit into the party.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Associates<\/span>: It&#8217;s pretty rare for parties to include\n\t\tcharacters of both good and evil alignments, so this probably won&#8217;t be a\n\t\tproblem.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t\t<li\n\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Charging Smite<\/span\n\t\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t\t>: If you didn&#8217;t want a mount, this is probably the best way to replace\n\t\t\tit. This triples your bonus smite damage on a charge, and saves the smite\n\t\t\tuse if you miss, dramatically improving the reliability of Smite Evil.\n\t\t\tNote that the additional smite damage is based on your paladin level, so\n\t\t\tif you multiclass into something like Gray Guard you only gain 1 damage\n\t\t\tper level.<\/li\n\t\t>\n\t\t<li\n\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Curse Breaker<\/span\n\t\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t\t>: I am far more scared of curses than diseases, and you can recover from\n\t\t\ta disease by resting.<\/li\n\t\t>\n\t\t<li\n\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Divine Counterspell<\/span\n\t\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t\t>: This is questionably useful for Clerics, and Paladins take a -3 penalty\n\t\t\tto your check compared to a Cleric.<\/li\n\t\t>\n\t\t<li\n\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Spirit<\/span\n\t\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Ds<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t\t>: The spirit abilities are interesting, but the limited user per day make\n\t\t\tthis hard to justify.<\/li\n\t\t>\n\t\t<li\n\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Dragonscale Husk<\/span\n\t\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DrM<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t\t>: Paladins are MAD enough as it without needing the 14 dexterity to make\n\t\t\tthis keep up with medium armor.<\/li\n\t\t>\n\t\t<li\n\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drakeensteed Mount<\/span\n\t\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DrM<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t\t>: Drakkensteeds aren&#8217;t as good as the options available from the Dragon\n\t\t\tMount feat, but they&#8217;re much better than a horse since they can fly, and\n\t\t\tthis doesn&#8217;t cost a feat.<\/li\n\t\t>\n\t\t<li\n\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Warrior<\/span\n\t\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t\t>: Giving up spells is always hard, but since spellcasting dramatically\n\t\t\tincreases the Paladin&#8217;s MAD, it&#8217;s not such a bad option.

The list includes all of the essential mounted combat feats, as\n\t\t\twell as Extra Smiting and Improved Smiting, so you should have enough\n\t\t\toptions if you&#8217;re going for a mounted combat build.

Expensive, but if you&#8217;re not using\n\t\t\tadamantine heavy armor it&#8217;s a great way to get DR. Absolutely\n\t\t\t<em>do not<\/em> get a Shirt of Resilience. By the time you can afford this\n\t\t\tnearly everything you meet can bypass DR\/magic. DR\/adamantine is my\n\t\t\tfavorite because only things like Iron Golems can bypass it without an\n\t\t\tadamantine weapon.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot. A\n\t\t\tstrictly better choice than a Cloak of Resistance, unless you plan to buy\n\t\t\ta Shirt of X for DR.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enlarge Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Reach is always nice, and the bonus Strength can be a helpful damage\n\t\t\tboost.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">See invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With no way to handle invisible creatures, the ability to always see\n\t\t\tthem is a fantastic benefit.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Multiclassing typically prevents you from taking additional Paladin levels,\n\t\tso either start in another class before becoming a Paladin, or plan to get\n\t\tall of your Paladin levels early before permanently switching to other\n\t\tclasses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bard<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Devoted Performer is bad for Paladins. The Paladin&#8217;s defenses are great\n\t\t\tfor the Bard, but the Paladin doesn&#8217;t really benefit from the Bard&#8217;s\n\t\t\tabilities.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blackguard<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: The Blackguard is a great flavor and an excellent plot device, but it\n\t\t\tmakes much more sense as a player to just build a Paladin of\n\t\t\tSlaughter\/Tyranny.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cavalier<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CW<\/a><\/sup>: Paladins get the best mount ability in the game, which rolls naturally\n\t\t\tinto Cavalier. If you really like to charge things with a lance for\n\t\t\tmassive damage, Cavalier is the way to go. Don&#8217;t forget to cast Rhino&#8217;s\n\t\t\tRush!<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gray Guard<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CS<\/a><\/sup>: You give up advancing your mount and half of your spellcasting, but you\n\t\t\tcontinue advancing smite evil and can smite chaotic creatures, and can\n\t\t\teventually smite anyone. Lay on Hands also turns into an offensive option,\n\t\t\tallowing you to harm living creatures.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Ascetic Knight is a cool flavor, but combining two extremely MAD\n\t\t\tclasses really doesn&#8217;t work well. Neither class gets any significant\n\t\t\tbenefit from the other. You might be able to cobble together a functional\n\t\t\tcharacter with the Elf Paladin substitution levels, Zen Archery, and the\n\t\t\tDragonscale Husk ACF.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ranger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Devoted Tracker is a cool flavor, and might work for an Elf Paladin,\n\t\t\tbut Paladin and Ranger are both very MAD, and Ranger is probably the\n\t\t\tsecond worst class in the game. The two classes offer very little to each\n\t\t\tother. The best way to optimize this is to focus on your animal\n\t\t\tcompanion\/mount, but there are better ways to build a cool pet.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Devoted Inquisitor is a cool concept, the ability to daze targets is\n\t\t\texcellent, and this rolls nicely into the Shadowbane Inquisitor class,\n\t\t\twhich is a lot of fun but very weak.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sorcerer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Sorcadin gish builds can be very effective.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 3.5
