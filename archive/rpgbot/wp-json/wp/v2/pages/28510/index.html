It\u2019s still very much the meat of the feat, though. The feel-good update is that it no longer requires a Bonus Action, instead being effectively a free action that interrupts your Attack action. This means two wonderful things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Characters with this feat can still use their Bonus Action for other things, including an additional attack with Polearm Master, other class-based, species-based, or feat-based features, etc. It also allows for casting spells with a Bonus Action casting time (which Paladins are exceptionally thrilled about, given the changes to Divine Smite).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you have multiple attacks, assuming the target fails the save and you give them the Prone condition, you make the rest of your attacks against them with Advantage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously this means we\u2019re going to want to optimize getting more attacks to take advantage of our prone target, so Barbarians, Fighters, and Paladins are the natural choice for this feat. Rangers and War Clerics could use it, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it as their class features don\u2019t particularly mesh with being an optimized Defender. Let\u2019s rate those other options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Barbarian<\/span>: While there are two subclasses that currently exist as reasonable defensive options for Barbarians, the rest don\u2019t generally make good Defenders. Even for the ones that do, they don\u2019t have access to Fighting Styles, making the Reaction part of optimized shield use inaccessible without multiclassing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter<\/span>: Access to Fighting Styles, the most attacks per round of anyone in the game except the Monk, and an extra feat so that they can take several and still be on Fundamental Math track at level 8. I\u2019ll present an abbreviated example build later in this article showing a Battle Master Fighter making good use of Shield Master.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Paladin<\/span>: Iconic shield users, the Oath of Devotion subclass art literally features a Paladin holding a huge shield they use to protect their party members. Access to Fighting Styles and an additional attack make Paladins solid users of the feat.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Shield Master Features<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shield-bash\">Shield Bash<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, we need to talk about the actual mechanics of how it makes targets Prone. As Shield Master no longer uses Athletics, you cannot increase your effectiveness with the shove in any way other than with straight Strength increases: no Expertise, no Enhance Ability, no Guidance, no Luckstone, etc. This <em>dramatically <\/em>reduces the amount you can invest into this tactic and therefore its power, but it also means there\u2019s a much lower opportunity cost ceiling to use this feat to its maximum effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, while the changes to Shove in general meant that this feat has also changed to only target Strength to match, it now allows a Strength <em>save<\/em> instead of giving them their choice of two skills in which not many enemy stat blocks had proficiency (except humanoids). Strength scores are <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/srd-monster-stats-analysis\/\">consistently the highest<\/a> at nearly every CR, and Strength saves aren\u2019t far behind Con in terms of having proficiency, especially at CR\u2019s 4-10 where you\u2019ll have 99% of the play time possible with this feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, an average CR 5 monster (representing a \u201cboss fight\u201d for a level 5 character that has this feat) will have an average Strength Save of roughly +4 vs the character\u2019s save DC of 15, allowing the target to succeed 45% of the time. Compare that to a character optimized for this in the 2014 rules: With Custom Origin, a level 5 character could have this feat and Skill Expert, meaning a +8 on their Athletics checks. This would be compared to the average target\u2019s Strength of 16 or Dex of 12 (again, basically only humanoids had skill proficiencies and not even all of them had Athletics or Acrobatics), meaning they\u2019d be rolling against you with +3 or +1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if we only look at average Strength, the target only has a 30% chance to succeed (yes, I made a chart of the 400 possible roll combinations and checked). That number actually goes down over time because Expertise means your bonus scales exponentially, eventually ending at +17 without magic items while targets are likely stuck somewhere around +8, giving less than a 20% chance of success. Compare that to this version, a level 20 optimized character will have around 20 Strength (not accounting for Epic Boons or magic items which could increase your Strength), for a save DC of 19 while average Strength saves are roughly +7, meaning a 40% chance of success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We can also compare Shield Bash to the Topple weapon mastery. It allows a Con save (which, for an average monster, is even higher than a Strength save), but it occurs every time you attack the target. At level 5, two attacks a round gives two chances for your DC 15 save vs their +4 average Con save bonus. That gives them only a 20% chance of remaining upright through two successful attacks with Topple. Once you get up to level 20, 6 attacks a round (if you do it right), with your save DC of 20 vs their save bonus of +13, they\u2019ll only have a 7% chance of remaining upright through the whole 6 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"interpose-shield\">Interpose Shield<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Evasion is always rated Blue on any class or subclass that has it. That said, Evasion doesn\u2019t use your Reaction, and any character that wants this feat is probably going to have at least two good uses for its Reaction already: some combination of a Fighting Style using the shield, Polearm Master\u2019s not-an-Opportunity-Attack, Sentinel\u2019s actual Opportunity Attack, and some personal defensive ability. With all these defensive tools taking a Reaction, I would expect that many Defenders would choose to protect their party members at their own expense, making this option less attractive in many circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Given Topple\u2019s clear numerical dominance, I think the best way to think of this incarnation of Shield Master is as a supplement to the strategy of knocking people over rather than a core component.
