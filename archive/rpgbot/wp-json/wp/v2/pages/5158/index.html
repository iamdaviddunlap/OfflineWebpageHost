Before we go further, let&#8217;s disect the text of both so that we clearly understand exactly how the spell works.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"polymorph\">The &#8220;Polymorph&#8221; Trait<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Polymorph trait is described on page 301 of the Core Rulebook. While its text amounts to two paragraphs, it&#8217;s extremely dense text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>These effects transform the target into a new form.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Descriptive text, but not actual mechanics here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>A target can\u2019t be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While not specifically relevant to Wild Shape, it does mean that other spellcasters will have trouble polymorphing your while you&#8217;re using Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is helpful for overcoming damage resistances. You can&#8217;t use weapons or cast spells, so without this creatures with damage resistance to nonmagical attacks would be a massive problem for Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don\u2019t allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You can turn into &#8220;a dog&#8221; or &#8220;a dwarf&#8221;, but you can&#8217;t turn into &#8220;Joe&#8217;s dog Fido&#8221; and you can&#8217;t turn into &#8220;Joe the dwarf&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three types of bonuses, and item bonuses are left out. This means that items which boost your AC, your attacks, etc. generally won&#8217;t apply (Wild Shape creates at least one exception: using your own attack bonus rather than the one provided by your Wild Shape form). This includes options like Handwraps of Mighty Blows (though they still apply if you use your own attack bonus if you&#8217;re using Wild Shape. Other effects don&#8217;t share the exception to this general rule.) which would otherwise seem like obviously good options, as well items like armor. Even if someone puts armor on you after you change forms, as-written you don&#8217;t benefit from your armor&#8217;s item bonus to AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there\u2019s doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few Wild Shape forms allow you to speak, and very few have hands. Even in cases where you have both, you still need to return to your humanoid form in order to cast spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Your gear is absorbed into you;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything you&#8217;re wearing or carrying is absorbed, so no one is going to run off with your bag of holding while you&#8217;re temporarily a bear. It&#8217;s unclear what happens in odd situations like if you have a mouse in your pocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can\u2019t activate any items.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that item bonuses can&#8217;t improve the statistics provided by the spell, but if you have items that provide constant abilities like damage resistance those would likely apply.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wild-shape-text\">The Wild Shape Spell<\/h3>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>You infuse yourself with primal essence and transform yourself into another form.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluff text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>You can polymorph into any form listed in pest form&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Pest Form is a useful form for scouting and for hiding in plain sight, but it&#8217;s not useful in combat.

For other forms, you only get 1 minute per casting of Wild Shape. If you&#8217;re in a fight which runs longer than 1 minute you&#8217;ll need to either re-cast Wild Shape or resort to other options like casting spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>You can add more forms to your wild shape list with druid feats; your feat might grant you some or all of the forms from a given polymorph spell.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You get Pest Form for free at 1st level and Animal Form for free at 3rd level (see below), but other options come from feats. I&#8217;ll discuss Wild Shape feats below. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>When you transform into a form granted by a spell, you gain all the effects of the form you chose from a version of the spell heightened to wild shape\u2019s level.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very important piece of text. You gain all of the effects from the spell which provides a specific form. No two spells provide overlapping forms, and each spell provides different effects like different numerical statistics, so it&#8217;s important to understand the differences. I&#8217;ll include a table highlighting some of these differences below alongside an investigation of Wild Shape Forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Wild shape allows you to use your own shapeshifting training more easily than most polymorph spells. When you choose to use your own attack modifier while polymorphed instead of the form\u2019s default attack modifier, you gain a +2 status bonus to your attack rolls.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the spells that define Wild Shape give you a specified Attack Bonus. This is a fixed attack bonus that replaces your own Unarmed Attack attack bonus unless you choose to use your own attack bonus. While these attack bonuses are often high, you may be able to exceed them with some effort. This line provides you an additional +2 bonus if you do so, making it easier and more worthwhile. Investing in Strength and in a set of Handwraps of Mighty blows will allow you to (slightly) exceed the attack bonuses provided by the spells, but you need to maximize your Strength and consider your Handwraps of Mighty Blows to be your most important magic item in order to do so. If you want to do this, great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to spend your resources elsewhere you&#8217;ll only be behind by something like +2 at level 20. Honestly, it&#8217;s not worth the hassle unless you&#8217;re multiclassing into Druid from something that goes higher than Expert in proficiency with Unarmed Attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Focus Spells heighten their spell level automatically, you often gain scaling benefits from individual Wild Shape feats which may keep a single feat releveant for several levels. For example: Animal Shape provides improved temporary hit points, statistics, and size as the spell level increases all the way to 5th level spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong>Heightened (2nd)<\/strong> You can also wild shape into the forms listed in Animal Form.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t take feats to add additional forms to Wild Shape, you still get to use forms from Animal Form. Animal Form scales at every spell level up to 5th, so you can continue to rely on these forms for a long time. However, the size of your animal form increases, and the spell is lost is you don&#8217;t have enough space to expand. Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t choose to use a lower level version of Wild Shape, so you may need new Wild Shape feats just to get access to forms which are small enough to accomodate small spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feat Form Control allows you to extend the duration of Wild Shape considerably by reducing the effective spell level, which may allow you to mitigate this size increase issue, but you&#8217;ll likely have better results by using higher-level forms instead because they&#8217;ll provide better statistics and more effective attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character\">Your Character<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wild Shape is a powerful feature, and if you plan to rely upon it heavily you should build your character accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Constitution is absolutely irreplaceable. You get a small pool of temporary hit points when you cast Wild Shape, but they won&#8217;t be enough to keep you alive. The Druid only gets 8+ hit points per level, so you need Constitution to make up the difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength is optional (at least for druids). You can very slightly exceed the attack bonus provided by Wild Shape&#8217;s various forms by maximizing Strength and investing a ton of gold in Handwraps of Mighty Fists, but you&#8217;ll only exceed the provided attack bonuses by something like +2 at level 20, so I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the effort when you could invest those precious resources elsewhere. Unless you plan to take the Form Control feats, you can dump Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classes multiclassing into Druid will benefit much more from high Strength. Because you can&#8217;t get the higher-level Wild Shape feats, your own attack bonus will exceed the highest bonuses you can get from Wild Shape forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Many spells which provide forms for Wild Shape provide a fixed bonus to Athletics or Athletics which replaces your own, provided that the spell&#8217;s bonus is higher. In most cases this bonus is very high relative to your level, and even if you invest heavily you&#8217;ll be unable to exceed the bonuses provided by the spell. However, it&#8217;s still wise to be proficient in both skills in the event that you adopt a form which doesn&#8217;t provide a bonus to one or the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Many feats still function while you&#8217;re using Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fleet<\/span>: The benefits should apply while\n\t\tusing Wild Shape, and the extra speed can make a big difference for forms\n\t\twhich have speed worse than a typical humanoid.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toughness<\/span>: Druids only get 8+ hit points,\n\t\tand while you can easily afford to invest in Constitution, you still need\n\t\tthe extra hit points if you&#8217;re going to be in melee frequently.

You might also consider Assurance in Acrobatics, but I&#8217;m not certain\n\t\tthat it&#8217;s worth the feat. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/assurance\">Practical Guide to Assurance<\/a>\n\t\tfor more information.\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Druids get to do a lot, including turning into a melee combat monster with Wild Shape. However, they get no feats or abilities to supplement their Strikes. Taking multiclass archetypes in Barbarian, Champion, Fighter, or Monk can add a number of fantastic new options to allow you to succeed in melee combat. Even simple, low-level class feats like Sudden Charge can make a big difference in how your druid fares in combat, but also look for great options like Attack of Opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other classes that take the Druid multiclass archetype for Wild Shape will likely see numerous difficulties. Animal Shape will likely provide the best forms that you&#8217;ll ever see, and since Wild Shape spells override your AC, Wild Shape will rapidly become a dangerous option beyond level 10 because your AC while using Wild Shape will be so poor relative to your normal AC. It&#8217;s also unclear if the Striking effect on Handrwaps of Mighty Blows works while in Wild Shape, so your Animal Form damage will almost certainly lag behind other options.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"druids-vestments\" class=\"rating-orange\">Druid&#8217;s Vestments<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>1,000gp is a lot for what you get. An extra focus point per day which you can use in a pinch is nice if you&#8217;re built around Wild Shape, but the time you can afford this you should have plenty of options to rely upon if you run out of Focus Points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"handwraps-of-mighty-blows\" class=\"rating-green\">Handwraps of Mighty Blows<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Handwraps of Mighty Blows are important, but not essential. The Item Bonus doesn&#8217;t add to the attack bonus provided by Wild Shape spells, but if your own attack bonus (with the extra +2) with Unarmed Attacks is higher than the bonus provided by the spell you&#8217;re replicating you can use that attack bonus instead. It&#8217;s not clear how the Striking property applies to unarmed attacks provided by Wild Shape, but I assume that it doesn&#8217;t apply at all.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wild-shape-feats\">Wild Shape Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Druids have long list of feat options which add additional forms to Wild Shape. In fact, you could spend every single one of your class feats (except the feat gained at 2nd level) on Wild Shape-related feats, and you would still need to skip two feats. That means both that there is room for you to pick options which appeal to you, and that there is room to skip over bad options. You might even choose to experiment with individual feats and retrain them if they don&#8217;t prove useful or if you get a better feat which makes a previous feat obsolete or redundant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, feats which add forms to Wild Shape will replicate the effects of a specific spell such as Humanoid Form or Aerial Form. These spells are all on the primal spell list, so even if you don&#8217;t select the feat you can still cast the spell to adopt forms specific to that spell. You only want to take feats for forms which you intend to use frequently in combat, or feats which provide some other benefit. If you took a feat which you are no longer benefiting from, you should retrain it at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Shape<\/span>: Essential.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Form Control<\/span>: In combat situations you\n\t\tcan recast Wild Shape, provided that you have enough Focus Points. However,\n\t\tthe ability to remain in a Wild Shape form for an entire hour means that you\n\t\tcould adopt a form and remain the form long enough to Refocus, and you can\n\t\tremain in your new form through several fights if you choose to do so.\n\t\tHowever, using Wild Shape in this way reduces the spell level of Wild Shape\n\t\tby 2, often reducing statistics provided by the spells which provide your\n\t\tWild Shape forms.\n\n\t\t<p>If you plan to remain in a single form through several combats, expect to\n\t\t\tinvest in Strength and in Handwraps of Mighty Blows. Because the spell&#8217;s\n\t\t\tlevel is reduced, you&#8217;ll be able to more easily exceed the attack bonus\n\t\t\tprovided the spell, and using your own higher attack bonus will make you\n\t\t\tmuch more effective despite the reduced effects of the spell.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<p>Perhaps the most important usage for this feat is when using Wild Shape\n\t\t\toutside of combat. Insect Form gives you the ability to use Pest Form for\n\t\t\t24 hours, but you&#8217;re limited to flightless pest forms which have terrible\n\t\t\tland speed and no other movement types. By comparison, you can use Form\n\t\t\tControl to turn into any form which you can normally access, allowing you\n\t\t\tto adopt forms with movement types and senses which allow you to easily\n\t\t\tscout areas or travel long distances in your adopted form.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s also totally unclear how this works if you attempt to assume a form\n\t\t\tusing Wild Shape below the spell&#8217;s minimum spell level. RAW it appears to\n\t\t\tbe allowed and it doesn&#8217;t seem to have any drawback, but I think that&#8217;s an\n\t\t\toverlooked abuse case.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Thousand Faces<\/span>: Too situational, and you&#8217;re\n\t\tnever going to use this in combat because it has no combat benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Insect Shape<\/span>: In combat, Animal Form will be\n\t\tjust as effective. Outside of combat, Form Control will do a better job\n\t\taddressing the desire to remain in a form for extended periods.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ferocious Shape<\/span>: Grants access to Dinosaur\n\t\tForm, which is statistically almost identical to Animal Form, so it&#8217;s only\nreally useful as a 7th-level spell where Animal Form has stopped advancing, and Dragon Form \ndoesn&#8217;t exceed its effectiveness yet. The\n\t\tpassive benefit from the feat (+1 to the Athletics bonus granted by your\n\t\tWild Shape forms) isn&#8217;t worth keeping the feat around once Dinosaur Form\n\t\tbecomes obsolete, so expect to take this at level 12 or 13 (if at all)\n and retrain this soon after.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soaring Shape<\/span>: Access to flight is too\n\t\tpowerful to ignore, and the combat options are close enough to Animal Form\n\t\tand Dinosaur form that you don&#8217;t give up a lot of damage output to get the\n\t\tability to fly. Even when Aerial Form itself stops being useful, the passive\n\t\tbenefit allows you to choose a type of damage resistance when you enter Wild\n\t\tShape. You also gain access to the Phoenix form when you later take\n\t\tMonstrosity Shape.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Shape<\/span>: Only useful for the\n\t\tfire resistance. Air Elemental is tempting as a travel form, but it&#8217;s not so\n\t\tmuch better than what you get from Aerial Form that it&#8217;s worth the feat, and\n\t\tall of the combat forms lag behind Dinosaur Form significantly.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Plant Shape<\/span>: Only useful for the poison\n\t\tresistance, and that&#8217;s not enough to justify spending a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dragon Shape<\/span>: Your best option at a few\n\t\tlevels, and it comes online just in time to replace Aerial Form. You also\n\t\tget to choose some damage resistance as a passive benefit of the feat, so it\n\t\tremains useful long after the forms become obsolete. You get the same amount\n\t\tof damage resistance from the same list as Soaring Shape, and I can&#8217;t\n\t\timagine that they stack so you likely get to choose 5 points of damage\n\t\tresistance to two types.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monstrosity Shape<\/span>: The best (and only)\n\t\tform options for two spell levels.

Form<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bat<\/span>: An immediate counter to invisible\n\t\tcreatures. You give up a small amount of damage in exchange compared to the\n\t\tPterosaur, and the Bat is the slowest option, but you also get a secondary\n\t\tAgile attack. If you&#8217;re not facing enemies which you can&#8217;t see, use\n\t\tsomething else. Otherwise, go straight to the Bat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bird<\/span>: The fastest option, and you get a\n\t\tsecondary Agile attack, but the Bat and the Pterosaur both deal more damage,\n\t\tso unless you specifically need the extra speed look elsewhere.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pterosaur<\/span>: The Pterosaur boasts the most\n\t\tdamage, imprecise scent, and good speed (though admittedly not as much as\n\t\tthe Bird&#8217;s). The Bat will do better against unseen foes, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\talready a Pterosaur and you get surprised, you&#8217;ll still do just fine.\n\t\tTragically, you need both Dinosaur Form <em>and<\/em> Aerial Form to get\n\t\taccess to the Pterosaur using Wild Shape.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wasp<\/span>: If you&#8217;re focusing on a single\n\t\ttarget, the Wasp will deal much less damage than other options. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tspreading attacks around to inflict ongoing damage, or if you&#8217;re having\n\t\ttrouble hitting a foe, ongoing damage can be a great option. Otherwise, look\n\t\telsewhere.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"animal-form\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/spell\/animal-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Animal Form<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ape<\/span>: A climb speed, and damage only\n\t\tslightly lower than the maximum. You also have opposable thumbs, which is\n\t\tuseful for things like opening doors and carefully manipulating objects\n\t\twhich would otherwise be difficult while you&#8217;re an animal. Unfortunately the\n\t\trules of the spell dictate that you can&#8217;t make any attacks except the\n\t\tbuilt-in fist, but your GM might let you do things like using a shield. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not planning to take advantage of the Ape&#8217;s hands, consider the Snake\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bear<\/span>: Similar to the Canine, but the bear\n\t\ttrades 10 ft. of extra speed for a secondary Agile claw attack with\n\t\tsignificantly reduced damage. I think the damage on the claw attack is too\n\t\tlow compared to the jaws attack to justify, but if you find that Agile is\n\t\thelpful this may be more effective for you than the Canine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bull<\/span>: Literally just a worse canine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Canine<\/span>: One of the fastest options, and\n\t\tmatches the highest damage available. A great, simple, go-to option with no\n\t\tfrills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cat<\/span>: The Cat strikes a balance between\n\t\tthe Bear and the Canine, keeping the Canine&#8217;s speed but sacrificing damage\n\t\tin exchange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deer<\/span>: The fastest option, but you give up a\n\t\tlittle bit of damage in exchange. The Deer is only 10 ft. faster than the\n\t\tCanine and the Cat, and considering 40 ft. is already significantly faster\n\t\tthan a typical humanoid I think they&#8217;re fast enough.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Frog<\/span>: The frog&#8217;s big appeal is the\n\t\t15-foot reach on its tongue. Most player characters can&#8217;t manage 15-foot\n\t\treach, and combined with your gradually increasing size, this allows you to\n\t\tcover an impressively large portion of the battlefield. Tragically, the\n\t\tDruid doesn&#8217;t have any built-in options to make Reactions when enemies move,\n\t\tso consider a multiclass archetype to pick up Attack of Opportunity or\n\t\tsomething similar. The frog also trades a bit of damage for this capability,\n\t\tso if you&#8217;re not benefiting from the extra reach look for other options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shark<\/span>: Your only option underwater.\n\t\tMatches the highest damage available, lets you breath underwater, and a\n\t\tdecent swim speed. You may only get one option, but it&#8217;s a pretty good\n\t\tone.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snake<\/span>: The only option with three\n\t\tmovement types, the Snake works in a variety of situations. The Snake&#8217;s\n\t\tfangs deal an average of 8.5 damage, falling between creatures that deal 2d6\n\t\ta(vg. 7) and those that deal 2d8 (avg. 9). Because part of its damage is\n\t\tpoison, you&#8217;ll have trouble with creatures that resist or ignore poison\n\t\tdamage, but you may be able to more effectively handle creatures that resist\n\t\tphysical damage types. In general, the Snake is versatile and capable, but\n\t\tit seems like in any specific situation there is a different form that will\n\t\tdo better. If you don&#8217;t need to use all three movement types, the Ape is\n\t\tfine while climbing, the Shark is better in the water, and the Canine is\n\t\tbetter on land.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dinosaur-form\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/spell\/dinosaur-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dinosaur Form<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ankylosaurus<\/span>: Almost identical to a\n\t\tBrontosaurus, but the Ankylosaurus gives up 5 ft. of reach for\n\t\tBackswing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Brontosaurus<\/span>: <\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deinonychus<\/span>: The fastest Dinosaur Form\n\t\toption, and it deals persistent bleed dsmage, but at 1 point of persistent\n\t\tdamage it&#8217;s hardly worth consideration. I&#8217;m not sure if the persistent bleed\n\t\tdamage increases with spell level since &#8220;1&#8221; isn&#8217;t a die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Stegosaurus<\/span>: <\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Triceratops<\/span>: The most damage of any\n\t\tDinosaur Form option by a large margin,\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Tyrannosaurus<\/span>: <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dragon-form\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/spell\/dragon-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragon Form<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Paizo went to great lengths to try to make different dragon forms distinct,\n\twhich resulted in forms using a dizzying variety of damage dice combinations.\n\tWhile this sounds neat, I find it incredibly frustrating because it makes it\n\tdifficult to compare options on the fly. Every form has a bite attack, an\n\tAgile claw attack, a tail attack with improved reach, and a breath weapon. In\n\taddition, dragon forms vary in land speed and frequently have a special\n\tability like a movement type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Black<\/span>: Average bite damage 13 + 7 acid, average claw\n\t\tdamage 16.5, average tail damage 16.5. Breath weapon 60-ft. line, average\n\t\tdamage 38.5 acid. The highest swim speed of any dragon form by a large\n\t\tmargin and an extra Horns attack which matches the tail&#8217;s reach but deals\n\t\tless damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Blue<\/span>: Average bite damage 11 + 6.5 electricity,\n\t\taverage claw damage 16.5, average trail damage 16.5.

Breath weapon 30-ft. cone,\n\t\taverage damage 35 poison. Adds a swim speed and the ability to avoid\n\t\tdifficult terrain from non-magical foliage, as well as an extra Horns attack\n\t\twhich matches the tail&#8217;s reach but deals less damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Red<\/span>: Average bite damage 13 + 7 fire, average claw\n\t\tdamage 14, average tail damage 16.5. Breath weapon 30-foot cone, average\n\t\tdamage 35 fire. Adds the ability to ignore the Concealed condition from\n\t\tsmoke and an extra Wing attack which matches the tail&#8217;s reach but deals less\n\t\tdamage, which is especially frustrating because it deals the same damage\n\t\ttype so it appears to have absolutely no useful function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">White<\/span>: Average bite damage 10.5 + 7 cold, average\n\t\tclaw damage 16.5, average tail damage 16.5. Breath weapon 30-foot cone,\n\t\taverage damage 35 cold. Adds a climb speed, but it only applies on ice and\n\t\tyou can already fly, so I&#8217;m not sure why you would want that.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Brass<\/span>: Average bite damage 13.5 + 5 fire, average\n\t\tclaw damage 16.5, average tail damage 16.5. Breath weapon 60-foot line,\n\t\taverage damage 37.5 fire. Adds a burrow speed and an extra Spikes attack\n\t\twhich matches the tail&#8217;s reach but deals less damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Bronze<\/span>: Average bite damage 11 + 6.5 electricity,\n\t\taverage claw damage 16.5, average tail damage 16.5. Breath weapon 80-foot\n\t\tline, average damage 39 electricity. Adds a swim speed and an extra Wing\n\t\tattack which matches the tail&#8217;s reach but deals less damage. Also the wing\n\t\tattack deals slashing damage for some reason.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Copper<\/span>: Average bite damage 13 + 7 acid, average claw\n\t\tdamage 16.5, average tail damage 16.5.

Even if you just\n\t\twant this as a travel option, Form of the Dragon is only one spell level\n\t\thigher and gives you a 100 ft. fly speed, so this form quickly becomes\n\t\tobsolete.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Earth<\/span>: The simplest Elemental Form\n\t\toption. It has the highest attack damage and a burrow speed, but it&#8217;s also\n\t\tvery slow compared to other elementals.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire<\/span>: Faster than the earth elemental,\n\t\tand you trade some immediate damage for ongoing fire damage. If you plan to\n\t\tperform a single Strike each turn, if you&#8217;re fighting an enemy that you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t hit reliably, or if you&#8217;re facing multiple enemies, the ongoing fire\n\t\tdamage can be a big help. However, it won&#8217;t stack with itself so if you&#8217;re\n\t\trepeatedly attacking the same creature and you&#8217;re not having trouble hitting\n\t\tit, the Earth Elemental may do more damage more quickly. Don&#8217;t forget: When\n\t\tthe spell heighters to 7th level, your ongoing damage dice also double with\n\t\tthe base damage dice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Water<\/span>: I would only use this in the\n\t\twater. On land, if you need to Shove you can still spend an Action to make\n\t\tan Athletics check to Shove, and the spell provides a decent bonus to do so.\n\t\tWeirdly, you don&#8217;t get to breath underwater, so you can turn into a water\n\t\telemental and drown somehow. Talk to your GM and hope for errata.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"insect-form\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/spell\/insect-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Insect Form<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ant<\/span>: Faster than the beetle and you get a\n\t\tclimb speed, but you give up a huge amount of damage for the extra movement.\n\t\tThe best comparison is to the Centipede, which is very slightly slower but\n\t\tdeals ongoing poison damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Beetle<\/span>: The most damage, but no special\n\t\tabilities or movement speeds or anything.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Centipede<\/span>: Slightly slower than the Ant,\n\t\tbut the Centipede&#8217;s persistent poison damage will likely deal more damage in\n\t\ttotal than the Ant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantis<\/span>: Comparable to the Beetle, but you\n\t\tgive up a little bit of damage for dramatically improved speed and imprecise\n\t\tscent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scorpion<\/span>: Excellent speed, Darkvision, and\n\t\timprecise Tremorsense with an impressive range. The Scorpion&#8217;s stinger\n\t\tmatches the Centipede&#8217;s damahe, and you get a secondary Agile attack, though\n\t\tthe damage is so much worse than the Stinger damage that I don&#8217;t think Agile\n\t\tmakes up the difference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spider<\/span>: Almost identical to the\n\t\tCentipede, but very slightly reduced damage in exchange for Darkvision and\n\t\tthe ability to shoot a web.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monstrosity-form\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/spell\/monstrosity-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monstrosity Form<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Phoenix<\/span>:90 ft. fly speed, 15-foot reach,\n\t\tand good ongoing fire damage, plus an ongoing fire aura which doesn&#8217;t allow\n\t\ta save or anything, so you can turn it on and fly around while you gradually\n\t\twear your enemies down.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Purple Worm<\/span>: A lot of damage and good\n\t\tongoing poison damage, plus you automatically recover from some problematic\n\t\tstatus conditions.

But at that point, just revert to your\n\t\thumanoid form and cast spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Kaiju<\/span>: Resistance to physical damage, a\n\t\tterrifying 30 ft. reach, tons of damage, and multiple attack options.\n\t\tAgainst single targets, jaws will do most of the work, but against multiple\n\t\tfoes don&#8217;t hesitate to use Trample. You don&#8217;t need to worry about Multiple\n\t\tAttack Penalties with Trample like you do with strikes, and you get to move\n\t\ttwice your speed with a base speed of 50 ft. so you can cover 100 ft.\n\t\twithout any further enhancements to your speed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"plant-form\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/spell\/plant-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plant Form<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arboreal<\/span>: The most speed and the most\n\t\tdamage of any Plant Form option, and you can speak in this form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flytrap<\/span>: The slowest Plant Form option,\n\t\tand the least reach. You do get a bit of acid resistance, but that&#8217;s not the\n\t\tbig draw here. The Flytrap&#8217;s big selling point is the ability to Grab a\n\t\ttarget as an action after a successful hit. This is a helpful crowd control\n\t\toption, but with low speed and reach, you&#8217;ll likely need to cast Wild Shape\n\t\twhile you&#8217;re already in extremely close range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shambler<\/span>: A swim speed and a bit of\n\t\telectricity resistance, but if you don&#8217;t need either of those the Arboreal\n\t\tis a better choice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-form\">Best Wild Shape Forms by Level<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Even after reading (or writing) the above information, it&#8217;s difficult to\n\tparse exactly which forms are most effective at any given spell level. Let&#8217;s\n\tlook at those options and what makes them so effective.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-1\">Spell Level 1<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At this spell level Pest Form is the only option available to you. The forms\n\tare all identical, so there&#8217;s not much to consider here. Pick something common\n\tin local area so that local creatures won&#8217;t notice you.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-2\">Spell Level 2<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>2nd-level spells brings Animal Form for free, which by default makes it your\n\tbest combat option. The Canine, the Frog, and the Shark are great go-to\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-3\">Spell Level 3<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>3rd-level spells introduces access to Insect Form. Insect form offers some\n\tinteresting capabilities than Animal Form doesn&#8217;t offer, including Tremorsense\n\tand persistent poison damage. However, beyond those capabilities Animal Form&#8217;s\n\toptions are roughly equivalent. If you choose to take Insect Form, add\n\tScorpion to your lift of go-to options.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-4\">Spell Level 4<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Aerial Form and Dinosaur Form both become available at the same time, and as\n\tmuch fun as it is to turn into a dinosaur, the upcast Animal Form options have\n\tstartlingly similar stats to the forms offer by Dinosaur Form. Both options\n\tgive you the same size, senses, AC, attack and damage bonuses, and the same\n\tAthletics bonus. The damage dice are similar, and while Animal Form options\n\tall have 10-foot reach, Dinosaur Form options may have higher or lower reach\n\tand adjust their damage up and down slightly to compensate. Perhaps the\n\teasiest comparison is between the Canine and the Stegosaurus: the only\n\tdifference is that the Canine has 10 ft. better speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Dinosaur Form, Aerial Form offers something new at this level: flight.\n\tFlight is an absolutely crucial tactical option that you absolutely need to\n\thave. Your best Aerial Form option is the Pterosaur, but tragically you need\n\tboth Aerial Form <em>and<\/em> Dinosaur Form to get access to the Pterosaur,\n\tand there&#8217;s no way to do that at this level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, use the Bat. It&#8217;s basically a flying Canine with echolocation,\n\tthough at this level Aerial Form only makes you Medium and you only have 5 ft.\n\treach. The flat damage bonus is only +5 (4 points lower than 4th-level Animal\n\tForm&#8217;s +9), so you&#8217;re giving up size, reach, and some damage in exchange for\n\tAerial Form&#8217;s flight. Stick to Canine if you know a fight will remain on the\n\tground, but don&#8217;t hesitate to turn into a bat if you can gain anything at all\n\tfrom flying.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-5\">Spell Level 5<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>5th-level spells is the highest level for Animal Form and Insect Form, and\n\tthe first level for Elemental Form and Plant Form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animal Form and Dinosaur Form still compete for space, and the numbers are nearly identical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elemental Form is disappointing. It looks really fun, but it doesn&#8217;t offer anything new at this level. Animal Form or Dinosaur Form will be much more powerful in combat, and while Aerial Form can&#8217;t compete with the Air Elemental&#8217;s speed, I doubt that you&#8217;re going to spend a class feat to get a slightly faster form for overland travel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plant Form is a weird option. You get resistance to poison damage, and the\n\tnumbers are slightly offer from other Wild Shape spells at the same level.\n\tPlant Form grants higher AC (only by 1, so not a huge difference) and a higher\n\tflat damage bonus, but most everything else is slightly worse than other\n\tspells. Plant Form&#8217;s attacks only deal two damage dice, and despite the\n\trelatively high fkat damage bonus Dinosaur Form will still deal more damage\n\t(2d8+11, avg. 20 from Plant Form; 4d8+6, avg. 24 from Dinosaur Form). Unless\n\tyou&#8217;re facing a lot of enemies which deal poison damage, I can&#8217;t think of a\n\tgood reason to use this when Dinosaur Form can do most of the same things with\n\thigher damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the introduction of Elemental Form, Aerial Form remains the leader in\n\tflying options, but it doesn&#8217;t double its damage dice until 6th level,\n\tso you <em>really<\/em> want to keep fights on the ground if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-6\">Spell Level 6<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Much like 5th spell level, your spell options change dramatically at this\n\tlevel. Animal Form and Insect Form are gone, and this is the last level for\n\tAerial Form and Plant Form. Dinosaur form is still on the table, but it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t get anything at 6th level, and we finally add Dragon Form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aerial Form doubles its damage dice at this level, bringing its damage closer\n\tto Dinosaur Form. Aerial Form&#8217;s flat damage bonus is still lower than Dinosaur\n\tForm so your total damage will still be lower, but Aerial Form is no longer\n\tdramatically weaker than Dinosaur Form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dragon Form is powerful and exciting, immediately catapulting to the top of\n\tyour options. The fly speed is more than double the highest you can get from\n\tAerial Form, even exceeidng the speed of the Air Elemental. The bite damage\n\tmatches the damage of the best Dinosaur Form options, and you get additional\n\tattack options like claws, tails, etc.. Finally, you get a breath weapon which\n\tallows you to easily handle groups of foes. This is, without question,\n\tsimultaneously the most versatile, useful, and powerful form available to you\n\tat this level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elemental Form and Plant Form continue to be awful.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-7\">Spell Level 7<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We finally lose Aerial Form, but it&#8217;s no big loss since we have Dragon Form. Dinosaur form sees its final improvement, and since Dragon Form doesn&#8217;t improve Dinosaur form takes a significant lead in size, reach, and damage output compared to Dragon form. However, Dinosaur Form doesn&#8217;t let you fly so Dragon Form is still your best option in the air or if you need AOE damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t get any new spell options at this level, but you can be either a\n\tdinosaur or a dragon and I don&#8217;t know why you would want to be anything else\n\tgiven that you have two of the coolest options I can think of.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-8\">Spell Level 8<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At this level we lose every previous option except Dragon Form, and Dragon\n\tForm gets its final (and only) improvement, increasing your size and reach and\n\tproviding some modest numerical increases that bring it back on par with\n\tDinosaur Form&#8217;s attack damage, though Dinosaur Form still gives you better\n\tsize and reach. Dinosaur Form also gives you similar temporary HP and AC, so\n\tit&#8217;s still usable despite a relatively low attack bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This level introduces Monstrosity form, and while the options are limited\n\tthey&#8217;re all pretty good. Phoenix directly competes with Dragon Form, and while\n\tyour movement speed is slightly lower the Phoenix&#8217;s damage will be slightly\n\thigher than the Dragon&#8217;s, and Aura of Flame can replace breath weapons.\n\tHowever, you lose the ability to change energy damage types by changing types\n\tof dragons, so Dragon Form is still useful when fire damage isn&#8217;t. You need to\n\thave Aerial Form to get access to the Phoenix, but it was good for a long time\n\tso hopefully you haven&#8217;t retrained it. If you did, Dragon Form will\n\tsuffice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the ground and in the water, the Purple Worm and the Sea Serpent easily\n\toutdo existing Form of the Dragon options. Purple Worm also has the highest\n\tburrow speed of any Wild Shape option, allowing you to easily travel\n\tunderground.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-9\">Spell Level 9<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Monstrosity form is the only option at this level. You add one die of damage\n\tand some other numeric increases, but nothing funamentally changes from level\n\t8.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-forms-10\">Spell Level 10<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Nature Incarnate is the only option at this level, so naturally it&#8217;s the best\n\toption. The Kaiju is the only guaranteed option, but it&#8217;s the biggest, baddest\n\tmelee monster you could ever hope to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have Plant Form you can also turn into a Green Man. It&#8217;s medium sized\n\twith a good ranged attack, so it&#8217;s a fine option for just walking around among\n\tnormal humanoids, but you can&#8217;t speak or cast spells so you&#8217;ll probably do\n\tbetter if you revert to your humanoid form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, Nature Incarnate doesn&#8217;t offer any flying forms, so the Phoenix\n\tremains your best flying option.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Wild Shape is complicated.
