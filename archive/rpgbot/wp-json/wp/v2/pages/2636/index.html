Until level 5 when cantrip damage increases and martial characters typically get Extra Attack, you can be effective with either regarless of your Divine Domain. At 5th level and beyond, your domain will determine which options are effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Levels 5 through 7 are notably painful for clerics that prefer to use weapons, but after that point Divine Strike makes weapon damage roughly comparable to unmodified cantrips for clerics expected to use weapons in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, being roughly comparable to un modified cantrips is hardly an incentive to use weapons. Other clerics get Potent Spellcasting, which puts them 5 damage ahead of unmodified cantrips, and therefore 5 damage head of whatever a cleric with Divine Strike could do with a weapon. There is a brief period from levels 14 through 16 where Divine Strike puts weapons attacks ahead unmodified cantrips, but it&#8217;s by 3 or 4 damage with a one-handed weapon which is <em>still<\/em> a smaller gap than what Potent Spellcasting provides.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The table below was originally a product of my article on <a href=\"\/dnd5\/players\/writing-homebrew-character-options\/\">Writing Homebrew Character Options<\/a>, but the data is very helpful for choosing a cleric subclass so I&#8217;ve included it here for reference. Note that the numerical bonus assumes that you&#8217;re enhancing Strength as quickly as possible (or using Shillelagh or something), which is generally a terrible idea and puts Divine Strike even further behind Potent Spellcasting in terms of effectiveness because you&#8217;re now sacrificing your class&#8217;s primary function (spellcasting) to prop up what is essentially filler to be used in between leveled spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Mace<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Longsword<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Greatsword<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Sacred Flame<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Toll the Dead<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Word of Radiance<\/th><\/tr><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Dam.<\/th><th>Avg.<\/th><th>Dam.<\/th><th>Avg.<\/th><th>Dam.<\/th><th>Avg.<\/th><th>Dam.<\/th><th>Avg.<\/th><th>Dam.<\/th><th>Avg.<\/th><th>Dam.<\/th><th>Avg.<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>1d6+3<\/td><td>6.5<\/td><td>1d8+3<\/td><td>7.5<\/td><td>2d6+3<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>4.5<\/td><td>1d12<\/td><td>6.5<\/td><td>1d6 each<\/td><td>3.5 each<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>1d6+4<\/td><td>7.5<\/td><td>1d8+4<\/td><td>8.5<\/td><td>2d6+4<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>4.5<\/td><td>1d12<\/td><td>6.5<\/td><td>1d6 each<\/td><td>3.5 each<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>1d6+4<\/td><td>7.5<\/td><td>1d8+4<\/td><td>8.5<\/td><td>2d6+4<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>2d12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>2d6 each<\/td><td>7 each<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>1d6+5+1d8<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>1d8+5+1d8<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2d6+5+1d8<\/td><td>16.5<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>2d12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>2d6 each<\/td><td>7 each<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>1d6+5+1d8<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>1d8+5+1d8<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2d6+5+1d8<\/td><td>16.5<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>13.5<\/td><td>3d12<\/td><td>19.5<\/td><td>3d6 each<\/td><td>10.5 each<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>1d6+5+2d8<\/td><td>17.5<\/td><td>1d8+5+2d8<\/td><td>18.5<\/td><td>2d6+5+2d8<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>13.5<\/td><td>3d12<\/td><td>19.5<\/td><td>3d6 each<\/td><td>10.5 each<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>1d6+5+2d8<\/td><td>17.5<\/td><td>1d8+5+2d8<\/td><td>18.5<\/td><td>2d6+5+2d8<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>4d12<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>4d6 each<\/td><td>14 each<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"blessed-strikes\">Blessed Strikes<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If your group uses <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2801\">Optional Class Features<\/a>, strongly consider using the Blessed Strikes class feature to replace Divine Strike. Yes, the damage bonus is lower than Divine Strike, but it has several qualities which make it worthwhile:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and most obvious, the bonus works on cantrips. 1d8 will average to 4.5 which isn&#8217;t quite as good as Potent Spellcasting, but it&#8217;s close. This allows you to totally abandon the idea of using weapons if you choose to do so while still playing a subclass expected to use weapons. The bonus only applies to a single target, so Potent Spellcasting still wins with multi-target spells like Word of Radiance, but Sacred Flame with an extra d8 damage is still better than you could possibly do with a non-magic weapon. You&#8217;re basically giving up on using a weapon and getting 1d8 damage on top of what you were already going to deal to single targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Blessed Strikes applies on Opportunity Attacks. That&#8217;s a funamental and honestly baffling lack of functionality in Divine Strike. You could choose to wield a weapon in case you want to make opportunity attacks, but if don&#8217;t have a weapon in hand, Blessed Strikes still applies if you make an unarmed strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Blessed Strikes deals Radiant Damage. It&#8217;s very rarely resisted, and it&#8217;s much more reliable than many Divine Strike damage types like fire and poison.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one case where I <em>might<\/em> recommend sticking to Divine Strike is if you have easy access to magic weapons. You might find that the damage boost from such weapons is enough to make using a weapon appealing. However, given the choice between a magic spellcasting focus and a magic weapon, you should always go for the spellcasting focus. Remember that the Cleric is a spellcaster first, and weapons are an entirely secondary function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Cleric Subclasses &#8211; Divine Domains<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcana-domain\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/cleric#ArcanaDomain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arcana Domain<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Arcana Domain Cleric borrows some options from the Wizard, giving the Cleric a lot of really great utilities and support options, as well as some excellent offensive options.

Utility\n\t\t\tcantrips have a lot to offer, especially options like Prestidigitation and\n\t\t\tShape Water. If you do go for offensive options, go for ones that expand\n\t\t\tyour damage type options like Mind Sliver or options which improve your\n\t\t\tmelee weapon attacks like Booming Blade if you plan to fight in melee.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration<\/span>:\n\t\t\tSituational, but extraplanar creatures (Celestials, Elementals, Fey, and\n\t\t\tFiends) are very common enemies which make up a huge chunk of the monster\n\t\t\tmanual. This only affects one target, so you generally want to use it on\n\t\t\tthe biggest thing in the room, even if you can&#8217;t banish it.\n\t\t\t<p>The banishment effect is terrible considering how easy it should be to\n\t\t\t\tkill the creatures which it affects. It&#8217;s intended to mirror the ability\n\t\t\t\tto destroy low-level undead, but since Arcane Abjuration is\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target rather than an AOE, it&#8217;s barely worth considering.<\/p><\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Breaker<\/span>: If you have Healing\n\t\t\tWord prepared (and you should), you can raise its level to whatever you\n\t\t\tneed to remove whatever debuff you like as a Bonus Action.

Unfortunately,\n\t\t\tthis only applies to spells and enemy spellcasters make up a small portion\n\t\t\tof the creatures you&#8217;ll face in a typical campaign, so this is only\n\t\t\tsituationally useful.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: This is already\n\t\t\tgreat for most Clerics, but it&#8217;s especially good for the Arcana Domain\n\t\t\tCleric because your two Wizard cantrips are treated as Cleric Cantrips, so\n\t\t\tthey get the bonus damage too! If your cantrips affect multiple targets\n\t\t\t(already possible for the Cleric thank to Word of Radiance), this bonus\n\t\t\tdamage applies to all of them.\n<p>Acid Splash gets the bonus against both\n\t\t\ttargets, and if you use Green-Flame Blade, Jeremy Crawford has confirmed\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/756203803339173888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Twitter<\/a>\n\t\t\tthat the bonus applies to the secondary target initially and to both\n\t\t\ttargets once you hit level 5 and Green-Flame Blade adds fire damage to\n\t\t\tyour weapon attack. I haven&#8217;t found a specific answer, but I assume that\n\t\t\tthe same applies to Booming Blade, so the damage bonus applies both on the\n\t\t\tinitial hit and on the secondary damage if the target moves.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Mastery<\/span>: This is absurdly\n\t\t\tversatile.

You probably don&#8217;t want to use reach\n\t\tweapons, either, since you don&#8217;t have heavy armor to keep your AC high when\n\t\tyou forgo a shield, though the Whip may be a worthwhile exception.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Reaper<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t many Necromancy\n\t\tcantrips, and many of them are already on the Cleric&#8217;s spell list, like Toll\n\t\tthe Dead. Chill Touch is also a good choice: it has better range than\n\t\toffensive cleric cantrips (Sacred Flame and Toll the Dead have a range of\n\t\tjust 60 ft.) and the damage is good. You&#8217;ll want to use Toll the Dead if you\n\t\tcan get within range, but having expanded range makes it more likely that\n\t\tyou can reach two enemies within 5 feet of each other.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The biggest problem with Reaper is that it&#8217;s difficult to control when\n\t\t\tenemies will be adjacent to each other. You can use the Telekinetic Feat\n\t\t\tto help, but it&#8217;s not a perfect solution. This will be much more impactful\n\t\t\tif you have allies with forced movement options or who like to grapple.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While the obvious use is offensive, Reaper also works with Spare the\n\t\t\tDying.

If your group uses the Optional\n\t\tClass Features, you&#8217;ll almost certainly get better results from using\n\t\tHarness Divine Power to get another spell slot. It does work on any melee\n\t\tattack, though, so you can use it with Inflict Wounds, Vampiric Touch, and\n\t\tSpiritual Weapon.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Inescapable Destruction<\/span>: Considering that\n\t\tyou probably took Chill Touch and\/or Toll the Dead, and that some of the\n\t\tcleric&#8217;s go-to single-target damage spells will deal Necrotic damage,\n\t\tresistance to Necrotic damage can be a problem. Immunity is still an issue,\n\t\tbut complete immunity to necrotic damage is rare, and generally limited to\n\t\tvery high-level creatures (Liches, etc.). Still, the Cleric&#8217;s biggest\n\t\tsources of damage typically deal radiant damage, so on the rare occasions\n\t\tthat you do encounter resistance or immunity to necrotic damage it&#8217;s easy to\n\t\tswitch to radiant.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Strike<\/span>: Necrotic damage is among\n\t\tthe most reliable damage types, so, as far as Divine Strike goes it&#8217;s hard\n\t\tto find a better option.

Searing Smite is \n normally a paladin-exclusive spell, and your spell save\n\t\t\t\t\tDCs will be higher than most paladins&#8217;.

The\n\t\t\tdifference in the amount healed between Cure Wounds and Healing Word can\n\t\t\tbe significant, especially if you up-cast the spells. This on its own is\n\t\t\tgreat, but it only marginally improves the tactical benefit of in-combat\n\t\t\thealing. The ability to use Spare the Dying at range as a Bonus Action is\n\t\t\tintended to fill in for Healing Word so that Cure Wounds is more\n\t\t\tappealing, but personally I still think that Healing Word is a better\n\t\t\ttactical option in most cases.\n<p>You can notably choose to cast Spare the\n\t\t\tDying as either an Action or a Bonus Action, which is neat if you want to\n\t\t\tdo something like cast Sacred Flame (an Action) in the same turn. Just\nremember that if you cast any spell as a Bonus Action, including a cantrip, you can&#8217;t cast leveled\nspells that turn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Circle of Mortality can be abused by taking allies who are at very few\n\t\t\t\thit points and beating them unconscious to get extra free healing, which\n\t\t\t\tcan be cathartic, but your allies may be nervous about allowing you to\n\t\t\t\tdo so and your DM might get ideas about imposing a drawback of some\n\t\t\t\tkind.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Eyes of the Grave<\/span>: Detect Evil is on the\n\t\t\tCleric spell list, and does the same thing, but detects more creatures.\n\t\t\tSure, the area is smaller, but that doesn&#8217;t seem like enough to make this\n\t\t\tmeaningful.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave<\/span>: Use\n\t\t\tthis with a rogue or with a spellcaster with a high-damage spell that\n\t\t\trequires an attack like Inflict Wounds.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sentinel at Death&#8217;s Door<\/span>: Critical hits\n\t\t\ton your allies can turn a tough fight into a crushing defeat in a single\n\t\t\troll.

The\n\t\t\timproved AC will also help to reduce the need to heal yourself instead of\n\t\t\thealing or supporting your allies, especially when supplemented by spells\n\t\t\tlike Shield of Faith and Sanctuary.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Disciple of Life<\/span>: This isn&#8217;t a ton of\n\t\t\thealing all at once, but it will be especially useful with Healing Word,\n\t\t\twhich is a good combination because it uses a Bonus Action, but normally\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t heal for a particularly large amount. Over the course of your\n\t\t\tcareer, the total amount of additional healing will be significant, so I\n\t\t\tencourage you to keep a running score if for no other reason than to\n\t\t\tremind your party members how badly they need you to survive.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Preserve Life<\/span>:\n\t\t\tFantastic when you&#8217;re looking at a possible TPK. Since you&#8217;re healing so\n\t\t\tmuch, most characters of your level will go from 0 to half hit points,\n\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re looking at someone like a Barbarian with d12 hit dice and 20\n\t\t\tConstitution or if you&#8217;re splitting the points between multiple allies.\n\t\t\tEven so, the scaling is excellent as you gain additional uses of Channel\n\t\t\tDivinity this will quickly become your go-to option for large amounts of\n\t\t\thit point recovery while in combat.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessed Healer<\/span>: Coupled with your\n\t\t\texcellent AC, there is now almost never a reason to cast a healing spell\n\t\t\ton yourself instead of helping your allies. However, casting a healing\n\t\t\tspell to restore hit points should not happen frequently during combat, so\n\t\t\tthis may not trigger as frequently as you would like.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Strike<\/span>: Radiant damage is among\n\t\t\tthe most reliable damage types available.

However, since in-combat healing\n\t\t\tis generally not a good idea, there are few situations where this will be\n\t\t\tsignificantly impactful. In a fight, if you need healing you should cast\n\t\t\tHeal or Mass Heal, neither of which involve dice.\n\t\t\t<p>Knowing how best to apply this requires a little bit of math. For\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target healing, anything of 6th level or above should still be\n\t\t\t\tHeal or a 9th-level spell like Mass Heal. The Cure Wounds spell cast at 6th level heals\n\t\t\t\tjust 48+Wis hit points compared to Heal&#8217;s 70 (without considering\n\t\t\t\tDisciple of Life which applies the same bonus to either). For\n\t\t\t\tmulti-target healing, Prayer of Healing is your best option, but with a\n\t\t\t\t10-minute casting time you&#8217;re more likely to use Mass Healing Word.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"light-domain\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/cleric#LightDomain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Light Domain<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Light Cleric is a Controller and a Striker, specializing in dealing damage both to single targets and to areas.

In terms of instantaneous area damage, there\n\t\t\t\tisn&#8217;t another spell that can compete with Fireball until 9th-level\n\t\t\t\tspells introduce stuff like Meteor Swarm.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">7th-Level<\/span>: Wall\n\t\t\t\tof Fire is among the best area control spells in the game.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">9th-Level<\/span>: Flame\n\t\t\t\tStrike is considerably less important since you get Fireball,\n\t\t\t\tand Scrying is only situationally useful so it&#8217;s frustrating\n\t\t\t\tto have it prepared every day.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Cantrip<\/span>: Not spectacular, but\n\t\ta Light Cleric really should have Light, and someone\n\t\tshould be able to cast it in most parties (unless every has Darkvision).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Warding Flare<\/span>: You won&#8217;t get a ton of\n\t\tuses, so save this for enemies which can do a lot of damage on a single\n\t\tattack.

So your DM could roll, ask &#8220;Does a 25 hit?&#8221; knowing\n\t\tfull well that it does, and you could scream &#8220;Warding Flare!&#8221; before the DM\n\t\tsays &#8220;you are hit&#8221; and the DM would then roll with Disadvantage (meaning\n\t\tthat they roll a second die and choose the lower of the two results, not\n\t\tthat they need to dump whatever they&#8217;ve already rolled).\n<p>Of course,\n\t\tyour DM might read that differently and take my portrayal of that interaction\n\t\tpoorly, so check with your DM before you assume how this works.\n\t\tTragically, Jeremy Crawford&#8217;s only response on the subject\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/839263164936003584\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tactually clarify the answer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn<\/span>:\n\t\tThe damage isn&#8217;t great beyond low levels.

Trickery gets to\n\t\t\tpretend to be in five places at once and cast spells from any of them.\n\t\t\tOrder gets to <em>maybe<\/em> deal 2d8 damage, provided that you hit with\n\t\t\tyour one attack per turn and have an ally handy to hit the same creature.\n\t\t\t<p>Your ideal use case for this is to hit an enemy with your weapon and\n\t\t\t\tdeal Divine Strike damage, then cast a leveled spell as a bonus action\n\t\t\t\tto trigger Voice of Authority and have your ally hit the same target to\n\t\t\t\ttrigger the bonus damage.<\/p>\n<p>That means you&#8217;re dealing 4d8 psychic damage\n\t\t\t\t(2d8 from Divine Strike, 2d8 from Order&#8217;s Wrath) plus whatever your\n\t\t\t\tweapon does plus whatever your ally&#8217;s attack does. That&#8217;s pretty good,\n\t\t\t\tbut by this level you&#8217;re dealing 4d8 damage with Sacred Flame (more with\n\t\t\t\tother options like Word of Radiance or Toll the Dead), and your\n\t\t\t\tspellcasting DC will be probably be more reliable than your attack\n\t\t\t\tbonus, so casting a cantrip is a much more consistent source of damage\n\t\t\t\toutput.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"peace-domain\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/cleric#PeaceDomain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Peace Domain<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Ban this domain. I do not say that lightly. Ban this domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Peace Domain domain is full of extremely obvious abuse cases and problems which break the math of the game and can turn an otherwise totally normal party into an unstoppable force of both incredible tactical efficiency and absolutely ridiculous shenanigans. Right from first level, Peace Domain can provide +2d4 on attack rolls and saving throws to two members of the party, mathematically trivializing combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the cleric gains levels, that two-person limit scales to gradually include the whole party, and they gain the ability to teleport and redirect damage from any source, eventually adding resistance to that damage, thereby effectively giving the whole party perpetual resistance to damage (so long as their Reaction has not been used), and making them immune to grapples and many other crowd control effects by allowing them to teleport to each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go into the implications of these problems at greater length in <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/ban-5es-peace-domain\/\">this Patreon post<\/a>. The issues are extensive and might not be obvious, and it takes me three pages of text to explain them all. People told me I was out of my mind when I first advocated banning peace domain, and now I see my arguments repeated all over the place online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to allow this domain in your game, I recommend these changes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Rule Change: Only one die can be added to any given d20 roll. No more stacking Bless, Guidance, Bardic Inspiration, and whatever else. (I recommend this as a house rule anyway; this issue long predates Peace Domain.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Emboldening Bond<\/strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If a creature willingly attacks another creature in the bond, the bond is immediately broken for all creatures. That creature cannot be part of another Emboldening Bond until the cleric completes a long rest. This prevents the abuse cases I describe below where the party can teleport for free by punching each other or throwing rocks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The number of uses and targets increases by the same amount and at the same levels as your Proficiency Bonus increases (5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level), but is not actually tied to your Proficiency Bonus. This is solely to prevent multiclass abuse.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Protective Bond<\/strong>: Consider one of these options:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The user immediately loses the benefits of the Emboldening Bond for the remainder of the effect, allowing them to sacrifice their own benefits in order to save an ally from a potentially lethal source of damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Split the damage between the original recipient and whoever spends their Reaction to activate Protective Bond using the same rules as the Warding Bond spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Potent Spellcasting<\/strong>: Considering the theme, I honestly don&#8217;t know why this is here. Leave it here as a peculiarity, or replace it with something novel like allowing Guidance to be cast at 30-foot range.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Expansive Bond<\/strong>: Remove the resistance mechanic. Doubling the range is plenty considering how good Emboldening Bond is already.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With those changes in place, this is an excellent support subclass. Warding Bond really emphasizes teamwork and sticking together, and provides fantastic benefits for doing so. Emboldening Bold is useful throughout your career, and your ability to use it on more targets as you gain levels is incredibly useful on top of the growing benefits. If you want to play a back-line support caster, it&#8217;s hard to go wrong here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the name of the domain, there&#8217;s not much to do with &#8220;peace&#8221; here. Sure, none of the class options are offensive (except Potent Spellcasting, which is inexplicably present here), but the Peace Domain&#8217;s primary function is making your party of violent murderers more effective at performing violence. Sure, you don&#8217;t need to get your hands dirty, but that doesn&#8217;t absolve you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Domain Spells<\/span>: Mostly healing and\n\t\t\tdefensive options, but taken as a whole the spells address a variety of\n\t\t\tproblems that an adventuring party will face in typical adventures.

Warding Bond is more situational, but since Peace Domain is\n\t\t\t\t\ta back-line cleric subclass you&#8217;ve got a big pool of hit points which\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not doing much with so you may as well share it with whoever is\n\t\t\t\t\tserving as your party&#8217;s Defender.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th Level<\/span>: Two situational options\n\t\t\t\t\tthat you&#8217;re not likely to use every day.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: A situational defensive\n\t\t\t\t\tbuff and a save-or-suck which amounts to a &#8220;time out bubble&#8221;.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Greater Restoration is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly situationally useful, but it&#8217;s an essential healing option so\n\t\t\t\t\thaving it handy is nice. Telepathic Bond is a huge advantage for\n\t\t\t\t\tadventurers and you should use it frequently.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Implement of Peace<\/span>: A free skill is\n\t\t\talways welcome. Insight is typically a great choice for the Cleric since\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s Wisdom-based, but Persuasion is also very helpful.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Emboldening Bond<\/span>: This is spectacular.\n\t\t\tThis is basically Bless but with a 10-minute duration and it also applies\n\t\t\tto Ability Checks. Bless will admittedly be more useful for creatures\n\t\t\tmaking more than one attack per turn, but that&#8217;s fine.\n\t\t\t<em>They stack.<\/em> Let me say that again:\n\t\t\t<em>Emboldening Bond and Bless stack.<\/em> Level 1, pick two people and\n\t\t\tthey get +2d4 to attacks and saving throws. On average, that\n\t\t\t<em>doubles<\/em>\n\t\t\ta level 1 character&#8217;s expected attack bonus, and saving throws are\n\t\t\tdramatically less threatening.\n\t\t\t<p>Even better, this whole thing progresses based on your Proficiency Bonus.\n\t\t\t\tIf you took one level of cleric and never came back, you&#8217;re just as good\n\t\t\t\twith this feature as a cleric of the same level.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Emboldening Bond is the Peace Domain&#8217;s central feature, and who gets to\n\t\t\t\tbe part of the bond is an extremely important tactical decision for the\n\t\t\t\tPeace Domain Cleric. Since Proficiency Bonus advances so slowly, you\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t cover a full party of 4 until level 9. That somewhat limits the\n\t\t\t\tbenefits, but if you stay out of trouble and rely on saving throw\n\t\t\t\tcantrips like Sacred Flame there&#8217;s little reason why you need to be\n\t\t\t\tpart of the bond. Put it on your front-line allies, and gradually add\n\t\t\t\tyour back-line allies as your Proficiency Bonus scales.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace<\/span>: Not\n\t\t\tmuch healing, especially compared to something like Channel Divinity:\n\t\t\tPreserve Life, but if your party is close enough together you can hit all\n\t\t\tof them and any pets or summons in the same action, especially if you have\n\t\t\ta lot of speed and are flying (centaurs and aarakocra are great for this).\n\t\t\tAt low levels, this can prevent a TPK. It&#8217;s also a great way to expend\n\t\t\tremaining uses of Channel Divinity before you take a rest.\n\t\t\t<p>However, as you gain levels its usefulness in combat will diminish, and\n\t\t\t\tit will become that thing you use before short rests to save on spending hit dice.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protective Bond<\/span>: Fantastic both for\n\t\t\tprotecting frail allies like spellcasters (including you, potentially) and\n\t\t\tfor repositioning allies in a hurry. There&#8217;s no limitation on how often\n\t\t\tyou can use this beyond their Reaction, and in a pinch you could make an unarmed strike against\n\t\t\tan ally and use Protective Bond to pull another ally adjacent to the\n\t\t\ttarget.\n<p>This does consume the Reaction of the creature that teleports, but\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s a price that is absolutely worth paying for many characters. When people have underutilized reactions to spare, this might see lots of use in combat. If the party is heavily invested into their own reactions on the other hand, it might not get used because the guy who wants to take the hit already used his reaction on a Polearm Master attack and the guy getting attacked is going to just cast Shield to have 24 AC prevent the attack doing any damage in the first place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Outside of combat, it does have teleportation utility. If your party includes a familiar, you can put\n\t\t\t\tthe familiar into your Emboldening Bond (provided that you have space to\n\t\t\t\tjustify doing so). Familiars get just one hit point, so even the\n\t\t\t\tsmallest amount of damage kills them and the owner of the familiar needs\n\t\t\t\tto invest the time and gold to bring them back. Protective Bond allows\n\t\t\t\tyou to both keep the familiar alive and use the familiar as a\n\t\t\t\tpotentially flying teleportation beacon.<\/p>\n<p>Send the familiar where you\n\t\t\t\tneed to be, throw a rock at them, then teleport to them and absorb the\n\t\t\t\tdamage. Your Bonds can similarly punch themselves to trigger teleportation. The entire Bond could even teleport off of one punch, simply have each one react to the damage of the previous reaction trigger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Another example of shenanigans: A Path of the Totem Warrior can have\n\t\t\t\tresistance to all damage while raging by this level. Throw Heroism (or better yet, have a second Cleric of the Twilight Domain for Twilight Sanctuary) on\n\t\t\t\ttop of that, and they&#8217;re a nearly-bottomless mountain of hit points and\n\t\t\t\tcan use their Reaction every turn to happily take damage for the rest of\n\t\t\t\tthe party, conveniently halving all damage that they take all while\n\t\t\t\tenjoying Heroism&#8217;s perpetually-replenishing pool of temporary hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\t\tcan easily have 20 Wisdom, giving an excellent boost to your damage\n\t\t\toutput. Note that this only applies to Cleric cantrips, so you can&#8217;t use\n\t\t\tit in conjunction with Magic Initiate or cantrips gained by\n\t\t\tmulticlassing.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expansive Bond<\/span>: Considering that\n\t\t\tProtective Bond has no usage limitaiton beyond taking a Reaction, this is\n\t\t\tan easy way to effectively give your whole party resistance to all damage\n\t\t\tby shuffling the damage between members of your party. So long as everyone\n\t\t\thas a decently pool of hit points (wizards may need be selfish here),\n\t\t\teveryone can sacrifice a little bit for the whole party to benefit\n\t\t\tconsiderably.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tempest-domain\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/cleric#TempestDomain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tempest Domain<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Tempest is both offensive and durable, falling somewhere between Life&#8217;s durability and Light&#8217;s damage output.

For the same 5th-level spell slot, Shatter does\n\t\t\t\t6d8 damage (maximizes to 48), while Destructive Wave will deal 47.5 on\n\t\t\t\taverage (30 maximized, plus 17.5 average) in a much larger AOE while\n\t\t\t\talso excluding your allies, so Destructive Wave does still win over\n\t\t\t\tShatter in the vast majority of situations. Unfortunately, Destructive\n\t\t\t\tWave doesn&#8217;t benefit from upcasting because it&#8217;s intended to be a\n\t\t\t\tPaladin spell.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Insect Plague is a fantastic area control option, but has some\n\t\t\t\t\toverlap with Spirit Guardians. Insect Plague uses larger damage dice,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut due to spell slot scaling deals roughly the same damage as Spirit\n\t\t\t\t\tGuardians. Both spells have 10-minute durations and require\n\t\t\t\t\tConcentration. Insect Plague is cast at range and has a larger AOE, so\n\t\t\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t need to stand in the middle of the AOE, but you also can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tmove it.

This isn&#8217;t an easy subclass to play, but an experienced player can turn the Trickery Domain into a powerful support and utility caster. With a little bit of work you can also jump into melee combat with some success, but that&#8217;s typically not the go-to option for Trickery Domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiclassing into rogue is an interesting option for the Trickery Domain. Trickery Domain&#8217;s spellcasting feels very similar to the Arcane Trickster, and many of the Trickery Domain&#8217;s features synergize very well with the Rogue&#8217;s class features. If you go this route, I recommend starting with a single level in rogue so that you get more skill proficiencies, and build around Dexterity and Wisdom. Two more levels to get a subclass can help if you want something like Booming Blade, but that&#8217;s not strictly necessary unless you definitely want jump into melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this class dip isn&#8217;t necessary by any means. Many problems that the Rogue solves by mundane means can be solved using spells on the Trickery Domain&#8217;s spell list, such as Disguise Self (replacing disguise kits), Charm Person (replacing Face Skills), and Pass Without Trace (replacing or at least augmenting Stealth).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/trickery-domain\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"10669\">Trickery Domain Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spells<\/span>: Lots of really fun\n\t\t\toptions, many of which aren&#8217;t normally available to Clerics.\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: Disguise Self and Charm\n\t\t\t\t\tPerson can diffuse quite a few social situations.

Dispel Magic is technically situational, but it&#8217;s so useful\n\t\t\t\t\tand important that not preparing it can often be a lethal mistake.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">7th Level<\/span>: Dimension Door is good\n\t\t\t\t\tshort-distance teleportation that the vast majority of clerics simply\n\t\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t replicate. Polymorph is one of the most versatile effects in the\n\t\t\t\t\tgame, and can allow you to solve a wide variety of problems with the\n\t\t\t\t\tright beast form. Remember that you don&#8217;t need to cast it on yourself,\n\t\t\t\t\tso turning an ally into a dinosaur and riding them around is\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely an option,<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Modify Memory is very\n\t\t\t\t\tsituational, but Dominate Person is a great way to turn a powerful\n\t\t\t\t\thumanoid enemy into a fun pet for up to a minute.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessing of the Trickster<\/span>: You can&#8217;t\n\t\t\tuse this on yourself, so either use it on whoever in your party is making\n\t\t\ta ton of noise stomping around in heavy armor or put it on your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\tScout and send them off on their own. Between this and Pass Without Trace,\n\t\t\tstealth checks are nearly guaranteed to be successful for your party.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity<\/span>:\n\t\t\tThis can be difficult to use effectively, but once you get your head\n\t\t\taround it, it&#8217;s very potent. Keep in mind that it requires Concentration,\n\t\t\tso you can&#8217;t combine it with staple cleric options like Spirit Guardians,\n\t\t\tand since it uses your Bonus Action to move it, you may struggle to use this at\n\t\t\tthe same time as Spiritual Weapon.\n\t\t\t<p>The best use case is to put the illusion somewhere visible while you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\thidden nearby and use the illusion as the origin point of your\n\t\t\t\tshort-range spells. Options like Word of Radiance are much safer when\n\t\t\t\tyou can walk your illusion into a crowd of enemies to cast it, and since\n\t\t\t\tthe illusion isn&#8217;t a creature it&#8217;s not worried about things like\n\t\t\t\tOpportunity Attacks, area control effects, or even enemy creatures\n\t\t\t\tblocking spaces.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>You can use the illusion to get yourself Advantage in melee, but I&#8217;m\n\t\t\t\tnervous to recommend capitalizing on that as a go-to tactic. In only\n\t\t\t\tmedium armor you&#8217;re not as durable as other front-line clerics, and weapon\n\t\t\t\tattacks aren&#8217;t a great option for clerics most of the time. Easy access\n\t\t\t\tto Advantage may make weapons viable compared to cantrips (which is very\n\t\t\t\thard for most clerics to do), especially once you get Divine Strike, but\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t let that compel you to build around melee. This notably applies to\n\t\t\t\tall attacks, so the Advantage offsets disadvantage for making ranged\n\t\t\t\tattacks, and it also applies to spell attacks so you can deliver spells\n\t\t\t\tlike Inflict Wounds and Spiritual Weapon with Advantage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re happy using your illusory double as a distraction and as a\n\t\t\t\tcourier for your spells, you can totally ignore the Advantage part of\n\t\t\t\tInvoke Duplicity and you&#8217;ll still do just fine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Strangely, Invoke Duplicity doesn&#8217;t offer details on how to handle\n\t\t\t\tinteraction with the illusory double. What happens if the illusion is\n\t\t\t\tattacked? Can creatures disbelieve it, and if they do so, how do they\n\t\t\t\tthen perceive the illusion? If creatures are aware that the double is an\n\t\t\t\tillusion, do you still get Advantage on attacks when you and your double\n\t\t\t\tare adjacent to a creature?

Keep Vigilant Blessing running in case combat breaks out. When combat starts, start with Twilight Sanctuary and keep your allies in the radius to protect them with the temporary hit points.

On top of the other amazing stuff that Twilight Domain gets at first\n\t\t\tlevel, you can give someone Advantage on their next Initiative roll. I\n\t\t\trecommend an Assassin Rogue if one is in your party, otherwise, go for one\n\t\t\tof the primary battlefield controller in your party even if that means you. The effect lasts\n\t\t\tuntil it expires, so you want to get this set up again the moment that\n\t\t\tcombat ends so that you&#8217;re never not benefiting from this.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary<\/span>: If\n\t\t\tthis were a fire-and-forget effect that granted temporary hit points or\n\t\t\tremoved charm\/fear once, I would rate it\n\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>\n\t\t\tbecause the pool of temporary hit points is enormous. Instead, it\n\t\t\trefreshes every round for a minute. Remember that clerics can use Channel\n\t\t\tDivinity once per short rest at this level, going up to 3 times per short\n\t\t\trest. This makes your whole party incredibly difficult to kill, and makes\n\t\t\tthem all but immune to both charm and fear effects.\n\t\t\t<p>The light effect here is a bit unclear, as it doesn&#8217;t explain how it\n\t\t\t\tinteracts with other light sources. Does it reduce existing light\n\t\t\t\tlevels? How does it interact with magical light? What about spells like\n\t\t\t\tDaylight or Darkness? I&#8217;m honestly not sure and I&#8217;m hesitant to offer\n\t\t\t\tsuggestions. It&#8217;s possible that brighter light simply overrides the\n\t\t\t\tlight from Twilight Sanctuary, and if that&#8217;s the case I&#8217;m fairly\n\t\t\t\tconfident that that doesn&#8217;t cause you any problems\nexcept trying to activate your Steps of Night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>This ability is exceptionally powerful. The amount of temporary hp is\n\t\t\t\thuge and the fact that it refreshes is terrifying. If it&#8217;s a problem in\n\t\t\t\tyour game (and it might be \nstarting in midgame when two per short rest doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s too precious to use often), there are\n\t\t\t\tseveral variations that you could try to address it with.

Weapons are mathematically worse than using cantrips, and spending spells and Channel Divinity to make them work does little to help. War Priest allows you to attack as a Bonus Action a few times per day, which is tempting enough to make the War Domain look appealing, but beyond low levels you&#8217;ll find that most of the subclass features aren&#8217;t helping you very much. The Spell list is fine, but the best options on the list are all cleric spells already, so all it does is save you the trouble of preparing those spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixing war domain requires fixing weapons for clerics, which requires fixing Divine Strike. Simply changing the damage progression on Divine Strike might be enough.

Spiritual Weapon is a staple cleric option, and\n\t\t\t\t\tgreat way to convert your Bonus Action into damage output without\n\t\t\t\t\trequiring Concentration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Crusader&#8217;s Mantle is\n\t\t\t\t\tDivine Favor for the whole party.

Divine Strike adds to the damage so\n\t\t\tyour attacks will at least feel impactful, but Divine Strike only applies\n\t\t\tonce on each of your turns, so generally activating War Priest is only\n\t\t\tuseful at low levels or if you&#8217;re high level and missed with your\n\t\t\tattack.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Guided Strike<\/span>: This\n\t\t\tisn&#8217;t limited to weapon attacks, and clerics have a few powerful spell\n\t\t\tattacks like Inflict Wounds which will benefit. However, spell attacks\n\t\t\tbecome uncommon beyond low levels, so the value of Channel Divinity:\n\t\t\tGuided Strike diminishes over time.

However, against enemies with resistance to\n\t\t\tnon-magic weapon damage, this will be very frustrating. If your game\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t use magic items, be sure to prepare Magic Weapon or similar buffs\n\t\t\twhich cause your weapon to deal damage as a magic weapon.
