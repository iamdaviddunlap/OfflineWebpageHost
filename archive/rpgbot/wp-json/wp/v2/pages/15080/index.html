Runaway math is a problem if it\u2019s just one powergaming munchkin skewing the party average, but Peace Domain is about teamwork and cooperation, adding a little bit to everyone\u2019s d20s. So what if the party is punching a little above their CR? Then let them fight a little above their CR.

With\n\t\t\tthe right spell from the Peace Domain&#8217;s spell list, you can prevent or\n\t\t\trepair most problems which might afflict your party with the exception of\n\t\t\tactual hit point damage since none of the Peace Domain&#8217;s spells restore\n\t\t\thit points. Fortunately, you can still depend on your regular allotment of\n\t\t\tspells, and Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace provides some additional\n\t\t\thealing.\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">1st Level<\/span>: Excellent defensive\n\t\t\t\t\toptions for yourself or an ally.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: Aid is good enough that\n\t\t\t\t\tmany people prepare it every day, so getting that for free is\n\t\t\t\t\tfantastic. Warding Bond is more situational, but since Peace Domain is\n\t\t\t\t\ta back-line cleric subclass you&#8217;ve got a big pool of hit points which\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not doing much with so you may as well share it with whoever is\n\t\t\t\t\tserving as your party&#8217;s Defender.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th Level<\/span>: Two situational options\n\t\t\t\t\tthat you&#8217;re not likely to use every day.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: A situational defensive\n\t\t\t\t\tbuff and a save-or-suck which amounts to a &#8220;time out bubble&#8221;.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Greater Restoration is\n\t\t\t\t\tonly situationally useful, but it&#8217;s an essential healing option so\n\t\t\t\t\thaving it handy is nice. Telepathic Bond is a huge advantage for\n\t\t\t\t\tadventurers and you should use it frequently.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Implement of Peace<\/span>: A free skill is\n\t\t\talways welcome. Insight is typically a great choice for the Cleric since\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s Wisdom-based, but Persuasion is also very helpful.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Emboldening Bond<\/span>: This is spectacular.\n\t\t\tThis is basically Bless but with a 10-minute duration and it also applies\n\t\t\tto Ability Checks. Bless will admittedly be more useful for creatures\n\t\t\tmaking more than one attack per turn, but that&#8217;s fine.\n\t\t\t<em>They stack.<\/em> Let me say that again:\n\t\t\t<em>Emboldening Bond and Bless stack.<\/em> Level 1, pick two people and\n\t\t\tthey get +2d4 to attacks and saving throws. On average, that\n\t\t\t<em>doubles<\/em>\n\t\t\ta level 1 character&#8217;s expected attack bonus, and saving throws are\n\t\t\tdramatically less threatening.\n\t\t\t<p>Even better, this whole thing progresses based on your Proficiency Bonus.\n\t\t\t\tIf you took one level of cleric and never came back, you&#8217;re just as good\n\t\t\t\twith this feature as a cleric of the same level.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Emboldening Bond is the Peace Domain&#8217;s central feature, and who gets to\n\t\t\t\tbe part of the bond is an extremely important tactical decision for the\n\t\t\t\tPeace Domain Cleric. Since Proficiency Bonus advances so slowly, you\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t cover a full party of 4 until level 9. That somewhat limits the\n\t\t\t\tbenefits, but if you stay out of trouble and rely on saving throw\n\t\t\t\tcantrips like Sacred Flame there&#8217;s little reason why you need to be\n\t\t\t\tpart of the bond. Put it on your front-line allies, and gradually add\n\t\t\t\tyour back-line allies as your Proficiency Bonus scales.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace<\/span>: Not\n\t\t\tmuch healing, especially compared to something like Channel Divinity:\n\t\t\tPreserve Life, but if your party is close enough together you can hit all\n\t\t\tof them and any pets or summons in the same action, especially if you have\n\t\t\ta lot of speed and are flying (centaurs and aarakocra are great for this).\n\t\t\tAt low levels, this can prevent a TPK. It&#8217;s also a great way to expend\n\t\t\tremaining uses of Channel Divinity before you take a rest.\n\t\t\t<p>However, as you gain levels its usefulness in combat will diminish, and\n\t\t\t\tit will become that thing you use before short rests to save on spending hit dice.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protective Bond<\/span>: Fantastic both for\n\t\t\tprotecting frail allies like spellcasters (including you, potentially) and\n\t\t\tfor repositioning allies in a hurry. There&#8217;s no limitation on how often\n\t\t\tyou can use this beyond their Reaction, and in a pinch you could make an unarmed strike against\n\t\t\tan ally and use Protective Bond to pull another ally adjacent to the\n\t\t\ttarget.\n<p>This does consume the Reaction of the creature that teleports, but\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s a price that is absolutely worth paying for many characters. When people have underutilized reactions to spare, this might see lots of use in combat. If the party is heavily invested into their own reactions on the other hand, it might not get used because the guy who wants to take the hit already used his reaction on a Polearm Master attack and the guy getting attacked is going to just cast Shield to have 24 AC prevent the attack doing any damage in the first place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Outside of combat, it does have teleportation utility. If your party includes a familiar, you can put\n\t\t\t\tthe familiar into your Emboldening Bond (provided that you have space to\n\t\t\t\tjustify doing so). Familiars get just one hit point, so even the\n\t\t\t\tsmallest amount of damage kills them and the owner of the familiar needs\n\t\t\t\tto invest the time and gold to bring them back. Protective Bond allows\n\t\t\t\tyou to both keep the familiar alive and use the familiar as a\n\t\t\t\tpotentially flying teleportation beacon.<\/p>\n<p>Send the familiar where you\n\t\t\t\tneed to be, throw a rock at them, then teleport to them and absorb the\n\t\t\t\tdamage. Your Bonds can similarly punch themselves to trigger teleportation. The entire Bond could even teleport off of one punch, simply have each one react to the damage of the previous reaction trigger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Another example of shenanigans: A Path of the Totem Warrior can have\n\t\t\t\tresistance to all damage while raging by this level. Throw Heroism (or better yet, have a second Cleric of the Twilight Domain for Twilight Sanctuary) on\n\t\t\t\ttop of that, and they&#8217;re a nearly-bottomless mountain of hit points and\n\t\t\t\tcan use their Reaction every turn to happily take damage for the rest of\n\t\t\t\tthe party, conveniently halving all damage that they take all while\n\t\t\t\tenjoying Heroism&#8217;s perpetually-replenishing pool of temporary hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\t\tcan easily have 20 Wisdom, giving an excellent boost to your damage\n\t\t\toutput. Note that this only applies to Cleric cantrips, so you can&#8217;t use\n\t\t\tit in conjunction with Magic Initiate or cantrips gained by\n\t\t\tmulticlassing.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expansive Bond<\/span>: Considering that\n\t\t\tProtective Bond has no usage limitaiton beyond taking a Reaction, this is\n\t\t\tan easy way to effectively give your whole party resistance to all damage\n\t\t\tby shuffling the damage between members of your party. So long as everyone\n\t\t\thas a decently pool of hit points (wizards may need be selfish here),\n\t\t\teveryone can sacrifice a little bit for the whole party to benefit\n\t\t\tconsiderably.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"peace-domain-problems\">Peace Domain Problems<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Emboldening Bond does too much at once for how easy it is to get. If it were just saves or just attacks, nobody would be arguing about it, but I don\u2019t think it would be any good if it were just one or the other. Trying to alter what the feature does in search of balance is, in my opinion, a rather foolish amount of effort for something that nobody is going to be happy with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, I think the answer lies in changing how easy it is to obtain. I propose that Emboldening Bond and Balm of Peace simply swap places, with Balm becoming PB times per LR and Bond becoming the CD, with no other alterations to their internal mechanics. This simple change means that the Bond is no longer the easy dip that it was, while still letting someone who wants to be an actual Cleric still have that strong party support feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"peace-domain-ability-scores\">Peace Domain Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Clerics want three things mainly: The Constitution to make Concentration saves, the Wisdom to increase save DCs, and good AC, whether that be Strength for heavy armor or Dex for Medium.

The swirly blendy user-friendly area control kind of things. It\u2019s Spirit Guardians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s almost always Spirit Guardians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"but-can-i-just-cast-bless-instead-for-that-sweet-stacking-2d4\">But can I just cast Bless instead for that sweet stacking +2d4?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/ban-5es-peace-domain\/\">You can; it\u2019s really good<\/a>. Especially at the first few levels, when nobody has Extra Attack so it doesn\u2019t matter that Bond only applies once per turn, this combination is amazing (assuming your party has at least a few people who fight by making attack rolls). Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">bounded accuracy<\/a>, it doesn\u2019t really drop off either, as the target AC for at-CR monsters increases at the same rate as proficiency and ability score bonuses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>This means that because the expected target on a d20 at CR is 8, then +2d4 from Bless and Bond will always be the same strength, changing the target from an 8 on the d20 to a 3 on average (Average on 1d4 is 2.5 so 2d4 is 5. 5+3 is 8.) This is a perfectly fine way to play it if you want to just buff everyone else up. To compare this to Spirit Guardians (which we\u2019re going to do more of below), let\u2019s look at a couple things to do with a 5th level cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Any of them can cast Spirit Guardians and it will use a resource you get exactly one of in a day which is also competing with Revivify, meaning if you choose to be a blender and someone dies, they\u2019re just outright dead. The spell will last ten minutes and do less than 9 average damage per target if you use the \u201c65% chance to hit\u201d math that attacks do, which isn\u2019t exactly accurate for saves but is ok as an estimation. Level 5 will see a normally-optimized rogue doing something like 11.5 DPR, a martial defender doing a bit over 11, and your blaster warlock a little more than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>As the math in the linked articles above shows, bond\/bless makes each of them do 50% extra DPR. That\u2019s you causing 17 DPR (about equal to hitting two targets with with your 1\/day Spirit Guardians) using resources you can use 3 times a day (meaning probably every fight unless your DM tries to make pacing work in the way it\u2019s badly described in the DMG), while also increasing party defenses, and saving your high level spell slots for a truly dire situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The 50% boost will wall off slightly when everyone hits 5th level, and characters who make multiple attacks get less benefit, so fighters, monks, and two-weapon fighting builds benefit the least, while rogues benefit the most since they rely on single attacks. <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/great-weapon-master-sharpshooter\/\">Great Weapon Master and Sharpshooter<\/a> similarly benefit a great deal since their attack penalty is negated on average by the +2d4, which also gives us a very simple formula: What if everyone in my party could add +10 damage once per turn?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The actual math is more complicated, but it\u2019s a fine \u201cback of the envelope\u201d estimate, and it points people in the right direction for building the rest of your party.
