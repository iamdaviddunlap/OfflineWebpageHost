The skill bonuses work\n\t\tgreat for a character with high Intelligence and Dexterity, and the innate\n\t\tspellcasting saves you the trouble of learning Mage Armor. However, you\n\t\tstill need to spend your spells known to take advantage of the dragonmark\n\t\tspell list, and I don&#8217;t see anything on the list that&#8217;s worthwhile except\n\t\tpossibly Armor of Agathys.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-default\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Default Rules<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Warding<\/span>: Interesting\n\t\tthematically, and some of the spells are tempting, but this is a hard choice\n\t\twithout a Strength or Dexterity increase.

The Eldritch Knight can benefit\n\t\tfrom the dragonmark spells, but they&#8217;re beyond the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s school\n\t\tlimitations so that&#8217;s a very hefty cost to get spells which you can&#8217;t use\n\t\tvery often due to your tiny pool of spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Hospitality<\/span>: The spells do very\n\t\tlittle to help the Fighter, and the dragonmark spell list doesn&#8217;t include\n\t\tanything that the Eldritch Knight wants.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-default\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Default Rules<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Healing<\/span>: A Dexterity-based\n\t\tEldritch Knight could make us of the new spell options to complement their\n\t\tparty&#8217;s existing healing capabilities, but the ability score increases\n\t\taren&#8217;t spectacular.

The\n\t\tinnate spellcasting has a few gems like Elemental Weapon which work very\n\t\twell for the Fighter, but which aren&#8217;t on the Wizard&#8217;s spell list so you\n\t\tnormally can&#8217;t cast them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: Misty step for free once\n\t\tper day, and teleportation options on the spell list. Unfortunately the\n\t\tspells are outside of the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s school limitations you&#8217;ll have\n\t\ttrouble actually learning them.

The skills are Wisdom-based, which is hard for the\n\t\tEldritch Knight but otherwise fantastic. Vigilant Guardian shares some\n\t\tfunction with Fighting Style (Protection). The dragonmark spells include\n\t\tsome great options from the Cleric and the Paladin&#8217;s spell lists, including\n\t\tShield of Faith, Protection from Energy, and Death Ward, all of which are\n\t\twithin the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s school limitations. There are some worthwhile\n\t\toptions outside of the school limitations, but they may not be worth your\n\t\tlimited number of unrestricted spells known.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-default\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Default Rules<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Mark of Finding<\/span>: See Mark of Finding under\n\t\tDragonmarked Half-Orc, above.

The ability to cast Magic Weapon\n\t\twithout Concentration is a significant benefit at low levels, providing a\n\t\treliable numeric boost over other fighters. The dragonmark spells offer some\n\t\texcellent new spell options, and there is no character in the game better\n\t\tsuited to benefit from Elemental Weapon than a fighter with up to four\n\t\tattacks per Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: If you miss the 4e\n\t\tWarblade class, famous for teleporting around in combat while using weapons\n\t\tto attack, Mark of Passage may scratch that itch. Grab a rapier to take\n\t\tadvantage of the Dexterity increase, take the Eldritch Knight subclass for\n\t\tthe spellcasting, and get really comfortable using Misty Step rather than\n\t\twalking around in combat like a peasant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Sentinel<\/span>: I really wish that the\n\t\tability score increases worked for the Fighter, because Mark of Sentinel&#8217;s\n\t\ttraits and spells all make perfect sense for the Fighter. If you can survive\n\t\twithout a Strength or Dexterity increase you may really enjoy Mark of\n\t\tSentinel, but mathematically you&#8217;ll suffer any time you try to use a\n\t\tweapon.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lineages\">Lineages<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Published in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything and beyond, no Lineage exists prior to the introduction of the Customizing Your Origin rules, and as such each lineage has flexible ability score increases.

While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait. Despite selecting a base race, you do not count as a member of your race for the purposes of any other effect, such as qualifying for feats or using magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-custom-lineage\" class=\"rating-blue\">Custom Lineage<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>+2 to either Strength or Dexterity, Darkvision or a skill, and a feat.\n\tExcellent, but in many cases the Variant Human&#8217;s split increases may be more\n\teffective so that you can also start with 16 in Strength or Dexterity and 16\n\tin Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-dhampir\" class=\"rating-blue\">Dhampir<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>The Dhampir&#8217;s Vampiric Bite is a powerful option for the Fighter, allowing you to build around a single ability score. Building around Constitution makes you unusually durable with only a minor reduction in damage output (compare Vampiric Bite&#8217;s 1d4 to a longsword&#8217;s 1d8). Spider Climb allows you to easily bypass many obstacles, and Ancestral Legacy lets you get another movement type (flight most likely) or two additional skills to expand your capabilities outside of combat.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-hexblood\" class=\"rating-green\">Hexblood<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>A hexblood eldritch knight is a very solid build.

Coupled with Action Surge, you can quickly pile damage onto a single target. Hex also imposes Disadvantage on ability checks with one ability of your choice, so you can impose Disadvantage on Strength or Dexterity checks (whichever you think the target is most likely to use) to make the Grapple\/Shove combo easier.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t recommend the Hexblood for anything except the Eldritch Knight, but that one combination is very solid. A Rune Knight built around grappling could also work, but without the ability to re-cast Hex, the Hexblood&#8217;s traits are less useful.
