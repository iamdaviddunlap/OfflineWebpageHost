Druidcraft and Prestidigitation both grant the ability to light or\n\t\tsnuff out small flames. Control Flames will let you spread flames,\n\t\textinguish them, change their color, etc., but if you want to light a torch\n\t\tyou need to use flint and tinder like a commoner. You can use this to\n\t\tdramatically improve the effectiveness of torches, or to snuff out enemy\n\t\tlight sources at a distance, but those are situational uses that you can\n\t\taddress with better light sources like the Daylight spell or by using water.\n\t\tNeither function is frequent or useful enough to justify a cantrip with so\n\t\tlittle functionality.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Bonfire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: This spell is\n\t\tfantastic for the Druid. It matches the damage of Produce Flame, it can do\n\t\tongoing damage if enemies stay in place or move into the square, and the\n\t\tDruid has very few spells which require Concentration at low levels so the\n\t\tConcentration requirement isn&#8217;t a significant hurdle like it is for other\n\t\tspellcasters like the Cleric. If you position yourself well, you may be able\n\t\tto use this with Thorn Whip to repeatedly pull enemies into the square for\n\t\tadditional damage. This is a great introduction to area control spells,\n\t\twhich is fantastic because the Druid&#8217;s options for area control are some of\n\t\ttheir best spells.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, Create Bonfire&#8217;s reliance on Concentration can become a problem\n\t\t\tas you gain levels because Concentration is such a precious resource, and\n\t\t\tmany of the best spells require Concentration. If your game doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tinclude an option to retrain cantrips, I would skip Create Bonfire\n\t\t\tentirely. If you have a way to retrain cantrips, consider taking Create\n\t\t\tBonfire at low levels, but be prepared to replace it if you find that\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not using it consistently.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Druidcraft<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This spell is\n\t\tprofoundly disappointing. It does almost nothing, and the things it does are\n\t\tnearly useless.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Frostbite<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Low damage for\n\t\ta cantrip (d6-based), but the big appeal is Disadvantage on the target&#8217;s\n\t\tnext weapon attack. Unfortunately, it works on Constitution saving throws,\n\t\tand those tend to be relatively high compared to other saving throws.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guidance<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: As long as you&#8217;re not\n\t\tconcentrating on something with a long duration between fights, you should\n\t\tbe constantly throwing this on your allies. Your Rogue should have Guidance\n\t\tfor every skill check they make while searching, sneaking, handling traps,\n\t\tetc.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Gust<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: If this scaled\n\t\tsomehow I would be interested. If it had more options, I would be\n\t\tinterested. If it had better range, I would be interested. But as it stands\n\t\tthis spell is almost totally useless.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infestation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Constitution saves\n\t\ttend to be high, which is this spell&#8217;s biggest problem. The damage is low\n\t\tbut fine, and the forced movement is enough to make it useful by forcing\n\t\tenemies to move around in dangerous places or move out of a grapple despite\n\t\tyour lack of control over the direction.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Stone<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: At low levels,\n\t\ta spell attack dealing 1d6+Wisdom will be more damage than any of your other\n\t\tcantrips. But every other damage cantrip will match it at level 5, and\n\t\twithout Extra Attack to let you throw more stones you&#8217;ll never get more than\n\t\t1d6+5 damage. On top of that, casting Magic Stone consumes your Bonus\n\t\tAction, so it&#8217;s difficult to use in conjunction with other options. Your\n\t\tbest bet is to get three NPCs to stand behind you, pull rocks out of your\n\t\thand, and throw them at enemies while you use your action to do literally\n\t\tanything else.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mending<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too situational. Short\n\t\tof Rust Monsters and a few oozes, nearly nothing in 5e deals damage to your\n\t\tequipment. If you&#8217;re playing Spelljammer this is essential, but otherwise\n\t\tyou can skip it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Mold Earth<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: You know what\n\t\telse can do this? A shovel. Sure, shoveling will take a long time, but you\n\t\tget at most 3 cantrips (5 with Circle of the Land), and if you can replace a\n\t\tcantrip with a mundane item it&#8217;s probably a bad cantrip. The only important\n\t\tfunction is to create difficult terrain, but you&#8217;re limited to two ongoing\n\t\teffects, which means you only get two 5-foot squares. And, again, you could\n\t\tdo that with a shovel. You&#8217;re about as likely to use this in combat as you\n\t\tare to use a shovel, too.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison Spray<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This highest damage die\n\t\tfor cantrips, at least until Toll the Dead came along. Poison spray has\n\t\tserious problems: 10 ft. range, and it works on a Constitution saving throw,\n\t\tso enemies will frequently resist it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Savagery<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: More damage than you\n\t\tcan get out of any other Druid cantrip except Poison Spray, but no function\n\t\tbeyond damage. If you&#8217;re building for melee without Wild Shape, you need to\n\t\tconsider this against options like Shillelagh, Thunderclap, and any ranged\n\t\tcantrip that works on a saving throw rather than an attack roll. Primal\n\t\tSavagery will beat out Shillelagh at level 5 unless you&#8217;re getting a second\n\t\tattack from something like Polearm Master. A Circle of Spores Druid with\n\t\tPolearm Master and Shillelagh will deal more damage than Primal Savagery,\n\t\tbut only until 17th level and only while running Symbiotic Entity.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Produce Flame<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The Druid&#8217;s go-to\n\t\tdamage cantrip, it notably also allows you to hold the flame and carry it\n\t\taround as a light source. You should be able to light fires with it even\n\t\tthough that function isn&#8217;t specified in the spell&#8217;s text. You are holding a\n\t\tflame large enough to cast twice as much light as a candle, after all.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Resistance<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Considerably more\n\t\tdifficult to use than Guidance. Your best bet is to throw this on an ally\n\t\tbefore going into combat, but if you have that luxury you should be casting\n\t\ta better Concentration spell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shape Water<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is as\n\t\tabusable and versatile as Prestidigitation. Freeze a solid 5 foot cube of\n\t\twater and drop it on someone. Pour water into a lock, freeze it, and allow\n\t\tthe ice expansion to break the lock. Put a dome of ice over something you&#8217;re\n\t\tprotecting. Build a small bridge in 5-foot segments. Block a hallway. Freeze\n\t\ta door in place. The uses are numerous and fantastic. If you have a barrel\n\t\tof water and this cantrip, you have a solution to most problems. Honestly\n\t\tthe fact that this spell is so much better than its other elemental\n\t\tequivalents (Control Flames, Gust, and Mold Earth) is a good indication of\n\t\tjust how awful those spells are. See our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/shape-water\">Practical Guide to Shape Water<\/a>\n\t\tfor more on how great Shape Water is.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shillelagh<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Stuck in melee? Out of\n\t\tWild Shape uses? Don&#8217;t use your dumped Strength score: use a magic stick!\n\t\tShillelagh is a neat spell, and it&#8217;s a popular option for clerics (via\n\t\tmulticlassing or Magic Initiate) so that they don&#8217;t need to devote ability\n\t\tscore increases to Strength or Dexterity. However, it&#8217;s not a great option\n\t\tfor most druids. Druids never get Extra Attack, so the most damage you can\n\t\tever get from melee attacks is 1d8+5 (avg. 9.5), which will be matched by\n\t\tProduce Flame at 5th level (2d8, avg. 9). As much as I love the idea of a\n\t\tdruid standing in melee with a magic staff and a shield, it&#8217;s just not a\n\t\tpractical option. However, the Circle of Spores Druid may be an exception.\n\t\tSymbiotic Entity provides a boost to weapon attack damage which may keep\n\t\tShillelagh viable as far as 11th level, at which point you should consider\n\t\tThunderclap for your melee needs.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Thorn Whip<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The damage is fine, but\n\t\tthe real appeal is the pull effect. 10 feet may not seem like much, but its\n\t\tenough to pull enemies off of ledges, to pull low-flying enemies into melee,\n\t\tto pull enemies into an area control effect like Create Bonfire or Wall of\n\t\tFire, to pull enemies out of a grapple, or in a pinch you can pull an ally\n\t\tout of a dangerous location (albeit at the price of some friendly fire).<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderclap<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Damaging every\n\t\tcreature within 5 feet of you is great if you&#8217;re in melee facing numerous\n\t\tenemies. Even with Extra Attack you will deal more damage with this against\n\t\tthree or more foes than you could with a weapon. See our article on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\"\n\t\t\t>Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrips to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Absorb Elements<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: A fantastic\n\t\tdefensive option at any level, this will save your life when you encounter\n\t\tan unpredictable source of elemental damage like a trap or a spell. The\n\t\tbonus damage on your next attack is largely useless, but it still feels cool\n\t\twhen you use it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Friendship<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Arguably easier than\n\t\tproficiency in Animal Handling, but it will become obsolete once beasts\n\t\tdisappear around CR 10.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Beast Bond<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Interesting,\n\t\tbut druids don&#8217;t have something like a beast companion which would\n\t\tsignificantly benefit from this. You could cast Conjure animals and combine\n\t\tit with this, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s worth the spell slots.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Charm Person<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you can cast this on\n\t\ta target outside of combat without them noticing, this can be a great way to\n\t\tdefuse a potentially hostile situation. However, the spell has some\n\t\tcomplications. Charm Person has no visual effect like a ball of fire, so\n\t\tthere&#8217;s no visual indication that the spell succeeded or failed. The target\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;ve been targeted by the spell if they succeed on the\n\t\tsaving throw, but you don&#8217;t know if they succeeded or failed unless your DM\n\t\tdecides to tell you (and they are under no obligation to do so). So\n\t\tgenerally your best bet is to cast this once or twice and hope for the best\n\t\tbefore presenting yourself to your target.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create or Destroy Water<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ability to\n\t\tmagically create water has many uses. Few of them are combat-related, but\n\t\tcombined with Goodberry and an appropriate plant, this allows you to be\n\t\tfully self-sufficient.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cure Wounds<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: More healing than\n\t\tHealing Word, but the action economy is considerably worse. Save this for\n\t\twhen you need hit points and you&#8217;re either out of hit dice or don&#8217;t have\n\t\ttime to rest.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Magic<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Someone needs to have\n\t\tit in every party.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Poison and Disease<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very situational, and\n\t\tunless you can also cast Protection From Poison there&#8217;s little you can do\n\t\tabout it anyway.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth Tremor<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Not nearly\n\t\tenough damage, and being prone isn&#8217;t enough of a problem in 5e. The\n\t\tdifficult terrain effect is the real draw. It only works on &#8220;loose earth or\n\t\tstone&#8221;, but that covers nearly anything you&#8217;ll stand on except wood, so it&#8217;s\n\t\tan easy way to create difficult terrain. Unfortunately, it also effects you\n\t\tso be careful not to trap yourself among enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Entangle<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A great area control\n\t\tspell at any level. Strength saving throws tend to be low for any creature\n\t\tthat isn&#8217;t a gigantic Strength-based brute, so it&#8217;s easy to restrain even\n\t\thigh-level enemies. However, it requires Concentration so you can&#8217;t easily\n\t\tcombine it with things like Create Bonfire.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Faerie Fire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The lowest-level option\n\t\tto deal with invisible creatures, and Advantage on attacks against creatures\n\t\twhich fail their save means that this remains a powerful support option well\n\t\tinto high levels, especially against bug bulky enemies with high AC but poor\n\t\tDexterity saves. Hopefully you won&#8217;t run into any invisible creatures at 1st\n\t\tlevel, but but it&#8217;s important to have some way to deal with invisibility\n\t\tjust in case.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fog Cloud<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An excellent way to\n\t\tcover your escape, but you can&#8217;t see through the fog any better than anyone\n\t\telse, so don&#8217;t expect to fight in this without some other advantage most of\n\t\tthe time. Fog Cloud can be a way to negate Advantage if your enemies have\n\t\tthe upper hand, so if you&#8217;re facing enemies who are invisible, hidden, or\n\t\thave some other source of Advantage, Fog Cloud can take that away,\n\t\teffectively leveling the playing field so that no one can see each other.\n\t\tSuch situations are rare, but it&#8217;s nice to know that there&#8217;s a\n\t\tcountermeasure when those situations do arise.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Goodberry<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Not useful in combat,\n\t\tbut more healing per spell slot than Cure Wounds. Players: Dump all of your\n\t\tspell slots at the end of the day into Goodberry so you have a giant bag of\n\t\thealing to use between combats the next day. DMs: Limit your players to 10\n\t\tactive berries at a time specifically to prevent them from doing what I just\n\t\tsuggested.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Word<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: More important than\n\t\tCure Wounds, especially at low levels.

That&#8217;s still incredibly effective\n\t\tfor a 2nd-level spell slot and it&#8217;s definitely better than Cure Wounds, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s likely not good enough to replace healing from a short rest when your\n\t\tparty is in rough shape. The healing goes up by 1d6 per spell slot past 2nd,\n\t\tso you can double the healing by using a 3rd-level slot.

The damage will be slow, but disadvantage on attack rolls and\n\t\tability checks makes martial characters (the ones typically in metal armor)\n\t\tbasically useless. Upcasting the spell is surprisingly efficient since the\n\t\tadditional damage applies every round, so if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to\n\t\tencounter a suitable enemy, use this to its fullest.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hold Person<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: On\/off button for\n\t\thumanoids.

Paralysis is a\n\t\t\tserious status condition, granting Advantage on attacks against the\n\t\t\ttargets and guaranteeing Critical Hits for attacks made within 5 feet of\n\t\t\tthe target.

In a practical sense, they&#8217;re both an ongoing\n\t\tspell which will deal damage to one creature once per turn and the creature\n\t\tgets a save to reduce the damage (or avoid it for Flaming Sphere). Moonbeam\n\t\tdoes more damage and targets save for half, but since Constitution saves\n\t\ttend to be so high creatures will frequently resist it. Moonbeam also deals\n\t\tradiant damage, which is a rarity for the Druid. All told, it&#8217;s a very\n\t\tefficient use of a spell slot, so at low levels before cantrip damage\n\t\timproves and while you have very few spell slots to throw around, this is an\n\t\texcellent combat option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pass without Trace<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A +10 bonus in a game\n\t\twhere most characters max out at +11 is huge.

Outside of\n\t\tnormal adventuring activities, the ability to enrich land to double crop\n\t\tyields is very useful. But DnD is a game primarily about adventuring, and\n\t\tthe option to make an area of plants overgrown is the more important option\n\t\tfor most adventurers. In most cases, Entangle will work fine if you just\n\t\tneed to slow your enemies down, but Plant Growth doesn&#8217;t expire, so those\n\t\tplants remain difficult to walk through until someone clears the plants\n\t\t(which may requires hours of chopping and\/or burning). The spell also\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t specify that the plants grow along the ground or surfaces, so RAW it\n\t\tcan create a sphere of plants, creating super-difficult terrain extending\n\t\t100 feet into the air, potentially engulfing flying enemies.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The math on Plant Growth&#8217;s speed reduction is impressive. Since most\n\t\t\tcreatures have a speed of around 30 feet, moving at 1\/4 speed means that\n\t\t\tthey can move one 5-foot square and be left with 10 feet of movement that\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t get them anywhere (unless they dash or something). Jeremy Crawford\n\t\t\thas clarified that Plant Growth\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/811643729966530560\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn&#8217;t create difficult terrain<\/a\n\t\t\t>, so it&#8217;s possible that difficult terrain would stack with Plant Growth,\n\t\t\tbut I personally think that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s intended to work. Plant Growth\n\t\t\tspecifies that &#8220;a creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of\n\t\t\tmovement for every 1 foot&#8221; while the difficult terrain rule specifies that\n\t\t\t&#8220;moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed&#8221;, and since\n\t\t\tthose two statements conflict I think you&#8217;re intended to use whichever\n\t\t\teffect is greater rather than stacking them or multiplying them or\n\t\t\tsomething.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While it&#8217;s not discussed in the text of the spell, it seems likely that\n\t\t\tPlant Growth would also impede vision. If you turn a nicely-tended hedge\n\t\t\tinto a 100-foot-radius hemisphere of super-difficult terrain, there&#8217;s\n\t\t\tclearly enough stuff in the way that seeing through it is difficult. This\n\t\t\twould necessarily mean that creatures inside the area would likely be\n\t\t\tconcealed to some degree, so don&#8217;t expect to drop Plant Growth on and\n\t\t\tenemy and then spend the next several turns spraying them with cantrips\n\t\t\tuntil they fall down.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Plant Growth&#8217;s problematic limitation is that it requires plants to be in\n\t\t\tthe area. However, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any restriction on how many or\n\t\t\thow large these plants must be (just that they must be &#8220;normal&#8221;, whatever\n\t\t\tthat means), and where there&#8217;s lack of clarity there&#8217;s room for\n\t\t\tshenanigans. For example: you might carry around a potted plant and throw\n\t\t\tit into the area to provide the necessary plant life to support the spell.\n\t\t\tPlants like mint or clover can fit into a small pot, and when you make\n\t\t\tthem grow you get a pretty and pleasant-smelling field of super-difficult\n\t\t\tterrain. If your DM scoffs at the idea of 100-foot-tall clover patches,\n\t\t\tconsider carrying a bonsai tree or some other plant which would normally\n\t\t\tbe very tall (though a bonsai might not qualify as &#8220;normal&#8221; since we don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tknow what that word means here).<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Energy<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An excellent defensive\n\t\toption, but you may be doing alright with Absorb Elements.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revivify<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Everyone who\n\t\tis capable of casting this should keep it handy.

Oh, and it goes to any sufficiently large\n\t\tplant on the same plane of existence, so you can transport between planets\n\t\t(provided that there are suitable destinations in your setting) or to less\n\t\tfar-off places like the Underdark, provided that you&#8217;ve been there once\n\t\tbefore and have seen\/touched a suitable destination plant.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wall of Thorns<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Casting Wall of Fire at\n\t\ta 6th-level spell will do almost as much damage, and Wall of Fire affect\n\t\tcreatures within 10 ft. of the wall so it&#8217;s much easier to apply the damage.\n\t\tHowever, fire damage is commonly resisted and aside from the damage there is\n\t\tlittle preventing enemies from moving through a Wall of Fire. Wall of\n\t\tThorns&#8217; damage will be less commonly resisted, it blocks line of sight, and\n\t\tmoving through it costs 4 times as much movement as normal. If you add\n\t\tdifficult terrain with something like Erupting Earth, it&#8217;s profoundly\n\t\tdifficult to get out of or through the wall, and if you can push or pull\n\t\tenemies into the wall somehow they&#8217;ll have a lot of trouble getting out of\n\t\tit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wind Walk<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Transport Via Plants is\n\t\tyour go-to travel option, but if you&#8217;re scouting an area from the air or if\n\t\tthere are no suitable plants, a 300 ft. fly speed is a great way to do it.\n\t\tThat&#8217;s 10 times as fast as most players can walk, so you can cover huge\n\t\tdistances in the spell&#8217;s 8-hour duration.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Draconic Transformation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">FToD<\/a>)<\/sup>: Blindsight, flight,\n\t\tand a breath weapon that you get to use both immediately and as a Bonus\n\t\tAction on following turns. The breath weapon&#8217;s damage is as good as\n\t\tFireball, so you&#8217;re getting as much damage as a 3rd-level fireball as a\n\t\tBonus Action every turn. The only problem is that you want to use this early\n\t\tin a fight where an area control spell or crowd control spell would be more\n\t\timmediately impactful. Your best bet is to cast this right before combat\n\t\tstarts or on a turn when you were already going to cast a cantrip.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire Storm<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Imagine a fireball that\n\t\tyou got to cut up and shape in 10-foot cubes. That&#8217;s essentially what Fire\n\t\tStorm is. It&#8217;s a decent blast spell, but it doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough damage\n\t\tfor a spell of this level.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mirage Arcane<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is a difficult\n\t\tspell. The affectable area is huge, the distance is Sight (go climb a\n\t\tmountain on a clear day), and the effects of the illusion are tangible\n\t\tenough that you can physically interact with them, including picking up\n\t\tsticks or stones. But it&#8217;s unclear how far that goes: Can you burn the\n\t\tillusory wood to keep yourself warm? Can you smooth over difficult terrain\n\t\tin the same way that you can make smooth terrain difficult? Could you place\n\t\tstairs in the side of a clear cliff face? How far up and down does the\n\t\teffect stretch?

Your DM will be the arbiter of exactly what you can\n\t\tget away with, but the spell itself is a wildly versatile toolbox.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plane Shift<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Combination\n\t\ttravel\/banishment in one spell. You can easily replicate teleportation by\n\t\tcasting Plane Shift twice to get where you want to be on the same plane. You\n\t\tcan also banish a creature to a plane where they&#8217;ll be really unhappy, like\n\t\ta living creature banished to the plane of fire, or a demon banished to\n\t\tCelestia. The spell requires a Charisma save to resist, and many monsters\n\t\thave terrible Charisma saves because they&#8217;re horrifying monstrosities.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Regenerate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too situational to\n\t\tselect as a spellcaster with a limited number of spells known. DnD doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thave injury rules which lead to limb removal except in very specific\n\t\tcircumstances, so it&#8217;s not like characters are losing fingers and toes\n\t\tdespite spending potentially years being sliced and diced by all many of\n\t\topponents.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reverse Gravity<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: If used under the right\n\t\tcircumstances, this spell is a death sentence for many creatures. If\n\t\taffected creatures can&#8217;t grab onto something, they don&#8217;t get a save. If they\n\t\tcan&#8217;t fly and can&#8217;t fight at range, they&#8217;re floating targets for up to a\n\t\tminute. If you&#8217;re facing creatures of larger size than your party members,\n\t\tyou can place the cylinder slightly off the ground, dragging tall enemies\n\t\tinto the air while your allies duck below the bottom of the cylinder.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Symbol<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: While many of the\n\t\teffects are wonderful, the inability to move the symbol and the high casting\n\t\tcost are prohibitive.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Whirlwind<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Casting this\n\t\tspell is a commitment: enemies won&#8217;t just walk into the whirlwind, so you&#8217;ll\n\t\tneed to spend your Action every turn to move it. Hopefully you&#8217;re in close\n\t\tenough quarters that you&#8217;ll be able to hit multiple enemies each turn, but\n\t\tthey&#8217;ll probably figure out that a 30-foot tall tornado isn&#8217;t something\n\t\twhich they want to stand by. Once you have a creature in the whirlwind, the\n\t\tvictim is making ability checks to get out rather than a saving throw or a\n\t\tskill check, so even creatures with high Strength or Dexterity may need\n\t\tseveral attempts to escape. And even when they do escape, they&#8217;re hurled\n\t\tbetween 30 and 180 feet in a random direction. Unfortunately it looks like\n\t\thitting objects won&#8217;t hurt them (though they may take some falling damage),\n\t\tbut you can always go pick them up again on your own turn if they&#8217;re close\n\t\tenough.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Animal Shapes<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Without adequate\n\t\tpreparation, Animal Shapes is essentially a worse version of Mass Polymorph:\n\t\tthe size, creature type, and CR limitations gives you few good combat\n\t\toptions. But there&#8217;s a lot of nuance to this spell, and understanding that\n\t\tnuance can make it extremely useful. See our\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/practical-guide-to-animal-shapes\/\">Practical Guide to Animal Shapes<\/a\n\t\t>.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Antipathy\/Sympathy<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Difficult to use\n\t\tbecause it targets a single type of creature, but if you&#8217;re facing a\n\t\thomogenous group of enemies you can greatly hinder them with either option.\n\t\tEven against single creatures, using Sympathy to force an enemy to approach\n\t\tone of your party members (sympathy on a paladin to attract a lich) can\n\t\tforce enemies into a situation which will end in their death.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Control Weather<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very situational, and\n\t\tkind of a pain for the DM. Go to your setting&#8217;s arctic equivalent, and raise\n\t\tthe temperature to &#8220;Unbearable Heat&#8221; for 8 hours. That certainly won&#8217;t cause\n\t\thorrifying and potentially irreparable ecological damage that the DM will\n\t\tneed to either totally disregard or track in some unpleasant fashion for the\n\t\tduration of the campaign.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earthquake<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tspecifically trying to destroy buildings, this spell is too subject to the\n\t\tDM&#8217;s whims to be reliable. The fissures are the only part of the spell which\n\t\tcan reliably harm enemies who aren&#8217;t inside a collapsing building, and you\n\t\thave no control over where they appear.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Feeblemind<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Casters are extremely\n\t\tvulnerable to Feeblemind. Even creatures who cast spells as a supplement to\n\t\ttheir other abilities can be seriously inhibited by suddenly being less\n\t\tintelligent than many animals.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Beyond losing the ability to cast spells, I&#8217;ve always found this spell\n\t\t\tdifficult to manage for other enemies. 1 Intelligence and 1 Charisma is\n\t\t\tobviously very poor, but what is the victim capable of? Could a character\n\t\t\tuse class features other than spellcasting? What are they smart enough to\n\t\t\tdo in combat? There&#8217;s a lot of room for the DM to interpret how this works\n\t\t\tand which abilities creatures can still use. While that could be fun and\n\t\t\tvery effective, it also makes the spell&#8217;s effect totally dependent on the\n\t\t\tDM and their interpretation of what an affected creature is mentally\n\t\t\tcapable of doing.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Incendiary Cloud<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Basically\n\t\tCloudkill with a bunch of improvements. The damage is fully doubled, the\n\t\tdamage type is improved (though fire is still one of the most commonly\n\t\tresisted damage types), and Dexterity saves are more effective than\n\t\tConstitution saves. The damage roughly matches a Fireball cast at the same\n\t\tlevel (avg. 45 vs. avg. 45.5 for Fireball), and the damage applies every\n\t\tround for the full 1-minute duration. However, it still retains some of\n\t\tCloudkill&#8217;s biggest issues. First, the damage applies when the spell is cast\n\t\tbut only re-applies to creatures inside the effect when they end their turn\n\t\tinside the cloud. With a 20-foot radius, most creatures can easily walk out\n\t\tof the cloud. The spell is also forced to move 10 feet every round, and the\n\t\ttext explaining how that works is absolutely nonsensical. RAW you get to\n\t\tchoose the direction, but you only get to choose that it moves directly away\n\t\tfrom you. Fortunately, Jeremy Crawford clarified that\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2016\/07\/30\/does-incendiary-cloud-move-directly-away-from-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you choose its heading<\/a\n\t\t>, so you&#8217;re free to make the cloud slowly roll back and forth in the same\n\t\tsmall area if you choose to do so.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sunburst<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Imagine fireball with\n\t\tthree times the radius and it\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#blind\">blinds<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\tthe targets. The targets get a Constitution save every turn to remove the\n\t\tblindness so you can&#8217;t expect it to stay in effect for long, but the save is\n\t\tat the end of their turns so they&#8217;ll spend at least one turn blinded if they\n\t\tfail the initial save, and that may be enough to determine the outcome of\n\t\tthe encounter.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Tsunami<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This would be great if\n\t\tit didn&#8217;t take a full minute to cast.

The ability to change forms while still under\n\t\tthe effects of a single casting makes you fantastically versatile, allowing\n\t\tyou to change forms to suit the situation at a moment&#8217;s notice. However, it\n\t\ttakes an action to change forms so you want to avoid doing so in combat.\n\t\tGenerally you should have a few go-to combat forms, but avoid any creature\n\t\tthat has spellcasting in its stat block, as losing the creature&#8217;s\n\t\tspellcasting will typically reduce the creature&#8217;s CR considerably. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tever unsure what to pick, pick a dragon. It&#8217;s hard to go wrong with a\n\t\thigh-CR dragon.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For more, see our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/true-polymorph-and-shapechange\/\">Practical Guide to True Polymorph and Shapechange<\/a\n\t\t\t>.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Storm of Vengeance<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: For a 9th-level spell\n\t\twith a cool name and an exciting description, this spell is terrible. The\n\t\teffects\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2016\/01\/07\/do-the-effects-of-storm-of-vengeance-stack\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">replace each other every round<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\trather than adding on top of each other, so you need to consider each effect\n\t\tindividually. The only meaningful damage is the lightning bolts in round 3,\n\t\tand notably that&#8217;s also the only damage which affects objects. I can&#8217;t guess\n\t\twhy hailstones large enough to deal as much damage as a greatsword somehow\n\t\tcan&#8217;t affect objects, but I suppose 2d6 damage to a castle for one round\n\t\tisn&#8217;t going to do more than annoy some masons. The wind and cold damage from\n\t\trounds 5 through 10 are the bulk of the spell&#8217;s effect, but the damage is\n\t\tpitiful and you can get the wind effect from other spells. The only case I\n\t\tcan think of where this spell is useful is if you want to murder a small\n\t\tcommunity of peasants in ramshackle houses at incredible distance.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">True Resurrection<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The Druid&#8217;s first and\n\t\tonly conventional way to raise the dead.

Ideally you want to rely on\n\t\tthe lowest-level available option for raising the dead because the material\n\t\tcomponents are so expensive, but the Druid doesn&#8217;t get much choice. If you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t want your friend coming back as a different race, you&#8217;ll need to drop\n\t\t25,000gp to do it or find a
