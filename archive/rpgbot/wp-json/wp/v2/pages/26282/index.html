One half grants the Sorcerer 15 total spells known from a\n\t\tfixed list. The list is generally good, but unlike other Sorcerous Origins\n\t\tthat allow the user to swap spells out, this list is static.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The second half allows the user to cast one of the 1st-level spells once\n\t\t\tper day without expending a spell slot, depending on which Moon Phase is\n\t\t\tchosen at the start of the day.. At later levels, this expands to allow\n\t\t\teach of the three 1st-level spells once each per day without expending a\n\t\t\tspell slot.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>And by which phase you choose, we mean always Full Moon and only Full\n\t\t\tMoon from levels one to five where the only thing the phase controls is\n\t\t\tthe free 1st-level spell. Because Full Moon is the shield spell and the\n\t\t\tother two spells are too situational to need a free cast each day.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 1<\/span>: One great spell, one okay\n\t\t\t\tspell, and one not great spell. All three are already on the Sorcerer\n\t\t\t\tlist as well. Still, the good spell is something most Sorcerers already\n\t\t\t\ttake so having it be available as a once per day free spell is even\n\t\t\t\tbetter.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3<\/span>: Fantastic options here. One\n\t\t\t\tgreat spell not on the Sorcerer list, and two spells ranked Green on the\n\t\t\t\tSorcerer spell breakdown.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5<\/span>: Overall rather solid. Two\n\t\t\t\tspells from outside the Sorcerer list as well as a commonly taken spell\n\t\t\t\tfor Sorcerers. While one of these spells is a bit niche, ranked Orange\n\t\t\t\ton the Wizard list even it still has occasional uses.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 7<\/span>: One dud spell ranked red on\n\t\t\t\tthe Sorcerer list is made up for by getting both a good and an okay\n\t\t\t\tspell from outside the Sorcerer list.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 9<\/span>: Continuing the trend, one\n\t\t\t\tspell from the Sorcerer list, ranked blue this time, as well as two\n\t\t\t\tspells from outside the list.

Strong boost when you can hit the extra target, but also\n\t\tnice to gain another out of class spell in a valuable damage type that&#8217;s\n\t\thard to access.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lunar Boons<\/span>: An upgrade to metamagic to\n\t\treally stretch out your spell points, as long as you prepare ahead of time\n\t\tfor the schools of magic you want to add metamagic to. Yes, because it can\n\t\tonly be used PB times per long rest, it&#8217;s at most 6 more Spell Points worth\n\t\tof metamagic at the high end, but that&#8217;s still more than other\n\t\tSorcerers.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Waxing and Waning<\/span>: This is the feature\n\t\tthat allows you to switch up your Moon Phase, changing, among other things,\n\t\twhich schools of magic the enhancement to metamagic from Lunar Boons is\n\t\tapplied to. This is also the feature that allows you to get those extra free\n\t\t1st-level spell casts from Lunar Embodiment, as mentioned above.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Lunar Empowerment<\/span>: Three passive benefits depending on which Moon Phase we&#8217;re in.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Full Moon<\/span>: Being a flashlight with\n\t\t\t\tsome extra benefits to searching for stuff is likely to be useful more\n\t\t\t\toften than not.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">New Moon<\/span>: Sneaky stealth mode for\n\t\t\t\tsneaky stealth missions.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Crescent Moon<\/span>: Resistance to multiple\n\t\t\t\tuncommon damage types.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lunar Phenomenon<\/span>: Three potent options\n\t\tthat can each be used as a bonus action once per long rest, or repeated for\n\t\t5 Sorcery points. As a great QoL feature, this can also be activated with\n\t\tthe same bonus action that changes your form via Waxing and Waning. Meaning\n\t\tyou could start in Full Moon, use Waxing and Waning to spend one Sorcery\n\t\tPoint to switch to Crescent Moon and simultaneously activate the Crescent\n\t\tMoon Lunar Phenomenon.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Full Moon<\/span>: An AoE Con save to inflict\n\t\t\t\tBlindness for a round along with some minor healing, which is very nice\n\t\t\t\tbut still the &#8220;weakest&#8221; of the three options.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">New Moon<\/span>: AoE damage and speed\n\t\t\t\treduction paired with self Invisibility for a round as a non-spell bonus\n\t\t\t\taction, so you can still cast a spell as your Action.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crescent Moon<\/span>: Duo misty step with\n\t\t\t\tfree resistance for you and your partner for a round as well.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Lunar Sorcery Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different than any other <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/\">Sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Bump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Bump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Pump<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Lunar Sorcery Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Not much different than any other <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/\">Sorcerer<\/a>, although a couple things worth noting.

The fact that Silent Image says \u201cIf a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image,\u201d as a separate sentence means that no interaction is required, you just have to know that it&#8217;s an illusion.<br>This means that not only us as the caster but, indeed, our entire party can see through it if you have told them specific things like \u201cwhen I summon a wooden crate around enemies, it will always be an illusion.\u201d The enemies won\u2019t know that, though, so you get an entire turn\u2019s worth of your party making attack rolls with advantage (because anything without enhanced sense will have the Blinded condition per the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/adventuring#VisionandLight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">basic rules<\/a> of you creating a heavily obscured area since your illusion is blocking out the light).<br>If you use it this way, it will only last until one enemy\u2019s turn, so be careful with that. On the other hand, you can always drop a fake mist wall in front of yourself and Firebolt with Advantage for an entire combat (or even several if you move it with you; remember the 10-minute duration).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Retrain Spell:<br>Chromatic Orb -&gt; Scorching Ray<br><br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Invisibility<br><br>Metamagic:<br>&#8211; Quicken Spell<br>&#8211; Extended Spell<\/td><td>Chromatic Orb needs an upgrade, so we turn it in for the biggest single-target damage spell available until Disintegrate.<br><br>Invisibility, meanwhile, is a staple for letting you or a party member do whatever they want* for an hour at a time.

This means you can Quicken one straight into a Firebolt for Advantage on the attack and get around the fact that we\u2019re a point behind on the fundamental math.<br><br>Since our reactions are probably never again going to be Shield, we take the thing we didn\u2019t try to abuse at low levels because we didn\u2019t have enough spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">Polymorph<\/a><\/td><td>Right now, we\u2019re not going to use Polymorph on ourselves because we can\u2019t turn into a <s>dire werewolf<\/s> T-rex.
