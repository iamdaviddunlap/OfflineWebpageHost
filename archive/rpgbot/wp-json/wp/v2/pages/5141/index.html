Where in 1e your save DC included the level of the spell, in Pathfinder 2e your Spell Save DC is the same for any spell that you cast (though it gets complicated if you can cast spells from multiple traditions). If you cast a 1st-level spell one turn, then a 9th-level spell the next, they will have the same save DC. Because of this change, low-level spells can remain fantastically useful at high levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Cantrips are always heightened to half your level rounded up, so they&#8217;ll match the level of the highest-level spells that you can cast. This scaling keeps Cantrips a reliable source of damage output at any level, though most spellcasters still want to rely on ranked spells when they suit the situation rather than counting on Cantrips as your only source of damage output. Because your number of Cantrips is limited, many spellcaster should try to split their options between damage and utility. A spellcaster whose only capability is damage is basically an archer with extra steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Acid Splash<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Against single targets, Produce Flame will always deal more damage\n\t\t(provided that resistances\/immunity aren&#8217;t a problem). Against multiple\n\t\tenemies where splash damage would matter, Electric Arc will deal\n\t\tconsiderably more damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Chill Touch<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: No more damage than than any other cantrip, and it&#8217;s only touch range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dancing Lights<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Great for lighting your way in dark dungeons, but as soon as combat\n\t\tbreaks out you need to have other light sources. You don&#8217;t want to waste\n\t\tactions sustaining this in the middle of a fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Daze<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Poor damage and bad scaling. You&#8217;re gambling for critical failures to\n\t\tstun the target. Against single enemies that&#8217;s a bad gamble, and doing more\n\t\tdamage to quickly eliminate the target is a better choice. Against larger\n\t\tnumbers of low-level enemies, use area damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An essential for adventurers. Someone in every party needs to know\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Electric Arc<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you can hit two targets, this will easy outdo the damage of any other\n\t\tcantrip.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ghost Sound<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good way to create a distraction.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple utility. Often essential if no one has a free hand for a\n\t\ttorch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mage Hand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Useful, but extremely limited since the text of the spell only allows it\n\t\tto carry and move unattended objects. RAW you can&#8217;t poke things, pull\n\t\tlevers, knock objects over, etc.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Message<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Prestidigitation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Neat, but not especially impactful. A great RP tool, but you can&#8217;t solve\n\t\tany serious mechanical challenges with it that couldn&#8217;t be solved my mundane\n\t\tmeans.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Produce Flame<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good single-target damage and persistent damage on a crit. You can also\n\t\tuse it as a melee attack, which is appealing for casters who occasionally\n\t\tstep into melee because you can use one cantrip both in melee and at range,\n\t\tbut if you&#8217;re worried about provoking Reactions you can use a spell that\n\t\tcalls for a saving throw instead of one that requires an attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ray of Frost<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Fine damage with excellent range. If you want a speed penalty, use\n\t\tTanglefoot instead of gambling for a critical success.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Read Aura<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: You can usually solve this with Detect Magic, which is more broadly\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: One action for +1 AC and the potentialliy to block some damage as a\n\t\tReaction. This is a great use for a spare 3rd action, and since it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tcare about your spellcasting stat it&#8217;s a great innate spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sigil<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. The best use I&#8217;ve found for this is to\n\t\tidentify imposters or to track objects that may have changed hands. Cast the\n\t\tmark invisibly on your allies and refresh it when it fades, then if there&#8217;s\n\t\tever a question you can touch the mark to reveal it. If it&#8217;s there, you\n\t\tmight be okay. If not, roll for initiative, because you&#8217;ve found an\n\t\timposter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tanglefoot<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: At 1st level, the speed penalty and the 1-round duration are not worth\n\t\tthe Actions to cast the spell in the vast majority of cases. The duration\n\t\timproves over time, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider this a go-to spell until you get\n\t\tthe 1-minute duration when you&#8217;re casting 4th-level spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Telekinetic Projectile<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good single-target damage with good scaling and you can choose from any\n\t\tof the physical damage types. Resistance to physical damage is common, so be\n\t\tsure to have another damage cantrip option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Burning Hands<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Compare 1d6 damage in a 15-foot cone to 1d4+mod damage to any two\n\t\tcreatures within 30 ft. of you. With the expected +4 ability modifier,\n\t\tElectric Loop deals 1d4+4 (avg. 6.5) damage to two creatures. You can\n\t\treasonably expect to hit two creatures with a 15-foot cone, and Burning\n\t\tHands cast at 1st level deals 2d6 damage (avg. 7). The damage gap is\n\t\tnegligible and the range gap is massive. The fact that you can even compare\n\t\tthis to a cantrip should tell you why this spell is bad.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Charm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Against a solitary target, this is close to a save-or-suck, and unless\n\t\tthe target critically succeeds on the save you may be able to cast Charm\n\t\tagain if the first attempt fails. There is no limitation on creature type as\n\t\tthere was in Pathfinder 1e, so this spell can be useful almost constantly.\n\t\tConsider expanding your language options so that you can talk to your new\n\t\tfriends, and consider investing in Diplomacy so that you can permanently\n\t\timprove the target&#8217;s attitude toward you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Color Spray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Useful early in a fight, but if you can&#8217;t get the Dazzled\/Blinded effects\n\t\tinto play early you&#8217;re not benefiting much from the spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Command<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A simple crowd-control spell with a few options. Commanding creatures to\n\t\trun away or drop what they&#8217;re holding is often the best option because it\n\t\tcan force an enemy to disarm themselves or to run out of melee (potentially\n\t\tprovoking Reactions), and the creature must then spend Actions to address\n\t\thow you&#8217;ve inconvenienced them. However, it&#8217;s a single-target spell with a\n\t\t2-Action casting time, and you can generally expect to cause 2 Actions worth\n\t\tof inconvenience if the target fails their save, which may not be a good\n\t\tenough trade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fear<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: For half the Action cost you can Demoralize a target. Demoralize will\n\t\tonly make them Frightened 1, but that leaves you with two Actions to cast a\n\t\tdifferent spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feather Fall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Any experienced player has seen a long list of situations which involved\n\t\tfalling in a dangerous fashion. I was once in a party that leapt from low\n\t\torbit to avoid a rematch with an angry dragon, and Feather Fall turned\n\t\tcertain death into a fast elevator ride. Every party needs this spell\n\t\tavailable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grease<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good low-level area control spell, and you can also target things like\n\t\tenemy weapons to potentially cause them to drop their weapon. Even if they\n\t\tmanage to hold onto their weapon, they still suffer a -2 penalty with it for\n\t\tthe 1-minute duration of the spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Grim Tendrils<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: At low levels this is a decent AOE damage spell. With a 30-foot line you\n\t\tcan easily hit two or three targets. 2d4 damage seems low, but negative\n\t\tdamage is rarely resisted, and the persistent bleed damage can quickly\n\t\tbecome a problem for low-level creatures. Compared to Burning Hands, it will\n\t\tbe easier to hit more than two targets and with just two rounds of\n\t\tpersistent Bleed damage you&#8217;ll roughly match the single-target damage of\n\t\tBurning Hands. Of course, you still need to compare this to Electric Arc,\n\t\twhich can target two targets and will deal better initial damage without the\n\t\tdifficulty of positioning yourself to have two or more targets in a line\n\t\tfrom your space.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gust of Wind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you just want to knock targets prone, use Grease. Gust of Wind is\n\t\tsituationally useful when enemies rely on smoke or fog, and when you&#8217;re\n\t\tfacing flying foes. Knocking a flying foe prone causes them to fall,\n\t\tpotentially dealing a huge amount of damage in addition to the 2d6 from the\n\t\tCritical Failure effect. As you gain levels and flying enemies become more\n\t\tcommon, this becomes more and more important. Despite not scaling with spell\n\t\tlevel, this should be a go-to option for handling flying enemies, especially\n\t\tif not everyone in your party can fly. At low levels you can probably forgo\n\t\tthis because flying enemies are uncommon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hydraulic Push<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Despite the relatively high damage compared to other 1st-level spells,\n\t\tthis isn&#8217;t a great offensive option. 3d6 is still not much more than you&#8217;ll\n\t\tget from a cantrip at low levels. The appeal is pushing enemies away from\n\t\tyou, potentially allowing you to run away without provoking Reactions, and\n\t\tallowing you to escape grapples. Generally you should try to avoid those\n\t\tsituations rather than investing in a way to escape them, but it&#8217;s good to\n\t\tknow that there&#8217;s an option when things go wrong.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusory Disguise<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: You can typically handle disguises with the Deception skill, but if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not proficient in Deception, it may be more convenient to learn a\n\t\tsingle spell, and since you add your level to the Deception check with this\n\t\tyou effectively match having Expert proficiency if you&#8217;re not already\n\t\tproficient. If you&#8217;re already proficient, this is effectively a +4 status\n\t\tbonus to Deception, which is hard to beat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Object<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: In many cases, an illusory object is as good as a real one. Hiding being\n\t\tan illusory wall is often just as good as hiding behind a real one,\n\t\tespecially if an enemy doesn&#8217;t know to Seek nearby, and even then the rules\n\t\tfor disbelieving illusions require creatures to make a Perception check to\n\t\tDisbelieve the spell before they can see through it even partially.\n\t\t<p>You can easily use this in combat to block line of sight, to create\n\t\t\tplaces to hide, and possibly to isolate enemies for several rounds. But\n\t\t\tfair warning: you and your allies are not immune to your illusions. Even\n\t\t\tif you know that an effect is an illusion, you still need to Disbelieve it\n\t\t\tto see through it.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The duration is long enough to let you do all sorts of useful stuff, and\n\t\t\tif you prepare it at higher levels the spell can be permanent.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Item Facade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational, but I just know that there are players out there who\n\t\tare going to cast this on looted items to try to get more gold when they\n\t\tsell it. As a GM, remember that when creatures interact with the affected\n\t\titem they can attempt to Disbelieve the effect, and if word gets out that\n\t\tthe players are trying to swindle people with this spell the players might\n\t\thave trouble trading with people who know their reputation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jump<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but it still makes both the Quick Jump feat and the Powerful\n\t\tLeap feat largely obsolete unless you&#8217;re building to jump almost every\n\t\tround. For spellcasters, this stops being interesting as soon as magical\n\t\tflight becomes convenient.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longstrider<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good bonus with a good duration, and upcasting it to 2nd level gets you 8 hours, which is easily enough to get through a full adventuring day. The speed bonus is very helpful for melee-only characters,\nso put this on your party&#8217;s front line and on characters like mounts who need to move around the battlefield\na lot to be effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you fight unarmored, Mage Armor will replace the benefits of a\n\t\twell-enhanced Explorer&#8217;s Outfit at the cost of a single spell slot. Sure,\n\t\tspell slots are valuable, but the amount of gold you save will be\n\t\tconsiderable. You need to cast higher-level versions of the spell to get the\n\t\tincreasing benefits, so I recommend using your second-highest level spell\n\t\tslot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Missile<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Reliable and flexible, Magic Missile has several great things going for\n\t\tit. First, it never misses, so it&#8217;s a great option when facing foes with\n\t\thigh defenses. Magic Missile deals Force damage, which very few creatures\n\t\tare resistant to. 120 ft. range is plenty to keep you well out of harm&#8217;s\n\t\tway. And finally, you can choose to cast it with 1, 2, or 3 Actions to\n\t\tincrease the effects at the expense of your time. Spending more Actions will\n\t\tget more effect out of the spell, so it&#8217;s a more efficient use of your spell\n\t\tslots, but if you need to move or cast another spell in the same turn you\n\t\tcan still get some damage out of Magic Missile.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Weapon<\/a>: This won&#8217;t remain useful beyond\n\t\tlow levels, but at levels 1 through 4, this is the best weapon you can get.\n\t\tIt only lasts one minute, but if you cast this on the biggest weapon in the\n\t\tparty (ideally something like a greataxe), you can get a ton of extra damage\n\t\toutput for the spell&#8217;s duration. If you can, cast this before you jump into\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-red\">Mending<\/a>: Tempting if you like to use shields, but\n\t\tthe Repair activity is more effective, doesn&#8217;t require a spell slot, and\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t have a Bulk limitation. You could save this for days when you&#8217;re not\n\t\tadventuring, but even then proficiency in Craft is easy to get and just as\n\t\tgood.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pest Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only useful for scouting and similar non-combat activities. Be sure that\n\t\tyou&#8217;re proficient in Stealth, because if you&#8217;re caught in this form and\n\t\tattacked you&#8217;re likely to die almost immedioately.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ray of Enfeeblement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: You must make a successful attack roll <em>and<\/em> the target gets a\n\t\tsaving throw. This is too unreliable, though making a target Enfeebled for a\n\t\tfull minute can be a serious debuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shocking Grasp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: High damage for a single-target 1st-level spell, especially with the\n\t\tpersistent damage, but unless the target is wearing metal armor or is made\n\t\tof metal it&#8217;s not worth the spell slot. Touch range is also frequently a\n\t\tproblem for spellcasters like the Wizard who typically have poor defenses\n\t\tand may have trouble delivering offensive touch spells safely.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleep<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Despite being heavily weakened compared to Pathfinder 1e, Sleep is still\n\t\ta good spell, but you need to reconsider how you use it. Its effects no\n\t\tlonger depend on the targets&#8217; hit points, and work on a normal saving throw\n\t\tmore like other spells. The area of effect is small, so rather than clearing\n\t\twhole encounters by putting them to sleep you may need to target a few\n\t\tcreatures that are clustered together, then either sneak past them or\n\t\teliminate them without drawing the attention of other nearby creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spider Sting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This spell is not written in a way that&#8217;s easy to understand, so I&#8217;ll\n\t\twalk you through how it works. First, it&#8217;s Touch range so you typically need\n\t\tto get into melee range to deliver it. Second, you need to hit with a melee\n\t\tspell attack to deliver the spell. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing\n\t\tdamage, then makes a Fortitude save. Even on a success the target still\n\t\ttakes 1d4 poison damage, but if they fail they become afflicted with Spider\n\t\tVenom (the effects are detailed at the bottom of the spell&#8217;s description).\n\t\tBe sure to read the Affliction rules on pages 457 and 458 of the core\n\t\trulebook, especially the Affliction Example sidebar on page 458. With that\n\t\tin mind, the maximum duration of Spider Venom is just 4 rounds, so if you&#8217;re\n\t\tvery lucky (or if your target isn&#8217;t), they might take as much as 4d4 poison\n\t\tdamage and be Enfeebled for the duration of the effect. All told, Spider\n\t\tVenom is a great introduction to Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s Affliction mechanics, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s unreliable because the target has so many opportunities to resist or\n\t\tremove the effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Summon Animal<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 3 Actions is a big Action cost, and with just a 1-minute duration you\n\t\ttypically want to cast this at the beginning of combat to maximize the\n\t\tbenefits.\n\t\t<p>Your summon options run most of the level range, but as you get into high\n\t\t\tlevels you&#8217;ll run short on animal options, so plan to switch to other\n\t\t\tsummon spells.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Summoning spells are worthy of their own article because the options are\n\t\t\ttoo numerous to detail in any other format, but generally you&#8217;ll summon a\n\t\t\tcreature to fight alongside your allies in melee, both drawing attention\n\t\t\tfrom your enemies and hopefully dealing a bit of damage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Summon Construct<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Mostly the same as Summon Animal, but constructs offer different\n\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: While it won&#8217;t be especially helpful at low levels when your spell slots\n\t\tare extremely limited, this is a great option at higher levels. The 1-Action\n\t\tcasting time allows you to cast this before casting another spell,\n\t\tdramatically improving the reliability of higher-level spells which require\n\t\tattack rolls like Disintegrate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Unseen Servant<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The servant can perform Interact Actions, so it may be able to do things\n\t\tlike triggering traps, activating magic items, administering potions to\n\t\tallies, etc., but the spell is Sustained so you&#8217;re still committing an\n\t\tAction every round to get an extra set of hands. Unfortunately, unlike\n\t\tPathfinder 1e you can&#8217;t simply issue commands to your servant and take a nap\n\t\twhile they mop your floors or something.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\">Ventriloquism<\/a>: Situational, and anyone who\n\t\thears the effect automatically gets a save to notice the illusion.

It doesn&#8217;t require you\n\t\tto Sustain the spell like Flaming Sphere, but it will likely deal less\n\t\tdamage in total for the same spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blur<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Effective at any level, this gives the target a 20% chance for any attack\n\t\tdirected at them to miss. Against foes with high attack bonuses, this is a\n\t\thelpful defensive option even for characters with high AC because it\n\t\tprovides an additional layer of defense. For characters with low AC you may\n\t\twant to look for more reliable options.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\">Comprehend Languages<\/a>: Technically situational,\n\t\tbut meeting a creature with which you don&#8217;t share a language is common. The\n\t\twording of the spell is specific enough that you can cast this on your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Face while they&#8217;re actively hearing a language which they don&#8217;t\n\t\tknow, and they&#8217;ll gain the ability to understand that language.\n\t\tUnfortunately you can&#8217;t grant the ability to also speak the language unless\n\t\tyou cast this at 3rd level, but if the speaker isn&#8217;t hostile you can always\n\t\tcast this twice so that your Face and the other creature can understand each\n\t\tother despite not speaking the same language<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Continual Flame<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A permanent magical light source for 6gp and whatever it costs you to\n\t\tlearn the spell. If you use a Spell Repertoire, don&#8217;t bother learning this.\n\t\tIf you can, find an NPC spellcaster to cast this for you or buy an\n\t\tEverburning Torch for 15gp. You have the option to cast Continual Flame at\n\t\thigher spell levels, but the spell itself doesn&#8217;t offer any specific\n\t\tbenefits for doing so. As far as I can tell, the only benefit is for the\n\t\tlight to remain in effect in an area of magical darkness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Darkness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is the most clearly-written version of this spell that I&#8217;ve seen\n\t\tacross several editions of DnD and both editions of Pathfinder, but it is\n\t\tstill very nuanced. The base version of the spell allows Darkvision to\n\t\tcontinue functioning, which means that if your party has Darkvision and your\n\t\tenemies do not, casting this will provide your party with a significant\n\t\ttactical advantage. The 4th-level heightened version of the spell also\n\t\tinhibits Darkvision, but weirdly that&#8217;s only appealing compared to the base\n\t\t2nd-level version if your enemies have Darkvision and you do not because it\n\t\tinhibits everyone equally. However, the Darkness spell is by no means an\n\t\tunassailable way to darken the battlefield at your convenience: Darkness\n\t\tsuppresses magical light of Darkness&#8217;s level or lower, but due to cantrips\n\t\tbeing automatically heightened, even the Light cantrip can easily override\n\t\tDarkness unless Darkness is heightened. This allows players to easily\n\t\tcounter magical Darkness, but remember that your enemies can do the\n\t\tsame.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Darkvision<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you or one of your allies don&#8217;t have Darkvision, this can be an\n\t\timportant option. Sources of magical light are typically less costly, but\n\t\tthey also give away your position which can be a problem when you&#8217;re trying\n\t\tto sneak around unnoticed. You can purchase a pair of Goggles of Night for\n\t\t150 gp, but that might be a prohibitively high cost for several levels after\n\t\tthe Darkvision spell becomes an option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deafened<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, and nearly never useful in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An absolutely essential option. While it&#8217;s not spelled out in the spell&#8217;s\n\t\tdescription, the Counteract rules make the level at which you cast this very\n\t\timportant. On a Critical Success you can dispel effects up to three levels\n\t\thigher than the level at which you cast Dispel Magic and on a Success up to\n\t\tone level higher. On a failure you can still dispel effects of a lower\n\t\tlevel, so upcasting Dispel Magic can be a powerful way to strip enemies of\n\t\tproblematic buffs or to disarm them of magic items like weapons which might\n\t\tdramatically boost their damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Improved reach, a little bit of extra damage, and a nice 5-minute\n\t\tduration so it&#8217;s sure to last through all but the most absurdly-long fights.\n\t\tThe fact that the spell raises a creature directly to Large size also means\n\t\tthat you can cast it on small creatures like halflings and they still get\n\t\tthe full benefits in combat, but it also means that you can cast it on tiny\n\t\tcreatures like a familiar and potentially ride them. While the effects of\n\t\tthe spell improve with spell level, the 2nd-level version of the spell is\n\t\tstill a significant advantage for your melee allies, especially if they have\n\t\tReaction options like Attack of Opportunity, so you can count on a 2nd-level\n\t\tspell to provide a significant tactical advantage even at high levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">False Life<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: With an 8-hour duration you can make this a staple buff which you cast\n\t\tevery day. The additional temporary Hit Points are roughly as much as you\n\t\twould get from an additional level, especially if your spellcasting ability\n\t\tmodifier is good. If you&#8217;re generous, you might cast this on one or more of\n\t\tyour allies, especially front-line allies who are likely to draw a lot of\n\t\tattacks. Unfortunately, the scaling on the spell isn&#8217;t great, so I recommend\n\t\tonly casting False Life as a 2nd-level spell where your spellcasting ability\n\t\tmodifier is the largest portion of the total number of temporary Hit\n\t\tPoints.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flaming Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: At low levels this is a great way to get a lot of damage out of a single\n\t\tspell slot. Cast this early in a fight, Sustain it through the fight, and\n\t\tbetween Flaming Sphere and cantrips you can do plenty of damage with very\n\t\tlittle expense. Unfortunately, the fact that the sphere is stuck on the\n\t\tground severely limits its usefulness as flight becomes more common, and the\n\t\t30-foot range requires you to stay close enough that most foes will be able\n\t\tto walk into melee with you using a single Stride.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Glitterdust<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good low-level option for countering invisibility, even on a successful\n\t\tsave targets still have their invisibility negated for 2 rounds.\n\t\tUnfortunately, negating invisibility in this way still leaves the target\n\t\tConcealed, which provides a 20% miss chance on attacks against that creature\n\t\t(DC 5 flat check). You can more easily target the creature with AOE effects\n\t\tor effects which require you to see the target, but try to avoid attacking\n\t\tthe target if you can.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hideous Laughter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: In a fight against single enemies this is a great option for a low-level\n\t\tspell. Making the target Slowed 1 robs them of a single Action per turn. If\n\t\tyou outnumber the target, that puts them at a massive disadvantage in the\n\t\taction economy, allowing your party to more easily overcome them by sheer\n\t\tnumbers, and since Hideous Laughter doesn&#8217;t have the Incapacitation trait it\n\t\tremains effective against difficult enemies. Denying the target Reactions\n\t\talso means that if you&#8217;re stuck in melee with them you can cast this then\n\t\tsafely run away without suffering an Attack of Opportunity from creatures\n\t\twhich can have the ability to make that Reaction. Even at high levels, this\n\t\tis a fine option because Slowed never stops being effective, and if you gain\n\t\tan ability which allows you to Sustain a spell without spending an Action\n\t\tyou can tip the scales of the action economy further in your favor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Humanoid Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This provides very few benefits, the biggest of which is a bonus to\n\t\tDeception checks to disguise yourself. If you need magical assistance with a\n\t\tdisguise, Illusory-Disguise will be more effective and it&#8217;s a spell level\n\t\tlower.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Illusory Creature<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The closest thing you&#8217;ll get to summoning a creature with an illusion,\n\t\tIllusory Creature is a complicated spell. The spell&#8217;s description is nearly\n\t\tan entire column in the Core Rulebook, so there is a lot of text to digest.\n\t\tGenerally this isn&#8217;t a go-to combat option because the damage is poor and\n\t\tthe damage dealt will be halved if the illusion is disbelieved, but there is\n\t\ta common and important case where this can be helpful offensively: if your\n\t\tenemy has a damage weakness, you can alter the form of your illusory\n\t\tcreature to deal that damage type, dramatically boosting the amount of\n\t\tdamage which your illusion can deal. The illusion&#8217;s stats are decent, and\n\t\twith two Actions per round it can hopefully make a few strikes before\n\t\tsomething gets through the illusion&#8217;s AC. Tragically, the illusion is\n\t\tdispelled if it&#8217;s hit even once or fails a single save the spell ends\n\t\timmediately, potentially ending before you get to Sustain the spell even\n\t\tonce.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Absolutely essential, invisibility can solve a lot of problems. The spell\n\t\tends if you perform a &#8220;hostile action&#8221;, and while that&#8217;s not explicitly\n\t\tdefined it likely includes anything which requires an attack roll or which\n\t\taffects another creature in a harmful way even if it doesn&#8217;t require an\n\t\tattack roll or saving throw. It&#8217;s unclear what happens if you do something\n\t\tlike cast Wall of Fire while invisible, so check with your GM. Generally you\n\t\tcan get away with being invisible in combat while doing things like casting\n\t\tbuff spells and area control spells, but I don&#8217;t know if commanding pets or\n\t\tsummoned creatures to attack counts as a &#8220;hostile action&#8221;. The 4th-level\n\t\tversion of the spell reduces the duration but allows you to make hostile\n\t\tactions without breaking the spell, so you can spend a minute invisibly\n\t\tblaster your enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knock<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Don&#8217;t have anyone in the party with Thievery? Cast this to open locks.\n\t\tThe total bonus matches Expert proficiency.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mirror Image<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A decent defensive buff that works at any level, but the fact that even a\n\t\tfailed attack can still destroy one of the images means that the images will\n\t\tdisappear almost immediately if even a small number of weak foes focus their\n\t\tattacks on you for a round or two.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Misdirection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational. You want the secondary creature to have the aura you want.\n\t\tIf you&#8217;re an evil character and you want to pass unnoticed despite someone\n\t\tcasting Detect Alignment, choose something like an animal with a neutral\n\t\talignment.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Obscuring Mist<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Concealed offers a miss chance on attacks, so this can be a passable way\n\t\tto defend yourself from enemies if you&#8217;re being targeted by a lot of attacks\n\t\tor something along those lines. Weirdly, the spell doesn&#8217;t inhibit line of\n\t\tsight in any way unless the target and\/or the attacker are within the area.\n\t\tYou can&#8217;t use this to obscure objects, or to keep enemies from seeing down a\n\t\tlong hallway. Honestly, it feels like the spell is missing half of its\n\t\teffects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantom Steed<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: With an 8-hour duration, this is a great option for overland travel.\n\t\tHowever, until you can cast it as at 4th level or higher there&#8217;s little\n\t\treason to cast this instead of buying a horse. Be cautious about bringing\n\t\tthe mount into combat: it&#8217;s frail and will die if an enemy makes any effort\n\t\tto kill it, and its defensive stats never improve beyond 20 AC and 10 hit\n\t\tpoints.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resist Energy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple defensive option. 10 minutes is long enough to get you through a\n\t\tfight or two, and as you gain levels and additional spell slots you can\n\t\tafford to cast this on multiple allies or to give more than one type of\n\t\tdamage resistance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple option for handling invisibility. At high levels casting the\n\t\tspell at 5th level will be a common daily occurrence so that you&#8217;re always\n\t\tready to face invisible enemies. The creatures and objects are still\n\t\tConcealed, but that won&#8217;t protect them from Fireball.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shrink<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational. The target needs to be willing, so realistically you&#8217;re only\n\t\tgoing to use this when you need to hide an ally or carry them around or\n\t\tsomething. You could shrink the target to allow them to fit into small\n\t\tspaces or to spy on other creatures, but those situations are rare and can\n\t\tbe handled by other spells most of the time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spectral Hand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Measuring the opportunity cost here is difficult. You have three go-to\n\t\toptions for extending the range of touch spells: Familiars, Reach Spell, and\n\t\tthis. Familiars and Reach Spell both cost a feat (expensive) and an Action\n\t\tto use them. You&#8217;re also going to get less range from either than you would\n\t\tfrom Spectral Hand. However, Spectral Hand costs two Actions up front that\n\t\tyou may not be able to afford early in a fight when they matter most, and\n\t\tthe hand can only reach creatures by crawling on the ground (no climbing,\n\t\tjumping, etc.) and it&#8217;s very easy to destroy.\n\t\t<p>I think if you&#8217;re taking this and you&#8217;re not built to fight in melee,\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re over-using touch spells. That may be the character you want to\n\t\t\tplay, in which case this is a great feat. But for most arcane\n\t\t\tspellcasters, you need to have options that work from a safe distance.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spider Climb<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The next best thing to flight. It also notably doesn&#8217;t require an Action\n\t\tto sustain, so in combat it may be more effective than flight because it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t cut into the target&#8217;s action economy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Elemental<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 3 Actions is a big Action cost, and with just a 1-minute duration you\n\t\ttypically want to cast this at the beginning of combat to maximize the\n\t\tbenefits.\n\t\t<p>Your summon options run most of the level range, and elementals are\n\t\t\tversatile, unique, and often very powerful. With 2nd-level slots you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\tmostly summon mephits, but things get weird as you increase the spell\n\t\t\tlevel and can summon things like living tornadoes and tsunami\n\t\t\telementals.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Summoning spells are worthy of their own article because the options are\n\t\t\ttoo numerous to detail in any other format, but generally you&#8217;ll summon a\n\t\t\tcreature to fight alongside your allies in melee, both drawing attention\n\t\t\tfrom your enemies and hopefully dealing a bit of damage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Maneuver<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you need to Shove, Kinetic Ram will do the job better for lower cost.\n\t\tDisarm is only occasionally useful. That just leaves Trip, and you&#8217;re\n\t\tspending 2 Actions and a 2nd-level spell slot to cost the target 1 Action.\n\t\tUnless making them Prone is going to be hugely impactful, this isn&#8217;t worth\n\t\tthe slot.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch of Idiocy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design. Stupefied in any amount is a powerful debuff\n\t\tagainst spellcasters, but the Touch range is a problem for many\n\t\tspellcasters, and walking into melee to deliver this is generally a poor\n\t\tchoice for sorcerers and wizards.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Water Breathing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but when you need it there&#8217;s really no\n\t\tsubstitute. Heightening the spell increases the duration significantly, so\n\t\tif you need to spend a lot of time in and around water, expect to heighten\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Walk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Web<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The area is too small, it&#8217;s too easy to clear the webs, and the effects\n\t\tare too weak.

You need to do some metagaming to match the\n\t\tlevel of this spell to the level of the undead in question, which feels\n\t\tweird, but if you have ambitions of a skeletal entourage, you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tmuch choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent against single targets, especially enemy spellcasters who often\n\t\thave relatively poor Fortitude saves and need to be able to see to target\n\t\tmany spells (spells which simply select a number of targets, such as the\n\t\tspell Blindness, require you to be able to see the target). Unfortunately,\n\t\tBlindness has the Incapacitation trait so you can&#8217;t use it effectively on\n\t\tsmall numbers of powerful creatures that are most likely to justify\n\t\tmagically blinding them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clairaudience<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A helpful scouting tool, but very expensive for what it does.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dream Message<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. I don&#8217;t recommend this for casters with a\n\t\tSpell Repertoire because it&#8217;s just not useful often enough to justify the\n\t\tspace. It&#8217;s more likely that a friendly NPC will use this to communicate to\n\t\tthe players.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earthbind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: As a general solution for flying creatures, Gust of Wind is better. On a\n\t\tfailure, Gust of Wind will knock a flying creature prone, inflict 2d6 damage\n\t\tup front, and cause them to fall. Falling drops a creature up to 500 feet\n\t\tand potentially deals more damage based on how far the creature fell.\n\t\tEarthbind&#8217;s only advantage is that the target loses the ability to leave the\n\t\tground for a minute on a failure. That&#8217;s certainly a good advantage, but is\n\t\tit worth the difference in spell level?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enthrall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This can be a very effective option to handle crowds both in and out of\n\t\tcombat (though the GM might grant enemies a problematically high\n\t\tcircumstance bonus if you&#8217;re already in combat). In combat, you can leave\n\t\tthe rest of your party to engage with any enemies which didn&#8217;t fail their\n\t\tsave, then work through the crowd one at a time while you talk about\n\t\tuncontroversial things like how nice food is, or how sometimes the sky gets\n\t\tcloudy.\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, Enthrall also affects your allies. Your allies may be able\n\t\t\tto stack the odds in their favor by having major philosophical differences\n\t\t\twith you, but so can your enemies, so singing is generally the best\n\t\t\tchoice. If some (but not all) of your allies are affected, whoever didn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tfail their save can take a hostile action to break the effect on your\n\t\t\tallies. An unarmed attack is usually sufficient.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Feet to Fins<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design, but for how infrequently you need this and how\n\t\tshort the duration is, this is simply too expensive to justify in the vast\n\t\tmajority of cases.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fireball<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good range, a big AOE, and good damage. In a game full of nails, this is\n\t\ta popular hammer. The scaling is good, too, making Fireball a good baseline\n\t\tfor measuring the effectiveness of other spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ghostly Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design, so only bring this if you expect to encounter\n\t\tincorporeal foes like ghosts. If you expect to use this often, get Ghost\n\t\tTouch runes for your party&#8217;s weapons. If you don&#8217;t expect to encounter\n\t\tghosts, but still want to be prepared, buy a scroll.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glyph of Warding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design, but a great option for prepared casters who won&#8217;t\n\t\tbe saddled with this near-permanently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haste<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A very powerful buff for martial allies who can deal a lot of damage with\n\t\ta single Strike. Remember that while the additional Action is limited, the\n\t\ttarget&#8217;s other Actions are not, so they should spend the Action to\n\t\tStrike\/Stride before spending other Actions whenever possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hypnotic Pattern<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Decent, but complicated. The automatic Dazzled condition is great because\n\t\tit imposes a 20% miss chance, and Hypnotic Pattern applies that without a\n\t\tsave as long as creatures are in the area of effect. But the Fascinated\n\t\tcondition is the big payoff here. If you can make enemy spellcaster\n\t\tFascinated, they can&#8217;t cast spells with the Concentrate trait on anything\n\t\texcept the hypnotic pattern&#8217;s effect, which is all spells with Verbal\n\t\tcomponents, which is most spells. The Fascinated effect appears to last\n\t\tuntil the spell ends, so once enemies are affected they&#8217;re affected even if\n\t\tthey leave. This makes Hypnotic Pattern a good way to seriously debuff enemy\n\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Invisibility Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent way to explore safely, but it&#8217;s often easier to just cast\n\t\tInvisibility on your party&#8217;s Scout and have them work alone so that you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t give away your position by stomping around with your armor-clad\n\t\tfighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Levitate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is almost never better than Spider Climb, and Spider Climb is a\n\t\tspell level lower.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Bolt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Fireball is outright better in almost every situation. It&#8217;s difficult to\n\t\tcatch more than two enemies in a line, and a larger number of small dice\n\t\talways has a higher average than a small number of large dice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Locate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Not useful enough to know permanently in a spell repertoire, but for\n\t\tprepared casters this is a great solution when you need to find plot items\n\t\tor named antagonists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Meld into Stone<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and you can probably solve the same problem\n\t\twith Invisibility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mind Reading<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and situations where you will need it can\n\t\tusually wait until you can rest to prepare this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nondetection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. This is great for powerful NPCs with powerful\n\t\tenemies (like the players), but players will only benefit when facing\n\t\tenemies with divination options available. This does notably block things\n\t\tlike See Invisibility, so players that like to rely on Invisibility might\n\t\tbenefit from this. Note that this does still require a Counteract check, so\n\t\tit&#8217;s not foolproof.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Paralyze<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The best use case for Paralyze is against big singular foes, but with the\n\t\tIncapacitation trait that&#8217;s not viable. The 7th-level version of the spell\n\t\tturns this into an excellent crowd control option, but the 3rd-level version\n\t\tis at best frustrating. If you want to rob enemies of actions, Slow is the\n\t\tsame level, doesn&#8217;t allow additional saves, and doesn&#8217;t have the\n\t\tIncapacitation trait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Secret Page<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a toy for paranoid NPC wizards.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shrink Item<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent way to transport large items like wagons full of treasure.\n\t\tThe spell continues if there isn&#8217;t enough room for the item to return to\n\t\tnormal size, so putting your now coin-sized item into a small box can make\n\t\tthe spell effectively permanent. The spell doesn&#8217;t try to end itself until\n\t\tyour next daily preparations, so I&#8217;m not certain what happens if you die\n\t\twhile you have items shrunk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent debuff for large single targets at any level. This doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire you to Sustain the Spell, and with a 1-minute duration you&#8217;re\n\t\tgetting a lot of mileage out of this. Starting every boss fight with Slow is\n\t\tan extremely good idea. The 6th-level version turns this into crowd control,\n\t\tand considering that numerous enemies are scary because of their action\n\t\teconomy advantage, robbing enemies of that advantage is extremely\n\t\teffective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stinking Cloud<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good area control, this both stalls and sickens enemies in the area.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vampiric Touch<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Decent damage of a good damage type, and the temporary hit points will\n\t\thelp keep you alive after you run into melee to deliver this. This is a\n\t\tgreat option for gish characters like the Magus, but wizards should be very\n\t\tcareful about using this without Reach Spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wall of Wind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational. The best use case for this is to block low-flying\n\t\tcreatures, and there are better counters for flying enemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\ns<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aerial Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The first shapechanging spell on the Arcane spell list. It&#8217;s decent if\n\t\tyou need to fight in the air, but otherwise it won&#8217;t keep pace with other\n\t\tshapechanging spells of the same level. See our\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\/#aerial-form\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>\n\t\tfor more details and comparison to comparable spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blink<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The damage resistance is nice, but the unpredictable movement is a\n\t\tmassive problem. The spell notably doesn&#8217;t specify that you must end in an\n\t\tunoccupied space or that the random direction must be horizontal or anything\n\t\telse helpful, so your GM is free to determine that randomly appear 10 feet\n\t\tinto the air and take falling damage, or worse, you reappear 10 feet\n\t\tunderground.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clairvoyance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to scout potentially dangerous locations, but upgrade to\n\t\tPrying Eye as soon as possible since Clairvoyance is immobile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Confusion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Pick the biggest enemy in a multi-enemy fight and make them everyone&#8217;s\n\t\tproblem. Confusion is intentionally unpredictable, which always makes me\n\t\tnervous, but of every edition of DnD and Pathfinder I&#8217;ve played, this is the\n\t\tonly one that I didn&#8217;t think was absolutely worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Creation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great utility, but you need to be able to think on your feet to make it\n\t\tactually useful. Limited only by your creativity and the limitations on\n\t\tmaterial. Easy uses include creating temporary tools (ladders, poles, etc.),\n\t\tequipment (shields), and obstacles. If you run out of ideas, a 5-foot cube\n\t\tof solid wood can hold a door shut or you can drop it on a creature.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Scrying<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A tool for paranoid NPC wizards.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dimension Door<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to get out of danger. The heightened version can get you all\n\t\tthe way out of a dungeon.<\/li>\n<li\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dimensional Anchor<\/span\n\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup\n\t>: A great counter counter to enemy spellcasters who might teleport to safety.\n\tThe target does get a save, but even on a Success the spell still works for a\n\tfull minute. There is still a Counteract check involved, so this isn&#8217;t\n\tfoolproof.<\/li\n>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Discern Lies<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Massively helpful in social situations, but not useful often enough to\n\t\tjustify learning it permanently in Spell Repertoire unless your campaign is\n\t\theavily focused on intrigue and social situations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A decent buff for gish characters, but the duration is short, so it&#8217;s\n\t\thard to cast before walking into combat, and the damage is poor and slow\n\t\tcompared to casting a damage spell with the same spell slot unless you&#8217;re\n\t\ttaking a large number of small hits.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fly<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Flight of some kind is a tactical essential, and this spell is among the\n\t\tmost consistently accessible options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Freedom of Movement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. The duration is long enough that you could\n\t\tpre-cast it before going into an encounter, but you would need to know that\n\t\tyou&#8217;re facing something that likes to immobilize\/grapple\/restrain you ahead\n\t\tof time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gaseous Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Maybe a good way to sneak in or out of somewhere, but the 5-minute\n\t\tduration is painfully short, and you&#8217;re still visible. I think you still\n\t\tkeep your base speed, which is great because the 10-foot fly speed won&#8217;t get\n\t\tyou anywhere in a hurry.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Globe of Invulnerability<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: At a glance, this is a great defense against enemy spellcasters, allowing\n\t\tyou to safely cast spells outward while being protected from spells\n\t\ttargeting anyone inside the sphere (you, for the most part). But it&#8217;s not\n\t\tportable, so it&#8217;s really only useful if you&#8217;re comfortable standing still\n\t\tfor the rest of the encounter.\n\t\t<p>The fact that the globe is a 10-foot burst (so it&#8217;s a sphere 20 feet\n\t\t\tacross) and can&#8217;t be broken by things like walls or floors is a\n\t\t\tsurprisingly major problem. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to use in close quarters\n\t\t\tlike a dungeon, and if you&#8217;re on the ground, only a 10&#215;10 group of squares\n\t\t\tis close enough to the ground to be considered inside the sphere. The rest\n\t\t\tof the sphere floats uselessly above you.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hallucinatory Terrain<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nightmare<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to mildly inconvenience the BBEG once you know their name.\n\t\tKeep them tired and annoyed, and then go attack them while they&#8217;re\n\t\tdebuffed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Outcast&#8217;s Curse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but if you want to ruin someone&#8217;s life without\n\t\tending it, I can&#8217;t think of a better option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantasmal Killer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The damage isn&#8217;t great (a 4th-level Fireball does the same amount of\n\t\tdamage), and while Frightened is a great debuff I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s enough to\n\t\tmake up the difference. You&#8217;re really gambling on the Critical Failure (which\n\t\thas the Incapacitation trait, which is a profoundly weird way to format the\n\t\tspell) on the initial Will save, and means that the exciting part of the\n\t\tspell literally isn&#8217;t applicable against targets worth casting this\n\t\tupon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Private Sanctum<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: I think this is intended to provide a safe place to rest without being\n\t\tspied upon, but a sphere 200 feet across that looks like black fog is hardly\n\t\tsubtle, and nothing prevents creatures from walking right in. Cast Rope\n\t\tTrick instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resilient Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: At this level, the pool of hit points won&#8217;t last long. Robbing enemies of\n\t\tactions with spells like Slow will be much more effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rope Trick<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Your first magical resting place, Rope Trick gives you a nondescript\n\t\textradimensional space in which to safely rest for the night. Unfortunately,\n\t\tthe rope can&#8217;t be removed or hidden, which dramatically reduces the spell&#8217;s\n\t\teffectiveness. Plan to use enough rope to get well off the ground, then haul\n\t\tthe rope up and knot it so that it can&#8217;t be easily reached from the\n\t\tground.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shape Stone<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A fantastic utility. A whole lot of things are made of stone, and this\n\t\tmakes them as pliable as soft clay. This notably doesn&#8217;t specify that the\n\t\tstone must be natural or unworked, so you&#8217;re free to absolutely wreck stone\n\t\tstructures, make yourself a nice hallway, ruin sculptures, and commit other\n\t\tacts of fantastic vandalism. I suppose you could also create rough\n\t\tstructures, tools, etc. out of stone, but that&#8217;s way less fun than\n\t\tmischief.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Solid Fog<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Passable, but not good enough for the spell level. Use Stinking Cloud\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell Immunity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Affects exactly one spell and still has a chance to fail because it\n\t\tinvolves a Counteract check. The 24-hour duration is generous, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tnearly impossible to guess a single spell which you&#8217;ll need to resist this\n\t\tway.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stoneskin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Use a stone body mutagen (Treasure Vault) instead. Stoneskin isn&#8217;t awful,\n\t\tit&#8217;s just obsolete.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Suggestion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A decent way to nonviolently remove problematic creatures, but you need\n\t\tto be creative and your GM needs to be willing to play along. The 1-minute\n\t\tduration for a Failure doesn&#8217;t leave you a lot of room to work, but it may\n\t\tbe enough to convince an enemy to walk out of a room, for a guard to let you\n\t\tpass, or something along those lines.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telepathy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Neat, but with only a 10-minute duration, 30-foot range, and requiring\n\t\tshared language, this isn&#8217;t especially helpful unless your whole party is\n\t\tsneaking around and trying to avoid notice. The 6th-level version is nice\n\t\tfor social situations, but Tongues is 5th-level and solves the same\n\t\tproblem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Veil<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but if you can make it work, it can be\n\t\thilarious. Imagine disguising your party as enemy soldiers and marching\n\t\tthrough enemy lines. With the 7th-level version, you can disguise your party\n\t\tas enemy officers and cause all sorts of mayhem. Those things are unlikely\n\t\tto come up, but it&#8217;s good that there&#8217;s an option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wall of Fire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Decent area control, but the damage isn&#8217;t enough to scare anything at\n\t\tthis level if it&#8217;s only going to be affected once. But if you have an ally\n\t\tthat likes to grapple, this can be very effective. The Concealed condition\n\t\twill deter creatures from attacking through it, though area of effect spells\n\t\twon&#8217;t be affected, so beware of enemy spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Storm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This basically only exists for the Magus, which is weird because it&#8217;s in\n\t\tthe Core Rulebook. You want to use a d12 weapon if possible, which is hard\n\t\tfor most magi, so in general this is just a frustrating and low-damage\n\t\tspell. Cast Fireball instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Banishment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Save-or-suck for anything from a different plane of existence. Simple,\n\t\teffective, and if you&#8217;re prepared for the specific creature(s) you can\n\t\timpose a penalty on the save. Unfortunately Banishment has the\n\t\tIncapacitation Trait, so it&#8217;s hard to use against powerful foes, and if the\n\t\ttarget rolls a Critical Success you&#8217;ll be Stunned 1 so you only want to use\n\t\tthis when you can be reasonably certain that the target will fail their\n\t\tsaving throw.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Black Tentacles<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Great area control with a duration long enough to get through a fight,\n\t\tand you don&#8217;t need to Sustain it. The damage isn&#8217;t significant, but Grabbed\n\t\tcauses all sorts of problems for the targets. For enemies who can&#8217;t fight at\n\t\trange, this can easily remove them from the fight for several turns.\n\t\tUnfortunately it doesn&#8217;t work in mid-air, and after the initial casting\n\t\ttargets need to end their turn in the effect to be affected, so it&#8217;s very\n\t\tdifficult to hit additional targets. If they do manage to escape, you and\n\t\tyour allies can always Shove them back in.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chromatic Wall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: You only get one color and you don&#8217;t get to pick which one it is. Too\n\t\tunpredictable, the effects are too weak, and the colors are all counteracted\n\t\tby extremely common spells. Casting this at 7th level adds effects that are\n\t\tactually worthwhile, but you still only have a 50% chance to actually get a\n\t\tworthwhile effect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloak of Colors<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A fantastic defense in melee at any level, but it immediately triggers\n\t\tthe <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/the-tank-fallacy\/\">Tank Fallacy<\/a>, and the\n\t\tThe blinded\/stunned effect has the Incapacitation trait so it&#8217;s not as good\n\t\tagainst high-level enemies, unfortunately.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloudkill<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The damage is decent, but the fact that the cloud moves makes this\n\t\tdifficult to use in a typical combat situation. The spell also doesn&#8217;t\n\t\taddress what happens if the spell encounters obstacles, which raises\n\t\tfrustrating questions like &#8220;can this roll through walls?&#8221; and &#8220;can I point\n\t\tthis into the sky?&#8221;<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cone of Cold<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: More damage than a fireball of the same level, but you sacrifice distance\n\t\tfor that 2d6 extra damage. A 60-foot cone is a decent AOE, but it&#8217;s still\n\t\tnot as safe as a 20-foot radius burst cast from several hundred feet\n\t\taway.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Control Water<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crushing Despair<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Similar to casting Slow at 6th level, but less reliable because targets\n\t\tcan save each turn to not spend an Action sobbing. Even on a success,\n\t\ttargets can&#8217;t make Reactions for one turn, allowing you to cast this and\n\t\tsafely Stride out of melee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Drop Dead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to get out of a bad situation. If someone in your party is in\n\t\trough shape, it may be best to turn them invisible and have them retreat to\n\t\tsafety rather than letting them fall to 0 and play hit point ping pong for\n\t\tthe rest of the encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only really useful as a combat form, and even then only two of the forms\n\t\tare good in combat.\n\t\t<p>See our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\/#elemental-form\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor more details and comparison to comparable spells.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">False Vision<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A toy for paranoid NPC wizards.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hallucination<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Surprisingly powerful since you may still be able to put this to great\n\t\teffect even if the target rolls a Success on their save, but simultaneously\n\t\tdifficult to use because there&#8217;s a ton of room for GM interpretation. For\n\t\texample: you could target an enemy (multiple enemies with higher-level spell\n\t\tslots) to make them unable to perceive your party. They could roll a Success\n\t\tand would know what the illusion was, but they still couldn&#8217;t see you and\n\t\tyour party. The creature can\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disbelieve the illusion<\/a>\n\t\tto remove the effect, but that at least buys you some time as they attempt\n\t\tto Seek, potentially multiple times if they fail to disbelieve. There is a\n\t\tlot of room for more clever uses than that, but making yourself invisibwole\n\t\tto the target(s) is a great example of how to use Hallucination.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Illusory Scene<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but a clever player can put this to great\n\t\teffect given time to make it work.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mariner&#8217;s Curse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: In the vast majority of games, the effect is to make the target\n\t\tpermanently Sickened 1 (even on a Critical Success, the target can spend an\n\t\tAction to reduce it to Sickened 1). Sickened is a good debuff, but probably\n\t\tnot good enough in a combat situation to justify such a high-level spell\n\t\tslot. This doesn&#8217;t have the Incapacitation trait, which makes it appealing\n\t\tagainst high-level foes, but unless you&#8217;re anticipating a very long fight\n\t\tthis isn&#8217;t worth the spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mind Probe<\/span> (Uncommon): Only\n\t\tsituationally useful, but it&#8217;s hard to think of a better, more direct way to\n\t\tinterrogate a creature. I wouldn&#8217;t take this in a spell repertoire, but it&#8217;s\n\t\toccasionally useful for prepared spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Passwall<\/span> (Uncommon): Most stone walls in\n\t\tstructures aren&#8217;t ten feet thick, so this is an easy way to get in and out\n\t\tof somewhere without worrying about things like traps and guards.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prying Eye<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An exceptionally powerful scouting option, Prying Eye allows you to scout\n\t\tdangerous areas from a safe distance, and the eye&#8217;s small size can often\n\t\tslip it through obstacles by sneaking under doors or through cracked\n\t\twindows. The duration doesn&#8217;t expire until you fail to Sustain the spell, so\n\t\tgiven enough time you can send the eye great distances and scout huge areas.\n\t\tThe biggest limitation is that the eye uses your normal senses, so be sure\n\t\tthat you have Low-Light Vision and\/or Darkvision so that you can send the\n\t\teye into dark places and still see.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sending<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and extremely expensive for how limited the\n\t\tfunction is. Teleport is one spell level higher and you can go have a full\n\t\tconversation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shadow Siphon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A bit like Counterspell, but it doesn&#8217;t require you to know the spell\n\t\tthat you&#8217;re countering. This could be useful once you&#8217;ve added a few levels\n\t\tand can use this to Counteract higher-level damage spells to mitigate their\n\t\teffects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Walk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent solution for long-distance travel, you effectively move 20\n\t\ttimes your normal travel speed. Combined with decent mounts (ideally flying\n\t\tones) your party can cover huge distances very quickly without resorting to\n\t\thigher-level (and potentially more dangerous) options like Teleport. The\n\t\tspell does specify that you may encounter denizens of the shadow plane, so\n\t\tbe prepared to have your party members end the spell early (which might be\n\t\thard for party members like animal companions or mundane mounts) if things\n\t\tget scary.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Subconscious Suggestion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially very powerful, but it requires you to really think about how\n\t\tto apply it in any given situation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Dragon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Powerful, versatile, and good scaling because there are summon options\n\t\tall the way up to the 9th-level spells. A good choice for a Signature\n\t\tSpell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Haul<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This only works on objects, so it&#8217;s only situationally useful. You might\n\t\tuse this to drop heavy objects on your enemies, but more likely you&#8217;re only going\n\t\tto use it to move heavy obstacles outside of combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Telepathic Bond<\/span> (Uncommon): Consistently\n\t\tuseful in any situation where the party needs to separate or where subtlety\n\t\tis required.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tongues<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple option for overcoming language barriers, but at such high level\n\t\tthis is an expensive way to solve the problem. Of course, it&#8217;s likely less\n\t\texpensive than spending several feats on Multilingual.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wall of Ice<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Mostly just a worse version of Wall of Stone, Wall of Ice has lower\n\t\thardness, less hit points, and can&#8217;t be shaped as freely. Wall of Ice&#8217;s\n\t\tunique selling point is that it can form a hemisphere, enclosing one or more\n\t\tcreatures inside it with no save. You could use this to isolate an enemy, or\n\t\tto protect the party while you heal and buff yourselves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Stone<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good area control. Split an encounter neatly in half and eliminate a few\n\t\tfoes before the rest can rejoin the fight. 50 hit points with 14 Hardness is\n\t\textremely durable even at this level. Be sure to place the wall slightly out\n\t\tof reach to maximize how many actions enemies need to waste to reach it and\n\t\tcarve their way through. The wall is also permanent and shapeable, allowing\n\t\tyou to sculpt it around squares and do things like creating stairs, so Wall\n\t\tof Stone serves double duty as a utility spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Baleful Polymorph<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The effect is fine, but on a Failure the target can re-attempt their\n\t\tsaving throw every turn, and with the Incapacitation trait this is\n\t\tborderline useless against powerful foes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chain Lightning<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent direct damage option, Chain Lighting easily exceeds the\n\t\tdamage of a Fireball of the same level, conveniently doesn&#8217;t have to worry\n\t\tabout friendly fire, and has a theoretically infinite number of targets.\n\t\tHowever, the chain ends if one target critically succeeds on their save,\n\t\twhich means that each target must roll their save before you pick the next\n\t\ttarget, which is going to make casting this spell take a horrifically long\n\t\tamount of real-world time to resolve.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Collective Transportation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent control option, and definitely worth making a Signature\n\t\tSpell. You can use this to get yourself and your allies out of grapples, to\n\t\tput melee allies within reach of enemies so that they don&#8217;t need to spend\n\t\tActions to Step or Stride, and to reposition enemies into dangerous places\n\t\tlike ongoing area effects, traps, or next to melee allies. The spell doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tspecify that the spaces need to be safe or hospitable, so you may be able to\n\t\tplace enemies in mid-air or underwater, causing them additional\n\t\tinconvenience beyond simply putting them somewhere that they don&#8217;t want to\n\t\tbe.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disintegrate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good single-target damage with good scaling, but it has two points of\n\t\tfailure, so even if you hit your target may still only take partial damage.\n\t\tOf course, it&#8217;s a Basic Save so it&#8217;s equally likely that you&#8217;ll score a\n\t\tregular hit and still deal double normal damage. This also doubles as a\n\t\tutility option, allowing you to disintegrate problematic objects like walls\n\t\tor structurally-important columns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dominate<\/span> (Uncommon): Extremely powerful,\n\t\tbut possibly very short duration. If you can, debuff the target&#8217;s saves\n\t\tbefore you hit them with this using status conditions (frightened, sickened,\n\t\tstupefied) and try really hard to force the Critical Failure.\n\t\t<p>Upcasting this to 10th level makes the duration indefinite, which is a\n\t\t\tterrifying implication. So long as you never command the creature to act\n\t\t\tcontrary to its nature, it might spend the rest of its life dominated.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dragon Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: One of the best polymorph spells, Dragon Form has good unarmed attacks,\n\t\tgood fly speed, and a breath weapon. If you have the hit points to stand up\n\t\tin combat (magus yes, wizard probably no), this is a great option in combat.\n\t\t<p>See our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\/#elemental-form\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor more details and comparison to comparable spells.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Feeblemind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Save-or-suck for spellcasters. This is situational by design, but\n\t\tspellcasters are common enough and powerful enough that this might still see\n\t\tsome use. The effects are excellent, and despite having the Incapacitation\n\t\ttrait, hoping for a standard Failure is enough to massively inhibit powerful\n\t\tenemy spellcasters. Against non-spellcasters, the critical failure effect is\n\t\tstill a significant debuff, but it&#8217;s hard to gamble on a critical\n\t\tfailure.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flesh to Stone<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save-or-suck with the Incapacitation trait, which makes it\n\t\textremely hard to use against strong single targets, but in encounters with\n\t\ta small number of enemies close to your level this is a decent option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mislead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great tactical option, but it can be difficult to use effectively. You\n\t\twant your actions and the actions of your duplicate to be plausible so that\n\t\tenemies won&#8217;t immediately figure out what&#8217;s going on, and keeping things\n\t\tplausible may require you to limit your spells to those which don&#8217;t have a\n\t\tvisually obvious origin point (Charm yes, Lightning Bolt no). If you move\n\t\tyour duplicate into close quarters with enemies, it might draw attention\n\t\t(and ideally attacks) away from you and your allies, allowing this spell to\n\t\tbe doubly effective as a defensive option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Phantasmal Calamity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very slightly less damage than a Fireball of the same level, but of a\n\t\tbetter damage type. The secondary effect is excellent, but only applies on a\n\t\tcritical failure against the initial Will save, so you can&#8217;t expect it to be\n\t\treliable. Still, you can use this in the same situations as Fireball and I\n\t\twould consider this a direct upgrade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Purple Worm Sting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Certainly not a fast way to kill an enemy, but Enfeebled 2 is a huge\n\t\tdebuff for Strength-based enemies, so against big single foes this can put\n\t\tyour party at a huge advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Repulsion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to keep enemies away from you and your other squishy allies,\n\t\tespecially since many creatures are wholly unable to fight at range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scrying<\/span> (Uncommon): Only situationally\n\t\tuseful, but if you can put it into use it can be a great way to spy on\n\t\timportant antagonists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellwrack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you can get this set up on a powerful enemy early in a fight, the\n\t\tdamage can add up quite a bit. But it takes 4 instances of the persistent\n\t\tdamage to match the damage of casting Chain Lightning, so the fight needs to\n\t\tbe long for this to beare useful in combat. The best-case scenario is to get this on\n\t\tan enemy outside of combat and leave it in place for later, but at that\n\t\tpoint why not just kill them and be done with it?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Teleport<\/span> (Uncommon): A staple option for\n\t\tlong-distance travel.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">True Seeing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and the fact that you could fail the secret\n\t\tCounteract check means that creatures could still make themselves invisible\n\t\tand go undetected even while you&#8217;re running True Seeing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vampiric Exsanguination<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good damage of a good type in a reasonably large area of effect, plus you\n\t\tget temporary hit points, but the range on the cone is short so frail\n\t\tcharacters like sorcerers and wizards should be cautious unless you&#8217;re also\n\t\tusing Reach Spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vibrant Pattern<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Repeatedly blind creatures in a small AOE.

Wall off part of an encounter with multiple foes,\n\t\tand suddenly the encounter gets a lot easier. The wall is big enough that\n\t\tenemies can&#8217;t quickly go around it (though they could go over it if they can\n\t\tfly), and with 30 hardness most creatures will struggle to break through\n\t\tit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7\">7th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Contingency<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Learn this and cast it at the highest level you can on any day where\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not adventuring.

You can use this offensively to try to keep\n\t\tenemies from teleporting to escape and\/or you can use this to prevent\n\t\tenemies from teleporting into whatever space you&#8217;re resting in.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Duplicate Foe<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Powerful, but frustrating in many ways. You can&#8217;t use this on an ally\n\t\t(the spell&#8217;s Target entry specifies &#8220;enemy&#8221;), but honestly that would be too\n\t\tpowerful so I understand the limitation. Since the duplicate can only Stride\n\t\tand Strike, you want to target enemies that rely on Strikes, but those\n\t\tcreatures also tend to have high Fortitude saves, which may make this\n\t\tunreliable.\n\t\t<p>If the spell does work, the level cap is generously high so you can\n\t\t\ttarget the vast majority of creatures that you face in combat. The\n\t\t\tduplicate&#8217;s stats are good enough that it&#8217;s a serious threat in combat,\n\t\t\tand since it&#8217;s not limited to attacking the target of the spell, you can\n\t\t\tcommand it to attack the target&#8217;s allies if the target of Duplicate Foe\n\t\t\twanders away.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Ideally you want the duplicate to both deal a bunch of damage and to draw\n\t\t\ta bunch of attacks which would otherwise be directed at you and your\n\t\t\tallies, so your best bet is to cast this early in a fight so that it has\n\t\t\tas much time as possible to work. Even if the target of Duplicate Foe\n\t\t\tsucceeds on its saving throw, you still get the duplicate for two rounds,\n\t\t\twhich may be enough to cause a lot of trouble for your enemies despite the\n\t\t\tduplicate dealing half damage with its strikes.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eclipse Burst<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good range, massive AOE, good damage, and on a critical failure creatures\n\t\tare permanently blinded.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Energy Aegis<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 5 points of resistance to 8 damage types, including options like Force\n\t\tDamage which are difficult to resist, and a 24-hour duration. It&#8217;s hard to\n\t\tspend such a high-level spell slot on something like this, but with a\n\t\t24-hour duration you can cast it before going to sleep, get a full night&#8217;s\n\t\tsleep, then wake up with 16 hours left on the spell&#8217;s duration. If you don&#8217;t\n\t\tneed to adventure on back-to-back days, you should strongly consider this as\n\t\tpart of your daily routine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fiery Body<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s tempting to cast this and spend the rest of the encounter doing\n\t\tnothing but casting Produce Flame, but that&#8217;s a trap. With the reduced\n\t\tcasting time and boosted damage, you could cast Produce Flame 3 times per\n\t\tturn and the Multiple Attack Penalty would become a problem. Instead, cast a\n\t\t2-Action spell like Fireball which requires a save and spend your third\n\t\tAction to cast produce Flame.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magnificent Mansion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A fine place to retire to or for a night&#8217;s rest. Unless enemies know\n\t\tabout the demiplane ahead of time or somehow discover it while you&#8217;re\n\t\tresting, you&#8217;re basically unreachable. However, this is a very expensive\n\t\tsolution to the issue of resting. Typically something like Rope Trick will\n\t\tsuffice unless you&#8217;re specifically trying to show off or feed a small horde\n\t\tof people.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mask of Terror<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Similar in concept to Sanctuary, but less fragile. The penalty for\n\t\tfailing saves is a nice touch since Frightened is such a good debuff, and\n\t\tthe ability to upcast this to 8th-level to get 5 targets means that you can\n\t\toften cast it on your whole party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plane Shift<\/span> (Uncommon): A staple travel\n\t\toption at high levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Word Blind<\/span> (Uncommon): This\n\t\trequires some metagaming to use effectively, which can be hard. But it&#8217;s\n\t\talso a single action to blind the target with no save, which can be very\n\t\tpowerful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Prismatic Spray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Unpredictable, and only half of the effects are good enough to justify\n\t\tthe spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Project Image<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, expensive, and fragile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reverse Gravity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Despite the small area, this is an easy win condition against enemies\n\t\tthat can&#8217;t fight at range and can&#8217;t fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Turning<\/span> (Uncommon): Only\n\t\tsituationally useful. If you know that you&#8217;re going to fight an enemy\n\t\tspellcaster this could be very effective, but it can be hard to get that\n\t\tinformation ahead of time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">True Target<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. Your party would need to make a series of\n\t\thigh-value attacks which were good enough to offset the cost of you casting\n\t\tthis both in terms of spell slot cost and action cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warp Mind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: I already don&#8217;t trust the Confused condition, and this is the Confusion\n\t\tspell but 3 levels higher and with the option of a permanent duration and it\n\t\thas the Incapacitation trait, so against major enemies which you would\n\t\tactually care about making permanently confused it&#8217;s actually less effective\n\t\tthan Confusion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8\">8th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Antimagic Field<\/span> (rare): Difficult to use\n\t\tto great effect with any frequency. If you&#8217;re expecting to fight a lot of\n\t\tenemy spellcasters this might be useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disappearance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Extremely durable invisibility with a 10-minute duration. This is\n\t\texcellent on frail spellcasters who want to avoid attention, and for\n\t\tcharacters like rogues who depend on foes being Flat-Footed it&#8217;s a massive\n\t\ttactical advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Discern Location<\/span> (uncommon): Only\n\t\tsituationally useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dream Council<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational. This is really cool, but it feels more like a plot\n\t\tpoint than a spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earthquake<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good crowd control option, but not always a good go-to. The fissures\n\t\tare deep enough that creatures will take a considerable amount of time to\n\t\tclimb out despite the fairly low DC, giving you time to handle any foes\n\t\twhich don&#8217;t fall into fissures, but anything that can fly or which has high\n\t\tspeed will climb right back out and get right back to fighting. The effects\n\t\tother than fissures (collapsed buildings, difficult terrain, etc.) are\n\t\tunpredictable, which makes this hard to recommend.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Horrid Wilting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is an excellent instantaneous damage option. You can target any\n\t\tnumber of creatures within the 500-foot range of the spell. The damage is\n\t\tgood, and resistance to negative damage is rare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maze<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The target doesn&#8217;t get a save against being put in the maze. You need to\n\t\tspend an Action every turn to Sustain the Spell, but one Action to remove\n\t\tthe target from combat for several rounds is frequently worth both the spell\n\t\tslot and the action cost. Maze the biggest thing in the encounter, kill\n\t\teverything else, then drop a bunch of problems into the space that the\n\t\tcreature will re-emerge into before it escapes or before you willingly end\n\t\tthe spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mind Blank<\/span> (uncommon): The primary\n\t\teffects of the spell are only situationally useful because very few\n\t\tcreatures can perform any sort of divinations, but a +4 status bonus to\n\t\tsaves against mental effects is huge. Most Will saves are against mental\n\t\teffects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monstrosity Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Not significantly better than Dragon Form unless you upcast it at level\n\t\t9, but it is still good.\n\t\t<p>See our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\/#elemental-form\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor more details and comparison to comparable spells.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Polar Ray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A bunch of damage and Drained 2, which is effectively another big pile of\n\t\tdamage. In some ways this is a linear upgrade from Disintegrate, dealing\n\t\tsimilar damage to a Disintegrate of the same level, but it relies entirely\n\t\ton the attack roll instead of also allowing a save, and you can dramatically\n\t\timprove the attack roll by casting True Strike the same turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Power Word Stun<\/span> (uncommon): Requires\n\t\tmetagaming to maximize the benefits. Spending one action to rob a creature\n\t\tof a turn is good, but for such an expensive spell slot it&#8217;s hard to justify\n\t\tagainst enemies of lower level than you. Use Paralyze instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prismatic Wall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very effective area control. Anything that knows what Prismatic Wall does\n\t\tisn&#8217;t going to walk through it, and anything that doesn&#8217;t know is going to\n\t\tbe so mangled by the wall&#8217;s effects that it will be much less threatening if\n\t\tit isn&#8217;t turned into a statue. The Dazzled\/Blinded effect is great, too, so\n\t\tyou can drop this right next to yourself to blind nearby enemies before\n\t\twalking through the wall to safety (remember that you can choose to ignore\n\t\tthe Wall&#8217;s effects).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scintillating Pattern<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Casting Confusion at the same spell level will nearly always be more\n\t\teffective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Uncontrollable Dance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Forcing the target to spend several of their Actions to \u201cdance\u201d means\n\t\tthat they&#8217;re not spending those Actions hurting you, and spending 2 Actions\n\t\tto cost your target 3 or more is a decent trade. The target also loses the\n\t\tability to Step, which may be as impactful as the Actions which they must\n\t\tspend dancing. Where this spell struggles is finding a suitable target on\n\t\twhich to use it. This is single-target with the Incapacitation trait, which\n\t\tmakes it hard to find targets who are both powerful enough to justify the\n\t\tspell slot and who are going to fail the save often enough to risk this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unrelenting Observation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. You could use this in combat to counter\n\t\tinvisibility and other means of hiding, but there are lower-level solutions\n\t\tto those problems. More likely you&#8217;ll use this to spy on important NPCs, and\n\t\tthat doesn&#8217;t happen often in a way that requires a solution like this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9\">9th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disjunction<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational. Generally you don&#8217;t want to risk permanently\n\t\tdisenchanting loot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Foresight<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent defensive buff with a great duration so you can cast it well\n\t\tahead of time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Implosion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good damage and a very efficient way to spend Actions. The single Action\n\t\tto Sustain the spell each turn is another 75 damage, and if you took the\n\t\tEffortless Concentration feat this is free damage every turn for a full\n\t\tminute or until you run out of targets. Not on the Divine spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Massacre<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a gamble. The expected outcome is 100 negative damage, which is a\n\t\tbig pile of damage. Lines are a difficult AOE so expect to hit no more than\n\t\ttwo creatures, and you generally want to kill something with the initial\n\t\tdamage rather than suffering 30 damage if you don&#8217;t, but maybe you&#8217;ll get\n\t\tlucky and the 30 damage will kill an enemy or two, in which case I would\n\t\thappily take the 30 damage rather than letting those creatures get another\n\t\tturn. The possibility that you can outright kill creatures on a Critical\n\t\tFailure is very tempting, but unless you&#8217;re hitting a bunch of creatures\n\t\tsomehow I don&#8217;t recommend making that gamble.\n\t\t<p>Because the level cap is so high, you can safely use this even with your\n\t\t\tallies in the line. However, if you fail to kill something, you and your\n\t\t\tallies are still going to take the flat 30 negative damage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Meteor Swarm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Creatures hit by both AOE&#8217;s take 82 damage on average, which isn&#8217;t going\n\t\tto one-shot high-level creatures on its own, but in multi-enemy encounters\n\t\tthat&#8217;s still a massive amount of damage to throw around, especially with\n\t\tfour meteors which you can target independently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Word Kill<\/span> (uncommon): A good way\n\t\tto quickly eliminate a foe in multi-enemy encounters, but you need to\n\t\tmetagame to know that the spell will work, and spending a 9th-level spell to\n\t\tkill an enemy 5 or more levels below you feels wasteful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prismatic Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Conceptually great, but very difficult to place. Creatures on the ground\n\t\twill break the surface of the wall and negate the spell, so you can only\n\t\tplace this in the air. Your best option is to entrap flying creatures inside\n\t\tthe sphere. If you need to protect yourself, you can cast this around\n\t\tyourself to buy yourself some time to buff yourself, to teleport to safety,\n\t\tor to do whatever else you might need.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resplendent Mansion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This sounds fancy and it seems like a great way to produce a safe place\n\t\tto rest, but the building is no more resilient than a regular house and the\n\t\tAlarm effects are the only defenses beyond mundane locks or bars on windows\n\t\tor whatever else. The spell doesn&#8217;t mention how it handles climate\n\t\t(presumably fireplaces and the like all function, though it&#8217;s unclear if the\n\t\thouse provides fuel). On top of all of that, there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a\n\t\tway to make it permanent, so retiring spellcasters need to look elsewhere to\n\t\tbuild their permanent magical dream home. While you&#8217;re actively adventuring,\n\t\tthe thought of spending a 9th-level spell slot on this is a comically bad\n\t\tdecision, and even learning it permanently for a class with a Spell\n\t\tRepertoire is a terrible choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shapechange<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Your best option with Shapechange is to pick a form from 8th-level Dragon\n\t\tForm or 8th-level Monstrosity Form, and with only a 1-minute duration you\n\t\tare unlikely to change forms after doing so. At that point, why not just\n\t\tcast Dragon Form or Monstrosity Form at 9th level? It&#8217;s a combination of the\n\t\tversatility of changing forms and likely the ability to refresh your\n\t\ttemporary hit points.\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s not explicit how this works with temporary hit points granted by\n\t\t\tpolymorph spells, but I think that you get fresh temporary hit points\n\t\t\tevery time you spend an Action to change forms. That&#8217;s not clarified\n\t\t\tanywhere, but temporary hit points are part of the statistics that you\n\t\t\tgain, so it seems likely to me. But it&#8217;s also 20 temporary hp at most at\n\t\t\tthe cost of an Action, and many enemies can do that much damage with a\n\t\t\tsingle Strike at this level so you&#8217;re mostly just stalling. That may still\n\t\t\tbe useful, of course: if you can spend one Action to waste an enemy&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAction in an encounter where your party outnumbers your enemies, that&#8217;s a\n\t\t\tgood trade to make.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The text of Shapechange says &#8220;You choose the type of creature as you Cast\n\t\t\tthe Spell rather than when you prepare it.&#8221; This appears to be an error\n\t\t\tbecause all of the applicable spells specify that you choose a form &#8220;when\n\t\t\tyou first cast the spell&#8221;.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telepathic Demand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very difficult to use with any frequency. It&#8217;s rare to have an enemy with\n\t\twhich you&#8217;ve connected telepathically before that you haven&#8217;t already\n\t\tkilled.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weird<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Similar in many ways to Phantasmal Killer, but much less frustrating.\n\t\tWith 120-foot range and any number of targets this can easily hit everything\n\t\tin an encounter. The Critical Failure effect&#8217;s secondary save won&#8217;t result\n\t\tin dead creatures frequently, but in big encounters with numerous foes it&#8217;s\n\t\tlikely enough that you might one-shot several enemies and leave many others\n\t\thurt, Frightened, and potentially Fleeing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10\">10th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cataclysm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 21d10 (avg. 115.5) damage of several types in a 60-foot burst. Normally\n\t\tspells which deal multiple types of damage suffer from multiple resistances,\n\t\tbut this also ignores 10 points of each resistance, which helps quite a bit.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s quite a bit more damage than Meteor Swarm upcast at 10th level (avg.\n\t\t94.5), but in some cases Meteor Swarm&#8217;s 4 independent AOEs may still be\n\t\tpreferable because it can hit more targets. Cataclysm really shines against\n\t\tenemies with multiple vulnerabilities, but that&#8217;s rare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gate<\/span> (uncommon): Only situationally\n\t\tuseful.
