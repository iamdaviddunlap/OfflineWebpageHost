It is limited only by your and your DM&#8217;s imaginations. If you are a\n\tcreative, artistic person who thinks on their feet, Illusions can be\n\texceptionally powerful. While there are spell options like Phantasmal Killer\n\tand Simulacrum which go well beyond the concept of sensory illusions (making\n\tstuff which appears to be real), School of Illusion strictly emphasizes\n\tsensory illusions, and gives you new options to make those spells more\n\tflexible, versatile, and powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, the freeform nature of illusions also means that your spells place a great deal of burden on your DM to interpret their effects and how other creatures will respond to them. If your DM is the sort of person who will play along with your shenanigans, School of Illusion can be a ton of fun. But if your DM is a mechanical stickler or in any way adversarial or contrarian, you may find that illusions are difficult to use to great effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend reserving School of Illusion for games where the DM is reasonably experienced and comfortable running the game. It&#8217;s unkind to throw something so disruptive into a game where your DM is still getting comfortable with the game&#8217;s mechanics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming that an illusionist works in your game, they can be effective Controllers and Strikers.

Strangely, this feature incentivizes you to use your two free\n\t\tspells learned per level to learn literally anything except spells from your\n\t\tfavorite school.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Minor Illusion<\/span>: Minor Illusion\n\t\tcan be incredibly powerful in the hands of a smart caster, and adding both\n\t\teffects on one casting makes it considerably more useful. Creating an\n\t\tillusion of a pot lying on the floor accompanied by the sound of a pot\n\t\tfalling, or an illusion of a small animal accompanied by appropriate sounds\n\t\t(I&#8217;m fond of chickens for this purpose) can be excellent distractions, and\n\t\tcreatures don&#8217;t get a save or a skill check to disbelieve the illusion until\n\t\tthey spend an Action to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Malleable Illusions<\/span>: Most illusion spells\n\t\twhich create an ongoing illusory effect (Minor Image, Hallucinatory Terrain,\n\t\tetc.) do not allow you to change the illusion once it&#8217;s in place. Minor\n\t\tImage and Major Image allow you to move and animate the illusion, but that\n\t\tcan turn a red ball into a rolling or bouncing red ball, but nothing more.\n\t\tMalleable Illusions could turn your red ball into a statue of a dragon or\n\t\tsomething, effectively replacing your existing illusion without re-casting\n\t\tthe spell. This adds a ton of flexibility to such spells.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Self<\/span>: Infallibly ignore one\n\t\tattack against you for free, once per Short or Long Rest. Very good for a\n\t\tsquishy Wizard. Combined with other defensive measures like hiding and using\n\t\tcover, you may even be able to forgo Shield.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Reality<\/span>: This turns your\n\t\tillusions into creation spells, which means that any tool that you can\n\t\timagine is available for the low cost of casting Silent Image. Sadly,\n\t\tMalleable Illusions likely doesn&#8217;t let you change the object which you&#8217;ve\n\t\tchosen to make real because Illusory Reality only applies when you cast the\n\t\tspell.\n\t\t<p>You can&#8217;t directly harm creatures with Illusory Reality, but the rules\n\t\t\tsay nothing about impeding, restraining, blocking, or even dropping them.\n\t\t\tThrow up a Silent Image to create a wall of stone between you and your\n\t\t\tfoes, or to put a cage around them. Create an illusory bridge with a\n\t\t\tconvenient trap door (or just time it so that they&#8217;re on the bridge when\n\t\t\tthe 1-minute duration expires) and drop your enemies into a pit.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-illusion-ability-scores\">School of Illusion Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">any other wizard<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-illusion-races\">School of Illusion Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#races\" data-type=\"page\">any other wizard<\/a>.

Sensory illusion spells like Minor Illusion barely care about your spellcasting DC, but many illusion spells do, so we do still need to invest in our Intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one change we&#8217;ll make is switching Wisdom and Charisma because the Kenku&#8217;s Mimicry is Charisma-based. We&#8217;ll put out +2 in Intelligence and the remaining +1 wherever we want, then try not to let an odd-numbered ability score both us for the rest of our career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Kenku.

I like rogue-adjacent backgrounds like Charlatan or Criminal because it&#8217;s a fun theme, but mechanically something like Sage is often more useful since you&#8217;re Intelligence-based. Since we&#8217;re trying to be rogue-adjacent, we&#8217;ll plan for Criminal.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We get Deception and Stealth from our background, and we&#8217;ll grab Arcana and Investigation from our class skills. With our two free skills from being a kenku, we&#8217;ll grab Perception (crucial while sneaking around) and History. That gives us a nice mix of skills for scouting and for being good at trivia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our background also gives us proficiency in a gaming set and Thieves&#8217; Tools.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We have lots of room for feats. We don&#8217;t need to worry about Concentration as much as many other wizards because we can spend a lot of time hiding behind illusions to make ourselves hard to hurt. We need at least one hybrid feat, but if we were feeling crazy we could do hybrid feats all the way through the build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll grab Telekinetic at level 4. We don&#8217;t have anything in the subclass to keep our Bonus Action busy, and making our Mage Hand invisible means that we can create an illusory hiding place, hide inside it, and use Mage Hand to do stuff from a safe distance without revealing ourselves. Telekinetic&#8217;s Bonus Action can also help us reposition enemies to get greater effects from our illusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 12 we&#8217;ll take Metamagic Adept to pick up Extend Spell and Subtle Spell. Subtle Spell with an illusion is a great way to get out of trouble, and many of our favorite illusion spells benefit greatly from having their durations doubled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 16 we&#8217;ll take Eldritch Adept to get Mask of Many Faces.

We&#8217;ll grab Mage Hand so that when we get Telekinetic at level 4 it&#8217;ll get double range.<br><br>We&#8217;ll also grab Silent Image.

Still, turning an illusory wall of adamantine into a real object for a full minute is enough to convince enemies that it will stay real so that they&#8217;ll either wait, go around, or give up and go home. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t work with Minor Illusion, but by this level Silent Image is inexpensive.<br><br>This has some cool implications with Disguise Self, too. You can use it to give yourself an outfit that&#8217;s temporarily real! It&#8217;s more of a novelty than an actually useful tool, but it sure is fun.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Illusory Dragon<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Illusory Dragon is basically a combat summon and you should use it like one. Summon it, throw it into an encounter, and let it do the work for you. Even if enemies discover that it&#8217;s an illusion, the breath weapon still hurts them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Metamagic Adept<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>Extend Spell and Subtle Spell are valuable additions to our arsenal as described above.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>Tragically, Weird is the only 9th-level illusion spell, and it&#8217;s really weak.

It is limited only by your and your DM&#8217;s imaginations. If you are a creative, artistic person who thinks on their feet, Illusions can be exceptionally powerful. While there are spell options like Phantasmal Killer and Simulacrum which go well beyond the concept of sensory illusions (making stuff which appears to be real), School of Illusion strictly emphasizes sensory illusions, and gives you new options to make those spells more flexible, versatile, and powerful. However, the freeform nature of illusions also means that your spells place
