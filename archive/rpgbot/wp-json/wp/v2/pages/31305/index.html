In this section we&#8217;ll walk through all of it and explain what it all means and how to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-pet-feat\">The Pet Feat<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Pet General Feat is the basis for the Familiar mechanics. A familiar is\n\tquite literally a Pet with better special abilities, so the Pet mechanics make\n\tup most of the mechanics for Familiars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>You have a pet\u2014a Tiny animal of a type you choose, such as a cat, bird, or\n\t\trodent.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Pets and Familiars are tiny, and most characters can&#8217;t change that. The\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=2631\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Corgi Mount<\/a> feat is a\n\tnotable exception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of animal you choose is important. See the text about abilities,\n\tbelow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It has the minion trait, meaning it gains 2 actions during your turn if you\n\t\tuse the Command an Animal action to command it; this replaces the usual\n\t\teffects of Command an Animal, and you don\u2019t need to attempt a Nature\n\t\tcheck.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Like other Minions, you spend one Action to give your Pet\/Familiar two\n\tActions. Familiars can take the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Independent<\/a> feature\n\tto get one Action per turn even if you don&#8217;t Command them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A pet can\u2019t make Strikes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want an attack animal, get an Animal Companion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Level<\/strong>&nbsp;Your pet\u2019s level is equal to yours.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This ensures that your Pet\/Familiar will scale as you advance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Modifiers and AC<\/strong>&nbsp;Your pet\u2019s save modifiers and AC are\n\t\tequal to yours before applying circumstance or status bonuses or\n\t\tpenalties.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Pet\/Familiar uses your defenses, which means that you need to keep your\n\tdefenses high. Get good armor and be sure to put runes on it to get item\n\tbonuses to saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It uses 3 + your level as its modifier for Perception, Acrobatics, and\n\t\tStealth, and just your level as its modifier for other skill checks. It\n\t\tdoesn\u2019t have or use its own attribute modifiers and can never benefit from\n\t\titem bonuses.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Pet\/Familiar is automatically passable with Perception, Acrobatics, and\n\tStealth. However, without attribute modifiers it won&#8217;t compete with a Trained\n\tcharacter. Even so, your Pet\/Familiar can make a decent Scout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that Familiars use your Spellcasting Attribute Modifier + your level instead of 3 + your level. This can often make a Familiar better than their master at Perception if their key casting stat is Intelligence or Charisma. Many spellcasters, such as Sorcerers and Wizards, get poor Perception proficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Hit Points<\/strong>&nbsp;Your pet has 5 Hit Points per level.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Enough to take a couple hits, but not enough to stand up to focused\n\tattention. Strongly consider the Tough ability if you plan to use your\n\tPet\/Familiar in combat, especially if you&#8217;re not a Witch and therefore don&#8217;t\n\tautomatically get your Familiar back during Daily Preparations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that Pets and Familiars still use the normal rules for dying, so\n\tthey fall unconscious at 0 hp and make Recovery checks. If you add the\n\tConstruct ability or if your Familiar is undead, they generally die at 0\n\thp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Senses<\/strong>&nbsp;Your pet has low-light vision and can gain\n\t\tadditional senses from pet abilities.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Pets can get Darkvision, Echolocation, and Scent. Familiars can gain those\n\tand more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Speed<\/strong>&nbsp;Your pet has a Speed of 25 feet. You can choose\n\t\tto instead have an aquatic pet, which breathes in water instead of air and\n\t\thas the aquatic trait, no land Speed, and a swim Speed of 25 feet.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t decide between a land or aquatic pet, the Amphibious ability\n\tgets you both a land Speed and a swim Speed. You can also add other speeds\n\twith Pet abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Pet Abilities<\/strong>&nbsp;When you gain your pet, choose two of\n\t\tthe following abilities.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Pet or Familiar has two abilities by default. Pets choose from the\n\tabilities listed in the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=2121&amp;Redirected=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pet<\/a>\n\tGeneral Feat, and those choices are fixed. Familiars can change their\n\tabilities daily during your Daily Preparations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>If your pet is an animal that naturally has one of these abilities (for\n\t\tinstance, an owl has a fly Speed), you must select that ability.\n\t<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You can put whatever abilities you want on whatever animal you want, but you\n\t<em>must<\/em> select any abilities which that animal would have. This is fine\n\tfor a Pet because you&#8217;re probably picking something like an owl for Darkvision\n\tand Flight or a bat for Echolocation and Flight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Familiars, you want a base form that has no abilities because it&#8217;s as\n\tflexible as possible. Aquatic Familiars can be one of any number of varieties\n\tof fish. It is weirdly difficult to find terrestrial animals that don&#8217;t have\n\tat least one pet ability. Kiwi birds, rabbits, rats, and snakes should work,\n\tbut your GM might let you get away with things like a dog that isn&#8217;t locked\n\tinto Scent or a cat that isn&#8217;t locked into Darkvision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Your pet can\u2019t be an animal that naturally has more pet abilities than the\n\t\tmaximum.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is here to prevent you from picking some fantastic animal that has a ton\n\tof Pet Abilities. I can&#8217;t think of a qualifying animal, but I&#8217;m not a\n\tzoologist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>In some cases, the GM might add some familiar abilities described on pages\n\t\t212\u2013213 to the pet abilities you can choose.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives your GM the ability to stretch the rules a bit. Don&#8217;t expect this in organized play, obviously, but the rules want your GM to feel empowered to give you something novel in a home game, such as if you have a monkey and you want them to have Manual Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Special<\/strong>&nbsp;You can gain a new pet by retraining this\n\t\tfeat, releasing any previous pet you have.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If your previous Pet or Familiar is lost or dies, you get a new one by <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=2448\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retraining<\/a>. Retraining a Feat takes 1 week, which means that it takes a full week to replace a Pet or Familiar. This is a huge limitation if your game doesn&#8217;t include downtime on a regular basis, so you need to be cautious about putting them in harm&#8217;s way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Witch is a notable exception; your familiar is resurrected by your patron during your Daily Preparations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>If you later gain a familiar or other companion that uses the Pet feat, you\n\t\tcan immediately retrain this feat.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This bit appears to only apply if you take the Pet feat directly. I don&#8217;t\n\tknow what happens if you get familiars from multiple sources, such as a Sprite\n\tWitch taking the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=2631\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Corgi Mount<\/a> feat. A\n\tpermissive GM might let you take a General Feat to replace the redundant Pet\n\tfeat, but I haven&#8217;t found anything in the rules text which makes that\n\tclear.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"familiar-rules\">Familiar Rules<\/h3>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Familiars are mystically bonded creatures tied to your magic. Most\n\t\tfamiliars were originally animals, though the ritual of becoming a familiar\n\t\tmakes them something more.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Flavor text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>You gain the&nbsp;Pet&nbsp;general feat, except that your pet has special\n\t\tabilities. Common choices for familiars include bats, cats, foxes, ravens,\n\t\tand snakes.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>See the explanation of the Pet General Feat, above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Some familiars are different, usually described in the ability that granted\n\t\tyou a familiar; for example, a druid\u2019s leshy familiar has the plant or\n\t\tfungus trait instead of animal.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There are numerous ways to gain a Familiar. Some of them give you something extra.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A familiar is different from a basic pet in the following ways.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"modifiers-and-ac\">Modifiers and AC<\/h4>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>For Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth, you can have your familiar use\n\t\tyour spellcasting attribute modifier + your level instead of 3 + your level\n\t\tif it\u2019s higher.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This overrides the Pet General Feat&#8217;s rules for your Pet&#8217;s skill modifiers.\n\tThis is why your Spellcasting Attribute Modifier is often important to your\n\tFamiliar.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"communication\">Communication<\/h4>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Your familiar can communicate empathically with you as long as it\u2019s within\n\t\t1 mile of you, sharing emotions.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Empathic communication is very crude. If you feel scared, your familiar knows\n\tit. If your familiar feels hungry, you know it. But you can&#8217;t get more\n\tdetailed, and I don&#8217;t know if you can force an emotional response to\n\tcommunicate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It doesn\u2019t understand or speak languages normally, but it can gain speech\n\t\tfrom a familiar ability.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-explanatory. You can still command your familiar without worrying about\n\tlanguage, fortunately.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"selecting-familiar-and-master-abilities\">Selecting Familiar and Master Abilities<\/h4>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Instead of choosing two abilities only when you gain your familiar as you\n\t\tdo with a normal pet, you can choose the two abilities each day during your\n\t\tdaily preparations. You can choose from familiar abilities and master\n\t\tabilities. You can choose the pet abilities from the feat as familiar\n\t\tabilities as well.\n\t<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what makes Familiars so much better than Pets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>You can\u2019t swap out abilities that are innate to your familiar. For example,\n\t\tyou couldn\u2019t choose not to give a raven familiar flying.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re still stuck with this limitation, so you may want to pick a very\n\tsimple animal as your familiar.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-character\">Your Character<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Like anything in Pathfinder 2e, how effectively you can use an option depends\n\theavily on how you build your character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-ability\">Spellcasting Attribute Modifier<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your Familiar&#8217;s skill and Perception modifiers are influenced by your Spellcasting Attribute Modifier. As such, your Spellcasting Attribute influences how useful they are. This is easy for spellcasting classes like the Druid, Witch, and Wizard, since you&#8217;re already going to maximize your Spellcasting Attribute Modifier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the rules are silent on how this works for non-spellcasters. You can\n\tget a Familiar from Ancestries and from Archetypes which don&#8217;t provide\n\tspellcasting, so it&#8217;s entirely possible to have a Familiar and no Spellcasting\n\tAttribute Modifier. Prior to the Remaster, the default was Charisma.\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=2232&amp;Redirected=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Innate Spellcasting<\/a>\n\tdefaults to Charisma, so it makes sense as a default, but that isn&#8217;t what the\n\trules say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For lack of a clear answer, default to +0. If you really want that numerical\n\tbonus to your Familiar&#8217;s skills and Perception, pick up an Archetype that\n\tprovides spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character-build\">Character Build<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Familiars are available from several character options, and it&#8217;s important to\n\tunderstand which options will work to get you the capabilities that you want.\n\tFamiliars can do and be a great many things, and different options will vary\n\tin effectiveness for whatever you&#8217;re trying to do with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: You can only have one Familiar at a time, so, while many of the\n\tclass options below are tempting, it may be difficult to combine them.\n\tFamiliars also take a full week to replace if they die, so be cautious about\n\tprotecting them.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alchemist\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Classes.aspx?ID=56\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alchemist<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Alchemist doesn&#8217;t have a built-in way to get more than 2 Familiar\n\tAbilities, but you can still get a Familiar, you get a free ability, and you\n\tcan get more from Familiar Master if you need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Familiar Abilities and Master Abilities cater to the Alchemist very well\n\tincluding Lab Assistant, Valet, Extra Alchemy, and Extra Vial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemical Familiar<\/span>: Construct for free,\n\t\tplus the regular 2 Familiar Abilities.

It doesn&#8217;t get as many Familiar\n\tAbilities as the Witch and doesn&#8217;t get all of the same feats, but it has three\n\tfeat options (Familiar Conduit, Familiar Mascot, Mutable Familiar) not\n\tavailable anywhere else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re building around a Familiar, this is absolutely essential. Even classes which get Class Feats like Enhanced Familiar will be better served by Familiar Master because you&#8217;ll get the same number of Familiar Abilities while also getting access to the Archetype&#8217;s unique feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Familiar Master Dedication<\/span>: An easy way to\n\t\tadd a familiar to any character. If you already have a familiar from another\n\t\tsource (such as from a class feature or from an Ancestry Feat), you get the\n\t\teffects of Enhanced Familiar instead, giving you two additional Familiar\n\t\tAbilities. For classes which already grant familiars like the Witch and the\n\t\tWizard, if you don&#8217;t plan to take another archetype but really like\n\t\tfamiliars, you should take this feat instead of taking Enhanced Familiar\n\t\tdirectly.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhanced Familiar<\/span>: 2 more familiar\n\t\tabilities. Note that the Familiar Master gets access to this feat 2 levels\n\t\tlater than the Witch or the Wizard since you can&#8217;t take Familiar Master\n\t\tDedication until level 2, but you can also get this for free if you already\n\t\thave a Familiar before taking the Dedication feat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Familiar Conduit<\/span>: It is much easier for\n\t\tfamiliars to gain access to flight than it is for player characters, so this\n\t\tis a fantastic way to make spells with short ranges or difficult AOEs work\n\t\tbetter. For example, your familiar could fly above combat, firing cones\n\t\tdownward to target a circular area from above while remaining just out of\n\t\tmelee reach.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Surprisingly, touch spells work well with Familiar Conduit. While there\n\t\t\tis a Familiar Ability to help deliver touch spells, it requires that your\n\t\t\tfamiliar start adjacent to you and deliver the spell the same turn so\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re limited by your familiar&#8217;s speed. With Familiar Conduit, you can\n\t\t\thave your familiar ride around on your allies&#8217; shoulders and deliver touch\n\t\t\tspells (including beneficial ones) without needing to return to you\n\t\t\tfirst.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, the Action economy here is difficult. It takes one Action to\n\t\t\tCommand your Familiar, then one Action to activate Familiar Conduit,\n\t\t\tleaving just one Action to cast a spell. Most spells require 2 Actions to\n\t\t\tcast, so you&#8217;ll either need to get your familiar positioned the turn\n\t\t\tbefore using Familiar Conduit or rely on Independent.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since this tactic can make your Familiar an easy target, consider casting\n\t\t\tRank 2 Invisibility on them. They&#8217;re not taking any Action which would\n\t\t\tbreak Invisibility, so they can spend an entire fight invisible while\n\t\t\tstill serving as the origin point of your spells. They could even deliver\n\t\t\toffensive touch spells relatively safely.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Familiar Mascot<\/span>: If you&#8217;re heavily\n\t\tinvested in your familiar, it&#8217;ll have a large number of Abilities. Sharing\n\t\tthese abilities with your party can provide a number of very useful benefits\n\t\tif you have spare Abilities which you don&#8217;t need. It&#8217;s also really fun to\n\t\thave an animal in the party which everyone is emotionally attached to.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Familiar<\/span>: Specific Familiars\n\t\twill frequently cost the same number of abilities as the number of abilities\n\t\tthat they give you. If you choose to use a Specific Familiar which requires\n\t\t2 or more abilities, this effectively gets you 2 additional abilities. With\n\t\tthe abundance of options, that&#8217;s an easy prospect. If you&#8217;re not sure what\n\t\tto pick, Elemental Wisp (Air) is an easy choice because it gives your\n\t\tFamiliar helpful immunities and Flight.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mutable Familiar<\/span>: Not everyone who uses\n\t\ta Familiar will need this. But if you use your Familiar as a Scout, the\n\t\tability to change some of its Familiar Abilities will allow you to quickly\n\t\tadapt it to most environments. The listed abilities include move speeds,\n\t\tsenses, and a couple other things like Amphibious and Resistance to help\n\t\tyour familiar succeed almost anywhere.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Familiar<\/span>: 2 more familiar\n\t\tabilities.

If you go for Wizard\n\tover Witch, you&#8217;re here for something other than the Familiar.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-familiar\">Your Familiar<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"base-creature\">Base Creature<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of base animal is a surprisingly important part of your Familiar&#8217;s capabilities. If your familiar naturally has an ability from the list of Familiar Abilities, that ability is locked in and you are unable to change that decision. For example: If you choose an owl as your familiar, one of your Familiar Ability slots must always be spent on flight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you get so few Familiar Abilities, it&#8217;s important to avoid being locked into an ability which you won&#8217;t use constantly. Flight is often a good choice, but be wary of other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re ever uncertain, stick with something like a rat or a tortoise.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"actions\">Familiar Actions<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Familiars have the &#8220;Minion&#8221; trait, which means that you need to spend an\n\tAction to command them before they can act. When you command your familiar,\n\tthey then take two Actions. In a lot of ways they function more like a\n\tremote-controlled robot than like an independent creature. Your GM might relax\n\tthese restrictions outside of combat, but your Familiar loses any ability to\n\tact on their own the moment that Initiative is rolled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because your Familiar is often most useful when they start in your space, it&#8217;s often helpful for your familiar to ride around on your shoulder, hang from your equipment, or sit in a pocket or pouch. Your Familiar doesn&#8217;t automatically follow you about, so having your Familiar on the ground means that you&#8217;re committing Actions every turn to simply command your familiar to follow you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Independent Familiar Ability allows your Familiar to take a single Action\n\teach turn without you spending an Action to command them. Depending on how\n\tyou&#8217;re using your Familiar, this is often a fantastic option, but it&#8217;s not\n\tuseful if you expect to Command your Familiar every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Familiar Skills and Perception<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Familiars always add your level to skill checks and attack rolls, and add your Key Attribute (see Key Attribute, above) on Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks, and on Perception checks. This means that your familiar may be better than you at a significant number of skills, but keep in mind that it&#8217;s not technically Trained in anything, so it can&#8217;t take any Trained Actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Skilled Familiar Ability allows your Familiar to add your spellcasting\n\tattribute modifier&nbsp;to an additional skill, but still does not allow your\n\tFamiliar to take Trained Actions.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attacks\">Familiar Attacks<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The rules for familiars don&#8217;t discuss attacks in any detail. Familiars use\n\tyour level as their modifier on attack rolls, but it&#8217;s unclear if or how\n\tfamiliars can attack. Familiars are (with some exceptions) tiny animals, but\n\teven tiny animals have the ability to attack. Several animals are suggested as\n\tpossible familiars, but none of the suggested creatures have stats in the\n\tbestiary. Apparently Paizo no longer saw fit to provide stat blocks for single\n\trats and housecats. The closest I can find is the Viper, which might be an\n\toption if your GM allows it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a GM, I would simply rule that your familiar lacks any sort of natural\n\tattacks until Paizo gives us further clarification on how that works. It&#8217;s\n\tentirely possible that future supplements will include ways to give your\n\tfamiliar an attack.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"familiar-and-master-abilities\">Familiar and Master Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>During your daily preparations each day, you are allotted two (or more with\n\tcertain feats and class features) ability slots to determine your familiar&#8217;s\n\tcapabilities. These can be spent on Familiar Abilities and\/or on Master\n\tAbilities in any combination you choose. You might choose to customize your\n\tfamiliar on a daily basis to suit your present needs, or you might settle on\n\tsome broadly useful options and rely on them exclusively.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"familiar-and-master-abilities-count\">How Many Can I Get?<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Witches can get more Familiar Abilities than any other character. Adding the Familiar Master Archetype doesn&#8217;t improve this progression. Wizards get one fewer only because the Witch gets an extra from their Patron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>3 at 1st level<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 unique patron ability<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhanced Familiar (+2)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>+1 at 6th level<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Incredible Familiar (+2)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>+1 at 12th level<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>+1 at 18th level<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Total: 10<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"familiar-abilities\">Familiar Abilities<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Familiar abilities expand and improve your Familiar&#8217;s ability to act on its\n\town.

Unlike\n\t\tother Familiar Abilities which help you with skills, this doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\tyour Familiar to Aid you before you get the bonus, which makes it much\n\t\teasier to benefit from this than comparable abilities like Ambassador. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re relying heavily on Performance for things like Lingering Composition\n\t\tor Fortissimo, you want every bonus that you can get.

It&#8217;s a 150 gp level 5 item, so this can postpone that\n\t\tpurchase until you can comfortably afford it. But using the alembic takes 10\n\t\tminutes per bomb compared to 1 minute for Alchemical Gut, so you might\n\t\tactually prefer this to the alembic if you&#8217;re using it on a large number of\n\t\tbombs on a regular basis. Alchemists and other characters using Advanced\n\t\tAlchemy to create daily bombs might want this so that you can process large\n\t\tnumbers of bombs quickly instead of potentially spending hours at the\n\t\tbeginning of the day to process your bombs.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ambassador<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">GB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An easy\n\t\tCircumstance Bonus to Make an Impression.

If your campaign takes an unexpected\n\t\tdive underwater, you&#8217;ll want to pick up Amphibious at least temporarily.\n\t\tThis also raises the question of whether or not the familiar needs to\n\t\tbreathe, which isn&#8217;t addressed in the rules text, but I assume that they do\n\t\tsince they&#8217;re still an animal by default.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Burrower<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Burrow speeds\n\t\tare really good for a lot of things like sneaking under walls or past gates\n\t\tor other obstacles.

Spiritual Recall gives it a layer of protection before it resorts\n\tto Lifelink, which makes this a little bit safer. But your Familiar&#8217;s attacks\n\tnever add more damage dice, it doesn&#8217;t get an Attribute bonus to damage, and\n\tit can&#8217;t get more damage from things like Handwraps of Mighty Blows. It&#8217;s an\n\tattack, but it&#8217;s not a good one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So your best bet is to ignore the attack, and just look at the Spirit Guide\n\tas an unusually durable Familiar. Independent, Lifelink, and Speech are all\n\tgreat abilities, plus you get Spiritual Recall as an added defense. This is a\n\tfantastic basis for almost any Familiar. If you don&#8217;t want the abilities of\n\tany other Specific Familiar, the Spirit Guide is an excellent choice.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sweet-beasts-chocolate-mousewtd-uncommon\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=30&amp;Specific=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweet Beasts (Chocolate Mouse)<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">WtD<\/a>)<\/sup> (Uncommon)<\/h6>\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re locked into Fast Movement and Scent, which are fine, but not amazing.\n\tThe unique ability here is Sorcerous Sweets.

Since the\n\tMockingfey has Independent, it can use Gibe on its own potentially every turn\n\tuntil you run out of targets (remember the 1-minute immunity), and that would\n\tbe a perfectly fine way to use a Familiar, especially if you have players in\n\tyour party like Rogues who depend on making enemies Off-Guard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mockingfey is an excellent basis for any Familiar.

It&#8217;s certainly more mobile in combat, and it\n\tcan&#8217;t be grappled or attacked with weapons, but it can still be blown up, set\n\ton fire, etc. I don&#8217;t know if Treat Wounds works on Incorporeal creatures even\n\tif you have Stich Flesh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negative Healing is great in an undead-heavy party, but might not work in\n\tother parties. You also don&#8217;t want your party&#8217;s Cleric to blow up your\n\tFamiliar when they cast 3-Action Heal. Also remember that being undead means\n\tthat your Familiar is destroyed at 0 hp instead of falling unconscious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability for your Familiar to cast Invisibility on itself is fantastic.\n\tOnce per hour means that it will be available for most encounters, and the\n\t10-minute duration allows you to use it consistently both in combat and while\n\texploring. The ability to get your Familiar close to enemies while keeping it\n\tHidden makes it easy to use it in combat, especially for Witches who often\n\twant their Familiar close to enemies to use their Patron abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All told, the Old Friend is powerful but very complex.

However, that&#8217;s a pretty narrow set of characters. Many characters\n\twill be able to easily benefit from Spell Delivery or from Valet, but may be\n\tunable to use both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negative Healing is great in an undead-heavy party, but might not work in\n\tother parties. You also don&#8217;t want your party&#8217;s Cleric to blow up your\n\tFamiliar when they cast 3-Action Heal. Also remember that being undead means\n\tthat your Familiar is destroyed at 0 hp instead of falling unconscious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lend a Hand is the Crawling Hand&#8217;s unique ability. This allows it to Aid with\n\tattacks, making it a useful companion in combat. It automatically Succeeds on\n\tthis check, giving the ally a +1 Circumstance Bonus, but it has no way to\n\tCritically Succeed, unlike with similar Familiar Abilities. Lend a Hand works\n\twhile sharing a space with the ally that the hand is Aiding, so you&#8217;re either\n\tsending your familiar to stand with a friend or it&#8217;s sitting alongside you.\n\tWeirdly, this appears to work at range, too. Don&#8217;t ask me how, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The text of Lending a Hand says &#8220;If the crawling hand has a similar ability,\n\tlike partner in crime, it still gains only 1 reaction and can choose how to\n\tspend it.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t found any other indication that Familiars can only ever\n\thave 1 Reaction, so I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going on here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest challenge with the Crawling Hand is figuring out who can best use\n\tit. Lend a Hand is for characters depending on attack, Spell Delivery is for\n\tcharacters depending on spells, and Valet is for characters depending on\n\texpendable items. There are very few characters that fit all three, which\n\tmakes the Crawling Hand only useful for a tiny number of characters.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"elemental-scamproe\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=28&amp;Specific=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elemental Scamp<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h6>\n\n\n<p>I cannot rate the Elemental Scamp blue simply because Elemental Scamps are\n\tfantastic and I love them. That would be irresponsible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elemental, Fier, and Speech are a great base to start from. You&#8217;re locked\n\tinto your choice of element (unless you replace your Familiar), which\n\tdetermines your scamp&#8217;s breath weapon damage type and their movement type.\n\tWeirdly, Flier is listed in their Granted Abilities, but they have the same\n\tElemental Mobility ability as the Elemental Wisp. I think the intent is that\n\tthey all get Flier and can get an additional movement-related ability. I don&#8217;t\n\tknow what happens with redundant Flier for air scamps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elemental Breath is pretty good, too providing decent damage with consistent\n\tscaling. The 10-foot cone can only hit adjacent creatures, but, against\n\tenemies that aren&#8217;t moving, your scamp can fly over their heads and hit them\n\twith it on back-to-back turns. The only issue is the 2-Action cost on a\n\tMinion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But keep in mind that Elemental Breath will likely monopolize your Familiar&#8217;s\n\tActions in combat. You either lean into using it, or you&#8217;re losing most of the\n\tElemental Scamp&#8217;s impact to do other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you go for the Elemental Scamp, expect Elemental Breath to be what it does\n\tin combat and look at Familiar Abilities and Master Abilities which make it\n\tuseful outside of combat like Ambassador, Cantrip Connection, and Extra\n\tAlchemy. You likely also want Fast Movement and Independent to help it\n\tposition to use Elemental Breath.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fey-dragonetpc2\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=35&amp;Specific=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fey Dragonet<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC2<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h6>\n\n\n<p>The Granted Abilities are great, providing a great basis for whatever you\n\twant your Familiar to do.

Your best bet\n\tis to use this when you expect to face enemies that rely on disease and\n\tpoison, but the bonuses only apply once each, so you&#8217;re better served by items\n\tlike Elixir of Life and Antiplague which will provide the bonus on multiple\n\tsaves over an extended duration.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"specific-familiars-4\">7 Required Abilities<\/h5>\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"imppc2\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=37&amp;Specific=true&amp;NoRedirect=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Imp<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC2<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h6>\n\n\n<p>The Imp is a great basis for use as a Scout. Skilled (Deception) probably\n\twon&#8217;t help you much, but, if you want an imp Familiar, maybe you do want\n\tsomeone around to lie on your behalf. It also adds the ability to make itself\n\tinvisible (again reinforcing its capability as a Scout) once per hour and\n\tInfernal Temptation. It gets a total of 7 Granted Abilities, most of which are\n\treliably good, plus two excellent unique abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infernal Temptation is amazing both thematically and mechanically. The target\n\tgambles with their eternal soul, risking losing the ability to be raised from\n\tthe dead, but in exchange you get to roll an attack or save twice and use the\n\tbetter result, potentially saving your life by doing so. If you have an ally\n\twho can make a big, singular attack, especially from a safe range, this is\n\tessentially Sure Strike with a 1-hour window to use it. A Magus, a Sniper\n\tGunslinger, a Swashbuckler with a nice Finisher, or just a Rogue or a\n\tspellcaster with a decent high-damage attack can all use this to great\n\teffect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to the remaster, the Imp require 8 abilities rather than 7. The\n\tResistance ability was updated to provide resistance to 2 damage types, but\n\tthe Imp only gets Resistance to Poison damage, which may account for the\n\treduction in the number of required abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shadow-familiarsomuncommon\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=8&amp;Specific=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shadow Familiar<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a>)<\/sup>\n\t(Uncommon)<\/h6>\n\n\n<p>The Shadow Familiar is complicated. Before you consider anything else,\n\tremember that it&#8217;s only available if you take the Shadow Caster Archetype. The\n\tArchetype offers other things, but, for the purposes of this article, we&#8217;re\n\tgoing to focus on the Familiar. The Shadow Familiar requires 7 Familiar\n\tAbilities, which means that most characters will need 4 Class Feats (Familiar,\n\tEnhanced Familiar, Improved Familiar, and Incredible Familiar) to be able to\n\tafford it. So you need a total of 5 Class Feats to afford it (fewer for the\n\tWitch and for Wizards with Improved Familiar Attunement), which is a\n\t<em>huge<\/em> resource cost unless you&#8217;re using Free Archetype. The obvious\n\tquestion is &#8220;is the Shadow Familiar worth all of this effort?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shadow Familiar gets 5 granted abilities, and they&#8217;re fine. Master&#8217;s Form\n\tis weird, and I haven&#8217;t found a way to use it consistently except to turn your\n\tFamiliar into a target for attacks. Shadow Step will be most useful in\n\tsituations like dungeon crawls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Become Shadow is a great way to make your Familiar more durable. Near-universal damage resistance will stretch its hit points considerably. Depending on what other abilities you give your Familiar (which are likely few in number), you can likely make your Familiar very useful both in combat and outside of combat as a Scout. Unfortunately, this will prevent things like Item Delivery or Valet, as well as mundace actions like opening doors and retrieving items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slink in Shadows will let your Familiar hide much more easily in nearly an\n\tenvironment. However, you no longer have a shadow, so your Familiar will need\n\tto find other creatures or objects to hide near. &#8220;creature&#8217;s or object&#8217;s\n\tshadow&#8221; covers nearly everything that has a shadow, so your Familiar should\n\talways have good places to hide unless you&#8217;re in a featureless void.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steal Shadow is a decent debuff. Enfeebled 1 with such a long duration means\n\tthat enemies will typically be dead long before it wears off. It&#8217;s not clear\n\tif your Familiar needs to have a physical form to use this, so they may need\n\tto exit Become Shadow before using this attack. There is no rules guidance in\n\teither direction, so we&#8217;re left to ask our GMs and hope for the best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Shadow Familiar has unique access to the Darkeater ability. It&#8217;s\n\tnot good unless your party is desperately short on healing resources. If\n\tthat&#8217;s the case, I don&#8217;t know how you survived to high enough level to get\n\tthis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: Is the Shadow Familiar worth all of the effort to get it? On its own, no.\n\tIt&#8217;s fine, and it has some cool stuff, but it&#8217;s simply not good enough to\n\tjustify the Feat cost unless you were already going to become a\n\tShadowcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-required-abilities\">8 Required Abilities<\/h5>\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"makhluk-wayangtxcg\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=48&amp;Specific=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Makhluk Wayang<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">TXCG<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h6>\n\n\n<p>Costs 8 abilities and you get 6 Granted Abilities and Shadow Projection.\n\tShadow Projection is not good, so there&#8217;s nothing here worth the cost.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"polongbotd\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Familiars.aspx?ID=19&amp;Specific=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Polong<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">BotD<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h6>\n\n\n<p>5 Granted Abilities, Anchored Incorporeality, and Undead so it has Negative Healing. The big draw is Polong Possession, which allows your Familiar to possess a creature, perceive through its sense, and make it Drained 1. Drained doesn&#8217;t usually matter on enemies, and there are much easier ways to spy on enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions<\/h2>\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1748001183376\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Are Specific Familiars good?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>As a concept, yes, but they vary wildly in quality.
