Jeremy\n\tCrawford explained that feedback from the Unearthed Arcana playtest pointed\n\tout that the Sorcerer already has a pool of class-specific expendable\n\tresources in their Sorcery Points, and adding a second pool felt weird. So,\n\tWotC listened to community feedback and removed it for the final version of\n\tthe subclass. It&#8217;s fun to be part of the design process, isn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without Psionic Energy Dice, there&#8217;s little that makes this subclass actually\n\t&#8220;psionic&#8221;; it&#8217;s mostly just themed around tentacles. In fact, it&#8217;s much more\n\t&#8220;Great Old One&#8221; than &#8220;Psionic&#8221;, though I&#8217;m starting to think that the two\n\tmight be more closely related than I realize. If you can&#8217;t decide between a\n\tGOOLock and a Sorcerer, this is a great compromise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, the Aberrant Mind is excellent. Psionic Spells dramatically\n\texpands your number of known spells, and doesn&#8217;t completely lock you into the\n\tgranted spells like most similar subclass features. The other subclass\n\tfeatures offer a number of interesting and powerful utility options, allowing\n\tyou to solve many problems without needing to find a suitable spell and\n\tcommitting one of your precious few spells known. If you&#8217;re more comfortable\n\tplaying a cleric or a wizard and having a lengthy list of spells available,\n\tthe Aberrant Mind can make the Sorcerer a much easier prospect since its\n\ttoolbox is so mucg larger than a typical sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/aberrant-mind\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"17813\">Aberrant Mind Sorcerer Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psionic Spells<\/span>: There is a lot of\n\t\tcomplexity buried in this feature that&#8217;s very easy to overlook, but\n\t\tunderstanding what makes this so powerful will help you to capitalize on it.\n\t\t<p>The first and most obvious benefit is that you get several excellent\n\t\t\tspells, including some warlock exclusives like Hunger of Hadar and wizard\n\t\t\texclusives like Evard&#8217;s Black Tentacles. Not everything on the list is a\n\t\t\tgem, of course, and be sure to check my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/spells\">Warlock Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\t\tand my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/spells\">Wizard Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor details on the spells borrowed from other spell lists.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Slightly less obvious: this adds a total of 10 known leveled spells to\n\t\t\tyour sorcerer (Mind Sliver is buried in the 1st-level spells on the table,\n\t\t\tand it&#8217;s a cantrip). A 20th-level sorcerer typically knows just 15 spells,\n\t\t\tso this is a massive increase. Even at level 1, you know twice as many\n\t\t\tspells as a typical sorcerer, plus you get an additional cantrip.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Third, and easiest to overlook, is the retraining mechanic. The Sorcerer\n\t\t\tcan already retrain one known spell every time they gain a level, but\n\t\t\tPsionic Spells also allows you to retrain the spells granted by the\n\t\t\tfeature. Surprisingly, you can choose from the sorcerer, warlock, and\n\t\t\twizard spell lists, though you&#8217;re limited to divination and enchantment\n\t\t\tspells. Of course, there are plenty of excellent divination and\n\t\t\tenchantment options (Hex is tempting at early levels), so that&#8217;s not a\n\t\t\tproblem. Trade in spells that you&#8217;re not benefiting from as you gain\n\t\t\tlevels, especially since divination options are often useful long after\n\t\t\ttheir spell level stops being defining in combat.<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: Two decent low-level\n\t\t\t\tdamage options, and the absolutely phenomenal Mind Sliver. I recommend\n\t\t\t\tretraining Arms of Hadar after a few levels, but you might enjoy\n\t\t\t\tDissonant Whispers as an inexpensive way to force enemies to remove\n\t\t\t\tthemselves from grapples and\/or to provoke opportunity attacks.\n<p>Replacing either of these spells with Silvery Barbs makes that spell eligible for Psionic Sorcery. Even though it would cost a reaction, using it on our own save-or-suck spells would be like getting to use Heighten for only 1 Sorcery Point.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Two options with\n\t\t\t\tsituational uses. Detect Thoughts is difficult for spellcasters that\n\t\t\t\taren&#8217;t Intelligence-based, so consider retraining it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Hunger of Hadar is an\n\t\t\t\texcellent AOE damage and area control option, and I&#8217;ve eyed it jealously\n\t\t\t\tfrom other spellcasting classes since 5e&#8217;s initial release. Sending is\n\t\t\t\tneat but not crucial, so you might retrain it, especially once you have\n\t\t\t\tlong-distance teleportation available at higher levels.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">7th Level<\/span>: Black Tentacles is a good\n\t\t\t\tspell, but it does less damage and has a smaller AOE than Hunger of\n\t\t\t\tHadar, and also doesn&#8217;t scale with spell level, so there&#8217;s a lot of\n\t\t\t\tredundancy between the two that the Sorcerer can&#8217;t justify. I recommend\n\t\t\t\tpicking one of the two to keep and retraining the other. Summon\n\t\t\t\tAberration is one of the new summon options presented in Tasha&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tCauldron of Everything, and it&#8217;s pretty good, offering three very\n\t\t\t\teffective choices to suit your needs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Two excellent utility\n\t\t\t\toptions. Rary\u2019s Telepathic Bond feels like a weird choice since you get\n\t\t\t\tTelepathic Speech at first level, but Telepathic Speech is extremely\n\t\t\t\tlimited so Rary\u2019s Telepathic Bond is a big upgrade.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telepathic Speech<\/span>: A useful utility, but\n\t\tvery limited compared to most forms of telepathy. You can communicate, but\n\t\tyou still need to share a language, the duration is short, and you can only\n\t\tconnect to one creature. That&#8217;s enough to send your party&#8217;s Scout off on\n\t\ttheir own with a way to remain in contact, but beyond stealth and subtlety\n\t\tthere are few meaningful ways to use this.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Psionic Sorcery<\/span>: This saves you one or\n\t\ttwo Sorcery Points (depending on the spell level) when you spend Sorcery\n\t\tPoints to get extra spell slots. You also don&#8217;t need to spend the Bonus\n\t\tAction to convert Sorcery Points into spell slots first. You also get to\n\t\tcast the spell without verbal or somatic components (and some material\n\t\tcomponents), so you get the benefits of Subtle Spell for free.\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s not perfectly clear how this works if you retrained the spells from\n\t\t\tPsionic Spells. This definitely applies to the default spells that you\n\t\t\tget, but I&#8217;m not sure otherwise. I think RAW it works with retrained\n\t\t\tspells since you still get those spells from the feature, but keep an eye\n\t\t\tout for Sage Advice or Errata, and check with your DM until then.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Defenses<\/span>: Psychic damage is rare,\n\t\tbut charm and fear effects are very common.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelation in Flesh<\/span>: For a single Sorcery\n\t\tPoint, every one of these effects is excellent. Replicating any of these is\n\t\tat least a 2nd-level spell, so the effects aren&#8217;t just good, they&#8217;re very\n\t\tcost-efficient. Note that since the fly and swim speeds are based on your\n\t\twalking speed, it&#8217;s easy to boost your new movement speed with buffs like\n\t\tLongstrider or Haste.\n\t\t<p>Personal note: Tyler finds the term &#8220;writhing sensory tendrils&#8221; upsetting.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warping Implosion<\/span>: Great for setting up\n\t\tcombos with Quicken Spell. Follow this with a quickened AOE damage spell\n\t\tlike Meteor Swarm or area control spell like Force Cage and you can\n\t\teliminate whole encounters in one turn even at this high level. The saving\n\t\tthrow is Strength, though, and with the exceptions of enemies who rely on\n\t\tmagic in combat many enemies will have high Strength saves.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clockwork-soul\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/sorcerer#ClockworkSoul\">Clockwork Soul<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Wild Magic Sorcerer is chaos, randomness, rerolls, and wacky fun\n\tchaos, the Clockwork Soul Sorcerer is order, no rerolls, numerical minimums,\n\tand straight order and efficiency. It offers tools to solve a variety of\n\tproblems in orderly fashion, including spell options borrowed from the Cleric\n\tand Wizard. However, the Clockwork Soul leans heavily on its spell list, and\n\tthe other subclass features are often only situationally useful, leaving the\n\tplayer to wait for these features to matter from time to time in between\n\tcasting spells every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Clockwork Soul shares a lot of design philosophy with the Abberant Mind,\n\tgiving sorcerers 10 more known leveled spells and the ability to retrain them\n\tinto a pair of specific schools of magic. However, the Clockwork Soul&#8217;s other\n\tfeatures are notably more situational in nature than those given to the\n\tAbberant Mind. The Clockwork Soul is by no means bad or weak, though, and its\n\tspell list includes several excellent options from the Cleric spell list\n\t(though none of them are hit point restoration so you&#8217;ll need to get that\n\telsewhere), in addition to a lot of staple spellcasting options which a\n\tsorcerer might otherwise be forced to take with their very limited known\n\tspells to avoid leaving their party without crucial options like Dispel\n\tMagic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a veteran player with a solid grasp of the rules and of their party&#8217;s\n\tcapabilities, the Clockwork Soul Sorcerer is an excellent option. However,\n\tunless you know exactly where the Clockwork Soul fits into your party, you may\n\tfind that the subclass has a lot of redundancies with other spellcasters. If\n\tyour party wants to go without a cleric or druid, the Clockwork Soul is a\n\tgreat option, though you&#8217;ll still need to solve the issue of hit point\n\trestoration. For less experienced players, the Clockwork Soul may be a great\n\tintroduction to the Sorcerer due to their abnormally large list of known\n\tspells, but personally I would still point new players to less complex\n\tsubclasses like draconic bloodline or less &#8220;serious business&#8221; options like\n\twild magic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/clockwork-soul\/\">Clockwork Soul Sorcerer Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clockwork Magic<\/span>: There is a lot of\n\t\tcomplexity buried in this feature that&#8217;s very easy to overlook, but\n\t\tunderstanding what makes this so powerful will help you to capitalize on it.\n\t\t<p>The first and most obvious benefit is that you get several excellent\n\t\t\tspells, including some cleric options like Aid and wizard options like\n\t\t\tSummmon Construct and Wall of Force.

Surprisingly, you can choose from the sorcerer, warlock, and\n\t\t\twizard spell lists, though you&#8217;re limited to abjuration and transmutation\n\t\t\tspells. Of course, there are plenty of excellent abjuration and\n\t\t\ttransmutation options (Absorb Elements and Shield are good at any level),\n\t\t\tso that&#8217;s not a problem. Trade in spells that you&#8217;re not benefiting from\n\t\t\tas you gain levels, especially since abjuration options are often useful\n\t\t\tlong after their spell level stops being defining in combat.<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: Protection from Evil and\n\t\t\t\tGood is a staple buff at any level, covering a wide range of dangerous\n\t\t\t\tcreatures. Alarm isn&#8217;t useful enough to justify on a sorcerer, so\n\t\t\t\tretrain it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: Two staple cleric\n\t\t\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: A staple utility option and\n\t\t\t\tan important defensive buff. Not glamorous or flashy, but hard to go\n\t\t\t\twithout.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: Freedom of Movement is\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but helpful against enemies which like to grapple.\n\t\t\t\tSummon Construct is a wizard exclusive, and it&#8217;s a decent summon option\n\t\t\t\tif you need a pet Defender.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Greater Restoration isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tas important as Lesser Restoration, but it&#8217;s still very important. The\n\t\t\t\tconditions which it fixes are miserable and in many cases borderline\n\t\t\t\tlethal. Wall of Force (another wizard exclusive) is one of the best area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol effects around, especially if you have another spellcaster in\n\t\t\t\tthe party who can drop some ongoing area damage before you put your\n\t\t\t\tenemies inside the impenetrable hemisphere.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Restore Balance<\/span>: This solves a lot of\n\t\tproblems. Creatures which have Advantage on saves against specific\n\t\tconditions are common, and for a sorcerer encountering those resistances can\n\t\thandicap you a great deal due to your limited pool of spells knowns.\n\t\tSimilarly, if your allies have Disadvantage on a save (such as because they\n\t\tare Restrained or Poisoned), you can help protect them. The usage pool is\n\t\tlimited, so save this for when it really matters.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bastion of Law<\/span>: This is similar in many\n\t\tways to temporary hit points (though you can notably apply this on top of\n\t\ttemporary hit points). The duration is great, and allowing the target to\n\t\tchoose when to use the ward allows you to take a little damage when you know\n\t\tthat there&#8217;s a Short Rest coming so you can spend some hit dice to manage\n\t\tyour limited resources.\n\t\t<p>Compare this to casting False Life. False Life is a 1st-level spell, so\n\t\t\tyou can spend two Sorcery Points to get a spell slot with which to cast\n\t\t\tFalse Life. False Life lasts for one hour, and grants 1d4+4 (average 6.5)\n\t\t\ttemporary hit points. Each additional spell level adds 5 more hit points.\n\t\t\tFor those same two Sorcery points, you can give a creature a ward with two\n\t\t\tdice, which will prevent an average of 9 damage and lasts until you take a\n\t\t\tLong Rest. Each additional Sorcery Points adds 4.5 more damage protection,\n\t\t\tcompared to one or two Sorcery Points for 5 more temporary hit points from\n\t\t\tFalse Life. So Bastion of law is cheaper compared to a 1st-level spell\n\t\t\tslot, and the scaling cost of converting Sorcery Points into spell slots\n\t\t\tkeeps this more efficient.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trance of Order<\/span>: The\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\">Fundamental Math<\/a> of DnD 5e\n\t\tassumes that players will succeed on attack rolls against a typical\n\t\tCR-appropriate AC if they roll an 8 or better (provided that your primary\n\t\tability scores hits 16, 18, and 20 at levels 1, 4, and 8), giving players a\n\t\t65% chance of hitting an attack against an average, CR-appropriate enemy.\n\t\tGiving you a minimum guaranteed roll of 10 on attacks, saves, and ability\n\t\tchecks means that you&#8217;re mostly guaranteed to hit with attacks, pass on any\n\t\tsaves in which you&#8217;re proficient and have a decent ability score, and pass\n\t\tany ability checks with skills in which you&#8217;re well-suited. With a 1-minute\n\t\tduration, this is enough to get through one combat or to perform\n\t\tseries of skill checks if you move quickly.\n\t\t<p>This is a great ability on almost any other class, but on the Sorcerer\n\t\t\tits usefulness is extremely limited. Spells which require attack rolls\n\t\t\t(with the exception of cantrips) mostly vanished around 2nd-level spells\n\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re upcasting low-level spells. Sorcerers are proficient with\n\t\t\tConstitution saves so this helps with Concentration, so this helps a lot\n\t\t\twith that. Since sorcerers are Charisma-based, most of your skills will be\n\t\t\ttoo and using Persuasion in combat doesn&#8217;t work particularly well. So the\n\t\t\tthree best uses for this are cantrips, upcasting low-level spells like\n\t\t\tScorching Ray, and Concentration. That&#8217;s underwhelming for an ability\n\t\t\twhich costs 5 Sorcery Points to recharge.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clockwork Cavalcade<\/span>: Even with three\n\t\teffects, this is still only situationally useful. The 100 points of healing\n\t\twill be the most consistently useful option for adventurers, allowing you to\n\t\tget allies back on their feet and restore a nice chunk of hit points. But at\n\t\tthis level, healing options like Mass Cure Wounds and Heal have been around\n\t\tfor a while.\n<p>The repair effect is neat, but only rarely useful.\nThis could be used to solve some puzzles though: Picture the \n<a href=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/23\/Rosetta_Stone.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rosetta Stone<\/a>, now picture the Rosetta Stone after a Clockwork Soul snaps their fingers and all the broken pieces that have been missing for millennia just reappear in place with complete text and all the wear and tear of time is undone.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Perhaps the\n\t\tmost remarkable effect is the last one, which outright ends spell effects\n\t\twithout the ability checks required by Dispel Magic. But even then, it&#8217;s\n\t\trare that you&#8217;ll face more than a small handful of enemies with magic effects\n\t\ton them, so in most cases you can just upcast Dispel Magic to 6th level to\n\t\tget the same effect if you don&#8217;t want to risk making the ability checks.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divine-soul\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/sorcerer#DivineSoul\">Divine Soul<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t decide between playing a divine caster or an arcane caster, play\n\ta Divine Soul.

If you&#8217;re in a fight, healing\n\t\tis rarely the best option. Death is easy to prevent in 5e, and if you&#8217;ve got\n\t\tHealing Word you can get an ally back into the fight as a bonus action.\n\t\tBeing massively injured isn&#8217;t much of an impediment, so allies can limp\n\t\taround at 1 hp and still be perfectly effective. With the exception of Heal,\n\t\tgetting a creature back to full hit points should generally be reserved for\n\t\thealing out of combat. Once you&#8217;re out of combat and your action economy\n\t\tisn&#8217;t limited, you usually don&#8217;t need to expend limited resources like spell\n\t\tslots to scrape together every last hit point.

There also\n\t\t\t\taren&#8217;t many good spells which deal poison damage.

A boost of up to 5\n\t\tdamage per spell, especially with AOE spells, is a considerable boost,\n\t\tespecially on low-level spells like Burning Hands, so your low-level spells\n\t\tcan continue to be big damage dealers while consuming your less-powerful\n\t\tspell slots. You also have the ability to grant yourself energy resistance\n\t\tfor an hour without the need to concentrate.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dragon Wings<\/span>: Flight is crucial at high\n\t\tlevels, especially for spellcasters who need to stay out of reach of\n\t\tterrifying melee enemies. Spells like Fly require Concentration, which\n\t\tseverely limits your options, so the ability to remain in flight and\n\t\tconcentrate on other effects is a massive tactical advantage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Draconic Presence<\/span>: Cast Fear or cast\n\t\tCalm Emotions or something. This is rarely worth 5 Sorcery Points. The big\n\t\tadvantage over other options is that the AOE follows you and creatures that\n\t\tenter the area after you activate Draconic Presence are affected.

If you want to get\n\t\t\tmultiple hounds on the field then upcast Hold Monster to paralyze a bunch\n\t\t\tof things, that&#8217;s a thing you can do. I&#8217;ve done it, and it&#8217;s exactly as\n\t\t\tamazing as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>Now, your foes might decide to try killing the hound, but any attack against the hound is damage not taken by your less instantly resummonable party members. \nOne more fun little tidbit, even though it&#8217;s called &#8220;Hound&#8221; you can just decide it&#8217;s whatever you want. A black cat bringing bad luck, a totally rad dinosaur, a horrible goose. Flavor is free.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Walk<\/span>: Free teleportation as a Bonus\n\t\tAction! The range is pretty good, and in a pinch you can cast Darkness to\n\t\tcreate an area in which to teleport. You can even use this while travelling,\n\t\tallowing you to move roughly 5 times as fast as normal by combining a\n\t\tcomfortable walking pace and frequent teleportation.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Umbral Form<\/span>: What if Rage let you cast spells and walk through walls instead of hitting things really hard? That&#8217;s kinda how this works. The Sorcery Points are\n\t\tcheaper than casting many spells which let you walk through walls and\n\t\tcreatures like Etherealness. Hopefully you won&#8217;t need the damage resistances\n\t\tbecause you have great defensive options like Improved Invisibility, but you\n\t\tmight be able to use Umbral Form before polymorphing and maintain the damage\n\t\tresistance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"storm-sorcery\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/sorcerer#StormSorcery\">Storm Sorcery<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Storm Sorcery faces several issues, which is unfortunate because the flavor\n\tis really fun. Tempestuous Magic doesn&#8217;t scale, and it&#8217;s obsolete by level 3.\n\tThe premise of the subclass requires you to stay just outside of melee range,\n\tdodging in to use Heart of the Storm before retreating with Tempestuous\n\tMagic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting premise, but it&#8217;s extremely risky. Unless you&#8217;re somehow\n\tboosting your speed (spells like Longstrider can help) or flying (aarakocra,\n\twinged tieflings, etc.), you&#8217;re stuck within walking distance on your enemies&#8217;\n\tturns. It&#8217;s much safer for sorcerers to remain at the longest distance\n\tpossible and assail their enemies from well outside of weapon range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the simple challenge of positioning, Heart of the Storm expects\n\tthat you will know some spells which deal thunder or lightning damage, but you\n\tdon&#8217;t get any for free. A misguided player could select spells which make\n\tHeart of the Storm totally useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can make Storm Sorcery work, but doing so successfully all but requires\n\tflight as a racial trait so that you can dart in and out of melee easily. An\n\textremely fast race like the Centaur might also suffice, but flight is still\n\tan easier choice because putting yourself 10 feet above your enemies makes you\n\tunassailable to half of the monster manual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a fix for Storm Sorcery, you need to solve one of two problems:\n\tSpells known, and Tempestuous Magic.\n\t<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/blog\/dnd-5e-expanded-spell-lists-for-non-tashas-sorcerer-subclasses\">Giving the Storm Sorcerer some spells known<\/a>\n\tthat will trigger Heart of the Storm makes the subclass functional at a bare\n\tminimum because players can&#8217;t accidently negate an entire subclass feature.\n\tYou could also adjust Tempestuous Magic to work with cantrips which deal\n\tlightning or thunder damage (currently only Booming Blade, Shocking Grasp, and\n\tThunderclap), which allows the Storm Sorcerer to use Tempestuous Magic more\n\tfrequently so that they can practice the hit-and-run tactics built into the\n\tclass right from level 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/storm-sorcery\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"8759\">Storm Sorcery Sorcerer Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Wind Speaker<\/span>: Essentially four free\n\t\tlanguages. Especially nice if you are your party&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tempestuous Magic<\/span>: 10 feet of flight\n\t\twon&#8217;t get you anywhere interesting. The primary function is to remove you\n\t\tfrom melee combat without drawing opportunity attacks. This will quickly\n\t\tstop being exciting once you can pick up Misty Step as a 2nd-level spell.\n\t\t<p>The fact that it&#8217;s free is nice, especially if you like to run into close\n\t\t\tquarters to deliver spells like Thunder Wave. If this worked with cantrips\n\t\t\tit would be a defining feature of the subclass, but limiting it to leveled\n\t\t\tspells makes this a situational novelty.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heart of the Storm<\/span>: Being within 10 feet\n\t\tof foes is rarely a good idea for a Sorcerer. The resistances are great, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s hard to bring the bonus damage into play without seriously endangering\n\t\tyourself.\n\t\t<p>The damage bonus is pretty good so if you can manage shuffling into melee\n\t\t\tor flying just over your targets&#8217; heads you can do quite a bit of damage.\n\t\t\tCombined with Tempestuous Magic you can rush in, trigger Heart of the\n\t\t\tStorm, and fly safely out of reach. You&#8217;ll still need to do something to\n\t\t\tprevent enemies from walking over and killing you, but at least you didn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tend your turn within reach.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Storm Guide<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re in a seafaring\n\t\tcampaign, this will almost certainly never matter.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Storm&#8217;s Fury<\/span>: This is very helpful since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re apparently expected to stand within 10 feet of foes. Of course,\n\t\tknocking them 20 feet away means that you&#8217;ll need to follow them to continue\n\t\tapplying Heart of the Storm.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wind Soul<\/span>: Flight for your entire party at\n\t\tEssentially no cost and without Concentration.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wild-magic\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/sorcerer#WildMagic\">Wild Magic<\/a>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Wild Magic Sorcerer is unpredictable, which means it&#8217;s unreliable and therefore ineffective. But it&#8217;s a lot of fun, so if your group can survive you not min-maxing this adds an element of zany fun to your game. Just be sure that your DM is willing to play along or you&#8217;ll have trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/wild-magic\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26083\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-none\">Wild Magic Surge<\/span>: If your DM forgets to\n\t\task you to roll, this doesn&#8217;t matter. But it&#8217;s a core component of the\n\t\tsubclass, so, as a DM, I would make you roll every time you cast a qualifying\n\t\tspell (unless we were trying to get through an encounter quickly). The\n\t\teffects range from comedic to catastrophic to fantastic, so there&#8217;s really\n\t\tno way to rate this.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Roughly 7 of the 50 options on the table are potentially harmful to you\n\t\t\tor your allies in some way, so most of the effects are benign. Perhaps the\n\t\t\tmost iconic option on the table is casting Fireball centered on yourself,\n\t\t\twhich will almost certainly kill an entire low-level party. Fortunately,\n\t\t\tthere&#8217;s only a 1 in 50 chance of that occurring when you roll on the\n\t\t\ttable. (although it has happened to me and made several party members unconscious, as well as nearly getting us kicked out of the inn).<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tides of Chaos<\/span>: How useful this is depends\n\t\tentirely on how often your DM will call for a Wild Magic roll to let you\n\t\trecharge Tides of Chaos. Your DM is absolutely allowed to never trigger the\n\t\trecharge mechanic, limiting you to just one use per day. Or, they might\n\t\tallow you to recharge Tides of Chaos after every time you cast a leveled\n\t\tspell, allowing you to use Tides of Chaos frequently.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The safest bet is to assume that you will get this once per day, and\n\t\t\tpossibly more if your DM is feeling whimsical. In that case, using this\n\t\t\tfor attack rolls is an absolute waste, but using it for saving throws can\n\t\t\tsave your life.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Bend Luck<\/span>: When your allies fails a save\n\t\tagainst death by 1 or two, it&#8217;s heart-breaking. Spend the Sorcery Points and\n\t\tbe everyone&#8217;s best friend. Two Sorcery Points is expensive, but your allies&#8217;\n\t\tlives are worth it. If your group is using magic items, strongly consider a\n\t\tBloodwell Vial so you have extra points to spend.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Controlled Chaos<\/span>: This considerably\n\t\treduces the threat of the Wild Magic table and makes it more of a source of\n\t\tunpredictable buffs and comic relief.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Bombardment<\/span>: This is a little bit\n\t\tof extra damage on many of your damage-dealing spells. Spells which use\n\t\tlarge dice like Toll the Dead are less likely to trigger the benefit, but\n\t\tthe extra damage is higher on average. Spells which roll a ton of small dice\n\t\t(like Meteor Swarm&#8217;s small mountain of d6s) are more likely to benefit, but\n\t\tthe additional 3.5 damage feels really insignificant for such a high-level\n\t\tclass feature. More damage is nice, of course; it&#8217;s just not very exciting\n\t\tsince Empowered Spell has been an option for 15 levels.\n<p>Keep in mind that this applies whenever you roll damage for a spell, rather than the first\ntime that you roll damage for that spell like most damage boosting features. This means that\nyou can reapply this benefit multiple times for spells which deal damage multiple times. It&#8217;s\nonly once per turn, of course, but most spells that would benefit this way will only roll damage\nonce per turn. For example: Tasha&#8217;s Caustic Brew deals damage at the beginning of the target&#8217;s\nturn. This may be enough to justify picking spells that specifically benefit.<\/p>\n<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-pale\">3rd-Party Publishers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT has covered some 3rd-party content from our favorite creators.
