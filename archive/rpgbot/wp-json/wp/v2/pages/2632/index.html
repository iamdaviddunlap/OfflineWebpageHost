More generally, Clerics\n\tare the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/healbot-olympics\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2693\">best healers in the game<\/a>, and have among the best support, utility, and divination options in the\n\tgame. However, they are by no means limited to healing and support roles.\n\tClerics have abundant offensive options, and can even be somewhat effective\n\twith weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Before considering a subclass, the Cleric can serve effectively as a Healer,\n\ta Support caster, and can provide a little bit of Blaster and Striker, though\n\tthey won&#8217;t match a wizard. Different subclasses will offer different options\n\twhich can expand your roles within the party. Light Domain adds Blaster,\n\tKnowledge Domain adds Scholar, and many other domains add Defender to your\n\tlist of roles. Every individual cleric can feel very different in great part\n\tdue to the huge number of subclasses available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, consider our other supporting material for the Cleric:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\">Cleric Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/spells\/\">Cleric Spells Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/\">Cleric Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/cleric-levels-1-10-a-build-guide-for-unleashing-the-divine-rpgbot-podcast-s4e13\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Cleric Optimization Part 1<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/cleric-levels-11-20-a-build-guide-for-balancing-faith-and-fighting-rpgbot-podcast-s4e14\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Cleric Optimization Part 2<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/dnd-cleric-roleplay-guide\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31530\">Cleric Roleplay Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

These rules are optional, and you should not assume that your DM will allow these features without consulting them first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments and suggestions for specific Optional Class Features are presented here, but for more information on handling Optional Class Features in general, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\">Practical Guide to Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Additional Cleric Spells<\/span> (Addition):\n\tEverything added by this optional feature makes sense on the Cleric&#8217;s spell\n\tlist, And some spells like Aura of Vitality and Aura of Life make more sense\n\ton the Cleric&#8217;s spell list than on the spell lists where they were\n\tpreviously.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing the expanded spell list on all clerics. The new spells\n\tare mostly situational options which won&#8217;t be go-to spells for the vast\n\tmajority of clerics, so nothing here is going to unbalance the game.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Harness Divine Power<\/span> (Addition): For divine\n\tdomains with poor or situational Channel Divinity options, this offers a great\n\tway to make use of a resource which might otherwise be ignored for several\n\tsessions at a time.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing this on all clerics who take divine domains which I have\n\trated <span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> or\n\t<span class=\"rating-red\">red<\/span>. The cleric won&#8217;t get anything bigger than\n\ta 3rd-level spell slot, and since Proficiency Bonus improves so slowly that\n\tthis won&#8217;t cause any huge problems. But the Cleric is also one of the stronger\n\tclasses in the game, and they don&#8217;t need any improvements to keep the class\n\tinteresting and effective. Consider allowing this on clerics who take divine\n\tdomains that I&#8217;ve rated <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span> on a\n\tcase-by-case basis, especially if the domain has particularly poor Channel\n\tDivinity options.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrip Versatility<\/span> (Addition): Retrain one\n\tcantrip every few levels. Sometimes a cantrip doesn&#8217;t work out how you hope it\n\twould, or maybe as you gain levels you&#8217;ve found that your leveled spells can\n\tfill needs which previously required cantrips (attack options, etc.).<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Cantrip Versatility on all clerics. You can&#8217;t get\n\tanything which you couldn&#8217;t already have, so it doesn&#8217;t make your character\n\tmore powerful. Hopefully it will make your character more satisfying to\n\tplay.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessed Strikes<\/span> (Replacement): Blessed\n\tStrikes makes cantrips more appealing for domains which which get the Divine\n\tStrike feature at level 8. The math on Divine Strike is disappointing, so\n\ttaking Blessed Strikes and using cantrips in favor of weapons makes domains\n\tdesigned to use weapons roughly comparable to cantrips for domains designed to\n\tfocus on spellcasting. I go into more detail on my\n\t<a\n\t\thref=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\"\n\t\t>Cleric Subclasses Breakdown<\/a\n\t>.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Blessed Strikes on any cleric who takes a divine domain\n\twith the Divine Strike feature which is rated\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> or\n\t<span class=\"rating-red\">red<\/span>. Consider allowing this on clerics who\n\ttake divine domains that I&#8217;ve rated <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span> on\n\ta case-by-case basis. You might also choose to mandate it for all clerics. The\n\t4.5 bonus damage isn&#8217;t far from the expected +5 for Potent Cantrips, so it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t weaken anyone significantly, but it might encourage caster clerics to\n\tgrab a mace from time to time.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Cleric&#8217;s abilities all center around Wisdom, but depending on your build you\n\tmay need to shuffle your other abilities around to accomodate whatever type of\n\tarmor you&#8217;re using and your role in the party.

Remember:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (1\/red)<br><br>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life<\/td><td>Preserve Life is a great way to revive multiple dying allies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEven one hit point is enough to get them back into a fight, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\teven if they go back down they&#8217;ll at least start fresh before\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthey face death saving throws while they wait for another\n\t\t\t\t\t\trescue attempt. This is a large pool of hit points, and it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscales nicely, so even at high levels you can rescue\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmultiple downed allies and still have enough points left to\n\t\t\t\t\t\theal your front-line allies significantly.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Domain Spells<\/td><td>3rd level brings Spiritual Weapon as a domain spell, which is great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it&#8217;s a significant boost in your damage output. Casting the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspell and attacking with it are both bonus actions, which means that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re still free to cast spells and attack on your turns while your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspiritual weapon flies around hitting things. Even at much higher\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevels, Spiritual Weapon remains a consistent, reliable offensive\n\t\t\t\t\t\toption in nearly every fight.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Wisdom 16 -&gt; 18)<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Spare the Dying<\/td><td>More Wisdom does a lot for the cleric. More spells prepared, more\n\t\t\t\t\t\thealing from Cure Wounds and from Healing Word, more damage from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpiritual Weapon, and of course higher DCs for our spells.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Domain Spells<br>Destroy Undead (CR 1\/2)<\/td><td>5th level brings some important milestones. Cantrip damage increases, putting\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSacred Flame consistently ahead of your weapon damage. Since Sacred\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlame doesn&#8217;t require you to make an attack roll, it works against\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadjacent targets. Unless you&#8217;re making opportunity attacks, there&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvery little reason to hold a weapon.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (2\/rest)<br>Blessed Healer<\/td><td>A second use of Channel Divinity means that you can use Preserve Life twice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetween short rests, dramatically increasing the amount of healing\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich you can provide in a day. The Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide&#8217;s rules\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor planning an adventuring day suggests two short rests in a full\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday of adventuring, so you can expect to use Channel Divinity: Preserve\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLife up to 6 times in a single day, healing a total number of hit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints equal to 30 times your cleric level (180 at 6th level).<br><br>With that dizzying number, you also get Blessed Healer. If you were going\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto spend a bunch of turns casting healing spells, this would be better\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbecause it would reduce your need to spend healing resources on yourself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut the majority of the hit-point restoration you&#8217;ll be doing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvia spells is either going to be Healing Word to get allies back on\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttheir feat in a hurry, Heal, or Channel Divinity: Preserve Life which\n\t\t\t\t\t\tisn&#8217;t a spell. So you&#8217;re probably not going to see much healing from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis ability.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Domain Spells<\/td><td>Nothing at this level except 4th-level spells. The big shiny\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspell you get at this level is Guardian of Faith.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Wisdom 18 -&gt; 20)<br>Destroy Undead (CR 1)<br>Divine Strike<\/td><td>We&#8217;re now at maximum Wisdom, which is great.<br><br>Divine Strike is tempting, but not especially helpful. By this level you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 full points behind the Attack vs. AC progression, so you have just\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta 45% chance to hit a generic CR-appropriate foe compared to the expected\n\t\t\t\t\t\t65%. Short of opportunity attacks, Sacred Flame will be considerably\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore reliable and will deal comparable damage (2d8 vs. 2d8+2).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Domain Spells<\/td><td>Nothing at this level except 5th-level spells. Your domain\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspells are largely worthless at this level, but you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnotably gain the ability to case Raise Dead at this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Divine Intervention<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Mending<\/td><td>Divine Intervention is really cool, but also totally unreliable. At this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel you have just a 10% chance to receive Divine Intervention.
