In combat, the Magus is defined by Spellstrike, which allows the Magus to deliver spells through a weapon attack. The Magus can serve the party as a Striker and Librarian, but has the spells to serve as a Support should the need arise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Magus Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#metamagic-feats\">Metamagic Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rings\">Rings<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#staffs\">Staffs<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Build &#8211; Generic Rapier Magus<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Magus Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points is hard for a\n\tstrictly melee class, so be sure to keep your AC high.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB is\n\tacceptable,\n\tand if you keep your weapon well enhanced and your Dexterity high, it will\n\tbe plenty.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Strong Fortitude and Will saves\n\tare great, and your high Dexterity will compensate for the low Reflex\n\tsave.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: All of the weapon and\n\tarmor proficiencies that you will need. The late introduction of medium and\n\theavy armor proficiency are annoying because they introdcue components to\n\tthe build much later than you need them in order to take advantage of\n\tthem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: 2+ skill ranks isn&#8217;t much, but\n\tyour high Intelligence will let you get whatever skills you need. Don&#8217;t\n\tforget that increasing your intelligence retroactively awards you skill\n\tranks, and Headband of Vast Intelligence grants you one rank per character\n\tlevel in one skill for every 2 points of enhancement bonus. What? Didn&#8217;t\n\tknow that? Yeah, no one beleives me when I tell them that, but it&#8217;s\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/magicItems\/wondrousItems#headband-of-vast-intelligence\">right there<\/a>\n\tin the core rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spells<\/span>: The Magus gets 2\/3 casting,\n\tsimilar to a Bard, but is much more dependant on spells. Spell Combat and\n\tSpellstrike are the Magus&#8217; two most iconic combat options, and the\n\teffectiveness of those abilities is entirely defined by the Magus&#8217; choice\n\tof\n\tspells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellbooks<\/span>: Spellbooks are what make the\n\tMagus and Wizard so much more versatile than the Bard and Sorcerer. You can\n\tcompletely change your list of tricks every day to fit whatever you need,\n\tand much like a Wizard you can have a functionally infinite number of\n\tspells\n\tknown.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Pool<\/span> (Su): Arcane pool fuels a\n\tlot\n\tof really cool abilities for the Magus, especially his ability to enhance\n\this weapon. If you really like enhancing your weapon this way, be sure to\n\tpick up the Enduring Blade Magus Arcana to help stretch your Arcane Pool\n\tpoints. Avoid using Arcane Pool to get the Keen property: you should have a\n\t+1 keen rapier without Arcane Pool, and supplement it with Arcane Pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: The Magus doesn&#8217;t get a lot of\n\tcantrips, but that doesn&#8217;t make them any less awesome. Be sure to bring\n\tDisrupt Undead when you get Spellstrike because you can channel Disrupt\n\tUndead into a Spellstrike for a free attack even if you aren&#8217;t actually\n\tattacking an undead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Combat<\/span> (Ex): This is the reason the\n\tMagus uses a Rapier instead of using an Elven Curve Blade. Being able to\n\tcast a spell and use a weapon at the same time gives you a lot of potential\n\tfor damage output. You can also take a penalty to your attacks to get a\n\tbonus to Concentration, which is nice at low levels when your Concentration\n\tchecks haven&#8217;t begun to outpace your spell levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellstrike<\/span> (Su): This is why you want to\n\tuse a rapier. I can&#8217;t think of another way to get a 15-20 critical threat\n\trange on a spell, and the idea of doing 20d6 damage with an Intensified\n\tShocking Grasp is very enticing. You want to make sure that you&#8217;re going to\n\thit with this attack, so don&#8217;t let your attack bonus fall behind. If you&#8217;re\n\thaving too much trouble hitting, switch to using regular Spell Combat so\n\tthat you can use your spells as touch attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magus Arcana<\/span>: The Magus&#8217; pseudo-feat.\n\tSimilar to Rogue Talents and any number of similar abilities, Magus Arcana\n\tare a great way to customize your Magus, and many options are better than\n\tmany feats. For help selecting your Magus Arcana, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/magus\/arcana\">Magus Arcana Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Recall<\/span> (Su): This will eat your\n\tArcane Pool very quickly, so don&#8217;t plan to use this on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: This really helps with our\n\tearly feat dependency, especially if you&#8217;re not a human. Combat Feats and\n\tMetamagic Feats make up most of your important feats, and 5th level is\n\tright\n\twhen you want to get Intensify Spell and use it on Shocking Grasp to keep\n\tthe damage relevant for another 5 levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge Pool<\/span> (Su): You can go out and\n\tbuy\n\tscrolls to learn knew spells. Unless you&#8217;re somewhere that you can&#8217;t do\n\tthat, this really isn&#8217;t useful. If you can&#8217;t find a scroll or spellbook\n\tthat\n\tcontains spells you want, you can use this to bypass the requirement for\n\tsource material.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Medium Armor<\/span> (Ex): Medium Armor is a\n\tsmall improvement to your AC. See the Armor section below for helping\n\tselecting your armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Spell Combat<\/span> (Ex): By now your\n\tConcentration checks should be decent. Your highest DC is 18 (15+3), and\n\twith at least 16 intelligence you have a better than even chance. If you\n\thaven&#8217;t found other ways to improve your Concentration checks (Spellguard\n\tBraces are a fantastic choice), taking a -1 penalty to your attacks for a\n\t+3\n\tto your Concentration check is a pretty fantastic trade.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fighter Training<\/span> (Ex): There aren&#8217;t a\n\tlot of Fighter feats that you really want at this point.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Spell Recall<\/span> (Su): This hugely\n\timproves your versatility because you can call up all of those weird\n\tobscure\n\tspells that you learned thinking you might use them once or twice in your\n\tlife. You can also recharge an Intensified Shocking Grasp for a single\n\tArcane Pool point.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heavy Armor<\/span> (Ex): Unless your Dexterity\n\tbonus is +10 or greater, Heavy Armor is your best option, and upgrading to\n\tMithral Tatami-Do will get you a nice +2 AC boost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Spell Combat<\/span> (Ex): The offer is\n\tcertainly tempting, but by now your Concentration check is 14+intelligence.\n\tAssuming a very modest 18 intelligence, you can roll a 1, score a 19, and\n\tcast a 4th level spell guranteed. At level 15 you are guranteed to succeed\n\twhen casting 5th level spells, and at level 16 you are guranteed to succeed\n\twith 6th level spells. This ability is completely unnecessary unless you\n\tare\n\tfighting someone with the Disruptive feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Counterstrike<\/span> (Ex): The free attack is\n\tnice, but not being able to disrupt the spell really handicaps this\n\tability.\n\tIf you don&#8217;t have Step Up, you probably will never get to use this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spell Access<\/span> (Su): The Wizard has\n\ta much better spell list than the Magus, and access to a whole bunch of\n\tthose spells gives you a ton of great options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">True Magus<\/span> (Su): The ability to forego\n\tcasting defensively is a token gesture because at this point you could\n\tautomatically cast any of your spells defensively with an Intelligence\n\tscore\n\tof 10. The flexible bonus is nice, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Magus has some problems with MAD, especially if you want a lot of Strength for damage, but it&#8217;s manageable if you understand that you really don&#8217;t need a ton of Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Because the Magus starts with only\n\tlight armor proficiency, you need to invest in Dexterity. If you&#8217;re going\n\tto\n\tinvest in Dexterity, you should use weapon Finesse. If you&#8217;re using Weapon\n\tFinesse, you don&#8217;t need Strength. You might take a bit of strength for\n\tdamage and to open up Power Attack, but it&#8217;s not strictly necessary because\n\tyour damage primarily comes from your spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Your primary combat stat. Because\n\tthe\n\tMagus starts with only light armor, Dexterity is crucial, and the Magus&#8217;\n\tonly bad save is Reflex.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: As a front-line character, the\n\tMagus\n\tneeds all of the hit points it can get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Your spellcasting ability, and it\n\tfuels your skill ranks and knowledge skills. While you don&#8217;t need it as\n\tmuch\n\tas a Wizard because you only get 6 levels of spells, it&#8217;s helpful for bonus\n\tspells, especially at low levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Helpful for Will saves, but Will\n\tis\n\tone of the Magus&#8217; good saves, so don&#8217;t invest too heavily..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Useless for a Magus. It only affects\n\tyour Use Magic Device skill, and if you want to use UMD, take the Pragmatic\n\tActivator trait. Dump to 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 18<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 16<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 16<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 13<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 16<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 14<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Dexterity or Intelligence are great. Small size doesn&#8217;t matter\n\tbecause the Magus doesn&#8217;t need Strength or a big weapon, and being small\n\tprovides a nice bonus to AC and Attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarf<\/span>: The Dwarf is great defensively,\n\tbut doesn&#8217;t give us any options that actually contribute to the Magus. The\n\tDwarf favored class bonus is tempting, but the few arcana which can only be\n\tused once per day aren&#8217;t very good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: A bonus to both of the Magus&#8217; most\n\timportant stats, and a whole bunch of other spellcasting benefits that will\n\treally help the Magus. The penalty to Constitution hurts, but Elven Magic\n\tcan take the place of Spell Penetration, so take Toughness if you need hit\n\tpoints. The Arcane Focus alternate racial trait is a must because the Magus\n\talready gets proficiency with everything important covered by weapon\n\tfamiliarity, and the favored class bonus is great if you need a few more\n\tMagus Arcana slots.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: If you want to be small,\n\tHalfling\n\tis strictly better. Gnomes don&#8217;t really get anything useful to the Magus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tall that we really get from the default Half-Elf. You can get some more by\n\ttaking alternate racial traits like Ancestral Arms and Dual-Minded, and the\n\tfavored class bonus boosts the Magus&#8217;s Arcane Pool a little bit, or you can\n\ttake the Elf favored class bonus for extra Magus Arcana.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tnice, and Darkvision is always great, but that&#8217;s really all that we get.\n\tThe\n\tfavored class bonus won&#8217;t be reliable because the Magus depends so heavily\n\ton Shocking Grasp for damage, so take the Human favored class bonus to\n\tboost\n\tyour Arcane Pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Small size gives you bonus AC\n\tand attack, and Halflings get a bonus to Dexterity and their penalty is to\n\tStrength, which is useless. The favored class bonus gives extra Magus\n\tArcana, which is great. If you want to play a small or sneaky Magus,\n\tHalflings are great choice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: The ability bonus can go into\n\teither Dexterity or Intelligence, and the bonus feat is always excellent.\n\tThe favored class bonus boosts the Magus&#8217;s Arcane Pool a little bit, so you\n\tcan rely on your Arcana a bit more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Anatomist<\/span> (Combat): You probably\n\t\tdon&#8217;t\n\t\thave enough extra feats to spare for Critical focus, so a small bonus to\n\t\tconfirm critical hits could be nice when you start swinging that Keen\n\t\tRapier.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): A bonus to your\n\t\tbad save, but your Dexterity should be high enough that this isn&#8217;t\n\t\tnecessary.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fencer<\/span> (Combat): A Magus is not a\n\t\tDefender.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nature&#8217;s Mimic<\/span> (Combat): With good\n\t\tIntelligence, the Magus can make an excellent Librarian, so more\n\t\tknowledge\n\t\tskills are great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): Going first\n\t\treally isn&#8217;t very important to the Magus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reckless<\/span> (Combat): With light armor,\n\t\tsometimes it&#8217;s nice to be able to get around without drawing attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resilient<\/span> (Combat): Bonus to one of\n\t\tyour good saves, but more never hurts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Child of the Temple<\/span> (Faith): With good\n\t\tIntelligence, the Magus can make an excellent Librarian, so more\n\t\tknowledge\n\t\tskills are great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Devotee of the Green<\/span> (Faith): With\n\t\tgood\n\t\tIntelligence, the Magus can make an excellent Librarian, so more\n\t\tknowledge\n\t\tskills are great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indomitable Faith<\/span> (Faith): Bonus to\n\t\tone of your good saves, but more never hurts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Revitalization<\/span> (Magic): One\n\t\textra Arcane Pool point per day is half of Extra Arcane Pool, which is\n\t\tpretty great. Of course you need to confirm a critical hit, so either hit\n\t\tsomething with a rapier or take a Coup De Grace and remind your GM that a\n\t\tCoup De Grace is an automatic critical hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Temper<\/span> (Magic): The Magus\n\t\treally doesn&#8217;t have a lot of trouble with Concentraiton checks, and going\n\t\tfirst isn&#8217;t all that important to the Magus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bladed Magic<\/span> (Magic): A full extra\n\t\tminute on top of the duration of your Arcane Pool enhancements is great,\n\t\tespecially at low levels when your pool is small and you haven&#8217;t picked\n\t\tup\n\t\tEnduring Blade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cross-Disciplined<\/span> (Magic): Many of the\n\t\tMagus&#8217; most important spells are also Wizard spells. Shocking Grasp and\n\t\tVampiric Touch are both excellent examples.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focused Mind<\/span> (Magic): Nice at low\n\t\tlevels before your Concentration bonus becomes reliable, but largely\n\t\tuseless after you get Improved Spell Combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Lineage<\/span> (Magic): There are many\n\t\texcellent Magic traits for the Magus, but this is far and away the best.\n\t\tThrow it on Shocking Grasp, and you can do some truly ridiculous things\n\t\twith it as a first level spell. There are a ton of fantastic magic traits\n\t\tfor the Magus, but this is simply too good to pass up.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Malleable Magic<\/span> (Magic): You can use a\n\t\tPearl of Power to recover a first level spell for 1000 gold.
