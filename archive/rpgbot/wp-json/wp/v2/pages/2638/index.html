It&#8217;s buried in the text of Circle Spells rather than in\n\t\t\t\tthe Circle Spells table alongside everything else, so it&#8217;s easy to miss.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3<\/span>: A fantastic debuff and a\n\t\t\t\tvery situational utility option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">5<\/span>: The logic behind why Circle\n\t\t\t\tof Spores druids can raise undead is a <em>huge<\/em> stretch,\n\t\t\t\tbut Animate Dead is great regardless. Having four human skeletons\n\t\t\t\tis useful at any level because they&#8217;re expendable and easy to\n\t\t\t\tuse as bait without feeling sad about killing an innocent person.\n\t\t\t\tGaseous Form is great too for a variety of sneaking and exploratory\n\t\t\t\tpurposes.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">7<\/span>: A decent single-target damage\n\t\t\t\tspell that works really well on plants, and a mediocre, unreliable\n\t\t\t\tdebuff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">9<\/span>: Two excellent offensive options.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circle of Spores<\/span>: When you first get\n\t\tthis, a free 1d4 damage is a really nice boost to your damage output.\n\t\tThe damage scales very slowly, so it won&#8217;t be especially threatening\n\t\tat high levels, but consider how infrequently most druids get to do\n\t\tsomething with their Reaction this is a fantastic improvement to your\n\t\taction economy. Find allies who make numerous attacks (fighters, etc.)\n\t\tto stun-lock enemies for extended periods of time. The range is\n\t\tshort, unfortunately, so make sure you have a tanky ally between you\n\t\tand whatever is trying to kill you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Symbiotic Entity<\/span>: Someone finally wrote\n\t\ta way for druids to thrive in melee without turning into an animal!\n\t\tCast Shillelagh on a club or a quarterstaff, grab your shield, and go\n\t\tclubbing. The 10 minute duration may be enough to get you through\n\t\tseveral fights if you move quickly, and even if you&#8217;re not walking\n\t\taround swinging a weapon, 4 temporary hit points per class level is a\n\t\tmassive pile of hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fungal Infestation<\/span>: You&#8217;re limited to\n\t\tsmall or medium beasts and humanoids, which means your best hope is\n\t\tfor a wolf or something to die right next to you. It&#8217;s cool that you\n\t\tcan activate this as a Reaction, but 1 to 5 CR 1\/4 zombies aren&#8217;t\n\t\tgoing to do a whole lot. Best case scenario: whatever you&#8217;re fighting\n\t\tspends an attack on the zombie instead of you and your\n\t\tallies (remember that your zombies only get 1 hp).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spreading Spores<\/span>: This creates an additional\n\t\tarea in which enemies can take the damage from your Halo of Spores.\n\t\tYou activate this as a Bonus Action, but after that creatures take the\n\t\tdamage without you spending your Reaction, so if you can keep enemies\n\t\tinside the area it&#8217;s a better use of actions and you may even deal\n\t\tmore damage if you can affect multiple targets.\n\t\t<p>You lose the ability to use\n\t\tHalo of Spores as a Reaction, unfortunately, and the ability curiously\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t exclude you from the damage, so be careful not top drop\n\t\tSpreading Spores on yourself. Cast something like\n\t\tEntangle to keep enemies from moving away quickly, then throw your\n\t\tspores on top of them.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This can also monopolize your Bonus Action, which conflicts with\n\t\t\tcommon tactics like Polearm Master. That may be perfectly fine\n\t\t\tdepending on your build and your situation. Not every turn needs\n\t\t\tto involve swinging a shillelagh, and alternating attack turns\n\t\t\twith turns where\n\t\t\tyou move Spreading Spores and cast a spell could be a great\n\t\t\tway to bring all of your options into play consistently.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fungal Body<\/span>: A nice list of condition\n\t\timmunitites. You can still take poison damage, which seems odd, but\n\t\tI&#8217;m never going to complain about condition immunities.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Circle of Spores Druid Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Unlike other druids, the Circle of Spores Druid needs to be concerned with\n\ttheir physical ability scores. Because you&#8217;re not relying on turning into an\n\tanimal but you still need to function in melee or near-melee range, you need\n\tto be able to survive melee combat on your own. Unfortunately, this means that\n\tthe Circle of Spores Druid is more MAD than other druids. Strangely, this also\n\tmeans that your ability score requirements match those of the Monk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: You can&#8217;t afford to have high ability\n\tscores in four abilities, and Strength simply isn&#8217;t useful enough. The only\n\tthing you would need from Strength is melee attacks, and you can solve that by\n\tusing finesse weapons or by casting Shillelagh.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Druids have notoriously poor AC, and\n\tanything you can do to address that will still require high Dexterity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: The Circle of Spores Druid needs\n\tConstitution more than other druids. Yes, Symbiotic Entity gives you a huge\n\tpile of temporary hit points, but you will inevitably take damage which goes\n\tbeyond your temporary hit points, and you don&#8217;t want to die because you have\n\t10 Constitution.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: The Druid&#8217;s spells are powered by\n\tWisdom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Circle of Spores Druid Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Ability scores are absolutely critical for the Circle of Spores Druid. Look\n\tfor some combination of Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom in most cases. But\n\tbeyond that, look for ways to make yourself more durable. Natural armor and\n\tcondition resistances are offered by several races. Innate spellcasting and\n\tadditional skills may look tempting, but you generally don&#8217;t have room to fit\n\tthem into your build with Circle of Spores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of races and subraces below is intentionally reduced to those options which I think make an effective Circle of Spores Druid or which offer traits which are illustrative of what you should look for in other races, and it does not address the Customizing Your Origin optional rules. These are by no means the only viable options (especially with the optional rules in place), and I encourage you to explore other options not listed below.

You need to be in melee or\n\tnear-melee range for much of the Circle of Spores to function, so flight\n\tdoesn&#8217;t do much except get you into melee faster. You could take the Mobile\n\tfeat to enable you to employ flying hit-and-run tactics, which is a\n\tsignificant improvement, but Circle of Spores is very MAD so it&#8217;s often\n\tdifficult to sacrifice an Ability Score Increase for a feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Dwarf<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: +2 constitution, Darkvision, and Dwarven resilience are all great.\n\tUnfortunately, we won&#8217;t be able to make use of Dwarven Combat Training because\n\twere dumping Strength and relying on shillelagh.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hill<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Constitution, Wisdom, and a big pile of extra hit points.

Nimble Escape is a great addition for when Symbiotic Entity runs\n\tout, and Fury of the Small can be a helpful damage boost since most enemies\n\tare medium or larger.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The abilities work great, and\n\tbonus skills are always nice, but Variant Human is strictly better.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">High\/Moon\/Sun<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: A single cantrip from the Wizard spell list means that you can get\n\t\tBooming Blade or Green-Flame Blade without taking Magic Initiate. However,\n\t\tat that point you&#8217;ll get a lot more from playing a Variant Human and taking\n\t\tMagic Initiate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vanilla<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Two skills are nice on nearly any character, but they do nothing to help\n\t\tthe Circle of Spores and you really need your race to complement the\n\t\tsubclass for any of it to work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Halfling<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The Dexterity increase provides a helpful AC boost, and Ghostwise provides\n\ta Wisdom increase. Lucky and Brave can help a bit, but may not be as useful as\n\tsomething that provides more condition resistances.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghostwise<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: A small wisdom bump is good, but that&#8217;s the only thing we really care\n\t\tabout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Human<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Versatile and fantastic at everything.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vanilla<\/span>: +1 to every ability score means\n\t\t+1 to each of the three that we care about. That&#8217;s still not enough to make\n\t\tthis a great option, but it&#8217;s something.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Variant<\/span>: Put the bonuses into Dexterity\n\t\tand Wisdom, and grab a feat. Magic Initiate and Polearm Master are both\n\t\tgreat choices.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lizardfolk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTM<\/a><\/sup>: The Lizardfolk&#8217;s natural armor isn&#8217;t as good as the Loxodon&#8217;s because\n\tyou&#8217;ll still need both Dexterity and Constitution, but everything else about\n\tthe Lizardfolk is better. Unfortunately, Bite and Hungry Jaws are both\n\tStrength-based, so don&#8217;t expect to get much out of them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tortle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TP<\/a><\/sup>: Despite only providing an increase to one ability score that we care about,\n\tthe Tortle&#8217;s natural armor makes it a serious contender. +1 Wisdom is enough\n\tto keep you on the Attack vs. AC progression, and 17 AC means you can totally\n\tignore Dexterity. Grab a shield, and your AC is 19 at 1st level, which will\n\tmatch most other druids until very high levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thri-Kreen<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SAiS<\/a><\/sup>: Four arms means that you can use a shield <em>and<\/em> two-weapon fighting, allowing you to capitalize more on Circle of Spores&#8217; capabilities in melee without Polearm Master.

The Druid&#8217;s AC is terrible, and they never get the ability\n\t\tto make additional weapon attacks so the 1d6 extra damage from Symbiotic\n\t\tEntity often isn&#8217;t meaningful beyond low levels. A single level of Monk\n\t\tsolve all of those problems. Unarmored Defense lets you reach an AC of 20\n\t\twith the ability scores that you were already going to increase and you no\n\t\tlonger need to use a shield. You could use unarmed strikes instead of a\n\t\tweapon, but you can also use a quarterstaff two-handed with or without\n\t\tShillelagh depending on whether you prefer to focus on Dexterity or on\n\t\tWisdom. However, your bonus action unarmed strike will still be\n\t\tDexterity-based unarmed strikes, so I recommend focusing on Dexterity first\n\t\tinstead of Wisdom and allow your spellcasting to lag until you can get both\n\t\tDexterity and Wisdom to 20.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Circle of Spores Druid Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Circle of Spores Druid likely needs keep a melee weapon in-hand both for attacking on their own turn and for making opportunity attacks.

We can also look at other feats like <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/war-caster\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24811\">War Caster<\/a>, but there&#8217;s nothing that we strictly need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Druidic<br>Spellcasting<br>Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Shillelagh<br>&#8211; Thorn whip<\/td><td>For your starting equipment, take a wooden shield, a quarterstaff, leather armor, an explorer&#8217;s pack, and a druidic focus.<br><br>With a shield in hand, your AC is 19. That&#8217;s as high as most fighters with shields at 1st level, so despite a few less hit points you&#8217;re still very durable. In combat your primary role is similar to the Fighter: Get into melee and club people with a stick.<br><br>Shillelagh is immediately useful, and at this level you have very few options for using your Bonus Action, but try to get into the habit of repeatedly casting Shillelagh whenever you might be attacked. As you gain levels, your action economy will be used heavily, and having Shillelagh running at the beginning of a fight can open up your Bonus Action for other things.<br><br>At range, your primary option is Thorn Whip. You generally want to get into melee with enemies, especially if they don&#8217;t want to be in melee, and pulling them 10 ft. closer can make that happen.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Wild Shape<br>Druidic Circle: Circle of Spores<br>Circle Spells<br>Circle Spell: Chill Touch<br>Halo of Spores<br>Symbiotic Entity<\/td><td>2nd level is big for the Druid. You gain the ability to Wild Shape into animals, but you&#8217;ll likely only use that for utility and exploration. More importantly, you get your subclass features.<br><br>Circle of Spores notably gets <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/spells\/chill-touch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chill Touch<\/a> as an extra cantrip at this level. It&#8217;s easy to miss because it&#8217;s listed in the text of Circle Spells rather than in the Circle Spells table. This offers<br><br>Halo of Spores and Symbiotic Entities are the most important things that we get at this level, and they&#8217;re two of our most important options in combat. You&#8217;ll still do fine in combat without Symbiotic Entity and you&#8217;ll employ the same tactics, but Symbiotic Entity is like a Caps Lock button for kicking ass. It takes an action to activate and lasts ten minutes, so ideally you want to start it before combat breaks out, but that&#8217;s not always an option.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>2nd-level spells. As you gain access to more spells, look for spells\n\t\t\t\t\tthat help you in melee. Warding Wind is a great way to make it even\n\t\t\t\t\tmore difficult for enemies to get away from you, and area control\n\t\t\t\t\tspells like Spike Growth can help you control the battlefield. If\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re low on hit points, cast Healing Spirit and stand your ground\n\t\t\t\t\twhile it heals you.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Wisdom 16 -&gt; 18)<br>Wild Shape Improvement<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Thunderclap<\/td><td>More Wisdom improves your spellcasting and your attacks at the same\n\t\t\t\t\ttime.<br><br>At this level we&#8217;ll learn Thunderclap. We don&#8217;t have\n\t\t\t\t\ta good way to deal with crowds yet, and with only a single weapon\n\t\t\t\t\tattack per turn at any level it can be difficult to deal with numerous\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies engaging you in melee.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>3rd-level spells. There aren&#8217;t a lot of good 3rd-level Druid spells,\n\t\t\t\t\tand even fewer cater to the Circle of Spores.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Fungal Infestation<\/td><td>Fungal Infestation isn&#8217;t especially powerful, but it gives you a pet\n\t\t\t\t\tzombie for up to an hour that you can use to block enemy movement, or\n\t\t\t\t\tyou can throw a backpack on it and make it carry treasure or\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>4th-level spells. We get some great options at this level. Giant Insect is really good, and if anyone is gross enough to carry a bunch of bugs in their pockets it&#8217;s a Circle of Spores Druid. Guardian of Nature is a fantastic fit, too.<br><br>This level also gives us access to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"5382\">Polymorph<\/a>. You&#8217;re already level 7, so nearly every polymorph option is already available to you. As far as I can tell, you can use Symbiotic Entity then cast Polymorph and retain all of Symbiotic Entity&#8217;s benefits. Of course, you can&#8217;t activate any of your class features once you&#8217;re polymorphed, so you only benefit from the temporary hit points and the bonus 1d6 necrotic damage on weapon attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Wisdom 18 -&gt; 20)<br>Wild Shape Improvement<\/td><td>I generally recommend to people that they get their primary ability\n\t\t\t\t\tscore to 18 before they consider feats, so this is the first time\n\t\t\t\t\twhere I would consider introducing feats to the build.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>5th-level spells. Some good options, but nothing that changes our\n\t\t\t\t\ttactics.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Spreading Spores<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>By this level you have a bunch of great area control spells like\n\t\t\t\t\tSpike Growth and Wall of Stone. Throw something down to keep\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies<br>from running away, then drop your spores on them and\n\t\t\t\t\twait. If they get out of the spores, spend another Bonus Action to\n\t\t\t\t\tmove Spreading Spores on top of them again.<br><br>We already have\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cantrips we care about, so take whatever you want at this level.\n\t\t\t\t\tI&#8217;m always partial to Shape Water because it&#8217;s amazing and Druidcraft\n\t\t\t\t\tis a steaming pile of worthless garbage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>6th-level spells. Investiture of Flame and Investiture of Ice both\n\t\t\t\t\twork great in melee.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient (Constitution 15 -&gt; 16)<\/td><td>Resilient bumps our Constitution increase, giving us a big pile of\n\t\t\t\t\thit points plus proficiency in Constitution saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>7th-level spells. Nothing exciting at this level, but you can use\n\t\t\t\t\tPlane Shift to get rid of enemies which you&#8217;re having trouble\n\t\t\t\t\twith.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Fungal Body<\/td><td>Fungal body adds a bunch of nice condition immunities. It doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tchange our tactics, but it makes you a bit more durable.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>8th-level spells. Again, nothing that changes our tactics.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Constitution 16 -&gt; 18)<\/td><td>Another opportunity for a feat, but by this level you&#8217;re probably\n\t\t\t\t\tconmfortable enough with your tactics that you don&#8217;t need another\n\t\t\t\t\tfeat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td> &#8211;<\/td><td>9th-level spells. Cast Foresight on yourself. All targets suffer\n\t\t\t\t\tDisadvantage on attacks against you, making you dramatically more\n\t\t\t\t\tdurable and easily compensating for any AC issues which you haven&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tmanaged to address yet. You also gain Advantage on all of your\n\t\t\t\t\tattacks, ability checks, and saving throws for a full 8 hours.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Timeless Body<br>Beast Spells<\/td><td>Tragically, we&#8217;ll probably never use Beast Spells. For other druids it&#8217;s a powerful option allowing them to use Wild Shape to improve their mobility and stay out of reach while still casting spells offensively.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Constitution 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>Another big pile of hit points or another feat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Archdruid<\/td><td>Archdruid gets us two really great things. First, you can use Wild\n\t\t\t\t\tShape as often as you want, which means that you can use Symbiotic\n\t\t\t\t\tEntity as often as you want. You should basically always have it\n\t\t\t\t\trunning, and you might even refresh it mid-combat if the temporary hit\n\t\t\t\t\tpoints run low.<br><br>Second, you can ignore all somatic and\n\t\t\t\t\tverbal components, and most material components for your druid spells.\n\t\t\t\t\tYou no longer need a free hand to perform somatic components, which\n\t\t\t\t\thas been a headache for most of your career unless you took War\n\t\t\t\t\tCaster.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e Circle of
