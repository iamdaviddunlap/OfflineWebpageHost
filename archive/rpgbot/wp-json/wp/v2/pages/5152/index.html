Capable of both\n\twithstanding and dealing great amounts of damage, the champion is a\n\twell-rounded Defender with a great theme and interesting mechanics. However,\n\tthe champion adheres to either end of the good\/evil alignment axis, so the\n\tChampion can often feel unwelcome in a party of adventurers who are less\n\tideologically extreme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Dungeons and Dragons and in Pathfinder 1e, the Champion was called the\n\t&#8220;Paladin&#8221;, and was historically locked into Lawful-Good alignment, along with\n\ta strict code of conduct which made it difficult to include paladins in a\n\tparty of characters who might not be good-aligned, and even in good-aligned\n\tparties, paladins were frequently seen as an inflexible and frustrating moral\n\tcompass. The Paladin&#8217;s strict moral code has been a subject of derision for\n\tdecades, and only in recent years did DnD and Pathfinder entertain the idea of\n\tpaladins of less rigid alignments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DnD now allows paladins of any alignment in the core rules, Pathfinder 1e\n\tpublished archetypes for other alignments, and Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s Core Rulebook\n\tallows three types of Good-aligned Champions, which was then expanded in the\n\tAdvanced Player&#8217;s Guide to cover the three evil alignments. Still, your allies\n\tmay find your character&#8217;s rigid morality (or immorality) frustrating, so\n\tdiscuss the matter with your party before brining a champion into the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, the Champion&#8217;s primary role is a Defender, and few classes can\n\tfill that role so well with so little effort. Depending on your selection of\n\tskills and class feats, the Champion can also serve as a Face, a Healer, and a\n\tStriker, though they may not be so effective at healing as the Cleric since\n\tthey lack a broad list of spells. The Champion is notably the only class that\n\tgets proficiency in spell attacks and spell DCs without getting an actual\n\tspell list, which makes it easy for the Champion to multiclass into classes\n\twith the Divine spell list like the Cleric and the Sorcerer (with the right\n\tbloodline, of course).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Champion Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Deity and Cause<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#strength-based\">Strength-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dexterity-based\">Dexterity-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#champion-feats\">Champion Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#champion-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#champion-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-10\">10th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Champion Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: The choice between Strength or Dexterity means\n\tthat you can build for a variety of weapons. Even if you plan to use heavy\n\tarmor (and you should, both for the higher AC and the Armor Specialization\n\tEffects), you have plenty of ability score increases to raise your Strength\n\tenough that your armor won&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: 10+ is standard for front-line\n\tmartial classes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Champion has\n\tsome of the best defensive proficiencies in the game, and their weapon\n\tproficiencies are as good as any other martial class except the Fighter. The\n\tChampion also gets as many Trained skills as most classes, but you&#8217;re locked\n\tinto two of them so you have much less flexibility than other classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: The worst Perception\n\t\tprogression in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Good Fortitude and Will\n\t\tsave progressions, but poor Reflex save progression.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 4+, but you&#8217;re locked\n\t\tinto Religion, and one comes from your Deity so you have very few actual\n\t\tchoices compared to other classes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attacks<\/span>: Simple and Martial weapons, and\n\t\tyour proficiencies improve at the same rate as other martial classes, giving\n\t\tthe Champion weapon proficiencies better than anyone except the Fighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Defenses<\/span>: Proficiency with heavy armor,\n\t\tand the best armor proficiency in the game. The Champion is the only class\n\t\tto reach Legendary proficiency with armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class DC<\/span>: Among the best Class DC\n\t\tprogressions in the game.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deity and Cause<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Deity and Cause&#8221;,\n\tbelow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deific Weapon<\/span>: Nice to have, but rarely\n\tsignificant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Devotion Spells<\/span>: Devotion Spells are the\n\tChampion&#8217;s Focus Spells. In addition, you get proficiency with Divine spell\n\tattacks and spell DC&#8217;s so getting access to some divine spells can be very\n\teffective. Your spellcasting proficiencies aren&#8217;t as good as those of\n\tdedicated spellcasting classes, but they&#8217;re better than the Warpriest and they\n\tadvance faster than characters who are taking multiclass feats to get\n\tproficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Champion Feats<\/strong>: See Champion feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield Block<\/span>: It&#8217;s difficult to choose to\n\tuse a shield without this feat, so getting it for free is helpful. If you\n\treally like shields, you might consider taking the Shield Ally feature to\n\timprove their effectiveness. However, keep in mind that you only have one\n\tReaction and Shield Block will need to compete with your Champion&#8217;s\n\tReaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Ally<\/span>: Your choice of Divine Ally is\n\ta significant decision point that can&#8217;t be changed. Blade Ally is the go-to\n\tfor two-handed weapon users, but it&#8217;s still good for one-handed weapon users.\n\tShield Ally is great for sword-and-board builds, and class feats will improve\n\tyour ability to use your shield. Steed Ally is essential for mounted builds,\n\tbut beware the number of feats you&#8217;ll need to spend to keep your Animal\n\tCompanion useful. If you&#8217;re having trouble deciding, remember than you can\n\ttake the Second Ally feat to get another, though you may have trouble finding\n\tenough feat slots to make both allies meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blade Ally (Evil)<\/span>: Evil champions can\n\t\tselect Fearsome, but can&#8217;t select Disrupting or Ghost Touch like good\n\t\tchampions can. They can still select Returning and Shifting, so the same\n\t\tadvice applies. Fearsome is an easy way to make targets Frightened, which is\n\t\ta really effective debuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blade Ally (Good)<\/span>: None of the runes are\n\t\tparticularly expensive, but they&#8217;re still good options. If you like to use\n\t\tspecial attacks like tripping and disarming, use Shifting. If you&#8217;re using\n\t\tsomething throwable like a spear, use Returning. Disrupting and Ghost Touch\n\t\tare only situationally useful, so save those for days where you expect to\n\t\tface relevant opponents. This is notably the Champion&#8217;s only way to get\n\t\taccess to Critical Specialization effects, and since the Champion&#8217;s Class DC\n\t\tis so good the DC to resist their effects is very high.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Ally<\/span>: The Hardness of your shield\n\t\tdetermines how much damage you can negate with Shield Block. Adding more\n\t\thardness and more hit points means that your shield will last longer and\n\t\tprotect you better. However, the additional points won&#8217;t scale as you gain\n\t\tlevels, and damage from single attacks will continue to scale so you can&#8217;t\n\t\trely on this alone. As you gain levels, be sure to invest in magical shields\n\t\tor shields made of special materials. In the event that your shield is\n\t\tbroken or destroyed, you can grab a spare. The effect appears to apply to\n\t\tany shield that you use, rather than a specific shield or one you picked\n\t\tduring your daily preparations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Steed Ally<\/span>: Riding a horse that isn&#8217;t an\n\t\tanimal companion in Pathfinder is an expensive way to quickly own a dead\n\t\thorse. The way damage and hit points scale make mundane mounts totally\n\t\tunusable beyond very low levels. If you plan to ride a horse (and there are\n\t\tgood reasons to do so), you need an Animal Companion. If you choose Steed\n\t\tAlly, be sure to read my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/animal-companions\">Practical Guide to Animal Companions<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage on weapon\n\tattacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion Expertise<\/span>: The best Class DC\n\tprogression in the game, and your spellcasting proficiencies are good too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Smite<\/span>: This adds a way to add\n\tpersistent Good damage to your Champion&#8217;s Reaction. Persistent Damage is nice,\n\tand by this level you should have 18 or more Charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Juggernaut<\/span>: Better Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: Better Reflex saves is\n\tgreat, but you&#8217;re still only Expert.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alertness<\/span>: Better Perception is great, but\n\tyou&#8217;re still only Expert.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Will<\/span>: Better Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exalt<\/span>: A significant improvement to your\n\tChampion&#8217;s Reaction.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Mastery<\/span>: The best Armor proficiency in\n\tthe game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery <\/span>: Standard for most martial\n\tclasses, so your attacks keep pace with everyone except the Fighter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage\n\ton weapon attacks. Tragically, you&#8217;ll never reach Legendary with weapon\n\tproficiencies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion Mastery<\/span>: Better class DCs and\n\tDivine spellcasting proficiencies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Legendary Armor<\/span>: The only class to reach\n\tLegendary in any armor, so you likely have the highest AC around.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hero&#8217;s Defiance<\/span>: See &#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;,\n\tbelow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Deity and Cause<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The first, and possibly most important benefit of your subclass is the\n\tChampion&#8217;s Reaction. This is a powerful option for using your Reaction which\n\tcan have a huge impact on the way your character works in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These Reactions all occur when enemies target your allies, and the conditions\n\tof the Reactions require that your ally and your enemy be within 15 feet of\n\tyou. This forces the Champion into melee, and it means that your Champion&#8217;s\n\tReaction may not see consistent use if your allies prefer to stay far out of\n\tmelee combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"antipaladin\" class=\"rating-orange\">Antipaladin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Antipaladin is an offense-focused evil subclass, encouraging a highly\n\trisky play style where you capitalize on enemies hitting you, then willingly\n\ttake additional damage to harm your attacker in kind. Since the Antipaladin&#8217;s\n\tversion of Champion&#8217;s Reaction only occurs when you&#8217;re hit with an attack by\n\tan enemy within 15 feet, you&#8217;re encouraged to forgo a shield and get into\n\tmelee as quickly as possible and encourage enemies to focus their attacks on\n\tyou instead of your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the Antipaladin&#8217;s biggest problem is the &#8220;Tank Fallacy&#8221;. You&#8217;re big\n\tand durable and hard to kill, but little about the subclass makes it easier to\n\tkill your enemies unless they choose to attack you and trigger Destructive\n\tVengeance. As soon as they figure out how Destructive Vengeance works, there&#8217;s\n\ta huge disincentive to continue attacking you instead of your allies. Look for\n\tways to force enemies to remain in melee with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a subclass for the cautious or the faint-hearted, and not just\n\tbecause you&#8217;re likely playing a murderous psycopath. Be sure that your party\n\tcan provide plenty of healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Champion&#8217;s Reaction: Destructive Vengeance<\/span>: Choosing to take damage so that your enemy takes an equal amount of\n\t\tdamage is usually a bad trade for player characters. If you go this route,\n\t\tmake sure that you have the ability to heal yourself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Focus Spell: Touch of Corruption<\/span>: A great\n\t\toffensive option, and it can heal undead creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Smite<\/span>: Persistent damage is really\n\t\tgood, and it makes Destructive Vengeance a much better option since your\n\t\tenemy will take considerably more damage than you. You can combine this with\n\t\tLitany of Depravity, and the PersistentDamage will also benefit from the\n\t\tWeakness applied by the spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Exalt<\/span>: Divine Smite already made\n\t\tDestructive Vengeance a good trade, and this makes it even better. The short\n\t\trange means that it won&#8217;t be especially impactful unless you&#8217;re being\n\t\tswarmed, but champions often have trouble handling crowds of enemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"desecrator\" class=\"rating-orange\">Desecrator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most survivable champion subclass, and you don&#8217;t even need a\n\tshield. Selfish Shield provides an easily-accessible mechanism to mitigate\n\tdamage as a reaction. However, beyond Touch of Corruption the subclass offers\n\tno defensive or support abilities. It&#8217;s pretty much just the damage reduction.\n\tSo, like the Antipaladin, the Desecrator falls into the Tank Fallacy. If\n\tyou&#8217;re not doing much to cause problems and you&#8217;re very difficult to kill, why\n\twould your enemies bother attacking you instead of one of your allies who are\n\tlikely both more lethal and less durable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion&#8217;s Reaction: Selfish Shield<\/span>:\n\t\tSimilar in many ways to the Shield Block reaction. There is a short range at\n\t\twhich you can use this, but you don&#8217;t need to carry a shield, use the Raise\n\t\ta Shield Action, or spend time constantly repairing damaged shields. Grab a\n\t\ttwo-handed weapon and go forth with the confidence that you&#8217;re not trading\n\t\tdurability for that additional offense.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Focus Spell: Touch of Corruption<\/span>: A great\n\t\toffensive option, and it can heal undead creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Smite<\/span>: More damage reduction is\n\t\tnice, but it&#8217;s <em>at most<\/em> 3 more points per attack.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Exalt<\/span>: A -1 penalty isn&#8217;t huge, but it\n\t\tmay apply to numerous targets which can make a difference.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"liberator\" class=\"rating-orange\">Liberator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Liberator is great at facing enemies that like to restrict their targets&#8217;\n\tmovement with conditions like Grappled and Paralyzed. While those conditions\n\tcan absolutely be a problem for your party, the creatures which rely on them\n\tare only a fraction of the total number of foes you might face. Against those\n\tspecific foes you&#8217;ll be very important, but the rest of the time the most\n\tyou&#8217;ll get out of your Champion&#8217;s Reaction is the ability to reduce some\n\tdamage and let your allies Step. Those are fantastic things to do, but\n\tcompared to other subclasses the Liberator just can&#8217;t compete across the broad\n\tspectrum of possible scenarios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion&#8217;s Reaction: Liberating Step<\/span>:\n\t\t\tConsistently useful, and an absolutely stellar use of your Reaction. The\n\t\t\tdamage reduction is already nice, allowing you to use your Reaction to\n\t\t\tdramatically improve your party&#8217;s ability to absorb damage. But somehow\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s the least exciting part of this feature despite already being very\n\t\t\tuseful.\n\t\t\t<p>Effects that grab, paralyze, etc. your allies can be a huge problem,\n\t\t\t\tand allowing your allies to repeat a save or Escape for free means that\n\t\t\t\tthey may not be paralyzed, etc. on their turn, and they hopefully won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tneed to spend an Action to Escape before they can do something\n\t\t\t\tuseful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>If you ally isn&#8217;t affected by one of the listed effects, they can\n\t\t\t\tinstead Step, potentially saving them an Action on their turn to do so\n\t\t\t\tand giving your party an advantage in the action economy. More actions\n\t\t\t\tspent eliminating foes means that you win fights faster and at lower\n\t\t\t\tresource cost, and effects which allow characters to improve their\n\t\t\t\tAction economy are usually expensive, have limited number of uses, or\n\t\t\t\taren&#8217;t available until very high level.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>If you want to abuse this, consider putting an angry rat in your ally&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tpocket. The rat will attack them and should be considered an enemy, but\n\t\t\t\tit won&#8217;t do enough damage to get past the damage resistance, so you can\n\t\t\t\trepeatedly trigger the Reaction to get the other benefits. If your ally\n\t\t\t\tis under one of the listed effects, they get extra saves\/Escape\n\t\t\t\tattempts, and if they&#8217;re not they can get an extra Step during your\n\t\t\t\tturn.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Focus Spell: Lay on Hands<\/span>: Never not\n\t\tuseful. A big pile of reliable healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Smite<\/span>: Situational. This will\n\t\tonly be useful against foes who rely on options which restrain your\n\t\tmovement.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Exalt<\/span>: Finally something that doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trely on enemies trying to grab you or something! A Step could save one or\n\t\tmore of your allies an Action on their turn, making this a significant\n\t\timprovement to your whole party&#8217;s action economy. You still need to be\n\t\twithin 15 ft. of the allies you want to affect, unfortunately, but the\n\t\tallies close to you in melee are the ones who really need this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"paladin\" class=\"rating-blue\">Paladin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you hate evil? Do you want to respond to evil with some simple,\n\tstraight-forward violence? That&#8217;s the Paladin. Their Champion&#8217;s Reaction and\n\ttheir feat options emphasize offense, granting you additional attacks and\n\tdamage. Paladins will often favor two-handed weapons for the extra damage\n\toutput, and reach weapons are a great idea so that you can more easily rely\n\tupon Retributive Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion&#8217;s Reaction: Retributive Strike<\/span>:\n\t\tReduce damage to your ally, and potentially make a melee Strike as part of\n\t\tthe Reaction. A great reason to use a weapon with reach, but you can also go\n\t\tbeyond your reach if you take the Ranged Reprisal class feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Focus Spell: Lay on Hands<\/span>: Never not\n\t\tuseful. A big pile of reliable healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Smite<\/span>: Even more damage on top of\n\t\tthe extra Strike that you get to make.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exalt<\/span>: The more melee allies you have, the\n\t\tbetter this is. Even with the -5 penalty (or -2 if you take Aura of\n\t\tVengeance) this is still potentially a huge amount of damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"redeemer\" class=\"rating-blue\">Redeemer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Paladin is all about offense, the Redeemer is more focused on\n\tdefense. Glimpse of Redemption both protects your allies and debuffs the\n\tattacker, providing additional protection beyond the moment in which you use\n\tthe Reaction. Higher-level options allow you to better protect your allies,\n\teven allowing you to reduce damage to multiple allies suffering damage from\n\tthe same attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion&#8217;s Reaction: Glimpse of Redemption<\/span>: The way that the text is formatted makes this hard to read. The attacker\n\t\tchooses to either not deal damage (unlikely), or they choose to deal damage\n\t\treduced by 2 plus your level but they become Enfeebled 2. Enfeebled is a\n\t\tgreat debuff for Strength-based enemies that rely on melee attacks, so this\n\t\tis a great way to continue protecting your allies even after you&#8217;ve used\n\t\tyour Reaction. You also don&#8217;t need to be in melee reach like Retributive\n\t\tStrike, so you don&#8217;t need to stand right next to your allies at all times or\n\t\tcarry a reach weapon. If Enfeebled isn&#8217;t good enough, you can take Weight of\n\t\tGuilt to make Stupefied an option so that you can handicap spellcasters or\n\t\tmake enemies vulnerable to Will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Focus Spell: Lay on Hands<\/span>: Never not\n\t\tuseful. A big pile of reliable healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Smite<\/span>: Enemies will rarely choose\n\t\tto deal no damage, so this is almost guaranteed. Of course, if they know\n\t\tthis is coming maybe they&#8217;ll choose to do no damage with their attack.\n\t\tEither way, it works out great for you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exalt<\/span>: Perfect for area effects. Even with\n\t\tthe damage resistance very slightly reduced, reducing the damage to even one\n\t\tadditional creature will massively increase the amount of total damage\n\t\treduced.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tyrant\" class=\"rating-orange\">Tyrant<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tyrant falls into the Tank Fallacy just as much as the other evil\n\tsubclasses. Iron Repercussions has the ability to make the damage from Iron\n\tCommand persistent, so enemies only need to make the mistake of hitting you\n\tonce for Iron Command to be reasonably impactful. Even so, since Champion&#8217;s\n\tReaction is such a central feature of the Champion it&#8217;s disappointing to know\n\tthat it&#8217;s going to be largely useless as soon as enemies figure it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Champion&#8217;s Reaction: Iron Command<\/span>: Maybe\n\t\tnot super impactful, but either the target makes themselves Prone (which\n\t\talso makes them Flat-Footed), or they take automatic damage with no save or\n\t\tattack roll required. Even better, you can make the damage Persistent Damage\n\t\twith the Iron Repercussions Class Feat.\n\t\t<p>The bonus damage on Strikes against them during your next turn is nice,\n\t\t\ttoo, and since you can change the damage type you can get around damage\n\t\t\tresistences more easily. If foes choose to make themselves Prone,\n\t\t\thopefully you have an ally who is built to capitalize on Flat-Footed\n\t\t\tenemies like a rogue.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Perhaps the biggest problem with this is that you need to be damaged by\n\t\t\tan attack, which excludes many spells and also means that enemies can\n\t\t\tsimply ignore you to avoid the effect entirely.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Focus Spell: Touch of Corruption<\/span>: A great\n\t\toffensive option, and it can heal undead creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Smite<\/span>: Persistent damage is really\n\t\tgood, and it makes Destructive Vengeance a much better option since your\n\t\tenemy will take considerably more damage than you. You can combine this with\n\t\tLitany of Depravity, and the Persistent Damage will also benefit from the\n\t\tWeakness applied by the spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Exalt<\/span>: Spread Iron Command to every\n\t\tenemy within 15 feet. They&#8217;ll likely choose to take the tiny amount of\n\t\tmental damage, and the ongoing damage from your Divine Smite and Iron\n\t\tConsequences don&#8217;t apply if I understand the text correctly. The damage\n\t\twon&#8217;t be significant unless you&#8217;re being swarmed, but it&#8217;s helpful since\n\t\tchampions aren&#8217;t great at handling crowds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Champion is one of the most MAD classes in the game. It&#8217;s hard to find an\n\tactual dump stat because you benefit from every ability score. Strength-based\n\tbuilds can dump Dexterity, but you don&#8217;t want to go below 10. Dexterity-based\n\tbuilds can dump Strength, but it means using crossbows and giving up on Armor\n\tSpecializations. You can dump Intelligence, but you get very few skill options\n\talready so that can be very limiting outside of combat. You can dump Wisdom,\n\tbut Will saves are important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But because the Champion is only fully dependent on a few ability scores, you\n\tcan also weigh the costs and benefits of your ability scores and adjust your\n\tbuild to your liking. You could dump Intelligence if you have a lot of skills\n\tin your party (maybe you have a rogue or unusually intelligent party members),\n\tor you could dump Wisdom if you have allies who can provide extra protection\n\tor who can set you right when you fail a saving throw. You could technically\n\tdump Charisma if you don&#8217;t want to be a Face or use Focus Spells, but Divine\n\tSmite is built into the class so you&#8217;ll lose some damage output. Do what makes\n\tsense to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strength-based\">Strength-Based<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most champions will likely prefer Strength-based weapons, especially if you\n\tplan to use two-handed melee weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Attacks and damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: You don&#8217;t need any more than 10.\n\tYou&#8217;ll eventually be in Full Plate, and the Bulwark trait provides a +3 bonus\n\tto Reflex saves which will override your Dexterity modifier anyway.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are crucial.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: You only get to choose 2+int of the\n\tskills from your class, which gives you very little flexibility.

Remember that if you&#8217;re using a Propulsive weapon\n\tyou only get half of the bonus, so stop at either 14 or 18 depending on how\n\tmany boosts you want to invest and whether or not you want to wear heavy\n\tarmor. You may be able to dump strength by relying on crossbows instead of\n\tbows, especially if you&#8217;re comfortable in light armor. The Champion&#8217;s armor\n\tproficiency is the best in the game, so even in light armor your AC will beat\n\teveryone else&#8217;s by 1.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: If you want to use a bow or a finesse\n\tweapon, you need as much Dexterity as you can get. You could easily fight in\n\tlight armor, too, but when you can afford it you should absolutely wear heavy\n\tarmor both for the extra AC and the Armor Specialization effects. Be sure to\n\tavoid Full Plate, though, because Bulwark will override your Dexterity\n\tmodifier to Reflex saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are crucial.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: You only get to choose 2+int of the\n\tskills from your class, which gives you very little flexibility.

Beyond that, you can\n\tfind interesting options from nearly any ancestry depending on your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Catfolk<\/span>: Dexterity and Charisma work great\n\tfor a Dexterity-based build, and the Wisdom flaw is minimally impactful. The\n\tCat&#8217;s Luck feat tree will go a long way to enhance your saving throws,\n\tespecially the Champion&#8217;s low Reflex saves, adding to your already excellent\n\tdurability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Even with the Charisma Flaw, the\n\tDwarf is a fine option for the Champion. High starting hit points and a\n\tConstitution increase are great for a durable champion, and if you stay away\n\tfrom spellcasting and Face skills you&#8217;ll do fine. Dwarven Weapon Familiarity\n\tadds some new weapon options like the Dwarven Waraxe, which is a spectacular\n\toption if you like to use a shield sometimes but not constantly. You can also\n\tget access to Critical Specialization effects, which is great if you didn&#8217;t\n\twant to select Blade Ally. All of that can leave you feeling like a fighter\n\twith some minor divine flavor, which may be exactly what you want, or it might\n\tbe underwhelming if you&#8217;re looking to play a warrior driven by divine\n\tpower.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: A Constitution Flaw is hard, but with\n\tthe Optional Ability Flaws you can end up with +2 Dex and a Flexible Ability\n\tBoost which you can put into your choice of Constitution or Charisma. For a\n\tDexterity-based build, that&#8217;s probably enough. You can get some extra skill\n\toptions from the Ancestral Longevity feat tree, and Otherworldly Magic can get\n\tyou a cantrip like Shield which you can benefit from despite it being Arcane\n\tspellcasting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome<\/span>: If you&#8217;re happy with a crossbow or\n\twith putting enough boosts into Strength to overcome the Strength Flaw, the\n\tGnome&#8217;s ability boosts are spectacular. Wellspring Gnome can get you a\n\tcantrip, including one from the Divine spell list (which takes advantage of\n\tthe Champion&#8217;s spellcasting proficiency progression). Gnome Weapon Familiarity\n\tcan get you access to the Gnome Flickmace, which is a great reach weapon\n\toption if you still want a shield (though the Strength Flaw will be an even\n\tbigger problem), and with other Ancestry Feats you can add options like an\n\tAnimal Companion and a cantrip from the Primal spell list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Goblin<\/span>: Perfect ability scores for a\n\tDexterity-based build, and you don&#8217;t even have the Strength Flaw that the\n\tGnome suffers. Unfortunately, the Goblin has fewer appealing Ancestry Feat\n\toptions. Rough Rider makes it easier to get an Animal Companion that&#8217;s more\n\tinteresting than the Horse, but remember that most Animal Companions lose most\n\tof their interesting capabilities while you ride them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Similar to the gnome, but the\n\tAbility Boosts don&#8217;t line up quite as well, and the Ancestry Feats don&#8217;t\n\tdirectly contribute to the Champion quite as well as the Gnome&#8217;s. Still, there\n\tare some interesting options here. Unfettered Halfling matches thematically\n\twith the Liberator, and Halfling Luck is literally always good. Plus, you can\n\ttake Cultural Adaptability to get good options from other Ancestries.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Two free Ability Boosts works\n\tliterally anywhere, and between Ancestry Feats and Heritages you have plenty\n\tof options. Versatile Heritage or General Training can get you a General Feat\n\tlike Toughness, which will reduce the need for a Constitution Boost.\n\tUnconventional Weaponry can get you access to options like the Gnome Flickmace\n\tif you want to use a shield but also want reach for things like Retributive\n\tStrike. Multitalented can help you get multiclass feats in order to get access\n\tto Divine spellcasting. There are lots of good options. If you&#8217;re absolutely\n\tdesperate for a third Ability Boost, you can use the Optional Flaw rules to do\n\tso, and depending on what you&#8217;re willing to give up it may be worth the\n\tcost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Kobold<\/span>: This is definitely playable, but it\n\twill be challenging. A Constitution flaw and minimum ancestry hit points are a\n\thard start, but Cringe can easily offset both and totally replaces any need\n\tfor a shield, though it competes with Champion&#8217;s Reaction for your Reaction\n\teach round. The Kobold Breath feat chain also offers a helpful option handle\n\tcrowds, which is normally difficult for the Champion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Orc<\/span>: Two increases is enough, and the Orc is\n\tall about being in melee and being hard to kill, which serves the Champion\n\tperfectly. If you take Steed Ally, Ferocious Beasts is great. The Orc Ferocity\n\tfeat chain is great on any champion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ratfolk<\/span>: The boosts and flaws don&#8217;t line up\n\twell, and the Ratfolk&#8217;s only interesting ancestry feats relate to item\n\tmanagement which champions don&#8217;t typically need to worry about.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tengu<\/span>: Workable, but you can get similar\n\tand better options from other ancestries like the Catfolk or the Goblin.\n\tSquawk is neat for a Face build, but there are few gems among the Tengu&#8217;s\n\tother Ancestry Feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Boosts to important ability scores are crucial, but also look for skills\n\tandskill feats which complement your character concept.

Many domain Focus Spells are very\n\t\tpowerful, offering a lot of excellent magic options which are absolutely\n\t\tworth the Focus Point to cast them. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/domains\">Domains Breakdown<\/a> for help with\n\t\tDomains.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Desperate Prayer<\/span>: If you really enjoy\n\t\tFocus Spells, this can be a great option. Characters taking Champion\n\t\tMulticlass Devotion might consider this for a build where Focus Spells are a\n\t\tcentral feature.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Repercussions<\/span>: (Tyrant only). This\n\t\tseems too good to be a 1st-level feat. 1d6 Persistent Damage at 1st level is\n\t\tenough to kill many enemies over the course of a few rounds. Trigger this\n\t\tthen hide behind a shield. If you get hit again, you can always choose to\n\t\tdeal regular damage instead of Persistent Damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ongoing Selfishness<\/span>: (Desecrator only) A\n\t\tfew points of additional damage resistance to additional attacks won&#8217;t do\n\t\tmuch until you&#8217;ve gained a few levels, but against enemies which make\n\t\tmultiple Strikes in a typically turn this will prevent a lot of damage over\n\t\tthe course of your career.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ranged Reprisal<\/span>: (Paladin only). Despite\n\t\tthe name, this is useable with both ranged weapons and with melee weapons.\n\t\tHaving a reach weapon and still being 5 feet too far away to make a\n\t\tRetributive Strike is immensely frustrating, especially at low levels when a\n\t\tsingle attack can make such a huge difference. This is essential for\n\t\tpaladins.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unimpeded Step<\/span>: (Liberator only).\n\t\tSituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vicious Vengeance<\/span>: (Antipaladin only).\n\t\tAt most 1 extra damage per round at level 1, and it scales to at most 6\n\t\tdamage per round.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weight of Guilt<\/span>: (Redeemer only) Stupefied\n\t\tdebuffs foes which rely on mental ability scores, including enemy\n\t\tspellcasters. In addition, it reduces their Will Saves, making them more\n\t\tvulnerable to spells and other options line Demoralize.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Conceited Mindset<\/span>: (Evil only). Mental\n\t\teffects make up most effects which target Will Saves. The +2 bonus alone is\n\t\tenough that you can worry a bit less about having Wisdom to back your\n\t\tsaves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Grace<\/span>: Situational, but a +2\n\t\tbonus is pretty good if your DM likes to use a lot of enemies who cast\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dragonslayer Oath<\/span>: (Good only). Bonuses to\n\t\tfight evil dragons. The benefits vary by subclass, but they only apply\n\t\tagainst dragons which makes them situational by nature. Unless you&#8217;re in a\n\t\tcampaign centered around slaying dragons, dragons will be incredibly\n\t\trare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Esoteric Oath<\/span>: (Good only). Aberrations are\n\t\tan uncommong creature type in most campaigns, but the Cthulhu mythos has a\n\t\tweird way of sneaking into Pathinder&#8217;s published Adventure Paths.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fiendsbane Oath<\/span>: (Good only). The same\n\t\teffects as Dragonslayer Oath, but fiends tend to be more common than\n\t\tdragons. Still situational, but more useful than Dragonslayer Oath.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightslayer Oath<\/span>: (Evil only). In a\n\t\tcampaign centered on evil characters, you could reasonably expect to\n\t\tencounter celestials at the same rate that good-aligned characters encounter\n\t\tfiends.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shining Oath<\/span>: (Good only). The same\n\t\teffects as Dragonslayer Oath, but undead tend to be more common than\n\t\tdragons. Still situational, but more useful than Dragonslayer Oath.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vengeful Oath<\/span>: (Paladin only). Turn Lay\n\t\ton Hands into an attack option against evil creatures that harm your allies.\n\t\tYou may not want to gamble with such a good healing option, but it&#8217;s a\n\t\tsingle Action that deals a big pile of damage without making a Strike so\n\t\tit&#8217;s a great follow-up to your normal attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Accelerating Touch<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Courage<\/span>: (Good only). Frightened\n\t\tis an easy debuff which can come from a variety of sources. Immunity to\n\t\tFrightened 1 means that you&#8217;re largely immune to Demoralize, too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Despair<\/span>: (Evil only). Fear is a\n\t\tgeat debuff, and forcing enemies to remain at Frightened 1 while within 15\n\t\tfeet of you can leave you at an easy numerical advantage. If you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tspells or magic items that can make targets Frightened, Demoralize works\n\t\tgreat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cruelty<\/span>: (Evil only). A great motivation\n\t\tto use Touch of Corruption early in a fight, Enfeebled is a good debuff for\n\t\tmartial creatures. However, it requires an Action to add this additonal\n\t\teffect which means you&#8217;re spending an additional Action early in a fight\n\t\twhen each Action is the most impactful. This is good, but not so good that\n\t\tyou should consider this over any other option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Health<\/span>: (Good only). Situational.\n\t\tThe bonus is small, and you can rely on the Medicine skill&#8217;s Treat Disease\n\t\taction for a bonus of the same type with twice the effect.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mercy<\/span>: Situational, though paralysis and\n\t\tfeat effects can often take an ally out of a fight for several rounds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-6\">6th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attack of Opportunity<\/span>: A fantastic feat,\n\t\tbut it conflicts with your Champion&#8217;s Reaction so you may not be able to use\n\t\tit consistently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Corrupted Shield<\/span>: (Evil only). It&#8217;s hard to\n\t\tfind a build where this fits. Antipaladin and Tyrant want to encourage\n\t\tattacks against them, and Shield Block is redundant for the Defiler. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re getting hit, you should be using Champion&#8217;s Reaction instead of\n\t\tShield Block. This would be really nice for good-aligned champions since\n\t\ttheir versions of Champion&#8217;s Reaction are less about defending\n\t\tthemselves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Invigorating Mercy<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Litany Against Wrath<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Loyal Warhorse<\/span>: If you chose Steed Ally,\n\t\tyou need to make your companion Mature to keep its stats good enough to keep\n\t\tit alive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Warden<\/span>: Shield Block reduces the\n\t\tdamage by the Hardness of your shield. The published shields made of special\n\t\tmaterials in the Core Rulebook have Hardness less than their level. By\n\t\tcomparison, your Champion&#8217;s Reaction reduces the damage by 2+your level and\n\t\tworks up to 15 ft. away. However, if you take Quick Block you get an extra\n\t\tReaction which you can only use for Shield Block, allowing you to use both\n\t\tShield Warden and your Champion&#8217;s Reaction in the same turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Smite Evil<\/span>: A bit of extra damage per\n\t\tStrike, and the duration extends every time your target attacks one of your\n\t\tallies. This creates a sort of Taunt effect, encouraging the foe to attack\n\t\tyou instead of your allies for at least one turn to end the effect. It&#8217;s\n\t\tunclear if enemies know about this mechanic, so check with your GM.\n\t\tRegardless, there&#8217;s no limit on how often you can use this, so any time that\n\t\tyou have a spare Action and don&#8217;t want to spend it on a Strike you can start\n\t\tthis. As far as I can tell, you can have this running on multiple foes\n\t\tsimultaneously, though I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a great option.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Smite Good<\/span>: (Evil only). Smite Evil, but\n\t\treversed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Advanced Deity&#8217;s Domain<\/span>: This is notably\n\t\tthe first option for the Champion to increase the size of their Focus Pool.\n\t\tAdvanced Domain spells are frequently very powerful, providing numerous\n\t\tmagical options otherwise not available to the Champion. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/domains\">Domains Breakdown<\/a> for help with\n\t\tDomains.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Mercy<\/span>: There are effects like the\n\t\tspell Blindness which can strike a target permanently blind or deaf. This\n\t\tchanges those effects from a massive handicap into a momentary\n\t\tinconvenience. You can also remove the Slowed effect, which is great\n\t\tconsidering the 1-Action casting time of Lay on Hands.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Cruelty<\/span>: Enfeebled is great for\n\t\tStrength-based enemies, Clumsy is great for Dexterity-based enemies and if\n\t\tyou want to lower the target&#8217;s AC, and Stupefied is great for spellcasters\n\t\tand if you want to reduce their Will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heal Mount<\/span>: Add 4 hit points per spell\n\t\tlevel of Lay on Hands. This is a 2\/3 increase in the amount healed, which is\n\t\tsignificant but hopefully not necessary. Consider this if you took Steed\n\t\tMount, but if you need to heal your mount often enough to need this you\n\t\tshould really consider other ways to protect your mount like barding.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Block<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using a shield,\n\t\tthis is absolutely essential. Your Champion&#8217;s Reaction is a much better use\n\t\tof your Reaction is most cases, but you can&#8217;t use it to protect yourself.\n\t\tThis allows you to protect yourself (or an ally if you took Shield Warden)\n\t\twithout losing the option to use Champion&#8217;s Reaction.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sacrifice Armor<\/span>: This is hard to justify.\n\t\tThe amount of damage reduced will be significant, but you&#8217;re almost\n\t\tcertainly in heavy armor and a -3 penalty until your armor is repaired is a\n\t\thuge price to pay to avoid some damage. That means that you&#8217;re likely going\n\t\tto save this for late in fights when you&#8217;re going to be attacked fewer times\n\t\tbetween breaking your armor and when you can repair it, and if you&#8217;re saving\n\t\tthis for late in fight just to save a few hit points you should look at\n\t\tbetter healing options instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Second Ally<\/span>: Divine Ally is a great\n\t\tability, and having two can be really useful. However, by this level the\n\t\tbasic benefits of Divine Ally may not be appealing compared to other feats,\n\t\tand you may have trouble finding enough feat slots to enhance your second\n\t\tDivine Ally.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sense Evil<\/span>: In most cases you can figure\n\t\tout who or what is evil with a little bit of real-world insight, and in\n\t\tcases where it&#8217;s not obvious this sense is vague to the point of being\n\t\tbarely helpful. You might be able to use this to detect that evil creatures\n\t\tare hidden or invisible nearby, but even then they might get a Deception\n\t\tcheck to avoid notice (consult your GM) and the Champion&#8217;s Perception\n\t\tprogression is terrible. If you desperately want this capability, take the\n\t\tmulticlass archetype feats for something with the Divine spell list and cast\n\t\tDetect Alignment.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sense Good<\/span>: (Evil only). Sense Evil but the\n\t\texact opposite.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Devoted Focus<\/span>: If you&#8217;re finding your\n\t\tFocus Spells to be very helpful and you took Advanced Deity&#8217;s Domain to\n\t\texpand your Focus Pool, this is very important. The wording on recovering\n\t\tFocus Points is very precise, so if you want your 2-point Focus Pool\n\t\trefilled this is one of the only ways to do it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elucidating Mercy<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Imposing Destrier<\/span>: The most important\n\t\tbenefit here is an improvement to your steed&#8217;s AC. If you&#8217;re doing fine\n\t\twithout that benefit, you may be able to skip this even if you&#8217;re heavily\n\t\treliant on Steed Ally.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Litany Against Sloth<\/span>: (Good only). See\n\t\tFocus Spells, below. You also add a Focus Point to your pool.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Litany of Self-Interest<\/span>: (Evil only). See\n\t\tFocus Spells, below. You also add a Focus Point to your pool.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Radiant Blade Spirit<\/span>: The basic set of\n\t\tproperty runes are fine but not very impressive. Flaming is a good go-to,\n\t\tbut Anarchic\/Axiomatic\/Holy runes are level 11 items that cost 1,400gp.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resilient Touch<\/span>: Nice, but not very\n\t\timpactful. +1 isn&#8217;t a big mathematical increase and it only lasts one\n\t\tround.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield of Reckoning<\/span>: Double down on\n\t\tprotecting your allies. The wording of the text is slightly confusing, but\n\t\tthis uses a single Reaction to perform both the Shield Block and Champion&#8217;s\n\t\tReaction Reactions, so you&#8217;re getting twice as much out of one Reaction as\n\t\tnormal. If you have Quick Block, you can still use that extra Reaction for\n\t\tShield Block.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Affliction Mercy<\/span>: DIsease and Poison can\n\t\tbe treated with the Medicine skill, but curses can be a serious issue. Of\n\t\tcourse, Remove Curse is a 4th-level spell on both the Divine and Occult\n\t\tspell lists, so by this level a cleric can easily handle all of these\n\t\tproblems.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Amplifying Touch<\/span>: The +1 bonus to attacks\n\t\twon&#8217;t make a huge difference, but if the target is weak to Good damage you\n\t\tcan easily turn this into a huge boost to your party&#8217;s damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Faith<\/span>: 1 damage only matters at\n\t\tthis level if you&#8217;re attacking tagets which have Vulnerability to Good\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blade of Justice<\/span>: In most cases, you won&#8217;t\n\t\tbe able to use this until the target attacks one of your allies in combat,\n\t\tconveniently making this a great combination with Smite Evil. When used,\n\t\tBlade of Justice is mechanically similar in many ways to the Fighter&#8217;s Power\n\t\tAttack feat, but it adds some other nice things. Adding the effects of\n\t\tRetributive Strike is a confusing way to think about things since\n\t\tRetributive Strike is just a normal Strike on its own. But by this level you\n\t\thave both Divine Smite and Exalt, so your Retributive Strikes applies\n\t\tpersistent Good damage and allies within 15 feet of you and in melee of the\n\t\ttarget can make a Strike at a -5 penalty as a Reaction. If you have one of\n\t\tthe Oath feats, the extra damage applies to your Strike. If you find that\n\t\tyou use this consistently, be sure to pick up Aura of Vengeance to reduce\n\t\tyour allies&#8217; penalty on the extra Strike and consider Instrument of Zeal for\n\t\ta bunch of extra damage if you score a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion&#8217;s Sacrifice<\/span>: The second\n\t\topportunity for the Champion to increase the size of their Focus Pool, and\n\t\tthis option doesn&#8217;t require two feats. Even if you never use Champion&#8217;s\n\t\tSacrifice even once, that&#8217;s a huge benefit. For more on Champion&#8217;s\n\t\tSacrifice, see Focus Spells, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Wall<\/span>: This means that most enemies\n\t\tcan&#8217;t step toward or away from you, meaning that they&#8217;re largely stuck in\n\t\tmelee with you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enforce Oath<\/span>: +1 status bonus to all\n\t\tthings against the target basically until you stop fighting it. Over that\n\t\tduration a +1 bonus is pretty good. Unfortunately, this requires you to take\n\t\tone ore more oath feats, and those generally aren&#8217;t very good. If you go\n\t\tthat route, since this only works once per hour try to save it for the\n\t\tbiggest thing in the room.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gruesome Strike<\/span>: (Evil only). If you used\n\t\tyour Champion&#8217;s Reaction last round, this is likely your best option for\n\t\tyour turn. The bonus damage is nice but not important, but Drained hits\n\t\treally hard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lasting Doubt<\/span>: A fantastic way to extend\n\t\tthe effects of your Champion&#8217;s Reaction. If you have Weight of Guilt, you\n\t\tcan make the target both Enfeebled and Stupefied, debuffing them\n\t\tconsiderably for several rounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Liberating Stride<\/span>: Situational. Stepping\n\t\tis typically sufficiency, and Striding can expose your allies to dangerous\n\t\tReactions.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pale Horse<\/span>: (Evil only). If you have a\n\t\tmount, it&#8217;s likely a big part of your tactics. That makes it an easy target\n\t\tfor your enemies. This will help discourage them from attacking it. I like\n\t\tthat the damage scales a bit, too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Anchoring Aura<\/span>: Situational. Potentially\n\t\texcellent against enemy spellcasters, but it seems unlikely that enemies\n\t\twill intentionally teleport within 15 feet of you. On top of that, you need\n\t\tFiendsbane Oath to get it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Life<\/span>: Situational, but more\n\t\tbroadly useful than Aura of Righteousness. Unfortunately, you Shining Oath\n\t\tto get it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Aura of Preservation<\/span>: Too situational\n\t\tunless your party is facing a weirdly large number of abberations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Righteousness<\/span>: Situational.\n\t\tResistance to damage of any kind is great, but evil damage is rare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Vengeance<\/span>: If you&#8217;re getting a\n\t\tlot of use out of your allies&#8217; attacks on Retribute Strike, this is a great\n\t\tidea. Much like Retributive Strike&#8217;s Exalt effect, this gets more useful\n\t\tdepending on how many melee allies you have.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Reflexes<\/span>: Too good to forgo. This\n\t\tlets you use your Champion&#8217;s Reaction twice in a round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Greater Interpose<\/span>: This makes it too easy\n\t\tto justify ruining your armor, which is likely among your most valuable\n\t\tpoesessions.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Litany of Depravity<\/span>: (Evil only). See\n\t\t&#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;, below. Your Focus Pool expands by 1 point<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Litany of Righteousness<\/span>: See &#8220;Focus\n\t\tSpells&#8221;, below. Your Focus Pool expands by 1 point.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wyrmbane Aura<\/span>: Resistant equal to your\n\t\tCharisma modifier to the 5 most common non-weapon damage types. The only\n\t\tproblem is that you also need the Dragonslayer Oath, which is not especially\n\t\tuseful on its own. In a way the two balance each other out because this is\n\t\tso much better than the equivalent aura feats for the other oaths.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Auspicious Mount<\/span>: Specializations offer\n\t\tsome new options for your mount, and the ability to speak is certainly\n\t\tinteresting, but you don&#8217;t strictly need this for your mount to be\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Expanded Aura<\/span>: Very situational. Generally\n\t\tif you can&#8217;t reach an ally who needs to be within your aura, you can spend\n\t\tthe same Action to either Strep or Stride to close the distance. You could\n\t\timagine scenarioes where you need to keep multiple allies within the aura\n\t\tbut who are in opposite directions, but if your allies insist on doing that\n\t\tyou should have a discussion with them about tactical positioning rather\n\t\tthan investing an extremely high-level Class Feat to occasionally solve that\n\t\tproblem. The fact that this only applies to one aura at a time is honestly\n\t\tinfuriating. Even if this applied to every aura feat you have I would\n\t\thesitate to rate this above <span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Instrument of Slaughter<\/span>: (Evil only). That\n\t\tis a huge amount of bleed damage, especially considering that evil champions\n\t\tmechanically favor two-handed weapons with large damage dice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Instrument of Zeal<\/span>: Slowed 1 robs the\n\t\ttarget of an Action on their turn, so between that and the extra damage die\n\t\tthis is an immensely satisfying addition your critical hits. Still, it\n\t\tdepends on a critical hit so it&#8217;s inherently unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield of Grace<\/span>: By this level you have\n\t\tlots of options to prevent damage to your ally, including using both your\n\t\tChampion&#8217;s Reaction and Shield Block against the same attack. Splitting the\n\t\tdamage between yourself and your ally is a very generous thing for you to\n\t\tdo, but try to prevent that damage instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Form<\/span>: Darkvision and permanent\n\t\tnon-magical flight. You also look super cool. if you chose Steed Ally you\n\t\tmay want to skip this and take Celestial Mount at level 20 instead because\n\t\tyour mount&#8217;s speed will be so much better than yours.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiendish Form<\/span>: (Evil only). Celestial\n\t\tForm, but you turn into a fiend instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rejuvenating Touch<\/span>: That&#8217;s a huge amount\n\t\tof temporary hit points. Sure, they don&#8217;t stack, but if the target is taking\n\t\tdamage with any sort of regularity this prevent a ton of it.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ultimate Mercy<\/span>: The time limit is\n\t\tproblematic, but if you&#8217;re close to your allies you can usually Stride to\n\t\tget into range for Lay on Hands. There doesn&#8217;t appear to be a usage\n\t\tlimitation beyond your Focus Points, so be sure to keep a Focus Point ready\n\t\tin case things go wrong.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Celestial Mount<\/span>: A bunch of great\n\t\timprovements to your mount, and also Weakness 10 to Evil damage.\n\t\tThematically it makes sense, but that doesn&#8217;t make me like it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fiendish Mount<\/span>: (Evil only). Celestial\n\t\tMount but evil.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Radiant Blade Master<\/span>: The new runes only\n\t\tlevel 13 or 14, just two levels higher than runes like Holy which are\n\t\tgranted by Radiant Blade Spirit 10 levels earlier. At this level the cost to\n\t\tadd these runes to a weapon is very reasonable, so you gain next to nothing\n\t\tfrom this feat. Spend the gold to get the rune normally, and use your level\n\t\t20 feat for something more interesting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sacred Defender<\/span>: A significant amount of\n\t\tresistance to the most common types of attack damage, and ignore natural\n\t\t20&#8217;s against you means that your unassailably high AC is flawless protection\n\t\tagainst swarms of low-level creatures who might otherwise try to hit you\n\t\tbased solely on the number of creatures rolling for a natural 20.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield Paragon<\/span>: By this level you&#8217;re\n\t\talmost certainly using an incredibly expensive shield like a high-grade\n\t\tadamantine shield, so a way to recover it if it&#8217;s broken is a great way to\n\t\tprotect your investment. You also get the benefit of having your shield\n\t\traised constantly, so you no longer need to spend an Action every turn to\n\t\traise it, leaving that Action free for more interesting things like\n\t\tattacking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Canny Acumen<\/span>: Your Perception never\n\t\tIncreases beyond Expert, so this becomes a great option when you reach level\n\t\t17.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Initiative<\/span>: The Champion&#8217;s\n\t\tPerception progression is terrible, and a +2 bonus to Initiative checks can\n\t\thelp to mitigate that.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ride<\/span>: You don&#8217;t need this to ride your\n\t\tSteed Ally because Animal Companions respond differently when you use the\n\t\tCommand an Animal action.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Toughness<\/span>: More hit points are always\n\t\tgreat, but Lay on Hands provides a significant amount of healing for a\n\t\tsingle Action, so it&#8217;s not as helpful as it is for other martial\n\t\tclasses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n<p>Much like the Fighter, the Champion gets access to the full range of martial<br>\n\tweapons and make excellent use of any of them.

A good Armor Specialization effect, and since it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t have the Bulwark trait you still get to enjoy your high Dexterity\n\t\tmodifier for Reflex saves. And don&#8217;t worry: you still get as much AC as Full\n\t\tPlate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Full Plate<\/span>: If you have less than 16\n\t\tDexterity, this is the best armor that you can get. Bulwak will override\n\t\tyour low Dexterity modifier to Reflex saves, helping to protect you from\n\t\tarea effect damage which can easily circumvent your unusually high AC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 id=\"focus-spells\">Champion Focus Spells &#8211; Devotion Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lay On Hands<\/span>: For a single Action, this is\n\t\ta big pile of healing. You can use it on yourself or an an ally, and since\n\t\tit&#8217;s a Focus Spell you can repeatedly Refocus and heal yourself out of\n\t\tcombat to ensure that you and your allies are always at full hit points.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Touch of Corruption<\/span>: A good pile of damage\n\t\tto living targets or a big pile of healing to undead targets. It works on a\n\t\tsingle Action and isn&#8217;t an attack, so it&#8217;s a great offensive option if you\n\t\thave already made multiple attacks this turn and your Multiple Attack\n\t\tPenalty is a problem. Remember that the healing option doesn&#8217;t necessarily\n\t\trequire you to be undead: some creatures like the Dhampir Versatile Heritage\n\t\tallow you to be healed by effects which normally heal undead creatures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Litany Against Wrath<\/span>: A nice way to deter\n\t\tenemies from harming you and your allies, and with 30-foot range and a\n\t\t1-Action casting time, this is a great option to fit into a turn that you\n\t\tspend moving and\/or attacking. However, it has some limitations. The spell\n\t\tonly takes effect of the target damages a Good creature, so the usefulness\n\t\tof the spell is significantly diminished if you have non-Good party members.\n\t\tThe effect is also clearly designed to be more effective against enemies\n\t\twhich rely on dealing damage, so foes with<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Litany of Self-Interest<\/span>: The duration is\n\t\tshort, but a +2 or +3 bonus is mathematically significant. While it\n\t\tdefinitely feels like you should use this on yourself, it may be more\n\t\teffective to put it on another martial ally because they&#8217;ll get their full\n\t\tturn to use the bonuses rather than their turn minus the 1 Action to cast\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Litany Against Sloth<\/span>: The flavor text on\n\t\tthis spell is extremely misleading; removing the target&#8217;s ability to take\n\t\tReactions is just part of the effect. The major effect is making the target\n\t\tSlowed, which robs them of one or more Actions. If you can spend one Action\n\t\tto rob the target one Action, you&#8217;re doing fine. Every Action after that\n\t\tjust further improves the value of the Focus Point that you spent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Champion&#8217;s Sacrifice<\/span>: Choosing to suffer\n\t\tthe full effects of an attack or a failed save is noble, but very dangeorus.\n\t\tThe 30 foot range on this makes it a good fallback when an ally is outside\n\t\tof your 15-foot range for Champion&#8217;s Reaction, so this extends your ability\n\t\tto protect your allies by another 15 feet. Interestingly, this effect\n\t\tbypasses any of your own resistances and immunities, so if you&#8217;re\n\t\thypothetically a robot which is immune to sleep, you can use this to be put\n\t\tto sleep instead of one of your allies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Litany of Depravity<\/span>: The Weakness value\n\t\tis really good, but the 1-round duration is a problem. You can likely make\n\t\ttwo more Strikes in the same turn, and the 14-20 damage (depending on the\n\t\tlevel at which you&#8217;re casting the spell) barely matchs the average damage\n\t\tfrom one more Strike an enhanced weapon at the level that this becomes\n\t\tavailable (assume 3d8+5 for a longsword, avg. 18.5). However, if you have\n\t\tother allies who can deal Evil damage, this is a spectacular way to focus a\n\t\tbunch of damage on one target in a hurry. Unfortunately this isn&#8217;t quite as\n\t\tuseful as Litany of Righteousness because evil champions don&#8217;t get ways to\n\t\tlet their allies deal evil damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Litany of Righteousness<\/span>: For one action, a\n\t\ttarget within 30 ft. gets Weakness to Good damage with no saving throw. The\n\t\tweakness matches the spell level, so it starts at 7 and maxes out at 10. On\n\t\tits own this might not seem like much, but considering Divine Smite added\n\t\tthe ability to apply persistent Good damage, not to mention all of the feats\n\t\tthat let you deal good damage with your attacks, and options like a Holy\n\t\tweapon property rune.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-10\">10th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hero&#8217;s Defiance<\/span>: A great way to keep\n\t\tyourself alive, especially since you can&#8217;t target yourself with Ultimate\n\t\tMercy. However, 10d4+20 only averages to 45 hit points, so don&#8217;t expect this\n\t\tto suddenly put your back into good shape to fight. You&#8217;ll likely want to\n\t\tend the fight as quickly as possible (or heal yourself) since you only get\n\t\tto use this once until your Refocus or perform daily preparations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Avenger<\/span>: Thematically very\n\t\tinteresting, but not good enough to justify the exhorbitant cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cassock of Devotion<\/span>: If you take feats to\n\t\tget domain Focus Spells, the extra Focus point can be very helpful.
