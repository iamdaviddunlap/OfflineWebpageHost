Well, here you go. Blood Kineticist is a mixed bag; some of the options are amazing, and some of them are bad. Overall, it balances out to a fair trade for what you give up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Focus<\/span> (Ex): Locking you into water is\n\t\tfine. Limiting the archetype&#8217;s Infusions to things with blood is really\n\t\tannoying since so many enemies are constructs, plants, undead, or things\n\t\twhich arguably don&#8217;t have blood (Abberations? Vermin?).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wrack<\/span> (Su): You won&#8217;t always need this,\n\t\tbut untyped damage is extremely rare and very powerful. Even if you run into\n\t\tsomething totally immune to your blast, this will hurt it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bleeding Infusion<\/span> (Su): Bleed damage\n\t\tusually isn&#8217;t great, but it also usually doesn&#8217;t do this much damage.\n\t\tCombine this with Wrack to get around resistances, and you can wait for an\n\t\tenemy to bleed to death instead of wasting all of your Burn to kill it with\n\t\tWrack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Tell<\/span> (Sp): Blood Biography is very\n\t\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Blast<\/span> (Su): Blood Blast is terrible\n\t\ton its own because it&#8217;s identical to water blast, but with more damage. The\n\t\tonly draw is that you get to use the Infusions from the archetype. Still,\n\t\tthat shouldn&#8217;t prevent you from considering other elements.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Throw<\/span> (Su): Foe throw is good, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s typically only available to aether users.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gut-Wrenching Infusion<\/span> (Su): At 3 points\n\t\tof Burn this is way too expensive for the effect. Sickened is an excellent\n\t\tdebuff, but 3 points of Burn is just too high.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Vampiric Infusion<\/span> (Su): Healing in combat\n\t\twithout cutting into your action economy is really nice. The Burn cost is\n\t\treally high, so be sure to use Gather Power to reduce it. You get\n\t\tSupercharge at the same level, so between Gather power and Infusion\n\t\tspecialization, you can easily reduce the Burn cost to 0. You still need to\n\t\taccept 1 Burn to heal, unfortunately.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Mastery<\/span> (Su): Living forever is\n\t\treally great in real life, but rarely matters in a campaign. The free age\n\t\tbonuses are also nice, but since Kineticists have so little dependence on\n\t\tmental ability scores you don&#8217;t have a good way to abuse them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Infusions (1st, 5th, 9th, 11th), Utility Wild Talents (6th, 8th), Expanded Element (Altered), Omnikinesis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"elemental-annihilator\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/kineticist\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes\/elemental-annihilator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elemental Annihilator<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This archetype is garbage. There are clear design holes which make it functionally unplayable. The concept is fine: give up utility options for even more damage output. The execution means that you actually deal <em>less<\/em> damage than a vanilla Kineticist, in addition to giving up all of your non-combat options. The whole archetype is build around Devastating Infusion and Flurry of Devastation. Devastating Infusion cripples your damage output, and expects that your damage output will scale based on Flurry of Devastation, but without full BAB Flurry of Devastation is really weak. Imagine a fighter, but with half as meany feats, bad proficiencies, and only 2\/3 BAB. That is the amount of damage output you can expect from this archetype.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Devastating Infusion<\/span> (Su): There is a lot\n\t\tgoing on in this Infusion, so read it a couple times to make sure you\n\t\tunderstand it. You can still use your Blast as normal since this is a Form\n\t\tinfusion. I&#8217;ll explain a bit to help, and we&#8217;ll break it down line by\n\t\tline.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;an elemental annihilator can either shoot her kinetic blast at a target\n\t\t\twithin 30 feet or make a single melee attack&#8230;&#8221;: You can use this at\n\t\t\trange or in melee, which is really fantastic.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;&#8230;as if she were using kinetic blade&#8230;&#8221;: If you attack in melee, you\n\t\t\tuse this Infusion as part of another action (see next point) and doing so\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t provoke attacks of opportunity. You form the weapon for the\n\t\t\tattack, and it disappears at the end of your turn. Normally Kinetic Blade\n\t\t\tdoes the same damage as your blast, but you deal 1d8+Con damage as\n\t\t\tdetailed below.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;&#8230;as an attack action.&#8221;: That&#8217;s the action &#8220;attack&#8221;, which is a\n\t\t\tstandard action, so you can&#8217;t use this with full attacks.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;For this attack, the elemental annihilator&#8217;s base attack bonus from her\n\t\t\tkineticist levels is equal to her full kineticist level.&#8221;: For one attack\n\t\t\tyou dump your 2\/3 BAB and get full BAB. Remember that it&#8217;s only for your\n\t\t\tKineticist levels, so if you multiclass you still use whatever BAB you get\n\t\t\tfrom this levels.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;A devastating infusion always deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 +\n\t\t\tthe elemental annihilator&#8217;s Constitution modifier, regardless of the\n\t\t\tannihilator&#8217;s class level or use of composite blasts.&#8221;: At first level,\n\t\t\tthis is fine. It matches the 1d6+1+Con damage of a physical blast.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, this damage never increases so this Form infusion will fall\n\t\t\tbehind your normal Blast damage by level 3. Remember that this damage is\n\t\t\t<em>instead of<\/em> your normal Blast damage, not in addition to.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;When making a melee attack with devastating infusion, the elemental\n\t\t\tannihilator doesn&#8217;t provoke attacks of opportunity,&#8230;&#8221;: The &#8220;as if she\n\t\t\twere using Kinetic Blast&#8221; part should have made this clear, but it&#8217;s good\n\t\t\tthat the text is explicit.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;&#8230; and if she uses two hands, the attack&#8217;s damage is equal to 1d8 +\n\t\t\t1-1\/2 times her Constitution modifier.&#8221;: At 1st level, this is great. It\n\t\t\tmight even match your normal Blast damage at 3rd level. Oh, and this part\n\t\t\tonly works in melee, so no two-handed ranged blasts.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn&#8230;&#8221;: This\n\t\t\tworks just like a normal Form Infusion. You can combine it with Substace\n\t\t\tInfusions just like any other Form Infusion.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;&#8230;and can be used with any physical blast (but not energy blasts).&#8221;: If\n\t\t\tyou want to use this Infusion, you&#8217;ll need to pick an element with a\n\t\t\tphysical basic blast. That means no fire.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Unlike with kinetic blade, the elemental annihilator can use Vital\n\t\t\tStrike with devastating infusion.&#8221;: This means that Vital Strike is the\n\t\t\tonly way to scale this Infusion&#8217;s damage. Even if you did that, you would\n\t\t\tstill max out at 4d8+Con damage, which is pitiful and a massive waste of\n\t\t\tfeats. Unfortunately, you still only have 2\/3 BAB so you&#8217;re going to get\n\t\t\tthe feats very slowly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dampened Versatility<\/span> (Ex): Utility talents\n\t\tare excellent, and losing them is a big handicap.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: The feats are good, but\n\t\tnowhere near as good as utility talents.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2nd Level\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deadly Aim<\/span>: If you&#8217;re built to\n\t\t\t\t\tfight at range, this is an excellent damage boost.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Double Slice<\/span>: The extra damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tbig enough since you won&#8217;t get as many attacks as a TWF build with\n\t\t\t\t\tfull BAB.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Point-Blank Shot<\/span>: Crucial for ranged\n\t\t\t\t\tattackers.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Shot<\/span>: Crucial for ranged\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattackers with allies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapid Shot<\/span>: Worthless until you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tget Flurry of Devastation at 6th level, but after that it will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallow you to make extra attacks and get more damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Attack<\/span>: A fantastic boost to\n\t\t\t\t\tyour damage output if you&#8217;re in melee.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: More attacks\n\t\t\t\t\tmay result in more damage than making your attacks two-handed,\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially once you have the damage bonuses from Blast Training and\n\t\t\t\t\tWeapon Specialization.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: Your attack deals\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage based on your Constitution, so you don&#8217;t get any benefit from\n\t\t\t\t\thigh Strength except access to Power Attack. You also need high\n\t\t\t\t\tDexterity to survive in light armor.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Focus<\/span>: More attack bonus is\n\t\t\t\t\talways nice, and you have 2\/3 BAB and few ways to get attack bonuses\n\t\t\t\t\ton your own.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>8th Level\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: If\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re going to use Flurry of Devastation in melee, you probably want\n\t\t\t\t\tthis for the extra attacks. However, at 2\/3 BAB you have trouble\n\t\t\t\t\thitting reliably.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: Flurry of\n\t\t\t\t\tDevastation is all about spamming attacks, so small damage bonuses\n\t\t\t\t\tlike this add up quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>10th Level\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"reen\">Greater Weapon Focus<\/span>: More attack bonus is\n\t\t\t\t\talways nice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Critical<\/span>: Doubling your\n\t\t\t\t\tthreat range on 20&#215;2 is not worth a feat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Precise Shot<\/span>: Crucial for\n\t\t\t\t\tany ranged attacker with allies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Two-Weapon Rend<\/span>: This feat is\n\t\t\t\t\tgarbage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Increased Range<\/span> (Su): Locking you into\n\t\tthese Infusions isn&#8217;t much fun, especially since you&#8217;ll need them so\n\t\tinfrequently.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ever-Preasant Threat<\/span> (Su): Neat, but you\n\t\tcould also threaten by wearing a gauntlet.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blast Training<\/span> (Ex): A bit of attack and\n\t\tdamage bonus will keep your attacks roughly on par with magically enhanced\n\t\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Flurry of Devastation<\/span> (Su): This is the\n\t\tdefining feature of the archetype. You don&#8217;t get it until 6th level, and\n\t\twhen you finally get it, it doesn&#8217;t work as I think it was intended to.\n\t\tUnless you have Rapid Shot or Two-Weapon Fighting, making a Full Attack\n\t\twon&#8217;t get you anything until 8th level. You&#8217;re stuck with the garbage damage\n\t\tfrom Devastating Infusion, and you don&#8217;t get the BAB boost so you don&#8217;t get\n\t\titerative attacks early.\n\t<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Omnicide<\/span> (Su): 50d6+50 damage is\n\t\tterrifying. The Burn cost is high, but using Gather Power and firing every\n\t\tother turn may be the most effective option available to the Elemental\n\t\tAnnihilator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Basic utility wild talent normally granted by selecting an element, Infusions (1st, 5th), Utility Wild Talents, Omnikinesis<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"elemental-ascetic\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/kineticist\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes\/elemental-ascetic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elemental Ascetic<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elemental Ascetic merges the Kineticist&#8217;s elemental powers with the martial style of the Monk. The flavor is really cool, and some built-in melee mechanics make melee Kineticists much simpler. However, like the Monk, the Elemental Ascetic is very MAD. You need four good ability scores to function, which is hard to manage. Playing this archetype will be mechanically difficult, and you&#8217;ll need to invest heavily in ability score enhancement items and items to compensate for your relatively poor AC due to lack of armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Flurry<\/span> (Su): This is not the\n\t\tMonk&#8217;s Unarmed Strike. You don&#8217;t get the damage progression. Instead, you\n\t\trely on Kinetic Fist for damage, which is unfortunate because Kinetic Fist\n\t\tapplies 1\/3 of the damage dice you get from a normal Blast. That means that\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll be dealing 1d6 energy damage until 7th level. Fortunately, you get\n\t\tFlurry of Blows as a Monk of your level, so you&#8217;ll get to make multiple\n\t\tattacks, potentially allowing you to exceed the damage you would deal with a\n\t\tsingle Blast. Unfortunately, you also give up access to every form infusion\n\t\twhich isn&#8217;t an AOE, so your ability to use blasts at range is massively\n\t\treduced.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Wisdom<\/span> (Su): Switching your\n\t\tprimary ability score to Wisdom is a serious handicap. Focusing on\n\t\tConstitution increases the size of your Burn pool, not to mention addressing\n\t\tyour problematic hit points. A normal Kineticist needs a bit of Wisdom to\n\t\tcompensate for their poor Will saves, but they don&#8217;t need to emphasize it\n\t\tsignificantly. If nothing else, the emphasis on Wisdom means that your Will\n\t\tsaves will be decent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">AC Bonus<\/span> (Ex): The Monk&#8217;s AC bonus is\n\t\tpretty great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Powerful Fist<\/span> (Su): One damage die size\n\t\tincrease means 1 more damage per die on average. Since this costs Burn,\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll generally use this as an occasionaly damage boost. Infusion\n\t\tSpecialization will reduce the cost, but it doesn&#8217;t stay in sync with the\n\t\tcost of the ability, and using the damage boost reduces your ability to use\n\t\tSubstance Infusions, so using the damage boost carries an opportunity\n\t\tcost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Kinetic Blast (Altered), Elemental Overflow, key ability scores of wild talents, Elemental Defense, Infusions (5th, 9th, 13th)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kinetic-chirurgeon\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/kineticist\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes\/kinetic-chirurgeon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kinetic Chirurgeon<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kinetic Chirurgeon gives up all of the flexibility of Infusions in exchange for the ability to be a mediocre healbot. If you want to play a healbot, play a Cleric. Also, don&#8217;t play a healbot because they&#8217;re boring and not very useful. Just buy a wand of cure light wounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Kinetic Chirurgery<\/span> (Su): Mercies are\n\t\tpretty great, and they allow you to solve problems well beyond simple\n\t\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metahealer<\/span> (Su): Access to Breath of Life\n\t\tis amazing, even if your target needs to accept Burn to get it. A bit of\n\t\tBurn is an easy trade for your life.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Healing Buffer<\/span> (Su): Free healing is\n\t\tnice, but you give up a ton of versatility to get it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Infusions, Metakinesis, Infusion Specialization, Internal Buffer (Altered)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"overwhelming-soul\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/kineticist\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-kineticist-archetypes\/overwhelming-soul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Overwhelming Soul<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Overwhelming Soul is a surprisingly large change to the class, considering it only has three abilities. The end result is that the class is easier to play, involves less resource management, and doesn&#8217;t need to balance the risks of Burn. If you&#8217;re new to Pathfinder and want to play a Kineticist, this archetype is a great option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mind Over Matter<\/span> (Ex): Switching your\n\t\tprimary ability is a weird trade. You&#8217;re turning a dump stat into your\n\t\tprimary stat, which makes a very SAD class more MAD. However, I think the\n\t\tKineticist can handle it, especially since this makes Elves and Halflings\n\t\tmuch more appealing. The additional class skills also make the Kineticist\n\t\tinto an effective Face, giving you something to do with your 4+ skill\n\t\tranks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mental Prowess<\/span> (Su): Giving up the\n\t\tability to accept Burn is a potentially huge handicap, but it also makes the\n\t\tKineticist much easier to play.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Overwhelming Power<\/span> (Ex): Elemental\n\t\tOverflow with a smaller bonus, you don&#8217;t need to accept Burn to get it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Class skills (Altered), the key ability score of wild talents, Burn (Altered), Internal Buffer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Kineticists have a couple of interesting options, but nothing that&#8217;s especially exciting.
