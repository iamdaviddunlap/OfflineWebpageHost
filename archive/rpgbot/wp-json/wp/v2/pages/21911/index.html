It is a stellar Defender build, and, while it has few offensive options, it does include Spirit Guardians, allowing the Paladin to turn themselves into a magical blender like a cleric does.

Note that Compelled Duel is somewhat redundant with Champion\n\t\t\t\tChallenge, but Compelled Duel only affects single targets, while\n\t\t\t\tChampion Challenge is an area effect. Also remember that your spell save\n\t\t\t\tDC won&#8217;t be as high as a full spellcaster&#8217;s (unless you build around\n\t\t\t\tBlessed Warrior), which can make both of these spells somewhat\n\t\t\t\tunreliable.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th-Level<\/span>: Warding Bond is nice if\n\t\t\t\tyou have another ally who is taking a lot of damage and you&#8217;re sick of\n\t\t\t\tspending your turns healing them. Zone of Truth is very situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th-Level<\/span>: Aura of Vitality is an\n\t\t\t\textremely efficient use of a spell slot as far as magical healing goes,\n\t\t\t\tbut I wouldn&#8217;t use it in combat because it requires Concentration and\n\t\t\t\tmonopolizes your Bonus Action which you might need for things like smite\n\t\t\t\tspells, and outside of combat you should try to rely on short rests for healing as\n\t\t\t\tmuch as you can. Spirit Guardians is a much better option in combat,\n\t\t\t\tturning you into the center of a magical blender that deals radiant\n\t\t\t\tdamage. You&#8217;ll still need to chase enemies around to force them to take\n\t\t\t\tdamage since Champion Challenge allows enemies to remain up to 30\n\t\t\t\tfeet away, but, in close quarters, Spirit Guardians is exceptionally\n\t\t\t\tpowerful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: Banishment is\n\t\t\t\tsituational and can be difficult due to the Paladin&#8217;s comparably poor\n\t\t\t\tspell save DC, but many extraplanar enemies have poor Charisma saves, so\n\t\t\t\tyou may be able to use it successfully against some enemies. Guardian of\n\t\t\t\tFaith is really only notable for its 8-hour duration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th-Level<\/span>: Circle of Power is an\n\t\t\t\texcellent buff when facing enemy spellcasters, especially with the Aura\n\t\t\t\tof Protection boosting all of your save bonuses. Geas is situational\n\t\t\t\tsince most of the things on which you might cast Geas can be handled\n\t\t\t\tbetter by killing them.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Channel Divinity<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion Challenge<\/span>: This is a great\n\t\t\t\tway to keep enemies where you want them, especially in open areas\n\t\t\t\toutside of the confines of a dungeon. 30 feet is close enough for most\n\t\t\t\tcharacters to get into melee without Dashing (halflings and dwarves may\n\t\t\t\tneed a reach weapon to compensate), so, even if enemies try to run, they\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t get far enough that you need to go to great lengths to chase them.\n\t\t\t\tIf you position yourself correctly, you may also be able to keep enemies\n\t\t\t\taway from your allies, allowing your allies to attack at range while\n\t\t\t\tyour enemies either struggle at the edge of your 30-foot radius or\n\t\t\t\tresign themselves to fighting you.\n\t\t\t\t<p>Enemies can escape by doing silly things like pushing or pulling each\n\t\t\t\t\tother out of the area, but if your DM tries that they are either\n\t\t\t\t\tpulling some very serious metagame shenanigans or the affected\n\t\t\t\t\tcreatures have had time to experiment and figure out how this effect\n\t\t\t\t\tworks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The ability doesn&#8217;t allow additional saves beyond the first, and\n\t\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t list a duration, so you can technically keep enemies trapped\n\t\t\t\t\twithin 30 feet of your forever as long as you don&#8217;t do something to\n\t\t\t\t\tend the effect (like walking away from them) and no one else\n\t\t\t\t\tintervenes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Turn the Tide<\/span>: Basically Mass\n\t\t\t\tHealing Word. It does affect\n\t\tunconscious allies, as <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/u67o2kE6InA?t=1352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the\n\t\tUnconscious condition was not intended to deafen creatures<\/a> according\n\t\tto Jeremy Crawford.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Allegiance<\/span>: This is considerably\n\t\tbetter than the Protection combat style because it&#8217;s 100% reliable. As a\n\t\tPaladin, you are the party&#8217;s Defender, so sometimes tanking comes down to\n\t\ttaking damage destined for your weaker allies. This is a lot like Warding\n\t\tBond since it works against any damage source, but you are still limited by\n\t\tyour Reaction, so multiple hits to your allies may be a problem.\n<p>If you plan to use this on a regular basis, you want as many hit points as you can get and you want a reliable source of temporary hit points on top.<\/p>\n<p>This also allows you to protect a mount, which is a much-needed defensive option for mounted combat enthusiasts. Mundane mounts and mounts available via Find Steed and Find Greater Steed are notoriously prone to dying if anything thinks to attack them, and even the Mounted Combatant feat is a poor defense. Divine Allegiance may be the best option available.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unyielding Spirit<\/span>: Between this and Aura\n\t\tof Protection, you&#8217;re nearly immuned to paralyzed\/stunned. But those\n\t\tconditions aren&#8217;t common, so this is only situationally useful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"20\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exalted Champion<\/span>: For one hour a day you\n\t\tand your allies are exceptionally difficult to kill. Most paladin capstones\n\t\tonly last for one minute, so getting literally 60 times the duration is a\n\t\tmassive improvement.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Oath of the Crown Paladin Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">typical paladin<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Oath of the Crown Paladin Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/#races\" data-type=\"page\">typical paladin<\/a>, but a few races offer some features which work especially well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Bugbear<\/span\n\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MotM<\/a><\/sup>:\nLong-limbed combines with a reach weapon to let you attack on your turn up to 15 feet away, making it much less taxing to be stuck adjacent to whoever you&#8217;re protecting.
