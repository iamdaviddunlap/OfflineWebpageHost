Themed around nature and\n\texploration, the Ranger is a welcome asset in parties exploring untamed lands\n\tabove or below ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Ranger can fill the role of either a Fighter-equivalent or a\n\tRogue-equivalent (sometimes both), and works well as a Scout and Striker, but\n\ttrades the Fighter&#8217;s durability for better skills and improved damage output.\n\tWhile they do have the ability to cast spells, and can therefore provide\n\thealing and utility options, the Ranger doesn&#8217;t have nearly enough magic to\n\tserve as a Healer or a Utility caster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Rangers are a cool concept that has long captured players&#8217; imaginations, but they&#8217;ve been plagued by mechanical issues since they were first introduced, literally decades before the original release of 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. The features which make them unique and interesting often go unused because they force rangers to specialize in solving problems and fighting enemies which players can&#8217;t guarantee that they&#8217;ll face. The Ranger&#8217;s Favored Enemy and Natural Explorer features ask players to choose creatures and places which the Ranger specializes in fighting, and if those things don&#8217;t appear in the game the features are essentially wasted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further torment ranger players, the Beast Master subclass as it was published in the Player&#8217;s Handbook was so frustratingly bad that it poisoned the community&#8217;s opinion of rangers to the point that years later the Ranger is still the character optimization community&#8217;s favorite punching bag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 5+ years into 5e&#8217;s life span, the Ranger has come into its own. The\n\tintroduction of numerous exciting subclasses like the Gloom Stalker and the\n\tSwarm Keeper, rules fixes like new ways to handle the Beast Master&#8217;s\n\tcompanion, and Optional Class Features which replace the Ranger&#8217;s least-useful\n\tfeatures have all made great strides to make the Ranger both fun and\n\teffective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

Rangers also get three skills, which is unusually\n\thigh, but since Rangers fall somewhere between a Fighter-equivalent and\n\tRogue-equivalent, it makes sense that they get an extra skill.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Rangers are half casters, which means that their spellcasting advances half as quickly as full spellcasters like the Druid. They get numerous exclusive spells, such as Hunter&#8217;s Mark and Hail of Thorns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Favored Enemy<\/span>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/spells\/hunters-mark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hunter&#8217;s Mark<\/a> is a central part of the Ranger&#8217;s capabilities. Several class features and some subclass features all tie into Hunter&#8217;s Mark, so in many cases it&#8217;s assumed that you have Hunter&#8217;s Mark running. This presents a persistent resource and action economy tax, but Favored Enemy provides some free castings each day, which lightens the load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunter&#8217;s Mark, and therefore the Favored Enemy feature, can be one of the most frustrating parts of playing the Ranger. Monopolizing your Concentration and your Bonus Action can limit your other options in ways that can make the class frustrating to play, especially when consider that the Ranger&#8217;s class features at levels 13, 17, and 20 only work while using Hunter&#8217;s Mark. But remember that because Favored Enemy makes Hunter&#8217;s Mark inexpensive, it&#8217;s easier to cast it, drop it, then cast it again later if you need to Concentrate on a different spell. You can only use Favored Enemy for Hunter&#8217;s Mark, so you might as well use it like the cheap resource that it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bonus Action casting\/reapplying time for Hunter&#8217;s Mark needs some special attention when planning your build. Combat typically lasts 3 rounds. Expect to apply Hunter&#8217;s Mark on turn 1 in a typical encounter, leaving 2 more Bonus Actions for the rest of the encounter. If you&#8217;re facing multiple enemies, you might need to move Hunter&#8217;s Mark again, costing another Bonus Action. You also have several spells which consume your Bonus Acton on hit like Ensnaring Strike, Hail of Thorns, and Lightning Arrow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these restrictions on your action economy, options which consume your Bonus Action can be less appealing. Crossbow Expert, Dual Wielder, and Polearm Master are less reliable for the Ranger than for other martial classes like the Fighter. You might still get use out of those options in encounters where you choose not to cast Hunter&#8217;s Mark, but the feats may not be worth their cost if you&#8217;re not consistently getting their full benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concentration can also be an issue, but the Ranger has surprisingly few combat spells which require Concentration. Ensnaring Strike is among the only options in the 2024 Player&#8217;s Handbook which compete for your Concentration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: Excellent on any martial character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Weapon Mastery, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/weapon-mastery\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"29315\">Weapon Mastery Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Explorer<\/span>: Expertise is great, but you only get one, so choose wisely. I recommend either Perception or Stealth. The languages will rarely matter in most games, and you&#8217;re certainly not your party&#8217;s Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Style<\/span>: See Fighting Styles under Feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Ranger subclasses are briefly summarized below.

A climb speed is the next best thing to a fly speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>9. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Expertise<\/span>: Excellent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>10. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Tireless<\/span>: The Temporary Hit Points are basically an additional Ranger level worth of hit points. Most Rangers will have Wisdom modifiers around +2 or +3 at this point, which is enough to use this after most rests. You never want to use this in combat, but coming out of a rest with full hp and a pad of THP works great. The ability to recover Exhaustion quickly is nice, but not super impactful. It does allow you to use rests to recover from the Exhaustion caused by lack of food and water, which is weird to think about, but not really impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>13. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless Hunter<\/span>: Hunter&#8217;s Mark is central to the Ranger&#8217;s tactics, especially if your subclass interacts with it, and with no proficiency in Constitution saves you&#8217;ve been struggling to maintain Concentration since level 1. This will make your life much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature&#8217;s Veil<\/span>: Invisibility for two turns a few times per day. Since this is the Invisible condition rather than the spell Invisibility, you&#8217;re free to attack and do whatever else you like without breaking Invisibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Hunter<\/span>: This is a massive improvement to your damage output. If you were using a Vex weapon, consider switching to something else since Vex will stop being impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Feral Senses<\/span>: 30 feet is a ton of Blindsight. This will make hidden and invisible enemies a non-issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20. <span class=\"rating-red\">Foe Slayer<\/span>: A pitifully small damage increase. Considering how great the Ranger&#8217;s other high-level features are, this feels really disappointing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-ranger-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Ranger Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Spellcasting. Moved from level 2 to level 1. You can now change one prepared spell per long rest. Rangers are no longer locked into their spell choices until they gain another Ranger level, making their spellcasting much less restrictive.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Favored Enemy. Hunter\u2019s Mark always prepared for free, and 2 free castings per Long Rest. Scales up to 6, matching Proficiency Bonus progression for a single-class Ranger. Many of the Ranger\u2019s class and subclass features work based on using Hunter\u2019s Mark, which means that we are once again defaulting to ranger concentrating on Hunter\u2019s Mark at all times. Ugh. We had a few years post-Tasha\u2019s where there were other interesting choices, and apparently WotC didn\u2019t like that.<br><br>Fortunately, Concentration has been removed from Magic Weapon. Doing DPR calculations for 2014 builds revealed that alternating between Magic Weapon and Elemental Weapon was actually more effective than using Hunter\u2019s Mark. Now you can combine Magic Weapon with Hunter\u2019s Mark to get even more damage output. Unfortunately, Elemental Weapon still requires Concentration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Weapon Mastery. New.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Natural Explorer. Gone. Replaced by Deft Explorer, Roving, and Tireless.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Deft Explorer. Mostly matches the \u201cCanny\u201d Optional Class Feature, but you get 2 languages instead of 1.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Fighting Style. Same changes as the Fighter; Fighting Styles are feats now. Rangers can now pick from any Fighting Style (2014 rangers have a restricted list). Alternatively, you can choose Druidic Warrior to get two druid cantrips.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Roving. Nearly identical to the Optional Class Feature, but the speed increase is raised to +10 feet and this now doesn\u2019t function in heavy armor.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>9. Expertise. New. Rangers previously only got Expertise in one skill from Canny, and they now get a total of 3.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Tireless. Mostly identical to the Optional Class Feature of the same name, but the uses of the Temporary Hit Points action are now based on your Wisdom modifier instead of your Proficiency Bonus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>13. Relentless Hunter. New.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Nature\u2019s Veil. Mostly identical to the Optional Class Feature of the same name, but the uses are now based on your Wisdom modifier instead of your Proficiency Bonus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>17. Precise Hunter. New.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>18. Feral Senses. No longer a weird invisibility detector; now it\u2019s just Blindsight.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Foe Slayer. Hunter\u2019s Mark improves from 1d6 damage to 1d10. That is\u2026 disappointing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Ranger Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An increase to Dexterity is too crucial to forego, so any Background which\n\tdoesn&#8217;t include Dexterity is immediately out.

Constitution is always helpful, and rangers should invest a\n\tlittle bit in Wisdom to support their spellcasting and crucial skills like\n\tPerception. While this does make the ranger somewhat MAD (Multiple Ability\n\tDependent), they don&#8217;t need to spread themselves thin as the Monk or the\n\tPaladin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength-based builds are technically possible, but face additional difficulties not faced by Dexterity-based builds. Half plate (the best medium armor) imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks but still requires you to invest in Dexterity, making you even more MAD than the Monk and the Paladin. You&#8217;ll be able to use two-handed melee weapons, but there&#8217;s very little reason to do so when so much of the Ranger&#8217;s damage can come from Hunter&#8217;s Mark. To summarize: Strength-based builds suffer immediate setbacks, and gain essentially no benefit. Do not build a Strength-based Ranger unless you are very certain that you know what you&#8217;re doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Druidic Warrior allows for Wisdom-based builds. Take the Shillelagh\n\tcantrip and a ranged attack cantrip like Produce Flame, and you can fight both\n\tin melee and at range using Wisdom instead of Strength or Dexterity.\n\tFurthermore, your spellcasting will be more effective. However, you&#8217;ll likely\n\tresort to medium armor and suffer the same challenges with Dexterity (Stealth)\n\tchecks faced by Strength-based builds. The improved spellcasting and\n\tWisdom-based skills can be worth the trade, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the Ranger&#8217;s\n\tMAD issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PHB recommended ability scores assume a Dexterity-based build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic -

Martial Arts offers a good way to get additional attacks, though it will compete for your Bonus Action with applying Hunter&#8217;s Mark and casting other combat spells, which might be frustrating. Martial Arts also lets you use Dexterity for many non-Finesse melee weapons, dramatically expanding your weapon options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue<\/span>: 1 level for Expertise and more Weapon Mastery. 2 levels for Cunning Action.

Themed around nature and exploration, the Ranger is a welcome asset in parties exploring untamed lands above or below ground. The Ranger can fill the role of either a Fighter-equivalent or a Rogue-equivalent (sometimes both), and works well as a Scout and Striker, but trades the Fighter&#8217;s durability for better skills and improved damage output.
