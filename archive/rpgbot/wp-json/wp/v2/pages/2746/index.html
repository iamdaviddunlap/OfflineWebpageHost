They are defined more by their Dexterity increase than their Wisdom increase, and the Kenku is a go-to race for stealthy characters. With the custom origin rules or the updated version of the Kenku published in Monsters of the Multiverse, the Kenku is defined primarily by its skill proficiencies and Mimicry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Thematically, the Kenku is a fantastically unique race with some interesting\n\tquirks. They are spectular imitators, but lack creativity. They can mimic\n\tsounds and ideas, but don&#8217;t have their own voices and can&#8217;t come up with plans\n\ton their own. This is an interesting roleplaying challenge; how do you play a\n\tgame that&#8217;s so dependent on clever thinking when your character can only\n\tregurgitate ideas which it heard elsewhere?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the updated version of the Kenku published in Monsters of the\n\tMultiverse discards much of that. While kenku are still fantastic at mimicry\n\tand imitation, WotC removed the Kenku&#8217;s inability to devise novel ideas or to\n\tspeak without mimicking other sounds and voices. There&#8217;s nothing to stop you\n\tfrom playing a kenku who relies entirely on mimicry, plagiarism, and\n\tduplication of other creatures&#8217; behaviors, ideas, and speech, but it&#8217;s not\n\tlonger the expectation. That does remove some of the novelty of the race, but\n\tit also means that players might not feel as restrained in their actions when\n\tplaying a kenku.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#kenku-vs-tabaxi\">Kenku vs. Tabaxi<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#speech\">Kenku Speech<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#kenku-versions\">Kenku Versions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-custom-origin\">Kenku Classes (Customizable Origins)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-default\">Kenku Classes (Classic Rules)<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Their ability score increases\n\tare similar and they recieves similar skill proficiencies. However, the minor\n\tdifferences between the two leave some room for one to excel over the other\n\tdepending on the needs of the class or build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"speech\">Kenku Speech<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Kenku&#8217;s unique method of speech is probably the most iconic feature of the\n\trace, and playing with this limitation draws many players to the Kenku over\n\tthe Tabaxi or the Wood Elf, which offer similar racial traits. However, many\n\tplayers misinterpret how the Kenku&#8217;s speech mechanics work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenku are capable of perfectly reproducing sounds which they hear, including\n\tvoices. There is no written limitation on how many sounds and voices you can\n\tremember and mimic, which means that any given kenku can build a nearly\n\tlimitless library of sounds to imitate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an absolute worst-case scenario where a kenku has been exposed to\n\ttrivially small amounts of speech, they can either repeat words or short\n\tphrases in their entirety. Imagine only being able to speek in star wars\n\tprequel memes. Sure, you can respond to nearly any situation with one of the\n\tlines you know, but you lose a lot of nuance and specificity. This is the way\n\tmany players portray the Kenku&#8217;s Mimicry trait, and again: this is the\n\tabsolute worst-case scenario. A kenku which speaks this way has likely never\n\tmet a non-kenku capable of speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more normal scenario would be a kenku who has heard several conversations\n\tbetween other speaking creatures over the course of their lifetime. Based on\n\treal-world research performed on speech patterns for natural language\n\tinterfaces like Siri and Alexa or for things like &#8220;deep fakes&#8221;, a computer can\n\treplicate the speech of a real human with reasonable accuracy based on\n\trecordings of\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/3k7mgn\/baidu-deep-voice-software-can-clone-anyones-voice-with-just-37-seconds-of-audio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just a few seconds of speech<\/a>. Kenku are natural mimics biologically predisposed to this capacity, and I\n\thave absolutely no doubt that a race of natural mimics could replicate natural\n\thuman speech after a hearing a few minutes of speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In extreme cases, kenku might learn speech in the same way that natural language interfaces do. Spoken language is composed of a collection of specific sounds rearranged in different orders to create sounds that we recognize as words. People whose voices are used as the basis for computerized speech (Siri, Alexa, etc.) participate in recording sessions where they record a library of these sounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These sounds are then arranged by computers to produce audible speech which can be adjusted in a few ways to sound like real speech. Kenku can do the same thing. A smart master could sit down with their kenku minions and read off a bunch of sounds, allowing kenku to speech almost naturally. Kenku could then perfectly mimic this teaching session, spreading the original master&#8217;s voice throughout the population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even in the best of cases it&#8217;s not clear if kenku are creative\n\tenough to alter the inflection of their voices. A kenku which has been coached\n\twith a full range of sounds to replicate speech might still only be able to\n\tspeak in monotone, and kenku that assemble speech from a broad collection of\n\tsources might sound disjointed and fluxuate wildly in tone and pitch like an\n\told Speak &amp; Spell. Individual families of kenku might all share one voice\n\twhich has been passed down for generations, allowing outsiders to identify\n\tregional kenku populations by their shared voices. These concepts aren&#8217;t\n\texplored in the official text, but it&#8217;s an interesting thought exercise, and\n\tit&#8217;s great fodder for roleplaying.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kenku-versions\">Kenku Versions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There are effectively three versions of the Kenku. The original was published\n\tin Volo&#8217;s Guide to Monsters. They were later reprinted in Explorer&#8217;s Guide to\n\tWildemount without any changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything introduced the option Customizing Your Origin\n\trules, which gave us the second version and allowing players to reassign the\n\tKenku&#8217;s ability score increases and removing the limitation on their two\n\tracial skill proficiencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Mordenkainen\u2019s Monsters of the Multiverse re-published the Kenku, making major change to their lore and their racial traits. In addition to the standard changes to Ability Score Increases (everyone gets their choice of +2\/+1 or three +1 increases), the Kenku&#8217;s other traits improved significantly. Kenku Training previously allowed 2 skills from a fixed list, but while other races went back to fixed proficiencies or a list of options, the Kenku now gets any two skills of their choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenku Training also offers an Advantage mechanic which makes the Kenku very effective at using skills. Mimicry was also updated to use a DC based on your Charisma rather than expecting you to be proficient in Deception in order to use it successfully. Altogether, this was a nice quality of life improvement to the Kenku, but not such a huge buff that it would cause problems.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-custom-origin\">Kenku Classes (Customizable Origins)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section assumes that you&#8217;re using the option updated versions of the race, including the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/character-options#CustomizingYourOrigin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Customizing Your Origin<\/a>&#8221; rules presented in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything and\/or the updated version published in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/motm\/fantastical-races\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monsters of the Multiverse<\/a>.
