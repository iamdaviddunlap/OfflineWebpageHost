If you have an ally who likes to hold enemies in place\n\t\t(grappling works great) and you can precisely position the end of the\n\t\t60-foot line, you may be able to hit one creature once when you use the\n\t\tImpulse, once again at the end of that creature&#8217;s turn, and a third time\n\t\twhen you recall the boomerang on your next turn.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The difficulty with line effects is lining up two or more targets. Be\n\t\t\tsure to look for speed increases wherever you can get them (many\n\t\t\tAncestries have a +5 ft. speed feat, Fleet, Longstrider, etc.), and use\n\t\t\tthe Air Impulse Junction to get a free Step\/half-Stride before you\n\t\t\tactivate the Impulse.
