With great skills,\n\tdeceptively good spellcasting, and decent combat abilities, the Bard can fill\n\tnearly any role in a party without depending entirely on spells to do so like\n\tthe Wizard does. They make an excellent addition to a large party which has\n\tevery role covered due to their effects as a force-multiplyer, but they also\n\tmake a fantastic member of a small party due to their wide-ranging\n\tskillset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A classic criticism of bards it that they are a &#8220;jack of all trades and a\n\tmaster of none.&#8221; Well, the full line is &#8220;Jack of all trades, master of none,\n\tbut often times better than a master of one&#8221;, and I can think of few things to\n\twhich that truism applies better than to the Bard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bard&#8217;s biggest roles are as a Face, Librarian, Support, and Utility\n\tCaster, though they can fill nearly any role with a handful of clever build\n\tchoices.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#bardic-music-feats\">Bardic Music Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armorshields\">Armor\/Shields<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which tend to be more consistent than 3.5 handbooks. Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"introduction\">Introduction<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h3 id=\"class-features\">Bard Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: For a class which can jump\n\tinto melee d6 hit points is difficult.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB is enough to get\n\tby on.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Good Reflex and Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: You get all of the .<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: More skills than the rogue, but less\n\tskill ranks to spend on them. Basically anything that be done with skills can\n\tbe done by the Bard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: Despite only being a 2\/3 caster the\n\tBard has one of the most interesting spell lists in the game. Bards are the\n\tonly arcane casters with built-in access to healing spells, as well as a\n\tcollection of spells unique to the Bard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Knowledge<\/span>: Even if you don&#8217;t invest a\n\tsingle skill point in a Knowledge skill, you can still compete with any other\n\tScholar in the party. 5 ranks in Knowledge (History) will give you an edge,\n\ttoo. If you do invest skill points in your actual skills, you essentially get\n\tto roll twice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Music<\/span>: The Bard&#8217;s most iconic\n\tability. Bardic Music does a lot, and it&#8217;s extremely effective. At low levels\n\tyou may need to be cautious about using your limited daily uses, but as you\n\tgain levels the potency and frequency of your music both increase\n\tdramatically.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Countersong<\/span> (Su): Too situational, and only\n\t\taffects a tiny set of spells that no one uses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fascinate<\/span> (Sp): This has saved my life at\n\t\tleast twice. It won&#8217;t work once you go into combat, but if you can surprise\n\t\tfoes with it or start it before anyone rolls initiative you can get a handle\n\t\ton fights before they happen. At low levels the duration will be short, but\n\t\tit grows quickly. The fact that the DC is equal to your perform check is\n\t\ttotally absurd since it&#8217;s so easy to optimize skill checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspire Courage<\/span> (Su): This is why most\n\t\tpeople play a bard. This bonus is the primary reason why bards act as a\n\t\tforce multiplier. I&#8217;ve played several bards where the phrase &#8220;don&#8217;t forget\n\t\tthe +1&#8221; was my motto, and those bonuses often made the difference between\n\t\toverwhelming defeat and resounding victory.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspire Competence<\/span> (Su): Aid Another is\n\t\tlikely enough to cover the same use case most of the time, but this works at\n\t\trange and it&#8217;s more fun.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Suggestion<\/span> (Sp): This is far better than\n\t\tyou could possibly get from the spell Suggestion. This costs nothing but\n\t\ttime to use, it doesn&#8217;t break Fascinate, and the DC scales with your level.\n\t\tIn theory, you could keep trying until Fascinate&#8217;s duration expires or you\n\t\tsucceed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspire Greatness<\/span> (Su): By this level\n\t\tthere are very few effects which work off of a number of hit dice (Circle of\n\t\tDeath is the only one I can think of), but the temporary hit points are\n\t\tgreat. The competence bonuses are nice since they&#8217;ll stack with Inspire\n\t\tCourage. Even the 5 round duration after you stop singing is great since it\n\t\twill allow you to switch to Inspire Courage. Add on Lingering Song and you\n\t\tget a full minute before you need to consider re-starting Inspire\n\t\tGreatness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Song of Freedom<\/span> (Sp): This can be great\n\t\tfor removing a vaguely defined variety of effects, but if you have a cleric\n\t\tin the party your cleric will be considerably better equipped to handle\n\t\tthese problems.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspire Heroics<\/span> (Su): Morale bonuses to\n\t\tsaves (with the exception of saves vs. fear) are uncommon, and dodge bonuses\n\t\tto AC always stack, so this is a great defensive option. Like Inspire\n\t\tGreatness the duration lingers after you stop singing, potentially allowing\n\t\tyou to stack the effects with other songs. At this point you&#8217;ve got three\n\t\tcombat buffs to choose from, and picking which to start with can often be\n\t\tthe decision that determines the outcome of the fight. Choose carefully, and\n\t\tif you haven&#8217;t done so already, find a way to start Inspire Courage as a\n\t\tswift action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mass Suggestion<\/span> (Sp): By this level your\n\t\tperform checks are likely absurd, so the DC of Fascinate is nearly\n\t\tunbeatable. Sit your enemies down for a quick concert, then kindly suggest\n\t\tthat they spend 1 hour per level sitting quietly and contemplating their own\n\t\tnavels while you continue adventuring in peace.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardick Knack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Trading in Bardic Knowledge hurts, but what you get in exchange is\n\t\tfantastic. You can pick up the Jack of all Trades feat to essentially have\n\t\tall of your skills maxed out as cross-class skills, but if you can&#8217;t spare a\n\t\tfeat you can probably still spare one rank to put into every skill you plan\n\t\tto use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Drow Bard<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DotU<\/a><\/sup>: Poison Use doesn&#8217;t really seem like something a bard needs, and you can\n\t\tget it from a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Healing Hymn<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Healing hit points is really easy (see Wand of Lesser Vigor, below), and\n\t\tFascinate is both amazing and required for Suggestion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hymn of Fortification<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Similar to Protection from Evil, but with no numerical buffs. You don&#8217;t\n\t\tgive up much to get it, but I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s much better than Inspire\n\t\tCompetence.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspire Awe<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DrM<\/a><\/sup>: Take the Haunting Melody feat instead, and you can do the same thing\n\t\tbetter and without giving up Inspire Courage. Admittedly, Haunting Melody\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t have the 20th-level fear effect, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough of\n\t\ta difference to give up Inspire Courage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Loresong<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DS<\/a><\/sup>: Losing Bardic Knowledge hurts, but activating this as an immediate action\n\t\tis a big deal. You could use this to turn near-misses into hits, allow\n\t\tallies to succeed on save-or-suck effects, or pass a crucial skill roll. All\n\t\tgreat options when the chips are down.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mimicking Song<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DS<\/a><\/sup>: Countersong is garbage, and this is probably the best thing you can get\n\t\tin exchange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellbreaker Song<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Personally, I would rather just cast Silence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"substitution-levels\">Substitution Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome Bard<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoS<\/a><\/sup>: 1st and 6th level are fantastic.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">1st level<\/span>: The gnome cantrips are\n\t\t\t\tgreat, and Counter Feat is passable.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">3rd level<\/span>: Situationa. You can get\n\t\t\t\tbetter trades for Inspire Competence..<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">6th level<\/span>: Excellent for fear\n\t\t\t\tstacking. If you don&#8217;t want to give up Suggestion, pick up the Haunting\n\t\t\t\tMelody feat for essentially the same effect.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">11th level<\/span>: Three spells known is\n\t\t\t\tnice, but by this level Color Spray is worthless, and touch of idiocy is\n\t\t\t\tonly situationally useful.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Elf Bard<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoD<\/a><\/sup>: You need to be a half-elf to even consider these options, and that&#8217;s not\n\t\ta punishment I would wish on any player. The options aren&#8217;t good enough to\n\t\tjustify such a terrible race.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">1st level<\/span>: Countersong is garbage,\n\t\t\t\tbut I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve ever found a use for Calm Emotions unless I\n\t\t\t\thad a Frenzied Berzerker in the party.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">6th level<\/span>: I like Suggestion much\n\t\t\t\tbetter than command, but you can use this in combat more easily.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">8th level<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"unearthed-arcana\">Unearthed Arcana<\/h3>\n<p>Content from Unearthed Arcana is generally considered optional variant rules.<br>\n\tMany of these options are poorly balanced, so be sure to consult your DM<br>\n\tbefore selecting any such options.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bardic Sage<\/span>: This is what I like to see\n\t\tfrom alternate class features: A slightly different take on the class\n\t\tintroducing some additional limitations in exchange for interesting new\n\t\tcapabilities. This makes the Bard more MAD than it already is, so this can\n\t\tbe difficult to play in many games. If you&#8217;re going for a\n\t\tspellcasting-focused bard, this can be great. If you&#8217;re going for more of a\n\t\tskill focus or combat focus you likely won&#8217;t be able to invest enough in\n\t\tIntelligence to make this work.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: An extra spell known\n\t\t\t\tper spell level is very helpful for spontaneous casters, and some of the\n\t\t\t\tdivination spell options are fantastic. However, you need Intelligence\n\t\t\t\thigh enough to cast spells (<em>including<\/em> your other spells), so\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll need to get 16 Intelligence eventually.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Knowledge<\/span>: A +2 bonus to your\n\t\t\t\tBardic Knowledge checks further lessens your need for actualy Knowledge\n\t\t\t\tskills. If you add on the +2 bonus from 5 ranks in Knowledge (History)\n\t\t\t\tyou can probably get away with totally forgoing real Knowledge\n\t\t\t\tskills.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bardic Knowledge<\/span>: This is annoying, but\n\t\t\t\thardly debilitating. With Lingering song your songs will last 8 rounds\n\t\t\t\tafter you stop singing instead of 10. Considering what you can get from\n\t\t\t\tthe improved spellcasting I think it&#8217;s worth it.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Divine Bard<\/span>: This turns the Bard&#8217;s only\n\t\tdump stat into a massive dependency for spellcasting, making the bard\n\t\texceptionally MAD.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The spells you get are\n\t\t\t\tmostly mediocre.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Savage Bard<\/span>: Another fantastic alternate\n\t\tclass feature, the Savage Bard trades some of the Bard&#8217;s existing abilities\n\t\tfor roughly equivalent abilities with a different flavor. In a\n\t\twilderness-heavy campaign where classes like barbarian and ranger are\n\t\timportant, the Savage Bard fits very well.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"\">Alignment<\/span>: Hardly important, and in my experience\n\t\t\t\tmost bards are chaotic anyway.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Save Bonuses<\/span>: Fortitude and Will\n\t\t\t\tsaves are better than Reflex and Will saves.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skills<\/span>: Decipher Script and\n\t\t\t\tSpeak Language are rarely useful, but Survival can be very helpful\n\t\t\t\tdepending on your campaign. If you really need to learn a language, you\n\t\t\t\tcan probably spare the 2 skill ranks to do so.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Illiteracy<\/span>: A minor inconvenience.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Some of the spells you\n\t\t\t\tgive up are disappointing, but you get some good options in\n\t\t\t\texchange.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Variant Bard<\/span>: Gaining an animal\n\t\tcompanion is really cool, but the rest of the abilities you get are really\n\t\tsituational. Giving up both Bardic Knowledge and all of the buffs provided\n\t\tby Bardic Music is really hard. If you want to build a bard focuses solely\n\t\ton spellcasting, this might be a good option since you can stop worrying\n\t\tabout Perform, and turn your Bardic Music uses into fuel for your spells\n\t\twith Lyric Spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<p>-107<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, due to their broad skill set bards also suffer from a little\n\tbit of MAD. They&#8217;re not monks, but it can be a problem. Where you choose to\n\tput your best ability scores will define the function of your bard, but there\n\tare surprisingly few bad choices.<\/p>\n<p>The existence of the Crystal Echoblade and Slippers of Battledancing are\n\tcrucial to note here. Those two items allow the Bard to largely ignore\n\tStrength and greatly reduce the need for Dexterity when fighting in melee. If\n\tthose two items are available to you and you plan to do any melee combat,\n\tconsider their presence very carefully when determining your ability\n\tscores.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: If you plan to fight at range with a\n\tcrossbow or with spells, you can dump Strength. Otherwise, you may want decent\n\tstrength for a melee weapon or just a little bit for bonus damage on a\n\tcomposite bow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Bards only get light armor (medium\n\twith Battle Caster), so you&#8217;ll want some Dexterity to boost your AC. If you go\n\tfor ranged weapons or weapon finesse, you&#8217;ll want a bit more.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: With only 1d6 hit points and poor Will\n\tsaves you&#8217;ll really need Constitution.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Bards get too many skills, and 6+\n\tskill ranks just isn&#8217;t enough without some Intelligence to back it up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wis<\/span>: Bards have good Will saves and very few\n\tskills tied to Wisdom, so this is your only true dump stat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: The Bard&#8217;s most important abilities are\n\tpowered by Charisma, including spells and Inspire Courage. However, since the\n\tBard is a little bit MAD and you&#8217;re not a full cast, you don&#8217;t need to start\n\twith and 18 at level 1. It helps, but it&#8217;s not required.<\/p>\n<table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>32 Point Buy<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th>28 Point Buy<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th>22 Point Buy<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th>15 Point Buy<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th>Elite Array<\/th>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t<\/thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Cha: 18<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Cha: 16<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Cha: 16<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Con: 11<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Charisma bonuses are great, but not absolutely essential.

Unfortunately, it&#8217;s essentially a perpetual tax on your\n\t\tskills. The different versions are mostly interchangeable, though there are\n\t\tsome exeptions due to items, feats, and prestige classes. If you plan to use\n\t\ttwo-handed weapons like bows or crossbows, consider a version which doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tuse your hands like dancing, oratory, or singing.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Act<\/span>: Essentially the same as singing.\n\t\t\t\tWorks with the Dragonsong feat, assuming you&#8217;re not miming.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Comedy<\/span>: Essentially the same as\n\t\t\t\tsinging, but qualifies you for Divine Prankster. Works with the\n\t\t\t\tDragonsong feat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dance<\/span>: A great option for combat bards\n\t\t\t\tsince it qualifies you for Slippers of Battledancing, Snowflake\n\t\t\t\tWardance, and Dervish.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Keyboard instruments<\/span>: Do you really\n\t\t\t\twant to carry around a harpsichord?<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Oratory<\/span>: Essentially the same as\n\t\t\t\tsinging.

Investing in tumble will allow you to do so\n\t\twithout constantly drawing attacks of opportunity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Use Magic Device<\/span> (Cha): The best skill in\n\t\tthe game, and almost no one does it better than you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Accompaniment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Lingering Song is strictly better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CW<\/a><\/sup>: Powerful, but you only get six levels of spells.

Mithral Breast Blate is\n\t\tplenty of AC for many Bards who want to invest a bit more in AC, but if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going to be on the front lines consider Battle Caster to get access\n\t\tto medium armor without hindering your spells. Mithral Full Plate is\n\t\texpensive, but it&#8217;s also a hefty AC bonus. Unless you&#8217;re willing to spend\n\t\tthe gold on Mithral Full Plate you&#8217;ll probably get more benefit from a wand\n\t\tof Mage Armor or Greater Mage Armor than from this feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Battle Dancer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: The bonus is a morale bonus, so it won&#8217;t stack with Inspire Courage.

The feat specifically calls for a Knowledge skill check, so I\n\t\tdon&#8217;t think Bardic Knowledge applies. Since you likely won&#8217;t have\n\t\tIntelligence as high as a Duskblade or other intelligence-based user, you\n\t\twon&#8217;t do quite as well with this, but at mid-levels and up this can provide\n\t\ta significant bonus to attacks and damage for any combat bard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lingering Song<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAd<\/a><\/sup>: If you plan to use Bardic Music in combat, this is an absolute must.\n\t\tContinuing to sing severeley limits your ability to cast spells, use magic\n\t\titems, or start other songs. Getting a full minute for free after you stop\n\t\tsinging will cover the duration of most combats, negating the need for many\n\t\tother options like Melodic Casting or a masterwork Lute.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Metamagic Song<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoS<\/a><\/sup>: Bards focused heavily on spellcasting (generally those going into Bard\n\t\tspellcasting prestige classes) can make excellent use of this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Martial Study<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: Many maneuvers could be useful for the Bard. If you choose a maneuver\n\t\tfrom Devoted Spirit, you get Intimidate as a class skill.

The ability to cast spells and\n\t\tuse some magic items while also using Bardic Music seems exciting, but once\n\t\tyou pick up Lingering Song it becomes much less important since you get\n\t\tseveral rounds of your song in which you can do whatever you want. You can\n\t\talso cast Undersong in order to use Perform in place of Concentration,\n\t\tthough the 10 minutes\/level duration may be a problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nymph&#8217;s Kiss<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>: The flat skill bonus applies to many of the Bard&#8217;s most important skills,\n\t\tand a free skill rank at every level is fantastic.

The ability to double your Inspire Courage bonus is already\n\t\tenough that this feat is too powerful to see actual use.

However, if you start a new song the\n\t\tharmonizing ends, so you&#8217;ll need to track what your weapon is singing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Surge<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup> (+1): Similar to Sudden\n\t\tStunning but considerably more balanced. Still fantastic, despite being more\n\t\tcostly and less powerful than Sudden Stunning. Sudden Stunning is just that\n\t\tamazingly, unfairly good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sudden Stunning<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG2<\/a><\/sup> (+2000gp): This is\n\t\tunfairly good, especially at such a pitifull low cost. I don&#8217;t allow it in\n\t\tmy games. If your DM won&#8217;t let you use this, consider Stunning Surge\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armorshields\">Armor\/Shields<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Commander<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup> (+1200gp): A cheap bonus\n\t\tto Diplomacy and a constant bonus to your allies will saves. As long as your\n\t\tparty isn&#8217;t trying to be stealthy, this is fantastic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mobility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup> (+1): Only works on\n\t\tlight armor, but if you&#8217;re wearing Slippers of Battledancing this will get\n\t\tyou Mobility without wasting a feat on Dodge. If you plan to go for Spring\n\t\tAttack, don&#8217;t waste gold on this. If you&#8217;re using maneuvers Spring Attack\n\t\twon&#8217;t work with them so this is a good idea. In either case, you could also\n\t\tuse Tumble as a replacement and wholly avoid attacks of opportunity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mage Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s rare for a bard to have enough Dexterity that armor stops making<br>sense, but if you ever get to the point that you&#8217;re outgrowing the +6<br>maximum dexterity bonus of your Mithral Shirt you should switch to relying<br>on wands of Mage Armor. Upgrade to an eternal wand of Greater Mage Armor<br>when you can afford it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigor, Lesser<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SpC<\/a><\/sup>: The most cost-efficient healing source in the game. Not every divine<br>class can cast it, so even if you have a traditional healer in the class you<br>may prefer to UMD this when you&#8217;re healing after a fight.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anstruth Harp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: All of the spells are activated as a swift action, but their very\n\t\tsituational so this isn&#8217;t really worth the price.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Canaith Mandolin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: The spells activate as a swift action, and they&#8217;re reasonably useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Charm of Countersong<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Despite costing nearly nothing, you&#8217;ll probably never find this useful\n\t\tenough to actually put it on.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chime of Harmonic Agony<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: The damage doesn&#8217;t scale nearly enough to waste a standard action on\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circlet of Persuasion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Easy to overlook, the Circlet of Persuasion is inexpensive and adds to\n\t\tall of the Bard&#8217;s most important skills, including Diplomacy, Perform, and\n\t\tUse Magic Device. The bonus is Competence, so it won&#8217;t stack with a lot of\n\t\tother buffs, but since you&#8217;re usually the one providing Competence bonuses\n\t\tto skills with Inspire Competence this may be the only way for you to get\n\t\tcompetence bonuses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Clie Lyre<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Song of Freedom invalidates one spell, and you can learn the other two.\n\t\tNot worth the cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Charisma<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Your most important item. Get one early, and upgrade it often.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Vest of Resistance is identical and takes up a much less useful slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Doss Lute<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Mirror Image is the only spell which isn&#8217;t extremely situational, and you\n\t\tprobably want to learn to cast Mirror Image on your own.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dove&#8217;s Harp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: A bit pricy, but free fast healing goes a long way. I always have trouble\n\t\tspening hold on healing since wands of lesser vigor are so efficient, but\n\t\tthe bigger your party is the better this gets, so in large, high-level\n\t\tparties this may become your go-to healing source.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fochlucan Bandore<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Cheap enough that by mid levels its basically nothing, but the spells are\n\t\tall cantrips that you might have trouble finding use for.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mac-Fuirmidh Cithern<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: The only useful spell is Mage Armor, which you should get from a\n\t\twand.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ollamh Harp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Good spells, but very expensive. You&#8217;ll likely find scrolls to be a\n\t\tbetter fit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slippers of Battledancing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG2<\/a><\/sup>: A great option for most combat bards. The ability to use your Charisma\n\t\tfor attack and damage means that you can dump Strength and don&#8217;t need to\n\t\tinvest heavily in Dexterity. The effect is persistent, but requires you to\n\t\tmove 10 feet <em>as part of a move action<\/em>. So, unlike Skirmish-users\n\t\tyou won&#8217;t be able to get away with movement and a full attack unless you go\n\t\tinto Dervish. Technically, that even disallows charging. Instead, consider\n\t\tboosting your damage output with martial maneuvers which often activate as a\n\t\tstandard action if you&#8217;re in melee. Also note that the item requires to use\n\t\tlight or one-handed weapons, but does not require you to use a single or to\n\t\tuse the weapon one-handed so two-weapon fighting, using a longsword\n\t\ttwo-handed, and using thrown weapons all work.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vest of Legends<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG2<\/a><\/sup>: The skill bonuses won&#8217;t stack with Circlet of Persuasion and don&#8217;t apply\n\t\tto nearly as many skills, but the bonuses are little bit bigger. However,\n\t\teven if you also picked up Circlet of Persuasion, the increase to your most\n\t\timportant Bardic Music abilities is well worth the cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot. Of\n\t\tcourse, you can cast Greater Resistance and Superior Resistance with\n\t\thours\/level duration, so you can probably skip a permanent resistance bonus\n\t\taltogether.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reduce Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: For spellcasting-focused or archery bards, Reduce Person is a potent\n\t\tdefensive option. Everyonme else can skip it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crusader<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: One level gets you quite a bit. White Raven stances open up the White\n\t\tRaven Song feat, and Strike maneuvers work really well with Slippers of\n\t\tBattledancing. A second level gets you Indomitable Soul, which isn&#8217;t quite\n\t\tas good as Divine Grace but still provides a hefty bonus to your Will saves.\n\t\tThe way that crusaders refresh their maneuvers is especially useful for\n\t\tbards with Slippers of Battledancing because it always ensures that you have\n\t\ta maneuver to use unless you have maneuvers that activate on a Swift action,\n\t\tin which cause you may be able to run down your maneuvers and go without a\n\t\tStrike for a turn or two. During those rare turns, consider refreshing your\n\t\tBardic Music or casting a spell. Also note that your &#8220;initiator level&#8221;\n\t\tincludes half of your bard levels, so if you wait a little while to pick up\n\t\ta level in Crusader you can get higher level maneuvers and stances than you\n\t\tcould otherwise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dervish<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CW<\/a><\/sup>: A bit of a weird idea, but I can see potential for a combat-focused bard\n\t\tgoing into Dervish. Slippers of Battledancing cater to this idea\n\t\texceptionally well.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Paladin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Without the variant paladins presented in Unearthed Arcana, this is a\n\t\thard combination. You need to go from whatever your alignment is as a Bard,\n\t\tthen switch into Paladin for at least one level before you can take Devoted\n\t\tPerformer. Still, there&#8217;s a bit to be gained from a level or two in paladin,\n\t\tespecially Divine Grace. Smite Evil is fun, but with only one use per day\n\t\tfrom a class dip you won&#8217;t get much out of it unless you spend feats on\n\t\tExtra Smiting. You paladin levels also don&#8217;t advance Inspire Courage or your\n\t\tother musical abilities, so the best you can do is an even split between\n\t\tbard and paladin, which is a mediocre combination no matter how you do it.\n\t\tInstead, consider the Crusader. If your DM allows you to use the alternate\n\t\tpaladin alignments, the paladin of freedom is an easier class dip since it\n\t\twon&#8217;t require you to change alignments and spend a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 8+ skill ranks, a huge skill list, trapfinding, and sneak attack. A\n\t\tsecond levels gets you Evasion, which is always nice to have.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scout<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAd<\/a><\/sup>: I&#8217;ve never seen scouts mentioned on another bard handbook, and I think\n\t\tthat&#8217;s a mistake. A single level of scout gets you Trapfinding, similar\n\t\tskills to the Bard&#8217;s, and a little bit of Skirmish damage. I probably\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t for more than one level despite all of the goodies the Scouts gets\n\t\tat any given level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warblade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: Warblades grant similar maneuvers to crusaders and also open up White\n\t\tRaven Song, but their emphasis on Intelligence synergizes less with Bards\n\t\tthan the Crusader does. Their mechanism for recharging maneuvers is a little\n\t\tbit less helpful than the Crusaders, too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the
