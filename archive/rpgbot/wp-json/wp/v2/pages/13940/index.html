The Eidolon allows you to\n\tchange your role within the party, allowing your dynamic duo to serve as a\n\tDefender, Scout, and Striker, while the Summoner can serve as a Face with some\n\tlight Blaster, Healer, and Support options from their Bounded Spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While building an effective Summoner can be complicated, it&#8217;s not so complicated as building two wholly independent characters. Keep in mind the role you want your Eidolon to play, and look for options which clearly play to that role. Plan your spellcasting around your Eidolon&#8217;s capabilities, and be sure to bring some cantrips to fill various needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The complexity in the Summoner comes from managing their action economy. A typical character gets three Actions, potentially stretching that with things like Minions. But the Summoner&#8217;s Act Together action lets you overlap actions with your Eidolon, allowing you to take up to 4 Actions in a single turn without involving Minions or the Quickened condition (5 with Tandem Movement!). But you also need to consider positioning both yourself and your Eidolon in order to keep both of you safe, but still a position to be useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the Summoner and think &#8220;I want a cool monster but I don&#8217;t want to juggle all the complicated action stuff&#8221;, look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=2892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meld With Eidolon<\/a> feat.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Summoner Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Charisma. Keep in mind that since the Summoner\n\tdoesn&#8217;t rely solely on spells to attack, you don&#8217;t need to maximize Charisma\n\tas much as you would for most spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: Most eidolons fight in melee,\n\tso sharing 10+ hit points between yourself and your eidolon makes that much\n\tfor manageable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: These proficiencies are\n\t<em>weak<\/em>. You&#8217;re bad attacking with both weapons and spells. Your AC is\n\tattrocious and your saves aren&#8217;t impressive. You don&#8217;t get a noteworthy number\n\tof skills, and your Perception is going to be poor. Hopefully your Eidolon can\n\tdo a lot of the hard work.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perception<\/span>: Middling Perception and no\n\t\tdependence on Wisdom, so expect to be bat at Perception.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Above average Fortitude,\n\t\thorrible Reflex, and average Will saves. You&#8217;re unarmored, so Dexterity can\n\t\tmake up the gap with Reflex saves, and the Summoner is very SAD so you can\n\t\tafford to invest a bit in Constitution and Wisdom to support your other\n\t\tsaves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 3+Int and your Eidolon will\n\t\tusually give you two. That&#8217;s slightly above the average of 4+Int, but\n\t\tIntelligence is also a dump stat for the Summoner.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: Only simple weapons and your\n\t\tprogression is as bad as it gets. You&#8217;re right down there with the\n\t\tWizard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: No armor and you&#8217;re tied for the\n\t\tworst Unarmored Defense progression in the game with classes like the\n\t\tWizard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcasting DC<\/span>: Your spellcasting\n\t\tproficiency is as good as classes like the Champion, the Magus, and the\n\t\tMonk, none of which rely on spellcasting offensively. This is especially\n\t\tfrustrating because your eidolon uses your spellcasting attack bonus and\n\t\tsave DC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eidolon<\/strong>: See my\n\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/classes\/summoner\/eidolons\">Summoner Eidolons Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Manifest Eidolon<\/strong>: Central to how the Summoner functions.\n\tThis takes three Actions and your Eidolon&#8217;s presence doesn&#8217;t have an\n\texpiration, so you should almost always have your Eidolon manifested. Avoid\n\tmanifesting it in combat as much as possible because doing so eats a full\n\tturn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Act Together<\/span>: Effectively gives you 4 Actions\nper turn to share between yourself and your Eidolon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Share Senses<\/span>: For many summoners, your\n\tEidolon will be better at going places and doing things due a combination of\n\tbetter movement options, better defenses, and sharing your skill\n\tproficiencies. Share Senses allows you to capitalize on this by sensing\n\tthrough your Eidolon while it&#8217;s off exploring in your stead, and if your\n\tEidolon is in danger you can un-manifest it and Manifest it again a moment\n\tlater. However, this doesn&#8217;t let you communicate instructions to your Eidolon,\n\tso be sure to have a nice conversation with them before you send them off to\n\tleap into traps or whatever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Summoner Spellcasting<\/span>: The Summoner is a\n\t&#8220;Bounded Spellcaster&#8221; like the Magus, so they get at most four spell slots by\n\tdefault, but they&#8217;re all high level. This means that casting leveled spells is\n\ta complement to your other capabilities rather than your central, defining\n\tfeature.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Heightened Spells<\/strong>: Heightening spells is an important\n\t\tmechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many important spells scale with spell level,\n\t\tallowing them to stay relevant long after you first learned them. Since the\n\t\tSummoner is a Bounded Spellcaster, you&#8217;ll spend a lot of time heightening\n\t\tlower-level spells. Fortunately, when you hit level 3 and get 2nd-level\n\t\tspells you&#8217;ll also get Unlimited Signature Spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Cantrips<\/strong>: Fantastic every time, on any character, in any\n\t\tamount. Summoners learn 5 cantrips at level 1 and never get more, but you\n\t\tcan replace them by retraining or when you gain a level so you&#8217;re not locked\n\t\tinto whatever you pick at first level.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spell Repertoire<\/strong>: You get at most 5 spells known (though\n\t\tyou can add to that with other options like Ancestry Feats), so you need to\n\t\tbe very picky about what spells you learn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Link Spells<\/strong>: See Summoner Focus Spells, below.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unlimited Signature Spells<\/span>: The Summoner\n\tknows at most 5 spells, so it&#8217;s helpful that they&#8217;re all Signature Spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Instant Manifestation<\/span>: Useful if you&#8217;re\n\tsomehow dragged into combat without your Eidolon handy, but that should not\n\thappen frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Summoner Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The typical Summoner&#8217;s ability scores closely resemble the Sorcerer. However,\n\tsince the Summoner isn&#8217;t a full spellcaster, their Charisma isn&#8217;t applied as\n\tfrequently as it is for Sorcerers and other spellcasters. This gives you room\n\tto reduce your investment in Charisma and put those resources elsewhere,\n\tespecially if you want to fill in gaps in the Summoner&#8217;s defenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not every summoner necessarily needs to be built this way. If you\n\ttake the Meld With Eidolon feat, your own ability scores are less impactful\n\tdefensively. You can likely afford to dump Dexterity and Wisdom since you&#8217;ll\n\tbe relying on your Eidolon&#8217;s defenses instead, leaving you room to invest\n\tthose ability scores however you like, such as investing more in Intelligence\n\tto support your skills. Regardless, you do need Constitution to support your\n\tshared pool of hit points, and you need enough Charisma to support whatever\n\tyou intend to do with your spells. Though, even that may be a minor need if\n\tyou don&#8217;t intend to your spells offensively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: You do not belong in melee, and even if\n\tyou&#8217;re in melee you can use Gouging Claw rather than a weapon. Dump this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: AC and Dexterity saves. Crucial for\n\tstaying alive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Con<\/span>: You have terrible armor and you share\n\thit points with your Eidolon. Your Constitution score should be as good as you\n\tcan get it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Generally all that you get is skills,\n\tbut if you take an Eidolon with the Arcane or Occult tradition and want to use\n\tExtend Boost, you&#8217;ll need enough Intelligence to support the appropriate skill\n\tcheck.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Perception nad Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Your Key Ability score. If you plan to\n\trely on offensive spellcasting in combat (cantrips, spells cast by your\n\tEidolon, etc.), you want to maximize this. If you&#8217;re going to rely more\n\theavily on your Eidolon&#8217;s Strikes, there&#8217;s much less pressure so you can\n\tafford to distribute your boosts elsewhere. It&#8217;s technically possible to play\n\ta Summoner with low Charisma if your spellcasting is all buffs and utility\n\toptions, but that will strictly limit your spellcasting options, so I don&#8217;t\n\trecommend it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Summoner Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Constitution boosts are absolutely essential, as are any other improvements\n\tto your durability like high Ancestry hit points or damage resistances.\n\tCharisma boosts are great, but how much you need them depends on how you plan\n\tto use your spells. If you&#8217;re planning to blast stuff with cantrips, you need\n\tCharisma. If you want buffs and utility spells, you can go easy on\n\tCharisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because summoners have such limited spellcasting, innate spells are a great\n\taddition. Additional skills can also be helpful to compensate for your dumped\n\tIntelligence, especially since your Eidolon shares your skill\n\tproficiencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weapon proficiencies are outright useless for the Summoner, as are\n\timprovements to unarmed strikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/ancestries\/catfolk\/\" class=\"rating-green\">Catfolk<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: A Wisdom flaw isn&#8217;t ideal, but it won&#8217;t ruin you.

Consider Adopted Ancestry.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/ancestries\/elf\/\" class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The elf really wants high Dexterity and Intelligence, but their Constitution\n\tFlaw and low ancestry hit points are hard to offset.

Goblin Lore is decent, and Goblin Song can be a good\n\tdebuff for your enemies if you have offensive spellcasters in the party.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/ancestries\/halfling\/\" class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good Ability Scores, but not few easy feat options.

That means that you can maximize at most three skills, and the rest of your skills might not advance beyond Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Feats at even-numbered levels, giving you a total of 10 Skill Feats (and maybe another from your Background) by 20th level. Generally, you want to invest these feats in the same skills which you are choosing to maximize, though in some cases you may want to grab feats from skills which don&#8217;t require that you be more than Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skills for the Summoner are a little bit odd because your Eidolon uses your\n\tProficiency but their own ability scores, meaning that the skills which work\n\tfor you and the skills that work for your Eidolon may differ. It&#8217;s entirely\n\tpossible that between you and your Eidolon you could be effective at any\n\tskill. However, Intelligence is a dump state for the Summoner and none of the\n\tpubished Eidolon options have great Intelligence, so Int-based skills are a\n\tdifficult choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite using your proficiency in skills, your Eidolon <em>does not<\/em> get\n\tto use your Skill Feats.

Note that this\n\t\tonly changes the damage type of <em>one of<\/em> your Eidolon&#8217;s unarmed\n\t\tstrikes. Eidolons start with two and you can add more with things like Ranged\n\t\tCombatant, so even if you pick something like fire for your damage type, you\n\t\tstill have other attack options if resistance\/immunity become an issue.\n\t\t<p>I&#8217;m not certain what is intended to happen if you add Versatile (B, P, S)\n\t\t\tto the unarmed strike you choose with Energy Heart.

Energy Heart&#8217;s\n\t\t\tdamage resistance is nice because it&#8217;s persistent, but Reinforce Eidolon\n\t\t\tcovers all damage, making it consistently useful in every encounter. Fire\n\t\t\tdamage is common, but it&#8217;s not universal, so you may go through many\n\t\t\tencounters where Energy Heart&#8217;s damage resistance isn&#8217;t useful, and if you\n\t\t\tpick less common damage types you might go long stretches without seeing\n\t\t\tacid or lightning damage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expanded Senses<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: Scent is a great way to find hidden and invisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extend Boost<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: See Extend Boost under Focus Spells, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Glider Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational by design, and the fact that it can&#8217;t be activated as a\n\t\tReaction means that your Eidolon is still vulnerable to falling unless you\n\t\tspend the Action to glide.

This feat fills that conceptual niche. However, it has none of the\n\t\tthings that made the synthesist powerful, and while it shares the concept,\n\t\tit is very much its own beast mechanically speaking.\n\t\t<p>The benefits and drawbacks of this feat are complex to say the least. You\n\t\t\tare no longer targetable from two places, so you no longer need to worry\n\t\t\tabout your own poor defenses. You&#8217;re free to build your ability scores\n\t\t\talmost however you like, such is by dumping Dexterity and boosting\n\t\t\tIntelligence for additional skills. So defensively, this holds some\n\t\t\tappeal. As you add additional capabilities to your Eidolon like movement\n\t\t\tspeeds, it can also make traveling much easier. Turn your eidolon into a\n\t\t\ttiny flying creature and you can go basically anywhere easily and with\n\t\t\tlittle hassle.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>However, you give up the benefits of Act Together. The ability to overlap\n\t\t\tyour actions means that you can get more actions in a single turn\n\t\t\tthan most creatures, means that you can accomplish a lot\n\t\t\twithin a single turn. You can set up combos, buff your Eidolon, heal\n\t\t\tyourself (and therefore your Eidolon), Aid your allies, or any manner of\n\t\t\tother things. Without separating from your Eidolon, you give up those\npotentially powerful options for safety.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Using Meld Into Eidolon is a complicated trade. You need to build your\n\t\t\twhole character around it if you want it to be a mechanically impactful\n\t\t\toption.

You can re-cast this to get\n\t\tup to three minutes (assuming that your Focus Pool is 3 points), but\n\t\tsituations where this is useful aren&#8217;t a guarantee. If you combine this with\n\t\tReactive Dismissal, you can send your Eidolon to safely scout for danger and\n\t\tunmanifest it to mitigate damage which would be dealt to your shared pool of\n\t\thit points, allowing your Eidolon to trigger traps while you&#8217;re at a very\n\t\tsafe distance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lifelink Surge<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Not a ton of healing, but it&#8217;s enough to get rid of persistent Bleed\n\t\tdamage, and it&#8217;s easy healing outside of combat that will work faster than\n\t\tMedicine checks.
