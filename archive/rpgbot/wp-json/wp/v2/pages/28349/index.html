Blur the lines between real and fake? Pull a rabbit out of your hat, and have it tear your enemies limb from limb? You might enjoy being an Illusionist. A Great and Powerful master of manipulation and misdirection. If you enjoy shenanigans and a little bit of summoning magic, you\u2019re going to love the Illusionist Wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t take my enthusiasm for the stage magician angle to mean that\u2019s the only way to play an Illusionist. It\u2019s all about trickery and misdirection, which has far more applications than theatrics and parlor tricks. Perhaps a bit of espionage is your forte or you fancy yourself a bit of a con artist. Subtlety is just as valid an approach to the School of Illusion as flashy in your face bravado.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Leaning into the stage magician aesthetic, I\u2019ve got a few Tricks Up My Sleeve with our example build.

Creating an illusion of a\n\t\tpot lying on the floor accompanied by the sound of a pot falling, or an\n\t\tillusion of a small animal accompanied by appropriate sounds (I&#8217;m fond of\n\t\tchickens for this purpose) can be excellent distractions, and creatures\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get a save or a skill check to disbelieve the illusion until they\n\t\tspend an Action to do so.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While it&#8217;s primarily a non-combat utility, the ability to cast Minor\n\t\t\tIllusion as a Bonus Action makes it an exciting tool in combat, too.\n\t\t\tCreating visual cover to break lines of sight can have a huge impact.\n\t\t\tDepending on how your DM handles illusions, you may be able to hide\n\t\t\tyourself inside an object like a crate or a barrel to make yourself\n\t\t\tuntargetable.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Don&#8217;t overlook the range increase, either. 60 feet of additional range\n\t\t\tmeans that you can do illusory nonsense from a safe distance, such as\n\t\t\tleading enemies far away from you and your party in order to avoid violent\n\t\t\tencounters.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Phantasmal Creatures<\/span>: This is\n\t\tcomplicated.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Changing the spells&#8217; school to Illusion has no mechanical benefit on its\n\t\t\town, but remember that Improved Illusions increases the range of your\n\t\t\tIllusion spells by 60 feet, allowing you to cast these spells from up to\n\t\t\t150 feet away.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Two free summon spells is pretty nice. Summon Beast and Summon Fey both\n\t\t\toffer some appealing options, and upcasting summon spells to boost their\n\t\t\tstats and number of attacks keep them relevant for your whole career.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The two free castings (one for each summon) are a nice convenience,\n\t\t\tgiving you low-cost canon fodder that can absorb a few hits that might\n\t\t\totherwise target you and your allies. The summons won&#8217;t last long in\n\t\t\tcombat with half hit points, but both spells have a 1-hour duration, so\n\t\t\tyou can pre-cast them and wander around outside of combat with a pet ready\n\t\t\tto go. Even as you gain levels and a level 2 or level 3 summon stops being\n\t\t\ta threat, they can still be useful as a scout or as a distraction.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Self<\/span>: Infallibly ignore one\n\t\tattack against you for free, once per Short or Long Rest. Very good for a\n\t\tsquishy Wizard. Combined with other defensive measures like hiding and using\n\t\tcover, you may even be able to forgo Shield, especially since you can use\n\t\tthis again at the cost of a level 2 spell slot.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Reality<\/span>: This turns your\n\t\tillusions into creation spells, which means that any tool that you can\n\t\timagine is available for the low cost of casting Silent Image. Sadly,\n\t\tMalleable Illusions likely doesn&#8217;t let you change the object which you&#8217;ve\n\t\tchosen to make real because Illusory Reality only applies when you cast the\n\t\tspell.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can&#8217;t directly harm creatures with Illusory Reality, but the rules\n\t\t\tsay nothing about impeding, restraining, blocking, or even dropping them.\n\t\t\tThrow up a Silent Image to create a wall of stone between you and your\n\t\t\tfoes, or to put a cage around them. Create an illusory bridge with a\n\t\t\tconvenient trap door (or just time it so that they&#8217;re on the bridge when\n\t\t\tthe 1-minute duration expires) and drop your enemies into a pit.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Illusionist Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re looking for backgrounds that grant Intelligence and either Dexterity or Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Artisan<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Dexterity for additional AC is alright, but Crafter is less useful than other feats.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Criminal<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: With the choice of either Dexterity or Constitution, Thieves&#8217; Tools and the Alert feat, this is the strongest option for Wizards in general.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Merchant<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This has the Constitution option, which is ok.
