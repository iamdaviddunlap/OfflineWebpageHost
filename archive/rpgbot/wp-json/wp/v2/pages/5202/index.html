The additional damage doesn&#8217;t hurt either.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemical Simulacrum<\/span> (Su): Create a low\n\t\tlevel version of yourself. Have it throw bombs and draw attention. Keep in\n\t\tmind that the simulacrum has at most half of your levels, so it&#8217;s not going\n\t\tto win any fights for you, but if you took the Infusion discovery at\n\t\tsufficiently low level, your simulacrum can be a good source of additonal\n\t\tlow level Infusions. However, the Simulacrum only lasts one hour per caster\n\t\tlevel, so in addition to taking 24 hours to create, it only lasts for part\n\t\tof one day. The components are expensive, so don&#8217;t expect to use this every\n\t\tday.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Alchemical Zombie<\/span> (Su): Undead pets are\n\t\tpretty cool, assuming your DM allows them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blinding Bomb (Su)<\/span>*: Blinding a target\n\t\tcan be hugely effective. The Dazzled effect is basically pointless, but it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t make the Blind effect any less awesome.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bottled Ooze<\/span> (Su): Oozes can be very\n\t\tthreatening creatures, but the highest CR that you can summon is CR 6 at\n\t\t16th level. Such a weak creature is unlikely to have a significant effect on\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Breath Weapon Bomb<\/span>*: This can hugely\n\t\timprove your damage output, but also puts you in a potentially dangerous\n\t\tlocation. A 15 foot cone is also fairly small, so don&#8217;t expect to catch more\n\t\tthan two creatures in the AOE.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cognatogen<\/span> (Su): If you don&#8217;t depend on\n\t\tphysical ability scores, Cognatogen can be fantastic. Boosting your\n\t\tIntelligence can greatly improve your bomb damage, though the duration\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t grant you additional bombs or extracts. Greater\/Grand mutagen are\n\t\tnot specifically mentioned to work with Cogantogen. Instead, use the\n\t\tGrand\/Greater Cognatogen discoveries.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combine extracts<\/span>: Fantastic, especially\n\t\tfor healing extracts and extracts with short durations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Concentrate poison<\/span>: The biggest problems\n\t\twith poison are price and DC. This helps with the DC issue, but the\n\t\tadditional cost may be prohibitive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Concussive bomb<\/span>*: Sonic damage is very\n\t\trarely resisted, and deafening spellcasters can seriously inhibit them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Confusion Bomb<\/span>* (Su): Confusion is\n\t\tunpredictable, but can be very effective if your enemies has allies that it\n\t\tcan attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Delayed bomb<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\tpotentially very effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dilution<\/span>: This is a great way to save\n\t\tmoney on potions, but by 12th level the cost of most potions should be\n\t\tfairly cheap.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dispelling Bomb<\/span>: Against NPCs, a\n\t\ttargeted dispel can be very powerful. Magic items are suppressed, buffs are\n\t\tended, etc. However, this is very situational and can probably be covered by\n\t\tone of your party&#8217;s casters carrying a scroll of Dispel Magic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Doppelganger Simulacrum<\/span> (Su): This is like\n\t\tClone, but miles better. Mail your simulacrums to allies around the world,\n\t\tthen transfer your conciousness when you need to talk to them. Keep a few\n\t\thandy at your base if the adventure goes badly. Is your body too wounded?\n\t\tSwitch to a spare and wait for your active body to recover. The uses are\n\t\tnearly limitless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elixir of life<\/span>: Hugely expensive and\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhance potion<\/span>: Squeeze some extra healing\n\t\tor some extra buff duration out of your potions without spending a ton of\n\t\tgold to make your potions higher caster level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eternal potion<\/span>: There are a ton of potions\n\t\twhich this would be fantastic for. Imagine permanent Improved\n\t\tInvisibility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explosive bomb<\/span>*: The alchemist&#8217;s signature\n\t\toffensive option is a very small AOE, and the damage doesn&#8217;t scale terribly\n\t\twell at high levels. Expanding the AOE and adding ongoing damage does quite\n\t\ta bit to address these issues. If you don&#8217;t need any other effect at the\n\t\tmoment, this is the best go-to option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Explosive Missile<\/span>: Sometimes you need a\n\t\tbit more range than Long Shot can get you with the Bomb&#8217;s 20 foot range\n\t\tincrement. If the target has low AC, this might even be a good way to\n\t\tsupplement your damage output. However, you are much more likely to hit with\n\t\ta ranged touch attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extend potion<\/span>: Great for buffs with short\n\t\tand medium durations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fast bombs<\/span>: 1d6 per two caster levels will\n\t\tfall behind wizard spells pretty quickly. As you advance in level, the\n\t\tability to throw additional bombs will go a long way to improve your damage\n\t\toutput. The wording is somewhat vague, but you may be able to combine this\n\t\twith Two-Weapon Fighting to throw extra bombs with your other hand(s).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Feral mutagen<\/span>: If you play your alchemist\n\t\tas a melee monster, or if you use the Vivisectionist archetype, this can be\n\t\ta fantastic option. Unlike two-weapon fighting, primary natural attacks\n\t\tapply your full Strength modifier, so if you use a Strength mutagen, you can\n\t\tthrow a ton of strength behind your new attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Force bomb*<\/span>: Force damage is basically\n\t\timpossible to resist, and it affects incorporeal creatures. The damage is\n\t\tslightly reduced, but the Trip effect is very handy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Frost bomb*<\/span>: Fire is the most commonly\n\t\tresisted energy type, so the ability to switch to other energy types provies\n\t\ta lot of versatility. The Staggered effect can also be very helpful,\n\t\tespecially at high levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Grand Cognatogen<\/span> (Su): Far less essential\n\t\tfor Cognatogen users than Greater Cognatogen. The bonus to Charisma isn&#8217;t\n\t\tgoing to get you much, and penalties to Constitution are scary.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Grand Inspiring Cognatogen<\/span> (Su): More\n\t\tDefenses, and three more Investigator Talents.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grand mutagen<\/span>: If you use the Mutagen\n\t\toften, this is essential.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Alchemical Simulacrum<\/span> (Su): Unlike\n\t\tthe Lesser Alchemical Simulacrum, the Greater version creates a permanent\n\t\tsimulacrum. It makes a good servant, assistant, and source of additonal\n\t\tTransfusions. Keep in mind that the Simulacrum still has at most half of\n\t\tyour levels, so don&#8217;t expect it to win fights for you by itself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Cognatogen<\/span> (Su): Essential for\n\t\tCognatogen users. Boost your Intelligence to improve your bombs, and boost\n\t\tyour Wisdom to improve your Will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Inspiring Cognatogen<\/span> (Su):\n\t\tAdditional defenses are nice, and access to three Investigator Talents is\n\t\tgreat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater mutagen<\/span>: If you use the Mutagen\n\t\toften, this is essential.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Healing Touch<\/span> (Ex): The ability to heal\n\t\tother creatures is nice, but doubling your daily healing is what makes this\n\t\tgood.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Immolation Bomb<\/span>*: This is most useful\n\t\tfor dealing ongoing damage to spellcasters to force Concentration checks.\n\t\tAlso note that the ongoing damage applies your intelligence bonus every\n\t\tround. If your Intelligence is high, this can turn into a huge amount of\n\t\tdamage very quickly. In fights with enemies that have huge pools of hit\n\t\tpoints that you can&#8217;t drop in a round or two, this could be a great\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infuse mutagen<\/span>: Situational and\n\t\texpensive, but may be worth it at higher levels when that 1000 gp doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thurt quite so badly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inferno bomb<\/span>*: An extra 6d6 damage to\n\t\tanything stuck in the cloud, and it obscures vision. Excellent area control\n\t\teffect. If your allies can keep enemies in the cloud for its duration, this\n\t\tcan really rack up a ton of damage. Try combining this with Tanglefoot\n\t\tbags.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infusion<\/span>: Share your extracts with your\n\t\tallies. Essential if you don&#8217;t have a decent support caster handy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspired Bomb<\/span> (Su): You can&#8217;t get nearly\n\t\tenough inspiration to waste it on 1d6 damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspiring Cognatogen<\/span> (Su): You only want\n\t\tthis if you plan to take the Inspired Chemist archetype, which gives you\n\t\tthis for free.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lingering Spirit<\/span> (Ex): Very situational\n\t\tunless you spend a lot of time dying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Madness bomb<\/span>: The diminishing return on\n\t\tWisdom damage really sucks. This mgith be good for nerfing enemy\n\t\twisdom-based casters or weakening enemy will saves, but don&#8217;t expect to beat\n\t\tthings by dropping their Wisdom to 0.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mummification<\/span> (Ex): Immunity to cold is\n\t\targuably worth a discovery. Nonlethal damage is hardly worth noting, but\n\t\tParalysis and Sleep effects are as close as you can get to death without\n\t\tactually dying. Also, immunity to sleep likely means that you don&#8217;t need to\n\t\tsleep, which leaves lots of time for things like staring at your sleeping\n\t\tparty members.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mutagen<\/span> (Su): If you gave up Mutagen,\n\t\tyou probably didn&#8217;t want Mutagen. But if you&#8217;re indecisive, here it is.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nauseating Flesh<\/span>: Very situational, and\n\t\tcounts on you being hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Parasitic Twin<\/span> (Ex): A once per day\n\t\treroll against a vaguely defined set of effects is hard to judge. The\n\t\teffects specified are generally very debilitating, which is nice, but you\n\t\tonly get a reroll, and only once per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plague Bomb<\/span> (Su)*: AOE Blinding Sickness\n\t\tmakes the Blinding Bomb look like a firecracker. Very versatile, very\n\t\tpowerful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison bomb<\/span>*: Cloudkill is only useful\n\t\tbecause you can move it around to murder swarms of low level enemies. You\n\t\tprobably can&#8217;t move the cloud, and you will almost never be in a fight where\n\t\tthis is helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Poison Conversion<\/span>: Turn all of your\n\t\tpoisons into injury or contact poisons, concentrate them with Concentrate\n\t\tPoison, and use Sticky Poison to get a whole mess of uses out of it.\n\t\tIngested poisons tend to be the best, but the hardest to use, so abuse them\n\t\theavily.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise bombs<\/span>: Essential, especially if\n\t\tyou take Explosive Bombs.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Preserve Organs<\/span> (Ex): Gain the equivalent\n\t\tof a +1\/+3\/+5 magic item property. Excellent if you&#8217;re scared of critical\n\t\thits or rogues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shock bomb<\/span>*: Other energy types are\n\t\tgreat, but Dazzled is a worthless status effect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Siege Bomb<\/span>*: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Smoke bomb<\/span>*: Good area control, but\n\t\tsomewhat situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spontaneous Healing<\/span> (Ex): On-demand fast\n\t\thealing as a free action is pretty great. 5 points per two levels isn&#8217;t\n\t\tmuch, but it&#8217;s a bit like taking Toughness 2 and a half times. The added\n\t\tbenefit that the healing kicks in when you fall onconcious makes this even\n\t\tbetter, because it makes you functionally immune to bleeding out.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sticky bomb<\/span>: At 10th level when you can\n\t\tget this, the extra damage is 5+int. That Assuming a modest intelligence of\n\t\t16, that&#8217;s 8 more damage per bomb, totalling 104 additional damage in a day.\n\t\tAsk the fighter if Weapon Specialization pays off that well. Also, because\n\t\tthe damage takes place a round later, it counts as ongoing damage and forces\n\t\tconcentration checks from spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sticky poison<\/span>: OH. OH GOD. A number of\n\t\tstrikes equal to your intelligence modifier. Buff your intelligence with\n\t\tCognatogen (or at least fox&#8217;s cunning or something), and get a whole mess of\n\t\tpoison uses. Heck, do this for your party&#8217;s rogue. Combine it with\n\t\tConcentrated Poison, and you can get a poison with +2 DC and\n\t\t<em>at worst<\/em> 3 uses with a perfectly reasonable 16 intelligence.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stink bomb<\/span>*: Nauseated is a hugely\n\t\tdebilitating status effect, and it persist for 1d4+1 rounds after targets\n\t\tleave the cloud.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Strafe Bomb<\/span> (Su): Lines are generally\n\t\tless useful than circular AOEs.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sunlight Bomb<\/span> (Su)*: Useful in\n\t\tundead-heavy campaigns, but otherwise very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tanglefoot Bomb<\/span> (Su)*: Tanglefoot bags are\n\t\tgreat, but are limited by their DC and stop being useful at high levels.\n\t\tTanglefoot bomb solves this issue very nicely. The Entangled condition is\n\t\tvery effective, especially if your party uses Combat Maneuvers, and gluing a\n\t\ttarget to the floor is very powerful if you can then hit them with Inferno\n\t\tBomb.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tentacle<\/span> (Ex): The Tentacle trades the\n\t\tutility of a full arm for a tentacle attack. Note that &#8220;The tentacle does\n\t\tnot give the alchemist any extra attacks&#8221;, so you can&#8217;t get extra attacks on\n\t\ta Full Attack. It&#8217;s an either-or situation. Personally, I would take\n\t\tVestigial Arm over Tentacle every time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tumor Familiar<\/span> (Ex): Familiars are\n\t\tastoundingly useful as scouts, messengers, and assistants. The ability to\n\t\tuse Share Spells to share your mutagen lets you do silly things like boost\n\t\tyour viper familiar&#8217;s constitution by 8 for a better poison DC, or give your\n\t\tcat familiar +8 strength and set it loose in a room full of level 1 human\n\t\tcommoners. A monky familiar can run around delivery infusions to allies or\n\t\twearing Poisoner&#8217;s Gloves. A mutagened owl could probably carry enemies into\n\t\tthe air and drop them. The possibilities are immense. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>\n\t\tfor additional guidance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vestigial Arm<\/span> (Ex): The wording is\n\t\tsomewhat confusing, but the intention of the ability is not as abusable as\n\t\tpeople hope. If you use Two-Weapon Fighting, you can&#8217;t weild a third weapon\n\t\tin your additional hand. You could technically dual-weild greatswords,\n\t\tthough this wasn&#8217;t the intention. You may be able to use a shield in the\n\t\tadditional hand, though that hasn&#8217;t been addressed to my knowledge. You also\n\t\tcan&#8217;t wear additional rings or gloves, so you can&#8217;t do fun things like\n\t\twearing an extra set of Poisoner&#8217;s Gloves. However, you can use the\n\t\tadditional hand to reload crossbows, so you can do silly things like\n\t\tTwo-Weapon Fighting with hand crossbows or you can apply poison to a weapon.\n\t\tVivisections can make abundant and effective use of the reload tactic. Even\n\t\tso, I would only take this discovery once.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings<\/span> (Ex): Flight is fantastic, but I\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t take this more than once. Use one or two minutes of duration to get\n\t\tthrough a fight, and you should have plenty to get through the day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"grand-discoveries\">Grand Discoveries<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>You only get one, so choose carefully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Awakened Intellect<\/span>: Not very exciting, but\n\t\tundeniably effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Eternal Youth<\/span>: Little mechanical effect unless you\n\t\tare taking advantage of the aging rules, but certainly cool for flavor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fast Healing<\/span>: Fast Healing 5. Amazing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Philosopher&#8217;s Stone<\/span>: Print money, or mix\n\t\twith a cheap potion for True Resurrection.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Touch<\/span>: Constitution damage is\n\t\tgreat, and your save DC will be respectable. However, touch attacks are\n\t\toften dangerous for alchemists, and by now you should have much better\n\t\toptions than a 4th-level spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">True Mutagen<\/span>: A +8 bonus to your physical\n\t\tabilities is enormous, and the bonus to natural armor is great. However,\n\t\tGrand mutagen is probably providing enough enhancement to your main ability\n\t\tscore that his won&#8217;t give you any meaningful improvement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Alchemist discoveries are the Alchemist&#8217;s customization mechanic, similar to Fighter&#8217;s bonus feats or Rogue Talents.
