The Evocation\n\tWizard is comparable, but the ability to break the action economy with\n\tMetamagic allows the Draconic Sorcerer to produce much higher spikes of damage\n\tthan even the Evocation Wizard can match.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Draconic Bloodline leans so heavily on elemental damage, the\n\tElemental Adept feat is essentially required. Resistances will be a persistent\n\tproblem which can negate your most exciting Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer\n\tfeatures and render your favorite spells nearly useless. Transmuted Spell\n\tMetamagic is another tax so that you can fit more spells into your favorite\n\telement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Draconic Bloodline is primarily a blaster focusing on damage via a single\n\telemental damage type, and between its unusual durability and emphasis on\n\tdirect damage, it&#8217;s very simple to play. This makes the Draconic Bloodline\n\tSorcerer an excellent choice for new players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Build &#8211; Dungeons and Several Dragons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

That said, you want to pick an energy type which\n\t\tyou can use frequently and which offers a large number of spell options\n\t\twhich can apply Elemental Affinity.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Acid<\/span>: Recent sourcebooks have\n\t\t\t\tgradually added new and powerful options for acid damage, including\n\t\t\t\texcellent spells like Tasha&#8217;s Caustic Brew. Acid damage from enemies is\n\t\t\t\troughly as common as cold or lightning.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cold<\/span>: Roughly as many damage options\n\t\t\t\tas Acid or Lightning, but they&#8217;re less consistently good. Expect to rely\n\t\t\t\ton spell options like Ice Knife and Snilloc&#8217;s Snowball Swarm which may\n\t\t\t\tbe slightly more challenging than comparable fire-based spells.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire<\/span>: Of the available options, fire\n\t\t\t\tdamage has the most available spells by far, but resistance and\n\t\t\t\timmunity to fire are common, so expect to take Elemental Adept. Enemies\n\t\t\t\twho deal fire damage are also common, so the resistance is frequently\n\t\t\t\thelpful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning<\/span>: Nearly as common as Fire\n\t\t\t\tspells, and considerably fewer creatures resist it.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison<\/span>: Poison resistance and immunity\n\t\t\t\tare extremely common, and since Elemental Adept doesn&#8217;t allow you to\n\t\t\t\tselect Poison you will have trouble overcoming resistance. There also\n\t\t\t\taren&#8217;t many good spells which deal poison damage. Poison damage from\n\t\t\t\tenemies is common, but if you&#8217;re worried about it you can play a\n\t\t\t\tdwarf.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Draconic Resilience<\/span>: This helps offset\n\t\tyour d6 hit points, and gives you the equivalent of permanent Mage Armor.\n\t\tYou&#8217;ll still want a bit of Dexterity and Constitution, but this is very\n\t\thelpful. Note that the bonus hit points only apply to Sorcerer levels, but\n\t\tif you&#8217;re taking a Sorcerer dip the armor will continue to function.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Affinity<\/span>: According to\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2015\/06\/28\/scorching-ray-dd-errata\/\"\n\t\t\t>Sage Advice<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\tand the Errata, this effect (and similar effects) apply to a single damage\n\t\troll per spell, so it&#8217;s much more effective on AOE spells like Fireball than\n\t\ton multiple-attack style spells like Scorching Ray. A boost of up to 5\n\t\tdamage per spell, especially with AOE spells, is a considerable boost,\n\t\tespecially on low-level spells like Burning Hands, so your low-level spells\n\t\tcan continue to be big damage dealers while consuming your less-powerful\n\t\tspell slots. You also have the ability to grant yourself energy resistance\n\t\tfor an hour without the need to concentrate.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dragon Wings<\/span>: Flight is crucial at high\n\t\tlevels, especially for spellcasters who need to stay out of reach of\n\t\tterrifying melee enemies. Spells like Fly require Concentration, which\n\t\tseverely limits your options, so the ability to remain in flight and\n\t\tconcentrate on other effects is a massive tactical advantage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Draconic Presence<\/span>: Cast Fear or cast\n\t\tCalm Emotions or something. This is rarely worth 5 Sorcery Points. The big\n\t\tadvantage over other options is that the AOE follows you and creatures that\n\t\tenter the area after you activate Draconic Presence are affected. The best\n\t\tuse case for this is when a mob of enemies are charging you and your allies,\n\t\tbut those situations are rare and could easily be handled by Wall of Fire.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#races\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>, though the emphasis on damage from a single element makes some feats\n\tunusually useful<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Adept<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Ignoring resistance to your favorite damage type means that you can rely\n\t\talmost exclusively on that damage type, which becomes especially impactful\n\t\twhen you pick up Elemental Affinity at level 6.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flames of Phlegethos<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: The Charisma increase and damage rerolls are nice, but mathematically\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll get more out of Elemental Adept.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#sorcerer\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section briefly details some obvious and enticing multiclass options, but doesn&#8217;t fully explore the broad range of multiclassing combinations.
