The combination of necrotic damage output and necrotic-immune pets thanks to Foul Conjuration means that Circle of the Blighted has an unusual interaction with undead, often making it hard for the druid and the undead to defeat each other quickly. Fortunately, you still have an entire party, you summons are still summoned monsters, and you still have a full spell list, so you&#8217;re never short on options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Blighted draws a very interesting contrast with <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/circle-of-the-shepherd\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"17178\">Circle of the Shepherd<\/a>.

The\n\t\tdamage bonus is once per turn, so you and all of your allies can trigger it\n\t\tonce on each of your turns. Since it&#8217;s &#8220;extra damage&#8221;, it&#8217;s multiplied on a\ncritical hit. If you can catch multiple enemies in the area,\n\t\tyou can drop area damage and get the Defile Ground damage boost on every one\n\t\tof them. If you have allies who like to grapple, try to place or move the\n\t\tDefile Ground area so that the grappled enemies are on its edge.\n\t\t<p>The scaling on this is good, too. The damage die advances slowly, but\n\t\t\tyour party gets better at dealing damage at least once per turn, so you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\tget the damage die more often. The area also grows, making it easy to\n\t\t\tcatch multiple creatures.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This affects all creatures, including you and your allies.\n\t\t\tOnce you get Foul Conjuration at level 10, your summons will be immune, so\n\t\t\tyou can flood the area with cows and drop area damage on your enemies\n\t\t\twhile they try to butcher their way out.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge for Circle of the Blighted is that Defile Ground\n\t\t\tonly works on the ground and in water, so flying enemies or enemies climbing\n\t\t\ton walls and ceilings may be perpetually out of reach. Against those enemies,\n\t\t\teither get them on the ground or resort to more conventional druid options.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Blighted Shape<\/span>: Proficiency in a\n\t\tCharisma-based skill which you&#8217;ll never use and +2 AC while in Wild Shape\n\t\t(which you&#8217;ll never do in combat) won&#8217;t help you much. But adding 60 ft.\n\t\tDarkvision to any Wild Shape form makes scouting a lot easier.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Call of the Shadowseeds<\/span>: A free summon as\n\t\ta Reaction PB\/day. The sapling isn&#8217;t strong by any means, and it certainly\n\t\twon&#8217;t compete with things beastmaster\/drakewarden ranger pets, but it also\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t eat your Bonus Action to command it and you don&#8217;t have to get\n\t\temotionally attached to it or spend a spell slot to re-summon it when it\n\t\tdies. This is intentionally a fail, disposable combat pet which can absorb a\n\t\tfew hits and be replace. It also has 60-foot blindsight, which is an amazing\n\t\tcounter to invisible enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Foul Conjuration<\/span>: This makes your\n\t\tsummoned creatures more durable (including your Blighted Sapling) and also\n\t\tturns them into bombs. The bombs will never be good enough for you to spend\n\t\tyour Action to detonate them, but they can still cause trouble for your\n\t\tenemies. Mercer and the team did a good job on the table for the explosion\n\t\tdamage: It&#8217;s essentially even with any of the PHB-era Conjure X spells, so\n\t\twhether you want to summon a flock of sheep or one tyrannosaurus, you&#8217;re\n\t\tgetting roughly the same damage from the explosions. Tasha&#8217;s-era Summon X\n\t\tspells will get less since they just use your Proficiency Bonus,\n\t\tunfortunately.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incarnation of Corruption<\/span>: Good, but it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t change your tactics in any way that&#8217;s helpful. +2 AC and some\n\t\ttemporary hit points don&#8217;t suddenly make you durable enough to be your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Defender, and keeping Defile Ground at a safe distance has worked\n\t\tfor us for 12 levels. Perhaps the best use here is to walk into Defile\n\t\tGround, recharge your temporary hp, then retreat to safety unless the fight\n\t\tis over.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-blighted-druid-ability-scores\">Circle of the Blighted Druid Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/#ability-scores\">standard druids<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-blighted-druid-races\">Circle of the Blighted Druid Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/#races\">standard druids<\/a>.

The challenge is keeping enemies in side the area so that enemies don&#8217;t spend huge parts of the round outside until we can move the area again. By building around area control and flooding the battlefield with bodies to fill space, we can create an extremely unpleasant situation which our enemies are unable to escape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll plan to use the Wild Companion Optional Class Feature, but it&#8217;s not actually necessary for the build to work. This adds another summon option, which fits the subclass thematically and mechanically. We&#8217;ll also assume that you&#8217;re allowing the additional spells added to spell lists in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything because that list includes all of the updated summon spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll mostly stick to standard druid ability scores, but we&#8217;ll take a splash of Charisma so that we can explore some Face skills without a penalty.

It&#8217;s a very solid race option for the Druid already, and resistance to necrotic damage makes that even better for our purposes. Plus we get to lean hard into the doom and gloom theme. We&#8217;ll use Trance to pick up proficiency in Thieves&#8217; Tools (always helpful) and whips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reborn Lineage would also be cool, but less effective in combat in exchange for better skill options. Being reborn as a half-rotten whatever you were feels very thematically appropriate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Far Traveler.

We get Perception from our race. That makes the proficiencies from our background redundant, so we&#8217;ll replace them with Persuasion and Religion. We get proficiency in Herbalism Kit from druid, one instrument from our background, and Trance allows us to pick up two tool or weapon proficiencies every day.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to rely heavily on PHB-era Conjure X spells, which depend less on your spellcasting ability than most spells. That makes it safer to delay ability score increases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 4 we&#8217;ll take Sentinel. Combined with proficiency in whips, that allows us to hold enemies in place within the area of Defile Ground. Attacking during our enemy&#8217;s turn also means that we get another chance to trigger the damage bonus. Our Dexterity is certainly lower than that of our martial allies, but we&#8217;re not depending solely on this tactic to be effective, so I think we&#8217;re okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Level<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feat(s) and Features<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Notes and Tactics<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Druidic<br>Spellcasting<br>Cantrips Known<br>&#8211; Guidance<br>&#8211; Thorn Whip<\/td><td>Until we hit level 2, you&#8217;re very much a standard druid.

Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t an attack or spell, so it won&#8217;t trigger the damage bonus from Defile Ground.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>More spells, but nothing directly relevant to our tactics.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase (Wis 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>We&#8217;re back on the fundamental math!<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>7th-level spells.

We&#8217;re basically rolling for 20&#8217;s, and fortunately Pack Tactics improves those odds quite a bit (you have almost a 10% chance of rolling a 20 with Advantage).<br><br>We also have a fun interaction with the spell Whirlwind. While it&#8217;s not an amazing spell on its own, it does have the ability to pick up creatures and carry them into the area of Defile Ground. Creatures in the whirlwind are Restrained, making it easy for you and your allies to attack them and repeatedly trigger the damage bonus from Defile Ground with little further expense of resources. However, the cylinder is taller than Defile Ground, so creatures may be sucked upward out of the area and tossed somewhere else. Consider ending the spell early to drop captured creatures; falling will trigger Defile Ground, and they&#8217;ll struggle to get out of the area in one turn after spending half of their movement to stand up.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Defile Ground Improvement (1d8 damage)<br>Incarnation of Corruption<\/td><td>A tiny bit more damage from Defile Ground, but Incarnation of Corruption is why we&#8217;re here. +2 AC makes it much easier to stand inside Defile Ground and use Sentinel, plus if you don&#8217;t need to move the AOE you can spend your Bonus Action to get some temporary hit points to compensate for relatively poor hit points.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>8th-level spells.

The subclass depends heavily on necrotic damage, which is rarely resisted. The combination of necrotic damage output and necrotic-immune pets thanks to Foul Conjuration means that Circle of the Blighted has an unusual interaction with undead, often making it hard for the druid and the undead to defeat each other quickly.
