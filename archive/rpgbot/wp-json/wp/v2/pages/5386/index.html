There is little that an Arcane Trickster can&#8217;t do, and with a\n\tdecent build an Arcane Trickster can fill any role in the party except\n\tDefender and Healer. Depending on build, the Arcane Trickster can supply a\n\thuge quantity of damage output, and can exceed the Rogue in stealth,\n\tversatility, and scouting ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Arcane Trickster has trouble keeping pace with the rest of the\n\tparty at mid levels before it has a few levels of Arcane Trickster. During\n\tthis middle period, you will need to be clever and careful to stay useful and\n\talive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong>: This class handbook currently depends heavily on the\n\tassumption that Scorching Ray can apply Sneak Attack one each ray, and\n\tregrettably the\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/paizo\/faq\/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9qqm\">Pathfinder FAQ<\/a>\n\tindicates that this is not allowed.

See &#8220;Base Classes&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Special<\/strong>: 2d6 Sneak Attack is easily achieved by a variety of\n\tclasses, and you should expect to have 2 Sneak Attack dice by level 6. You\n\tcould take one level in two classes which offer Sneak attack to get into\n\tArcane Trickster early, but you will give up a lot of useful low level class\n\tabilities, and a much-needed +1 BAB. See &#8220;Base Classes&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 id=\"class-features\">Arcane Trickster Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: The lowest hit points available.\n\tArcane Tricksters need to be careful not to draw fire.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 1\/2 BAB.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Good Reflex and Fortitude saves. Be\n\tsure to invest in Constitution to boost the Arcane Trickster&#8217;s lousy Fortitude\n\tsaves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Proficiencies<\/span>: None. You should get\n\teverything you need from your base classes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: The Arcane Trickster only gets 4+\n\tskill ranks, and has a very long list of very important skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells per Day<\/span>: The Arcane Trickster\n\tadvances spellcasting at every level, meaning that you only give up\n\tspellcasting levels for your Sneak Attack class. Note that, like every other\n\tprestige class with spell advancement, classes which have a specific &#8220;Spells\n\tKnown&#8221; table will learn new spells, but classes like the Witch and Wizard\n\twhich can learn spells on their own do not gain new spells known. This is\n\tinconvenient, but you can always buy new spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ranged Legerdemain<\/span> (Su): Situational, but\n\tvery flashy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span>: Increases at the same rate as\n\tthe Rogue. Note that if you took the Knife Master Rogue Archetype, only your\n\tRogue Sneak Attack dice are d8&#8217;s; your Arcane Trickster dice are still\n\td6&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Impromptu Sneak Attack<\/span> (Ex): The Arcane\n\tTrickster gets a lot of great tricks which allow them to use Sneak Attack,\n\tlike casting Invisibility. Sometimes you need a little extra help, which is\n\twhere Impromptu Sneak Attack comes in. You only get it once a day (twice at\n\t7th level), but it&#8217;s good to have this in a pinch.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tricky Spells<\/span> (Su): Situational, but\n\tfantastic in a grapple or if you need to do something clever like casting an\n\tillusion while someone is staring at you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisible Thief<\/span> (Su): Wizards can cast\n\tGreater Invisibility by 7th level, and other full arcane casters can cast it\n\tby 8th level. With 3 levels given up to get into Arcane Trickster, an Arcane\n\tTrickster can expect to cast Greater Invisibility at 10th or 11th character\n\tlevel. You get Invisible Thief at 15th or 17th character level. The rounds per\n\tday are .<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Surprise Spells<\/span>: This is where the Arcane\n\tTrickster overtakes nearly every other Blaster in the game. Drop a Cone of\n\tCold on a group of enemies and you will exceed other spellcasters by 6 or 7d6\n\tdamage. Scorching Ray will still be your bread and butter, but a big AOE is a\n\tfantastic opener.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"base-classes\">Base Classes<\/h2>\n\n<p>The Arcane Trickster requires two base classes: One to provide arcane spells,<br>\n\tand one to provide Sneak Attack.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-red\">Bloodrager<\/h4>\n<p>Literally the worst option you can find. It takes a full 8 levels to meet the\n\tArcane Trickster&#8217;s spellcasting requirements, and the Bloodrager&#8217;s paltry\n\tnumber of spell slots isn&#8217;t nearly enough to fuel your need to constantly cast\n\tScorching Ray. If you wanted to build a weird melee trickster it may look\n\ttempting, but giving up 8 levels of Sneak Attack progression largely\n\tinvalidates the purpose of the class.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-orange\">Arcanist<\/h4>\n<p>The Arcanist receives spells at the same levels as the sorcerer, but gets as\n\tmany spell slots as a wizard, combining the drawbacks of both classes. The\n\tarcanist&#8217;s big draw is the ability to change their spell selection on a daily\n\tbasis, then cast from that pool as though they were a spontaneous caster.\n\tArcane tricksters typically cast from a small set of favored spells which\n\tnever changes, so the appeal of the Arcanist is largely wasted on the arcane\n\ttrickster.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/h4>\n<p>Bards get second level spells at the same level as the Sorcerer, and have\n\tmuch better skills. Unfortunately, the Bard doesn&#8217;t have access to offensive\n\tspells which can be used to Sneak Attack. If you plan to be more of a melee\n\ttrickster, the Bard offers some interesting archetypes.<\/p>\n<h5>Archetypes<\/h5>\n<p>Only archetypes which take effect before you switch to Arcane Trickster\n\tlevels are included.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Duelist<\/span>: A more melee-focused Bard,\n\tthe Arcane Duelist gives up much of the Bard&#8217;s skill abilities to focus on\n\tdealing damage. Bardic Music won&#8217;t be very helpful, but the Arcane Duelist\n\tgets both Arcane Strike and a bonus feat by level 3.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Archaeologist<\/span>: The Archaeologist&#8217;s Luck\n\tability is a much better option for the Arcane Trickster than Bardic\n\tPerformance. Clever Explorer helps with scouting, and Uncanny Dodge can be\n\thelpful on a lightly armored character.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Archivist<\/span>: Still stuck with a variant of\n\tBardic Performance, but Lore Master lets you take 20 on one Knowledge check in\n\ta day, and Magic Lore can largely replace Trapfinding.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-orange\">Magus<\/h4>\n<p>The Magus gets second level spells at the same level as the Sorcerer, and\n\toffers some very interesting options for a melee trickster. 4 levels brings\n\tArcane Pool, Spell Combat, Spellstrike, one Magus Arcana, and Spell Recall.\n\tWith a bit of focus, this combination of abilities can make for a fantastic\n\tpile of damage by combining Spellstrike with Sneak Attack. In addition, the\n\tMagus allows you to cast spells in light armor, which helps with the Arcane\n\tTrickster&#8217;s AC problems.<\/p>\n<h5>Archetypes<\/h5>\n<p>Only archetypes which take effect before you switch to Arcane Trickster\n\tlevels are included.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bladebound<\/span>: The blade&#8217;s abilities won&#8217;t scale\n\twhile you take Arcane Trickster levels, so it will quickly become useless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eldritch Scion<\/span>: The Eldritch Scion is\n\tCharisma-based, which can be a good option if you plan to use the Ninja\n\tbecause it will help with your Ki Pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hexcrafter<\/span>: If you don&#8217;t plan to use Spell\n\tRecall, gaining a free Witch Hex can be very helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Kensai<\/span>: You are already giving up a lot of\n\tspellcasting to be an Arcane Trickster. Don&#8217;t give up more.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Myrmidarch<\/span>: You are already giving up a lot\n\tof spellcasting to be an Arcane Trickster. Don&#8217;t give up more.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skirnir<\/span>: A shield helps with the Arcane\n\tTrickster&#8217;s AC problem, but the diminished spellcasting is crippling.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Soul Forger<\/span>: You are already giving up a lot\n\tof spellcasting to be an Arcane Trickster. Don&#8217;t give up more.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spellblade<\/span>: Two-Weapon Fighting is very hard\n\tfor the Arcane Trickster because their BAB is terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Staff Magus<\/span>: This doesn&#8217;t really improve\n\tthe Magus in this case.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/h4>\n<p>The Sorcerer gets 2nd-level spells one level behind the Wizard, so it tends\n\tto be used less than the Wizard. However, the sorcerer&#8217;s larger pool of spell\n\tslots can be appealing for arcane tricksters because they typically rely on\n\tsuch a small pool of favored spells.<\/p>\n<h5>Archetypes<\/h5>\n<p>Only archetypes which take effect before you switch to Arcane Trickster\n\tlevels are included.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Crossblooded<\/span>: Giving up spells known is very\n\thard when you&#8217;re already giving up 3 levels of spellcasting to become an\n\tArcane Trickster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Eldritch Scrapper<\/span>: You won&#8217;t gain enough\n\tlevels to make use of Martial Flexibility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Mongrel Mage<\/span>: Because you will only take 4\n\tlevels of Sorcerer, you will get very few bloodline powers, and the special\n\tabilities will quickly stop mattering.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Witch<\/h4>\n<p>Witches get spells at the same rate that wizards do, and give you a familiar\n\t(familiars are great for skill-heavy characters). Three levels of Witch gets\n\tyou two Hexes, which gives you a lot great utility options. Fortune is great\n\tfor your skills, Prehensile Hair will let you dual-weild crossbows if that&#8217;s\n\tsomething you want, and Nails can give you a decent backup melee option. See\n\tmy\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/witch\/hexes\">Witch Hex Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor more help picking hexes.<\/p>\n<h5>Archetypes<\/h5>\n<p>Most witch archetypes are bad, and none of them help the Arcane Trickster in\n\tany way. Gravewalker looks tempting, but Possess Undead is the only thing that\n\tworks well for tricksters, and it doesn&#8217;t come online until 8th level.<\/p>\n<h5>Patrons<\/h5>\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Wizard<\/h4>\n<p>Wizards get 2nd-level spells earlier than any other Arcane spellcaster,\n\tmaking them the obvious choice for the Arcane Trickster&#8217;s spellcasting class.\n\tThe ability to buy spells known dramatically improves the trickster&#8217;s\n\tversatility. The only issue with the Wizard is the relatively limited number\n\tof spells per day.<\/p>\n<h5>Archetypes<\/h5>\n<p>Only archetypes which take effect before you switch to Arcane Trickster\n\tlevels are included.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Bomber<\/span>: Literally never.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Exploiter Wizard<\/span>: Arcane Bond and Arcane\n\tSchool offer a lot of great options, but the ability to boost your spell DC\n\tand caster level can help you keep up with dedicated spellcasters. An Arcanist\n\tExploit offers some interesting options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Scrollmaster<\/span>: Save this for straight\n\tcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Siege Mage<\/span>: An Arcane Trickster is not using\n\tsiege weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell Sage<\/span>: Focused Spells will get you a\n\tfree ray with Scorching Ray, which is nice, but Spell Study uses spell slots\n\ttoo quickly for the Arcane Trickster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellslinger<\/span>: Not as awful for the Arcane\n\tTrickster as it is for a normal Wizard, the Spellslinger&#8217;s access to firearms\n\tis an interesting option. This greatly improves the number of spells with\n\twhich you can Sneak Arrack because you can turn cone and line spells into\n\tattacks. However, this limits you to a single shot per round when you can use\n\tScorching Ray to make several.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spirit Whisperer<\/span>: If you planned to take a\n\tfamiliar, you can trade your arcane school for a small buff to your\n\tfamiliar.<\/p>\n<h5>Schools<\/h5>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Abjuration<\/span>: The Arcane Trickster isn&#8217;t much\n\tof a support character, and defensive buffs don&#8217;t help much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Conjuration<\/span>: Summoning isn&#8217;t typically in\n\tthe Arcane Trickster&#8217;s wheelhouse, but the Teleportation subschool can be\n\tfantastically helpful for the Arcane Trickster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divination<\/span>: Forewarned ensures that, even if\n\tyou&#8217;re surprised, you can probably Sneak Attack in the surprise round. The\n\tForesight subschool offers a fantastic reroll mechanic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Enchantment<\/span>: Save or suck effects don&#8217;t\n\treally work for the Arcane Trickster because their spell DC&#8217;s won&#8217;t keep up\n\twith full casters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Evocation<\/span>: Intense Spells offers a tiny\n\tdamage boost to your spells, and the Admixture subschool makes it easier to\n\tuse Scorching Ray when you encounter enemies which are resistant to fire. This\n\tdoesn&#8217;t seem like much, but Scorching Ray is important to the Arcane\n\tTrickster&#8217;s most common tactic, and it can be completely shut down by\n\tresistance or immunity to fire.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Illusion<\/span>: Extended Illusions won&#8217;t really\n\thelp because you only get 3 levels of it. Blinding ray is helpful in a pinch,\n\tbut it means that you&#8217;re only Sneak Attacking every other round. While you use\n\tit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Necromancy<\/span>: Arcane Tricksters can&#8217;t do much\n\twith undead pets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transmutation<\/span>: Physical Enhancement will\n\tonly give you a +1 to one ability. Battleshaping out of the Shapechange\n\tsubschool can be nice to get an extra natural attack to Sneak Attack with if\n\tyou&#8217;re in melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Universalist<\/span>: Hand of the Apprentice is\n\tmediocre. Arcane Tricksters are just as good at throwing a weapon normally.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Air<\/span>: Garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth<\/span>: Garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Fire<\/span>: Garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Water<\/span>: Garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Metal<\/span>: Garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wood<\/span>: On par with Transmutation, and you\n\tget some Druid spells which don&#8217;t really help the Arcane Trickster.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Sneak Attack Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemist<\/h4>\n<p>Only usable with the Vivisectionist archetype (see below).<\/p>\n<h5>Archetypes<\/h5>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vivisectionist<\/span>: A very interesting option,\n\tthe Vivisectionist gets +2d6 Sneak Attack at level 3, Brew Potion, Mutagen,\n\tThrow Anything, a Discovery, Poison Resistance, Poison Use, Swift Alchemy,\n\tTorturer&#8217;s Eye, Cruel Anatomist, and 3 1st-level extracts per day. However,\n\tthe Alchemist only gets 4+ skill ranks, and skill ranks will be a problem for\n\tmany Arcane Trickster builds attempting to fill in for a conventional rogue.\n\tIf you combine alchemist with Wizard you can double-dip on Intelligence, which\n\twill help compensate for the lack of skill ranks from your class.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Ninja<\/h4>\n<p>On par with the Rogue, the Ninja gets +2d6 Sneak Attack at level 3, and\n\tbrings Poison Use, the Ninja&#8217;s Ki Pool, a Ninja Trick, and No Trace. The size\n\tof the Ki Pool won&#8217;t be very large because it&#8217;s level-dependent, but it offers\n\tsome useful options like Vanishing Trick (turn Invisible as a swift action).\n\tThe reliance on Charisma works well if you plan to use Sorcerer as your\n\tspellcasting class, but you&#8217;ll lag behind other Arcane Trickster builds in\n\tskills, so this option may work best in parties with another high-skill\n\tcharacter to fill the gaps.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue<\/h4>\n<p>The gold standard since Arcane Trickster was written, the Rogue gets +2d6\n\tSneak Attack at level 3 and brings Evasion, Trapfinding, Trap Sense, and a\n\tRogue Talent. The vanilla and unchained rogues will both work fine, but the\n\tthe unchained version is outright better in nearly every way, with the\n\tpossible exception of the removal of some of my favorite Rogue Talents, like\n\tOffensive Defense. The biggest difference you&#8217;ll see in the three levels we\n\tcare about is whether or not you get Finesse Training, which only matters if\n\tyou want to use melee weapons.<\/p>\n<h5>Archetypes<\/h5>\n<p>Only archetypes which take effect before you switch to Arcane Trickster\n\tlevels are included.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Counterfeit Mage<\/span>: Magical Expertise is the\n\tonly ability which the Arcane Trickster will see from this archetype until\n\tvery high level, and because the Arcane Trickster can already cast spells UMD\n\tis much less important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Knife Master<\/span>: The Arcane Trickster will\n\tfrequently Sneak Attack with spells, and we don&#8217;t want to give up that\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poisoner<\/span>: The Arcane Trickster already has\n\tplenty of tricks without Poison, but if you really want to use Poison the\n\tPoisoner archetype is a must.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Rake<\/span>: Intimidating a target makes them\n\tShaken, and therefore more vulnerable to your other spells, so Bravado&#8217;s Blade\n\tcan be very effective for the Arcane Trickster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Sniper<\/span>: You trade your only Rogue Talent for\n\t10 feet more Sneak Attack range. Slightly useful, but getting a Rogue Talen\n\tallows you to take the Extra Talent feat to get more.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-red\">Slayer<\/h4>\n<p>Takes far too long to get enough Sneak Attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Arcane Trickster&#8217;s abilities depend heavily on your choice of base class, especially Intelligence and Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump to 7 on nearly any Arcane\n\tTrickster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Important for AC, saves, and\n\tattacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Crucial for the Arcane Trickster&#8217;s bad\n\tFortitude saves and lousy hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Int<\/span>: If you use the Arcanist, Magus, or Wizard, this is\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">blue.<\/span>. If not, it&#8217;s\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> because you need it for skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wis<\/span>: Only needed for Will saves, and the\n\tcombination of multiclassing with spellcasting classes should give you a\n\tdecent base Will save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Cha<\/span>: If you use the Bard or Sorcerer, this is\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>, otherwise it&#8217;s\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> because it&#8217;s helpful for social\n\tskills.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Dexterity and\/or your spellcasting ability are great, but technically not essential because the Arcane Trickster doesn&#8217;t depend on spell DC&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: Nothing helpful to the Arcane\n\tTrickster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: With bonuses to both Dexterity and\n\tIntelligence, the Elf is a fantastic option for the Arcane Trickster.

Arcane\n\t\tTricksters are both.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Point-Blank Shot<\/span>: To use Sneak Attack, you\n\t\tneed to be within 30 feet, and a +1 to attack and damage is nice, though not\n\t\tterribly significant.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Precise Shot<\/span>: Your allies will\n\t\t\t\tabsolutely be in melee with your targets. You will depend almost\n\t\t\t\texclusively on ranged touch attacks, so you shouldn&#8217;t have too many\n\t\t\t\tproblems, but a removing that -4 penalty will nearly guarantee\n\t\t\t\tsuccess.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Precise Shot<\/span>: You can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSneak Attack enemies with concealment.

Scorching Ray, the\n\t\tArcane Trickster&#8217;s favorite spell, is only 2nd-level, leaving 7 levels worth\n\t\tof metamagic that you can apply to it for free. How about Quickened and\n\t\tEmpowered? How about Maximized and Empowered? You don&#8217;t get to\n\t\tmaximize\/empower your Sneak Attack damage, but you get a pile of rays, each\n\t\tof which apply Sneak Attack damage, and the damage is enhanced by your\n\t\tmetamagic feats. All that from two 2nd-level spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: If you plan to go into\n\t\tmelee, you need Weapon Finesse. However, you will likely find that you\n\t\tdamage output is much better if you use spells. You can also go for three\n\t\tlevels\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Metamagic Feats<\/h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Spell<\/span>: If you didn&#8217;t go for\n\t\tAdmixture Wizard, energy resitance to fire will cripple you. Elemental Spell\n\t\tcan easily solve that problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Empower Spell<\/span>: In my opinion Empower is a\n\t\tbetter payoff than Maximize. Combining the two can be horrifyingly\n\t\teffective, but neither boost your additional damage from Sneak Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intensified Spell<\/span>: Intensified Spell\n\t\tspecifically increase the cap on damage dice, which tragically means that\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t use it to get extra rays out of Scorching Ray. It&#8217;s tempting once\n\t\tyou get Surprise Spells, but at that point you can easily afford a metamagic\n\t\trod (lesser or standard will suffice) for the two or three times per day\n\t\tthat you&#8217;ll get lucky enough to find a room that looks to be in need of a\n\t\tSneak Attack-laden Fireball.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Maximize Spell<\/span>: Not always useful, but\n\t\ttempting with Spell Perfection.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quicken Spell<\/span>: Essential at high level.\n\t\tTwice as many Scorching Rays means twice as much damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silent Spell<\/span>: When you find enemies, you\n\t\tare hopefully sneaking around and making a concerted effort to remain\n\t\tunnoticed Casting a spell with verbal components is a great way to ruin that\n\t\teffort. But on a typical day you may not havy any need for Silent Spell, so\n\t\tconsider a metamagic rod.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Still Spell<\/span>: Too infrequently useful. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re worried about being grappled, you have Tricky Spells available, or\n\t\tyou can look for spells without somatic components like Dimension Door.\n\t\tQuicken Spells also removes somatic components.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dagger<\/span>: Carry a few even if you don&#8217;t plan\n\t\tto use them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hand Crossbow<\/span>: Pick up the Witch Hex\n\t\tPrehensile Hair or the Alchemist Discovery Extra Hand, and you can use\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting with hand crossbows. Arcane Trickster is a terrible way\n\t\tto pursue this option, but it&#8217;s technically an option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapier<\/span>: The go-to melee option if you\n\t\tplan to take Weapon Finesse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shortbow<\/span>: Nice if you run out of better\n\t\toptions, but personally I would turn to cantrips before restorting to\n\t\tsomething as simple as a bow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Leather<\/span>: Wear it until you can cast\n\t\tspells or upgrade to a mithral shirt.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Armor<\/span>: +4 AC, hours per level\n\t\tduration. If you can&#8217;t wear armor, this is a lifesaver.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Shirt<\/span>: If you picked a\n\t\tspellcasting class which allows you to wear armor, the Mithral Shirt is your\n\t\tbest bet.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Buckler<\/span>: Most Arcane Tricksters\n\t\tcan&#8217;t wear real armor, so AC bonuses are crucial. With no check penalty or\n\t\tspell failure, a mithral buckler is one of the cheapest and easiest AC\n\t\tinvestments that you can make. Every Arcane Trickster should have one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section won&#8217;t address every spell on your spell list, but it will point out some especially notable options. For a complete list of spells, see the <a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/indices\/spelllists.html\">SRD Spell Index<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Invisibility<\/span>: Normally a must for\n\t\tmundane rogues, you have several powerful options for making yourself\n\t\tinvisible, so this is much less useful. It&#8217;s still tempting to be invisible\n\t\tall the time, but consider how many 2nd-level Pearls of Power you could buy\n\t\tfor the ring&#8217;s 20,000gp cost. Are you going to cast invisibility more than 5\n\t\ttimes in a day on a consistent basis? Probably not, but that&#8217;s a judgement\n\t\tcall that you&#8217;ll need to make based on the game you&#8217;re playing in.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rods\">Rods<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic (See above)<\/span>: Metamagic rods in\n\t\tpathfinder are spectacular and inexpensive. Grab a few favorites like Extend\n\t\tSpell, Intensify Spell, and Silent Spell. Conveniently you can rely on\n\t\tLesser metamagic rods for Scorching Ray, so you can afford a sizeable\n\t\tcollection of rods.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"staffs\">Staffs<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I normally likes staffs a lot, but the Arcane Trickster has few meaningful options. Only two staffs include Scorching Ray, and both are expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Staff of Dark Flame<\/span>: False Life is a\n\t\tfanftasic option, but perhaps the best part of the staff is that Ray of\n\t\tEnfeeblement and Scorching Ray both cost 1 charge, so you can cast a\n\t\t1st-level spell into the staff to get an extra use a 2nd-level spell. That&#8217;s\n\t\tvery efficient, but for the same price you buy almost 12 2nd-level Pearls of\n\t\tPower, which will get you more uses of Scorching Ray <em>and<\/em> won&#8217;t eat\n\t\tyour 1st-level spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Staff of Many Rays<\/span>: All rays means that\n\t\tevery single spell in the staff is a candidate for Sneak Attack. The\n\t\tarrangement of the charge costs means that you can expend three 1st-level\n\t\tspell slots to get a 6th-level spell (Disintegrate, specifically), which is\n\t\ta pretty great exchange. Unfortunately, by the time you can reasonably\n\t\tafford one of these you can probably do more damage with Scorching Ray.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Just your ordinary Rogue\/Wizard\/Arcane Trickster<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>Anything but ordinary.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Arcane Trickster can do nearly anything.

They are the most obvious entry points for the Arcane Trickster, and they work very well. Because of the skill requirements for the class, we will start with Wizard, then move into Rogue. Our favored class will be Wizard because it will be the majority of our non-prestige classes by the time we hit level 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will use Evocation (Admixture) as our Arcane School, and we will take a ring as our Arcane Bond option. The Monkey is a tempting option as a familiar because familiars share skills with their masters, but this is intended to be a simple example build. If you want a Monkey to scout and pick locks for you, it is a hilarious and excellent decision. The Admixture subschool ability allows us to switch Scorching Ray to do other types of energy damage, which removes the issue of energy resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Allocating skills is difficult, and depends heavily on the makeup of your party.
