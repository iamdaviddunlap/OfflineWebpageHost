Some skills,\n\tsome spells, they&#8217;ve had a little of everything. But what if a Bard could have\n\ta little more \u201ceverything\u201d? What if a Bard could specialize into being a\n\tgeneralist? Well, that is the College of Lore. Bards get three skill\n\tproficiencies. The College of Lore Bard gets <em>three more<\/em> skill\n\tproficiencies. The Bard gets Magical Secrets. The College of Lore goes and\n\tgets an extra helping four levels early.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with all those choices, all those options, it would be so easy to make\n\tall the wrong choices. So easy to spread a character too thin, a jack of all\n\ttrades and master of none kind of problem. Conversely, it would be so easy to\n\tchoose to put all our eggs into one basket and be a one trick pony. That right\n\tthere is the fine balancing act the College of Lore must perform. We can&#8217;t do\n\teverything all the time all at once, but we don&#8217;t have to hyperfocus on being\n\treally good at one thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, you might ask, how should we build from there? There&#8217;s no easy one\n\tsize fits all answer. Not for most Bards, and doubly so for the College of\n\tLore. We must instead first look at our companions and determine their\n\tstrengths and weaknesses so that we may fill in where they lack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">College of Lore Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-lore-ability-scores\">College of Lore Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-lore-races\">College of Lore Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#bonus-feat-races\">Bonus Feat Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cantrip-races\">Cantrip Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-lore-feats\">College of Lore Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-lore-weapons\">College of Lore Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-lore-armor\">College of Lore Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-college-of-lore-builds-the-choose-your-own-adventure-subclass\">Example College of Lore Builds &#8211; The Choose Your Own Adventure Subclass<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#build-one-the-sorcerers-apprentice\">Build One &#8211; The Sorcerer&#8217;s Apprentice<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

We&#8217;ll be using\n\t\t\t\t\tcantrips mostly, but we can still swing a rapier or use a bow for a\n\t\t\t\t\tbit. Until we hit level 5 and things like Extra Attack come online,\n\t\t\t\t\twe&#8217;re just as good with a weapon as almost anyone else.<br><br>We\n\t\t\t\t\ttake care of covering all the knowledge skills while still managing to\n\t\t\t\t\talso fit in the negotiation skills.<br><br>For cantrips, we take\n\t\t\t\t\tVicious Mockery for damage and debuffing saving throws, and we take\n\t\t\t\t\tPrestidigitation because it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/prestidigitation\/#prestidigitation\">very useful for a variety of effects<\/a>.<br><br>For leveled spells we pick up an array of debuffs and\n\t\t\t\t\tsupport spells to fill our role of Arcanist Support, as well as\n\t\t\t\t\tHealing Word.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Jack of All Trades<br><br>Song of Rest &#8211; d6<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-1st-level\n\t\t\t\t\tSpells<br>-Bane<\/td><td>Jack of All Trades is a great feature.

It&#8217;s a strong debuff for saves that targets Charisma, a\n\t\t\t\t\ttraditionally weak save. If Disadvantage is mathematically about -3 to\n\t\t\t\t\tany roll, and Bane is -1d4, which averages -2.5, then Bane is\n\t\t\t\t\tDisadvantage to all Attacks and Saves, but also stacks with further\n\t\t\t\t\tDisadvantage. Another way to look at Bane is giving your whole party\n\t\t\t\t\tan extra 2.5 AC on average vs those targets. Also, we&#8217;re not\n\t\t\t\t\tConcentrating on anything else yet. However, it does allow a save,\n\t\t\t\t\tonly targets 3 enemies unless you upcast it, and enemies have a bad\n\t\t\t\t\thabit of dying quickly after you cast this so the effects are often\n\t\t\t\t\tshort-lived. It&#8217;s not a go-to spell in every situation, but it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tappealing in fights that are going to last a while where you&#8217;re facing\n\t\t\t\t\troughly 3 enemies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>College of Lore<br>-Bonus Skills<br>-Deception<br>-Intimidation<br>-Perception<br>-Cutting Words<br><br>Expertise<br>-Insight<br>-Perception<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-2nd-level Spells<br>-Enhance Ability<br>-Shatter<br>-Removed Spell: Sleep<\/td><td>We take on the College of Lore at this level, getting three more\n\t\t\t\t\tskills right away, Deception, Intimidation, and Perception.<br><br>We\n\t\t\t\t\talso get Cutting Words here, a way to use our Bardic Inspiration as a\n\t\t\t\t\treaction ability to lower an attack roll, ability check, or the damage\n\t\t\t\t\tof an attack.
