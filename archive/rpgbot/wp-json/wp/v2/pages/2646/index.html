Arcane Shot is the heart of the subclass, and with just two shots per Short or Loing Rest, you can&#8217;t afford to rely on your signature feature often enough for it to be a meaningful part of your character. Arcane Archer gets a couple of excellent features, but they simply don&#8217;t compensate for the massive amount of time you&#8217;ll spend wishing that you had more Arcane Shot uses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/arcane-archer\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26221\">Arcane Archer Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Archer Lore<\/span>: A skill proficiency\n\t\tand a cantrip.

A lot of people mis-read the feature&#8217;s text:\n\t\tyou get additional Arcane Shot <em>options<\/em>, not Arcane Shot\n\t\t<em>uses<\/em> as you gain levels. Plan to reserve your Arcane Shot uses until doing so is\n\t\texceptionally beneficial, because you don&#8217;t get enough to be careless with them.\n<p>This resource constraint was apparently intentional. The designers intended for the shot uses\nto remain flat, but for the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mikemearls\/status\/937496034254536704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">powers to increase over time<\/a> to keep the Arcane Archer consistently\npowerful. Unfortunately, they forgot the part where the power increases over time, and, since\nnone of the options are restricted by level, you are most powerful relative to your enemies\nat level 3 and only diminish in effectiveness from there.<\/p>\n<p>The saving throws are based on your Intelligence\n\t\tscore, which likely won&#8217;t be stellar, so your save DC may not be high enough\n\t\tto be reliable. Try to pick options which work against a variety of saving\n\t\tthrows and use them on foes which are bad at the chosen saving throw.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Banishing Arrow<\/span>: Take the target\n\t\t\t\tcreature out of combat for one round. This allows a Charisma saving\n\t\t\t\tthrow, and most creatures have absolutely terrible Charisma saves, so\n\t\t\t\tthis is decently reliable even with a poor save DC. Creatures which you\n\t\t\t\tmight expect to banish (demons, elementals, etc.) often have high\n\t\t\t\tCharisma saves, but you&#8217;re free to use Banishing Arrow on creatures of\n\t\t\t\tany type, so if you want to banish a dinosaur or a zombie or something\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re ready to go.\n\t\t\t\t<p>At high level this adds a little bit of damage, but it&#8217;s a negligible\n\t\t\t\t\tquantity of damage and it doesn&#8217;t improve Banishing Arrow&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tusefulness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beguiling Arrow<\/span>: Prevents the target\n\t\t\t\tfrom attacking one of your allies for one round, and does a little bit\n\t\t\t\tof bonus damage. This allows a saving throw and relies on the Charmed\n\t\t\t\tcondition, so many creatures will be resistant, immune, or will have a\n\t\t\t\tgood chance of resisting simply due to a decent Wisdom score.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bursting Arrow<\/span>: A bit of extra damage\n\t\t\t\tand AOE damage with no saving throw. Excellent in an opening volley\n\t\t\t\tagainst groups of enemies, but it also requires that your enemies be\n\t\t\t\tnumerous and tightly packed to make this worthwhile. Unfortunately,\n\t\t\t\tBursting Arrow&#8217;s damage bonus isn&#8217;t &#8220;extra damage&#8221; so the damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Enfeebling Arrow<\/span>: Creatures that rely\n\t\t\t\ton weapon attacks tend to have good Constitution saving throws.\n\t\t\t\tBanishing Arrow will be more effective if you need an enemy not to do\n\t\t\t\tany damage for a turn.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grasping Arrow<\/span>: Bonus damage and a\n\t\t\t\tspeed debuff with ongoing damage. The target can waste its action to\n\t\t\t\t<em>attempt<\/em> to remove the brambles, but, even if they succeed,\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;ve wasted their Action for a turn, which is a trade that you should\n\t\t\t\tbe very happy to make.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Piercing Arrow<\/span>: Bonus damage, hit\n\t\t\t\teverything in a line, and ignore full cover. Unfortunately it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\t\t\thit more than two creatures with a line, and, since the line is only 30\n\t\t\t\tfeet long, you&#8217;ll need to be in close quarters to use this. Plan to spend\n\t\t\t\tas much movement as possible moving away after using this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Seeking Arrow<\/span>: Ignoring cover and such\n\t\t\t\tis nice, but the big draw is that you learn the target&#8217;s location, so\n\t\t\t\tyou can locate invisible creatures and enemies who might be hiding or\n\t\t\t\ttrying to escape from you.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Arrow<\/span>: An excellent way to\n\t\t\t\tincapacitate enemies who use extended reach, ranged weapons, or spells.\n\t\t\t\tUnfortunately it&#8217;s on a Wisdom save, so, if you just need a creature to\n\t\t\t\tbe unable to attack for a turn, you&#8217;ll have better results with Banishing\n\t\t\t\tArrow.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Arrow<\/span>: If you&#8217;re in a campaign with\n\t\tfew or no magic items, this is absolutely essential.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Curving Shot<\/span>: Redirect a missed attack\n\t\tonce per turn. Absolutely amazing, at least in theory. With 2 to 4 attacks per turn, you&#8217;re\n\t\tinevitably going to miss with some of them, so turning a missed attack into\n\t\tanother chance to hit something provides roughly as much attack output as\n\t\tthe Crossbow Expert feat. This also makes the attack penalty from the\n\t\tSharpshooter feat less risky. All around, it&#8217;s really great, <em>in theory<\/em>.\n<p>Unfortunately, you are required to use a magic arrow here, and the Magic Arrow feature doesn&#8217;t actually make your arrows magical despite the name being &#8220;Magic Arrow&#8221;. This means that you are required to find magic arrows, most of which are single-use, in order to use what is arguably your best class feature. Jeremy Crawford has stated on Twitter that\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/arcane-archer-the-arcane-shot-feature-is-not-intended-to-require-a-magic-arrow-errata\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this an error<\/a>, but that was 2017 and we still don&#8217;t have errata. At my tables I would allow the Magic Arrow feature to work with Curving Shot. There needs to be <em>something<\/em> mechanically appealing about the Arcane Archer. If your DM won&#8217;t make that concession, maybe they&#8217;ll let you collect some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/magic-items\/36838-unbreakable-arrow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unbreakable Arrows<\/a>, which are the only arrows I know of which aren&#8217;t single use.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ever-Ready Shot<\/span>: Now you can afford to\n\t\tuse your signature ability in every encounter. Sure, it&#8217;s only once and\n\t\tthat&#8217;s not nearly enough, but considering how resource-starved the Arcane\n\t\tArcher is, this is still a massive improvement.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Shot (improved shots)<\/span>: At this\n\t\tlevel all of your Arcane Shot options deal 1d6 or 2d6 more damage and literally nothing else changes. This is\n\t\tnot at all significant when we&#8217;re 1 level past wizards casting Wish.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-master\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/fighter#BattleMaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle Master<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want a martial character with a combat toolset as versatile as a\n\tspellcasters? Do you want to go beyond the basic combat mechanics and reflect\n\ta more nuanced style of combat? Do you see the battlefield as a complex chess\n\tgame to be mastered and dominated? Do you want to shout the names of your\n\tspecial attacks? The Battle Master may be for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Battle Master is more complicated than most fighter subclasses, but has\n\tthe potential to do a lot of cool tricks beyond repeatedly stabbing things\n\tuntil they fall down. Each maneuver, much like a spell, is a tool tailor-made\n\tto address a specific situation or problem, allowing the Battle Master to\n\trespond dynamically to scenarios which are often more complex than simple hit\n\tpoint attrition and which require more nuanced solutions than swinging your\n\tweapon until your enemy falls down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While almost every one of the Battle Master&#8217;s maneuvers works with melee\n\tweapons, many of them also work with ranged attacks. This allows for cool\n\tthings like using Disarming Attack to shoot a weapon out of a target&#8217;s hand or\n\tusing Goading Attack to make it hard for a melee-only enemy to attack\n\teffectively for a turn. Many of the Battle Master&#8217;s best maneuvers are\n\tmelee-only, but a ranged battle master is still viable and effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Martial Adept feat (PHB) and Fighting Style (Superior Technique) both grant additional maneuvers and superiority dice, making them great additions to the Battle Master&#8217;s limited pool of both. More dice means that you can use your maneuvers more often, and knowing more maneuvers means that you have more room to explore situational options to broaden your ability to respond to unusual circumstances in combat. This is a heavy feat cost, but many of the Battle Master&#8217;s maneuvers replicate the effects of feats, so you may find that a maneuver is sufficient in place of a whole feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/battle-master\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14757\">Battle Master Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Superiority<\/span>: You get four\n\t\tsuperiority dice, which means you get to use 4 maneuvers between each\n\t\tshort\/long rest. You gradually get more dice, allowing for more maneuvers at\n\t\thigher levels, and you gradually add more known maneuvers. You can replace\n\t\tknown maneuvers as you level, but since there aren&#8217;t any maneuvers with\n\t\tprerequisites or anything, you really only need to replace maneuvers that\n\t\tyou tried and didn&#8217;t like.\n\t\t<p>Many maneuvers add your superiority die to the damage roll if you hit.\n\t\t\tSince the damage die is added to the damage roll, the additional damage is\n\t\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit. This makes it especially appealing to apply\n\t\t\ta maneuver when you score a critical hit so that you get both a big pile\n\t\t\tof damage and a cool rider effect.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Student of War<\/span>: Artisan&#8217;s tools probably\n\t\twon&#8217;t matter to the game, but the expanded options in Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to\n\t\tEverything make this much more fun than it was when the core rules were\n\t\tpublished. Check out out\n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/tools\/\">Practical Guide to Tools<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Know Your Enemy<\/span>: This won&#8217;t come into\n\t\tplay in most encounters unless you work to make it happen, but it&#8217;s great if\n\t\tyou can get the BBEG monologuing while you study him or if you can manage to\n\t\tbe stealthy long enough to observe the target. There&#8217;s no limitation on the\n\t\tusage, so you could spend additional minutes studying the target to learn\n\t\teverything on the list and get a really good sense of the target&#8217;s\n\t\tstats.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Combat Superiority (d10)<\/span>: These\n\t\tbumps only amount to an increase of 1 each, but they feel very nice and\n\t\tsince you&#8217;re using Superiority Dice so frequently the small bonus adds\n\t\tup. As an interesting quirk, RAW if you have any dice from the Superior Technique style or the Martial Adept feat those dice also increase to d10s at this level, though that won\u2019t be reflected in DnDBeyond.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless<\/span>: This ensures that you always\n\t\thave at least one superiority die, so you don&#8217;t have to stress about using\n\t\tyour last die before the adventuring day is over.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Combat Superiority (d12)<\/span>: These\n\t\tbumps only amount to an increase of 1 each, but they feel very nice and\n\t\tsince you&#8217;re using Superiority Dice so frequently the small bonus adds\n\t\tup.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cavalier\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/fighter#Cavalier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cavalier<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Cavalier is a fantastic Defender, and possesses several features which I have been hoping to find since I first started writing handbooks for 5e which answer long-standing problems for Defenders. The Cavalier also caters well to fighting while mounted, allowing you to protect your mount from harm and providing fun abilities like Ferocious Charge, but the abilities are also worded so that fighting mounted is not strictly required so you can still go into a dungeon without your horse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/cavalier\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"16014\">Cavalier Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Proficiency<\/span>: A free skill or\n\t\tlanguage proficiency. Take the skill. Languages can be solved magically.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Born to the Saddle<\/span>: It&#8217;s difficult to\n\t\tknow how often you&#8217;ll need to make a saving throw to stay in the saddle.\n\t\tArguably anything with a save to prevent forced movement would count\n\t\t(Thunderwave, Command (Flee), Telekinesis, etc.), but it&#8217;s not clear.\n\t\tAllowing you to mount\/dismount for only 5 feet of movement means that you\n\t\tcan get back onto your mount when you start your turn further away. However,\n\t\tit doesn&#8217;t remove the once-per-turn limitation on mounting or dismounting a\n\t\tmount, so don&#8217;t expect to go hopping on and off of your mount a bunch of\n\t\ttimes in the same round.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unwavering Mark<\/span>: This is a great taunt\n\t\tmechanic. It makes it difficult for foes to attack your allies, and if they\n\t\tdo it anyway you get an extra attack as a Bonus Action on your next turn\n\t\twith a nice damage boost.\n\t\t<p>The Disadvantage portion of Unwavering Mark only functions while the\n\t\t\ttarget is within 5 feet of you, making lances, whips, and other reach\n\t\t\tweapons difficult to use in conjunction. You can still make the Bonus\n\t\t\tAction attack if those enemies attack someone else, but you still want to\n\t\t\tkeep enemies within 5 feet of you in order to impose Disadvantage on their\n\t\t\tattacks.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You&#8217;re limited in the number of times that you can use the Bonus\n\t\t\tAction attack between rests, so try to use the attack only as needed\n\t\t\trather than throwing it on everything you hit. But you can mark foes (and\n\t\t\timpose Disadvantage) as much as you want, so spread the marks around and\n\t\t\ttry to keep as many enemies as possible within 5 feet of you.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>For cavaliers fighting while mounted, imposing Disadvantage on attacks\n\t\t\tagainst creatures other than you is a good way to keep enemies from attacking\n\t\t\tyour mount. Considering how frail most mounts are compared to you, that&#8217;s\n\t\t\ta huge benefit.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you really want to lean into this feature, consider the Sentinel feat.\n\t\t\tIt will make it especially difficult for enemies to move away from you,\n\t\t\tmaking it easy to keep marked creatures within 5 feet of you. Even better,\n\t\t\tif they still attack a creature other than you, you get to attack them as\n\t\t\ta Reaction.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warding Maneuver<\/span>:Similar to the\n\t\tProtection Fighting Style. You can only use this a few times per Long Rest,\n\t\tso use it sparingly, and make steps to avoid needing it if you can.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold the Line<\/span>: This is considerably better\n\t\tthan the Sentinel feat in most cases, as it prevents enemies from running\n\t\taround within your reach. This means that you can reliably hold enemies in\n\t\tplace while remaining adjacent to allies so that you can protect them with\n\t\tWarding Maneuver and\/or the Protection Fighting Style. It gets even better\n\t\tif you have extended reach because it doesn&#8217;t require you to be within 5 feet\n\t\tof the target like other Unwavering Mark&#8217;s Disadvantage effect does. However, unlike Sentinel, the\n\t\tDisengage action still allows enemies to get past you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ferocious Charger<\/span>: Two important notes:\n\t\tFirst, your mount moving counts, so you don&#8217;t need to use your own movement.\n\t\tSecond, your mount can still Dash or Disengage to put distance between you\n\t\tand your enemy to set up your charge. You should be doing everything you can\n\t\tto use this every round.

You\n\t\tcan move your echo for free once per turn in addition to recreating it in a\n\t\tnew place or switching places with it, and unlike moving your own character,\n\t\tyour echo doesn&#8217;t have specific movement types so you can move it 30 feet in\n\t\tany direction,\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/1242507818986422272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">including vertically into the air<\/a>!\n\t\t<p>Remember that your echo disappears if you move too far away, but it costs\n\t\t\tyou nothing except a Bonus Action to recreate, so in many cases it may be\n\t\t\tmore effective to intentionally walk away from your Echo and recreate it\n\t\t\tthan to try to move it along with you. You can also teleport to switch\n\t\t\tplaces with your echo, allowing you to escape grapples, difficult terrain,\n\t\t\tand bindings with little effort (though it does also cost part of your\n\t\t\tmovement for the turn). There is no limitation on how often you can create\n\t\t\tyour echo, so recreating it every round is basically expected\nif yours has been destroyed by an attack or moved too far away.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There is some confusion around how this works since the Grappled\n\t\t\tcondition reduces your speed to 0, which means that you don&#8217;t have 15 feet\n\t\t\tof movement to spend. I think RAI you&#8217;re intended to be able to teleport\n\t\t\tout of a grapple, but RAW you definitely can&#8217;t since the effect doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tspecify a rules exception around grapples the way that the spell Freedom\n\t\t\tof Movement does. That said, Jeremy Crawford had a\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/932413630305275904\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discussion on Twitter<\/a>\n\t\t\tin which he discusses Freedom of Movement&#8217;s interaction with the Grapple\n\t\t\trules. He points out that once you&#8217;re no longer grappled, your speed is no\n\t\t\tlonger 0, so it makes sense that you could pay the 5-foot cost to escape a\n\t\t\tgrapple using Freedom of Movement even though your speed is 0 when you do\n\t\t\tso. We can apply that same logic to the Echo&#8217;s teleportation, and so long\n\t\t\tas you will have 15 feet of movement to spend after teleporting you can\n\t\t\tpay the cost. However, the Echo Knight&#8217;s text doesn&#8217;t specify an exception\n\t\t\tto the grapple rules, so it&#8217;s not perfectly clear. Discuss this with your\n\t\t\tDM to see how they would like to handle things.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Manifest Echo doesn&#8217;t specify, but\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/1240669629661380609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the echo is an object<\/a>. It can be targeted by things like attacks and spells, but weirdly RAW\n\t\t\tthat means that it can&#8217;t be targeted or damaged by many spells. Even\n\t\t\toptions like Meteor Swarm RAW only damage creatures, but I think a\n\t\t\treasonable DM will rule that the echo qualifies as a valid target for such\n\t\t\tthings and takes damage appropriately. This thing is already insanely\n\t\t\tpowerful, and it doesn&#8217;t need broad immunity to damage to keep it\n\t\t\tpowerful.\nIf that&#8217;s the case though, it also makes it a valid target for beneficial spells like Shield of Faith, Blur, etc. That means that it&#8217;s a valid target for Sanctuary, which is busted because the Echo never actually attacks, it just allows you to use its location.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Unleash Incarnation<\/span>: Up to 5 extra\n\t\tattacks per day.

Since the Eldritch\n\tKnight&#8217;s spellcasting is Intelligence-based, you need to put some resources\n\tinto Intelligence, but it&#8217;s easy to invest far more than necessary. Many\n\tspells will depend on your spellcasting modifier, so it&#8217;s tempting to raise\n\tyour Intelligence to get better fireballs and such, but this is usually a poor\n\tinvestment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get by on very little Intelligence (14 is likely sufficient) by\n\tsticking to spells which don&#8217;t care about your spellcasting modifier (Booming\n\tBlade, Shield, Resist Energy, etc.) and still be extremely effective.\n\tRemember: The Eldritch Knight is still primarily a fighter, so throwing\n\tfireballs is a rarity rather than your go-to tactic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s totally possible to play an eldritch knight at range, it comes with some specific challenges. Since ranged attack cantrips all depend on your spellcasting modifier, you can&#8217;t get by on as little Intelligence as melee eldritch knights. You&#8217;ll likely need to reduce your investment in Constitution to make up the difference. But in exchange for that trade, you&#8217;re better situated to capitalize on Eldritch Strike, using ranged attacks to prime enemies for cantrips like Acid Splash and Toll the Dead which will impose saves made at Disadvantage. Once you move up to Improved War Magic you can shoot several foes one round, then fireball them the next round and impose Disadvantage on their saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/eldritch-knight\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15923\">Eldritch Knight Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Spellcasting is what defines\n\t\tthe Eldritch Knight.

The +2 AC to your whole\n\t\tparty will mitigate a huge amount of damage in a typical fight. +2 on a\n\t\t20-point scale is 10% of the scale, so a +2 AC bonus will negate roughly 10%\n\t\tof all attack damage to your party in that encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Master<\/span>: By this level it&#8217;s\n\t\tentirely possible that you have raised both your Strength\/Dexterity and your\n\t\tIntelligence to 20, so your Intelligence checks may be very good. That makes\n\t\tTelekinesis a useful option in combat, especially against foes with poor\n\t\tStrength like many spellcasters. You can use this to lift foes into the air\n\t\tand drop them, to move them over pits or into hazards, or just to pull them\n\t\tinto melee range.\n\t\t<p>The ability to make a weapon attack as a Bonus Action while\n\t\t\tconcentrating on Telekinesis is very exciting. The obvious intent is that\n\t\t\tyou use your Action to use Telekinesis, and that can be a powerful\n\t\t\tcombination: lift your target into the air and shoot them, or drop them to\n\t\t\tforce them to fall prone before attacking them in melee.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>However, you&#8217;re under no obligation to actually use Telekinesis while\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re concentrating on it. The spell has a 10-minute duration, so you can\n\t\t\teasily use it as a buff to add an attack as a Bonus Action. If you enjoy\n\t\t\tthis strategy, I think you&#8217;ll agree that spending a Psionic Energy Die to\n\t\t\trecharge this ability is well worth the cost to get an additional attack\n\t\t\twith little effort.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"purple-dragon-knight\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/fighter#PurpleDragonKnight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Purple Dragon Knight \/ Banneret<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I love the flavor the Purple Dragon Knight (Banneret in non-Forgotten Realms\n\tgames). A charismatic, knightly fighter. The class adds some nice support\n\tabilities, and encourages the Fighter to serve as a Face. Unfortunately, to\n\treally work as a Face you need Charisma, which is typically a Fighter dump\n\tstat, and as great as Royal Envoy is, it&#8217;s not enough to justify significant\n\tinvestment in Charisma when the Fighter already needs to maximize two other\n\tability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest problem with the Purple Dragon Knight is that it takes the\n\tFighter, who is almost exclusively good at fighting, and tries to make them\n\tgood at some other stuff. While it&#8217;s a nice option in the right party,\n\tDungeons and Dragons is a game that rewards specialization and punishes\n\tdiversification. If you do want to play a martial Face character, the Paladin\n\tis likely a better way to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individually, each of the Purple Dragon Knight&#8217;s abilities are great, but the\n\tsum of the abilities in the broader context of the Fighter class makes the\n\tPurple Dragon Knight a difficult option. I don&#8217;t recommend this for newer\n\tplayers, but it could be a really fun option for veterans in a low-powered\n\tgame or in a party with new players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I frequently offer suggestions to help balanced problematic subclasses, but the Purple Dragon Knight is difficult to fix. I think it needs more features to make it interesting, but I haven&#8217;t come up with any options which I think would make the Purple Dragon Knight appealing without introducing more problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/purple-dragon-knight\/\">Puple Dragon Knight Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rallying Cry<\/span>: This isn&#8217;t a ton of\n\t\thealing, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be.

It does affect\n\t\tunconscious allies, as <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/u67o2kE6InA?t=1352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the\n\t\tUnconscious condition was not intended to deafen creatures<\/a> according\n\t\tto Jeremy Crawford.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Royal Envoy<\/span>: Persuasion is the king of\n\t\tsocial skills, and Expertise with it will go a very long way, \ncompensating for even a more modest Charisma score. The free skill proficiency is nice, too, but if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re planning to play a Face, then you probably have both Persuasion and\n\t\tIntimidation, and quite possibly have Insight as well. Animal Handling is\n\t\tfun flavor for a knight, but not especially useful since mounted combat is\n\t\tsuch a niche option in 5e. If you start your build planning to be a Purple\n\t\tDragon Knight, you might leave Insight or Intimidation open so that you can\n\t\tmake use of this free proficiency.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspiring Surge<\/span>: Use this on a Rogue if at\n\t\tall possible. Rogues can Sneak Attack once <em>per turn<\/em>, not once per\n\t\tround, so they could in theory sneak attack hundreds of times if enough\n\t\tpeople could give the Rogue a free attack on their turns. (This has been\n\t\texplained several times by WotC&#8217;s designers in various places.) Remember\n\t\tthat this needs to be a weapon attack, and it&#8217;s only one attack, so \nbarring a Rogue, anyone else that can make a big solid hit (Raging Barbarian, Ranger with Hunter&#8217;s Mark, Hexblade Warlock, Paladin with Smites, etc.) will do.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bulwark<\/span>: Rerolls on saving throws are\n\t\tfantastic, especially on mental saves which can often take you and your\n\t\tallies out of a fight.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rune-knight\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/fighter#RuneKnight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rune Knight<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Rune Knight runs on magic runes which they accumulate as they gain\n\tlevels. There are just 6 runes available and you&#8217;ll get 5 of them, so there&#8217;s\n\tnot much diversity in rune knight builds as you gain levels. Each rune\n\tprovides a passive buff (often a bonus to a skill) and an active ability\n\tthemed after the corresponding variety of giant. Since the active abilities\n\tare usable once per Short or Long Rest (twice once you get Master of Runes),\n\tthey feel a bit like Warlock spell slots: few in number, but big on impact,\n\tand you get them back quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tactically, the Rune Knight has a limited pool of resources and you&#8217;ll need\n\tto weigh the cost and benefit of using any given rune&#8217;s active effect. The\n\tresource management is the core complexity of the subclass, and if you can\n\tmaster that resource management you&#8217;ll find that the Rune Knight is a capable,\n\tinteresting subclass with a lot to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Rune Knight suffers is damage output. Fire Rune can do some\n\tsingle-target damage, but the only other damage boost comes from Giant&#8217;s\n\tMight. Giant&#8217;s Might provides a +1d6 damage bonus, but only while Giant&#8217;s\n\tMight is running (two to six times per day; the uses per day equal your\n\tProficiency Bonus), and only once per turn on your own turn. The die scales up\n\tto d10, but +1d10 damage per round at level 18 is an insultingly small amount\n\tof damage. The Rune Knight does a lot of cool stuff other than damage, but\n\tmake sure that the rest of your party can provide adequate damage on their\n\town. Having Strikers classes in your party like monks, rogues, rangers, and\n\twarlocks is typically sufficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being giant-themed, the Rune Knight is surprisingly appealing for a rogue-style character with high Dexterity and Charisma. Proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, and Thieves&#8217; Tools can all benefit significantly from the passive effects of runes, and nothing about the Rune Knight&#8217;s features requires high Strength (unless you want to make Strength checks with Giant&#8217;s Might).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/rune-knight\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11639\">Rune Knight Fighter Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Smith&#8217;s tools are a\n\t\tpopular option for adventurers since so much of adventuring gear is made of\n\t\tmetal, and if you get the Fire Rune you can apply Expertise with all tools\n\t\t(see Fire Rune, below, for more). One proficiency is not a driving reason to\n\t\tget good with tools, but it can add some non-combat utility to a class which\n\t\tis all about fighting. You also learn to speak Giant, which is weirdly nice\n\t\tbecause runes can give you Advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma\n\t\t(Intimidation) checks, allowing you to serve as a Face without much\n\t\tinvestment in Charisma.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rune Carver<\/span>: 2 runes at 3rd level, and\n\t\teventually you get up to 5. Since there are just 6 runes, that means that\n\t\trather than choosing which runes to learn you get to choose one to ignore\n\t\t(Frost. Skip Frost. ). There are two runes with level requirements, but\n\t\tthanks to the built-in retraining rule you can drop a different rune when\n\t\tyou hit level 7 to get both of the level-locked runes at the same time, then\n\t\tpick up whichever rune you dropped the next time you learn a new rune.\n\t\t<p>Each rune provides a passive effect and an activatable ability. The active\n\t\t\teffect can be used once per Short or Long Rest (that&#8217;s not a rule inherent\n\t\t\tto Rune Carver, but every rune works that way). Saves are\n\t\t\tConstitution-based, which is exciting because it makes it easy to justify\n\t\t\t20 Dex or Strength and 20 Constitution, which many fighter subclasses need\n\t\t\tto postpone or forgo due to their subclass&#8217;s dependence on a mental\n\t\t\tability score or a severe need for feats.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Every rune is tied to a type of giant, so don&#8217;t expect this list to\n\t\t\texpand unless WotC brings back the weird extra giants that they introduced\n\t\t\tlate in 3.5 like Death Giants. Although a high-level Death Rune would\n\t\t\tprobably be really cool. Well shoot, now I want that.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloud Rune<\/span>: Sleight of Hand and\n\t\t\t\tDeception are a weird combination of skills for your typical fighter\n\t\t\t\tsince Charisma is frequently a dump stat and even Dexterity-based\n\t\t\t\tfighters rarely take Sleight of Hand, so don&#8217;t expect to get much use\n\t\t\t\tout of those unless you&#8217;re building yourself with skills similar to a\n\t\t\t\ttypical rogue.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect allows you to retarget a successful attack to\n\t\t\t\t\tanother creature within 30 feet of you. The expectation is that you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\tgoing to redirect and enemy&#8217;s attack to hit an enemy, and that&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tprobably your best bet, but you can also use this to attack an ally\n\t\t\t\t\tand redirect the attack to an enemy which might be out of your reach\n\t\t\t\t\totherwise. Keep in mind that transferring the attack doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tautomatically hit the new target; the attack roll must still be\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared to the new target&#8217;s AC as normal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The difficulty with Cloud Rune is that it competes for space with Runic\n\t\t\t\t\tShield, which you get automatically.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire Rune<\/span>: Expertise in every tool in\n\t\t\t\twhich you&#8217;re proficient. The Rune Knight gets Smith&#8217;s Tools at level 3,\n\t\t\t\tbut you should strongly consider getting other tools, especially crucial\n\t\t\t\tadventuring options like Thieves&#8217; Tools.\n\t\t\t\t<p>While most martial enemies will be big, Strength-based monsters with\n\t\t\t\t\thigh Strength saves, there are many other types of enemies with bad\n\t\t\t\t\tStrength saves. Spellcasters, nimble enemies, and most small enemies\n\t\t\t\t\twill have poor Strength save bonuses. If you manage to keep the enemy\n\t\t\t\t\trestrained, they&#8217;ll take an impressive 20d6 damage, which is pretty\n\t\t\t\t\tgood even by the standards of many spells.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>But while that damage is exciting, the bigger benefit is that the\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget is Restrained. Restrained creatures have 0 speed, suffer\n\t\t\t\t\tDisadvantage on their attacks, grant Advantage on attacks against\n\t\t\t\t\tthem, and suffer Disadvantage on Dexterity saves. That makes the\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget bait for every attack that your party can put out. Throw this\n\t\t\t\t\ton the highest-priority enemy in an encounter and focus on them until\n\t\t\t\t\tthey drop. Consider using Action Surge the same turn in order to\n\t\t\t\t\tmaximize how much damage you can do before the target potentially\n\t\t\t\t\tescapes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frost Rune<\/span>: Animal Handling is very\n\t\t\t\tsituational, but Intimidation is a popular face skill for fighters and\n\t\t\t\tother martial classes despite usually lacking Charisma.\n\t\t\t\t<p>+2 to saves is nice, but Strength saves are extremely rare and +2 to\n\t\t\t\t\tConstitution saves for 10 minutes one to three times a day (remember:\n\t\t\t\t\tAdventuring Day rules encourage two short rests) isn&#8217;t worth a Rune.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you need better Constitution saves, put an ASI into Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bonus also applies to Strength checks, including important checks\n\t\t\t\t\tlike Athletics checks to Grapple or Shove. But remember that Giant&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tMight gives you Advantage on both Strength Checks and Strength Saves,\n\t\t\t\t\tand since both Giant&#8217;s Might and Frost Rune are activated as a Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\tAction, it&#8217;s hard to fit both into the same fight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re really concerned enough about Athletics that you still want\n\t\t\t\t\tFrost Rune, consider the Skill Expert feat. The additional bonus will\n\t\t\t\t\tbe larger than that provided by Frost Rune and it will apply\n\t\t\t\t\tconstantly without the need to activate Frost Rune. If, somehow, you\n\t\t\t\t\thave Expertise in Athletics, high enough Strength that using Athletics\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes sense, and Giant&#8217;s Might to get easy Advantage on Strength\n\t\t\t\t\tchecks, but you still somehow can&#8217;t reliably succeed at Strength\n\t\t\t\t\t(Athletics) checks, it seems likely that an occasional +2 is not going\n\t\t\t\t\tto solve whatever problem you&#8217;re facing. Consider new dice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Rune<\/span>: Spectacular passive\n\t\t\t\teffects. When you&#8217;re building out your initial Ability Scores, you will\n\t\t\t\ttypically max out your Strength or your Dexterity (depending on your\n\t\t\t\tbuild), then ideally you&#8217;ll raise your Constitution as much as makes\n\t\t\t\tsense. After that, Wisdom is a great third-highest ability score both\n\t\t\t\tfor skills and for saving throws. After that, Insight isn&#8217;t much of a\n\t\t\t\tstretch. Perpetual Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) means a +5 bonus to\n\t\t\t\tyour Passive Insight, which is a boon for your whole party. You also get\n\t\t\t\t120 ft. Darkvision, which is great for races like the Dragonborn and the\n\t\t\t\tHuman which don&#8217;t get it naturally. Even races with Darkvision tend to only have 60 ft range.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect is a Wisdom-based save-or-suck charm effect used as\n\t\t\t\t\ta Reaction. It&#8217;s not quite as good as Hold Monster, but it&#8217;s close,\n\t\t\t\t\tand like Hold Monster the target can repeat their save at the end of\n\t\t\t\t\teach of their turns. If you pair this with Fire Rune, you have one\n\t\t\t\t\tpowerful single-target crowd control effect which can affect big dumb\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies (Stone Rune) and one for smart, frail enemies (Fire Rune).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hill Rune<\/span> (7th level): Poison is\n\t\t\t\tcommon across the full level range, and resistance to it is excellent.\n\t\t\t\tMany races like dwarves already have this, so this rune does lose some of its appeal for\n\t\t\t\tthem, but the active effect is still very good.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect is a powerful defensive buff that you should\n\t\t\t\t\tabsolutely employ when facing the prospect of significant weapon\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage. It&#8217;s one of those abilities where you&#8217;ll always wonder if you\n\t\t\t\t\tmight need it more later, but if a fight looks like any significant\n\t\t\t\t\tthreat and your enemies are relying on weapon damage types, use this\n\t\t\t\t\tas soon as attacks come your way. Resistance to weapon damage also\n\t\t\t\t\tmakes it easier to justify using two-handed weapons since your AC is\n\t\t\t\t\tless important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Storm Rune<\/span> (7th level): Arcana isn&#8217;t a\n\t\t\t\tskill that you&#8217;ll be good at (you likely dumped Intelligence since you\n\t\t\t\thave no other usage for it built into the class), but never being\n\t\t\t\tsurprised is great on any character.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The active effect turns your Reaction into a reroll on any d20 roll\n\t\t\t\t\twhich happens within 60 feet of you. You do need to use the Reaction\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the roll happens, but that&#8217;s probably fine. Use this to support\n\t\t\t\t\tsave-or-suck effects (yours or someone else&#8217;s), to protect your allies\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom save-or-suck effects, and potentially to grant Advantage on\n\t\t\t\t\thigh-damage attacks from you or your allies. Keep in mind you can take\n\t\t\t\t\treactions on your own turn and consider imposing Disadvantage on a\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget\u2019s save or check, such as the save against Fire Rune&#8217;s active\n\t\t\t\t\teffect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Giant&#8217;s Might<\/span>: Similar to casting\n\t\tEnlarge\/Reduce as a Bonus Action, though the damage bonus isn&#8217;t as good.\n\t\tBeing large makes it harder for enemies to get around you since you take up\n\t\tmore space, and Advantage on Strength checks makes it very easy to use\n\t\tAthletics to Shove and Grapple your enemies.\n\t\t<p>The bonus damage only applies once per turn on your own turn, which\n\t\t\tconsidering the Fighter&#8217;s famously high number of attacks feels totally\n\t\t\tout of place and unremarkable. Weirdly, the d6 grows to a d10 over time\n\t\t\tbut never becomes a significant part of your damage output since it&#8217;s\n\t\t\tstill just once on each of your own turns.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The precise wording in the feature is important. If you are not Large or larger, your size becomes Large. This is important because Enlarge\/Reduce cast upon the Rune Knight <em>after<\/em> using Giant\u2019s Might further increases the knight to Huge size, but not if Enlarge\/Reduce is cast beforehand.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Runic Shield<\/span>: This is a great way to\n\t\tnegate critical hits. You force the attacker to reroll the specific d20 used\n\t\tand use that result, so even if they have Advantage they still just roll one\n\t\td20 and use whatever comes up. The number of uses per day is plenty if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t try to negate every hit that comes toward your party; save it for\n\t\tcritical hits or for allies who have a passable chance of a reroll missing.\n\t\tIf an enemy is attacking your 12 AC wizard with a +10 attack bonus, don&#8217;t\n\t\twaste the effort.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Great Stature<\/span>: The 3d4 inches is amusing,\n\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re a small race, but it has absolutely no mechanical\n\t\teffect on the game. Height is a purely cosmetic portion of your character.\n\t\tUpgrading the damage die on Giant&#8217;s Might from 1d6 to 1d8 is such a minor\n\t\timprovement that if you forgot to make the adjustment you would probably\n\t\tnever notice. On average, that&#8217;s 1 point of damage per round. At level 10\n\t\twhen you and your enemies can easily have 200 hit points, 1 damage is not\n\t\tnoteworthy.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master of Runes<\/span>: Double how often you can\n\t\tuse all of your rune&#8217;s active effects. You also gain your fifth and final\n\t\trune at this level, so this is just a really fantastic level. With 10 active\n\t\teffects to use between short rests, you can afford to use two or more active\n\t\trune effects in each combat and you may find that you have runes to spare\n\t\twhen you make it to your next Short Rest.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Runic Juggernaut<\/span>: The extra damage is\n\t\tnot significant, especially at this level. But the ability to become Huge\n\t\tand get a little more reach can be helpful in some cases. Being Huge notably\nmeans that you can grapple gargantuan creatures, making you big enough to grapple any creature\nin the game.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"samurai\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/fighter#Samurai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samurai<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An offensively focused archetype, the Samurai is a Striker, focusing on damage output almost exclusively.

However, at just three uses per day you can&#8217;t expect\n\t\tto use this in every fight until you get Tireless Spirit at level 10.\n<p>If your table is using the optional flanking rules, this is less important for melee\nbuilds because it&#8217;s so much easier to get Advantage, but it remains excellent for fighting\nat range.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elegant Courtier<\/span>: Allowing you to use\n\t\tWisdom in addition to Charisma on Charisma (persuasion) checks means that\n\t\tyou can function as a face without having high Charisma. An additional\n\t\tsaving throw proficiency is even better, as most characters never get more\n\t\tthan two saving throw proficiencies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tireless Spirit<\/span>: Once you have this, you\n\t\tshould plan to begin every fight with Fighting Spirit. Come out swinging,\n\t\tand do a lot of damage up front.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapid Strike<\/span>: Advantage is nice because\n\t\tyou get to roll twice and keep the higher. Rapid Strike lets you keep\n\t\t<em>both<\/em>, so if you get lucky and both rolls are high you can hit\n\t\ttwice. You only get to do this once per turn, but this means that you can\n\t\tget four attacks in a single turn (5 once you hit 20th level, more if you\n\t\thave Haste, use Two-Weapon Fighting, activate Action Surge, etc.).\n\t\t<p>Fighting Spirit&#8217;s guarantee Advantage is an easy way to trigger Rapid\n\t\t\tStrike, but remember that Fighting Spirit only works three times per day.\n\t\t\tA more reliable tactic is to Shove your opponent prone before attacking\n\t\t\tthem, or if an ally can land Hold Person\/Monster then all attacks have advantage and all melee attacks are automatic critical hits.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Strength before Death<\/span>: An entire turn.\n\t\t<em>An entire turn.<\/em>. Drink a potion, use Second Wind. Anything to get\n\t\tyou some hit points and keep you conscious. Otherwise, take the Attack\n\t\taction and get revenge! If you\u2019re close to 0 on your own turn and have some way to give yourself enough falling damage to trigger this with just your movement you could in theory take a full turn with action surge and Fighting Spirit fueled Rapid Strike, fall to trigger Strength Before Death, and then do it all again, in the same round. And fun fact, if we do this during our own turn and we&#8217;ve already used Fighting Spirit then Fighting Spirit is still active (it says &#8220;interrupting the current turn&#8221;) because the turn that we used it on hasn&#8217;t ended yet. Even crazier, you could activate Action Surge again during this mid-turn bonus turn. If you can&#8217;t find a way to fall you can always use your last attack on yourself if you&#8217;re close enough to 0.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character
