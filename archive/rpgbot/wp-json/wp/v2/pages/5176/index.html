With a broad and diverse spell list, the Wizard can solve nearly any problem magically. In a party, your role is defined by the spells you employ. You can serve as a Blaster with area damage spells like fireball, a Defender by summoning creatures to stand between your party and your enemies, a Face by enchanting other creatures, a Scholar with your vast Intelligence and ample skills, a Scout with divination spells and stealth options like Invisibility, a Striker with single-target spells like Disintegrate and Power Word Kill, a Support caster with a wide range of buffs, debuffs, and area control spells, and a Utility caster with access to all manner of spells for solving the world&#8217;s mundane problems with magic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In truth, there is very little that the Wizard can&#8217;t do, and while it&#8217;s not\n\tthe uber-class that it was in previous editions, the Wizard is still a\n\tprofoundly capable and versatile class. However, with great versatility comes\n\tgreat complexity. Playing a wizard involves a lot of planning, tracking, and\n\tmanagement. You can keep the class simple by playing an Evoker and solving\n\tyour problems by blowing them up, but many wizards will have a large suite of\n\tspecialized tools and will need to choose from a long list of options to\n\temploy in any given situation. If you&#8217;re afraid of &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221;,\n\tconsider other class options like the Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Also see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/arcane-spell-list\/\">Arcane Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Arcane School<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-skill-feats\">General Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Wizard-feats\">Wizard Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Wizard-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Wizard-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells\">Wizard Focus Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#focus-spells-abjuration\">Abjuration<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-conjuration\">Conjuration<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-divination\">Divination<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-evocation\">Evocation<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-enchantment\">Enchantment<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-illusion\">Illusion<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-necromancy\">Necromancy<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-transmutation\">Transmutation<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-universalist\">Universalist<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Intelligence. Like any spellcaster it&#8217;s used for your Spell Attacks and for your Spell DCs. Those are two of your most important stats, so keep your Intelligence as high as you can get it. Intelligence also grants you additional Trained skills at 1st level, allowing you to easily invest in numerous skills, including Lore options which other classes often need to ignore in favor of more important skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: 6+Con hit points. Fortunately, you\n\thave plenty of room to boost your ability scores so your Constitution bonus\n\tcan compensate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Wizard&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are terrible. Your high Intelligence will give you an abundance\n\tof Trained skills, but that&#8217;s the height of the Wizard&#8217;s proficiencies in\n\tanything except spellcasting.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Trained at 1st level, and it\n\t\tmaxes out at Expert at 11th level. Expect to rely on allies for Perception\n\t\tchecks, and strongly consider Incredible Initiative if you don&#8217;t want to go\n\t\tlate in the turn order in every fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Only one good saving throw.\n\t\tWill is a great option, but only one good saving throw is still a serious\n\t\thandicap, and it never improves past Master. Your other saving throws will\n\t\talso increase to expert, but no further. You can take the Canny Acumen feat,\n\t\tbut that won&#8217;t get you past Expert until 17th level, so you&#8217;ll spend most of\n\t\tyour career with absolutely dismal saving throws compared to your\n\t\tallies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Arcana, plus 2+int Trained skills\n\t\tat 1st level, for a total of 3+. That&#8217;s standard, and with 18 Intelligence\n\t\tat 1st level you&#8217;ll have plenty of trained skills. You should get more than\n\t\tanyone except the Alchemist and the Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: 5 weapons plus unarmed strikes. A\n\t\tdagger is your best weapon option. Don&#8217;t expect to use any weapon except in\n\t\tthe most unusual circumstances.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: No armor proficiencies, and your\n\t\tproficiency in Unarmored Defense never increases past Expert. Expect to rely\n\t\ton spells like Mystic Armor, and be sure that you have nice sturdy friends to\n\t\thide behind. The Wizard&#8217;s saves are also terrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spells<\/strong>: Standard progression for full spellcasters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arcane Spellcasting<\/strong>: The Wizard uses the Arcane spell list,\n\tand they are prepared spellcasters so you need to prepare a spell in each of\n\tyour spell slots during your Daily Preparations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Heightened Spells<\/strong>: Heightening spells is an important\n\t\tmechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Important spells like Mage Armor scale with spell\n\t\tlevel, allowing them to stay relevant long after you learned them. Since\n\t\twizards don&#8217;t use a Spell Repertoire, you only need to learn a spell once,\n\t\tthen you can prepare it at any level that you can cast.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Fantastic every time, on any\n\t\tcharacter, in any amount. Wizards can prepare 5 cantrips, and they start\n\t\twith 10 in their spellbook so you have lots of room to customize your\n\t\tarsenal every day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellbook<\/span>: Your spellbook is your most\n\t\tvaluable possession. Guard it jealously; if you lose it, you&#8217;ll be unable to\n\t\tprepare spells. Also, expect to buy several over the course of your career.\n\t\tThey have a finite number of pages, and as you gain levels your spells will\n\t\ttake up increasing numbers of pages. If you add spells to your spellbook\n\t\tbeyond the free 2 spells that you gain at each level, you&#8217;ll exacerbate this\n\t\tproblem. Fortunately, after very low levels the cost of extra spell books\n\t\twill be negligible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arcane School<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Arcane School&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Bond<\/span>: Recast any one spell you\n\tprepared today. This is hugely useful, and it makes it easier to prepare a\n\tdiverse array of spells rather than preparing Fireball 8 times.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Arcane Thesis<\/span>: Arcane thesis adds an extra\n\tmechanic to your Wizard. While this option isn&#8217;t as defining as your Arcane\n\tSchool, it&#8217;s a helpful extra ability which will remain useful at every\n\tlevel.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Familiar Attunement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Familiars are really good, but their capabilities are limited by their\n\t\tnumber of abilities. Normally you only get two, so this triples the number\n\t\tof abilities which you can give your familiar. You can also take the Enhance\n\t\tFamiliar feat to add another 2.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Metamagical Experimentation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: More class feats is always great, but the level limitations on the second\n\t\tfeat means that you&#8217;ll probably end up learning a metamagic feat then\n\t\tretraining it once you can take it with Metamagical Experimentation. It also\n\t\tseems unlikely that you&#8217;ll change out your chosen metamagic feat frequently.\n\t\tChanging out metamagic feats to prepare for expected challenges doesn&#8217;t make\n\t\tas much sense as changing your spells for the day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Blending<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a gamble. Higher-level spells grow dramatically in power, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s hard to say if a small number of higher-level spell slots are better\n\t\tthan the regular spell slot arrangement. If you take this option, expect to\n\t\tburn a big spell or two right at the beginning of a fight in a way that will\n\t\tdefine the outcome of the fight, then expect to fall back on cantrips.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Substitution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you can&#8217;t decide what to choose for your Arcane Thesis, Spell\n\t\tSubstitution is a great option. Wizards are generally stuck with the options\n\t\tthat they picked at the beginning of a day, and you can rarely predict your\n\t\tneeds with perfect accuracy. This is great for when you encounter unexpected\n\t\tobstacles and don&#8217;t have time to spend 8 hours resting in order to\n\t\tre-prepare spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Staff Nexus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Before you go any further, go read the rules for Casting Spells from a\n\t\tStaff and Preparing a Staff. If you don&#8217;t know those rules, none of the\n\t\tadvice I&#8217;m about to give you will make any sense.\n\t\t<p>The Makeshift Staff starts off very weak, but grows in efficacy as you\n\t\t\tgain levels, and takes a massive jump when you upgrade it to a real magic\n\t\t\tstaff. At levels 1 and 2, basically all that it does is give you an extra\n\t\t\tcantrip per day since you still get to prepare your normal number of\n\t\t\tcantrips. You get one 1st-level spell in the staff, but you need to spend\n\t\t\ta 1st-level slot to get 1 charge so you&#8217;re effectively turning a 1st-level\n\t\t\tspell slot into a 1st-level slot, leaving you right where you started.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Normally when you Prepare a Staff you get some free charges, but the\n\t\t\tMakeshift Staff doesn&#8217;t get that benefit (until you turn it into a real\n\t\t\tstaff), so you need to expend a spell slot to get any use out of the\n\t\t\tleveled spell in your staff. As you gain access to higher-level spell\n\t\t\tslots, you can turn them into multiple slots for repeated castings of your\n\t\t\t1st-level spell, so it&#8217;s really important that the spell which you choose\n\t\t\tis a going to remain useful throughout your career without casting the\n\t\t\tspell at a higher spell level. Choose carefully.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>When you eventually turn your Makeshift Staff into a real staff, it&#8217;s a\n\t\t\thuge upgrade. Magic staffs are available as early as level 3, but most are\n\t\t\teither level 4 or 6 at their lowest-level version. Once you upgrade, you\n\t\t\tadd your cantrip and 1st-level spell to your upgrade staff, giving you a\n\t\t\ttotally unique item. You could have a Staff of Ice that can also be used\n\t\t\tto cast Produce Flame and Magic Missile (not great examples of a powerful\n\t\t\tcombo, but a good example of the mechanic). Keep in mind that you get no\n\t\t\tspecial benefits to perform this upgrade, so you&#8217;ll need to put some Skill\n\t\t\tIncreases into Crafting.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re going to take Staff Nexus, you need to be prepared to do two\n\t\t\tthings: first, you need to like how staffs work and want to use them;\n\t\t\tsecond, you need to craft magic items (mostly your staff, but your party\n\t\t\tis inevitably going to ask you to make other stuff). If you&#8217;re okay with\n\t\t\tthat, and if you don&#8217;t mind suffering through low levels with the\n\t\t\tMakeshift Staff, you&#8217;ll do just fine.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wizard Feats<\/strong>: See Wizard feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: More saves is always\n\tgreat, but this is as high as you ever get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Spellcaster<\/span>: Standard and essential\n\tfor spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Magical Fortitude<\/span>: More saves is always\n\tgreat, but this is as high as you ever get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alertness<\/span>: Perception is absolutely\n\tcrucial, but this is the best you will ever get without spending General\n\tFeats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wizard Weapon Expertise<\/span>: You should never\n\tneed this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Robes<\/span>: More AC is great, but this\n\tis the best you will ever get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: You should never need\n\tthis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Spellcaster<\/span>: Standard and essential\n\tfor spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resolve<\/span>: Fantastic, but it comes online\n\tvery late in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archwizard&#8217;s Spellcraft<\/span>: 10th-level spells\n\tare crazy.

However, because your extra spell slot is limited and you\n\tcan&#8217;t re-cast expended spells (unless you prepared duplicates), you can&#8217;t\n\tmatch the versatility of the Generalist.

Gnome Ancestry Feats can get you\n\tautomatically-scaling Lore skills, extra cantrips, a familiar, and a few other\n\texcellent options. Two of the Gnome&#8217;s Heritages give you additional cantrips,\n\tbut since they&#8217;re innate spells they&#8217;ll be Charisma-based, so look for utility\n\toptions rather than offensive ones, especially from other spellcasting\n\ttraditions which offer spells that the Wizard can&#8217;t normally select.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Goblin<\/span>: With your Free Ability Boost in\n\tIntelligence, the Goblin&#8217;s ability increases look similar to the Gnome&#8217;s. Burn\n\tIt! is a great option for blasters, and you could make good use of Very Sneaky\n\tand Very Very Sneaky, but those don&#8217;t specifically supplement your\n\tcapabilities as a wizard so I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re better than what you could\n\tget from Adopted Ancestry.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Workable ability boosts, and\n\tHalfling Luck is good on literally every character. Cultural Adaptability can\n\tget you Burn It! from the Goblin Ancestry Feats, too.

The primary function of this feat is to\n\t\t\tprotect you from failure when you attempt to Learn a Spell. If you roll a\n\t\t\tFailure, you must normally wait until you gain a level to try to learn\n\t\t\tthat spell again. At low levels the gold to learn a spell that you can\n\t\t\tcast isn&#8217;t significant compared to how much gold you&#8217;ll find as you gain\n\t\t\tlevels, and you&#8217;re going to gain levels fast enough that it&#8217;s mostly an\n\t\t\tinconvenience, so the consequences for failure are both minor and\n\t\t\tshort-term.\n\t\t\t<p>On top of that, it&#8217;s pretty easy to avoid a Critical Failure to Learn a\n\t\t\t\tSpell. A 1st-level wizard who is Trained in Arcana with 18 Intelligence\n\t\t\t\t(basically every wizard) has a +7 bonus to Arcana checks. The DC to\n\t\t\t\tlearn a 1st-level spell is 15, so you can only Criticaly Fail on a\n\t\t\t\tnatural 1.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Of course, the math changes a bit as you gain levels, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tputting Ability Boosts into Intelligence and Skill Increases into Arcana\n\t\t\t\tat every opportunity, the DC remains low enough that you can only roll a\n\t\t\t\tCritical Failure on a natural 1 for most spell levels for most of your\n\t\t\t\tcareer. If you&#8217;re worried, get an apprentice and have them Aid you for a\n\t\t\t\t+1 (every good wizard needs an apprentice or two), look for items that\n\t\t\t\tgrant you an item bonus to the skill (Cognitive Mutagen, Orange Aeon\n\t\t\t\tStone, Hat of the Magi, etc.), and see if you can bring in other stuff\n\t\t\t\tlike the Guidance spell. A few inexpensive bonuses can minimize a\n\t\t\t\tCritical Failure to rolling a Natural 1.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>The one arguement in favor of this feat is 20th level. If you reach\n\t\t\t\t20th level and still want to learn spells, rolling a Critical Failure\n\t\t\t\tmeans that you can never attempt to learn that spell again. That&#8217;s a\n\t\t\t\tterrible tragedy for a wizard fortunate enough to reach 20th level, but\n\t\t\t\tyou can still reduce that chance to 5% (a natural 1), and you get up to\n\t\t\t\t4 10th-level spells for free anyway. Plan to take your favorites with\n\t\t\t\tyour 4 guaranteed spells, attempt to learn anything else you want at\n\t\t\t\tlevel 19, then retry any critical failures at level 20. The odds of\n\t\t\t\trolling a critical failure for the same spell twice by this method are 1\n\t\t\t\tin 400.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Widen Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Essential for blasters.

You&#8217;ll also run into situations\n\t\twhere enemies have resistance or immunity to whatever type of damage they\n\t\tdeal (such as red dragons being immune to fire) so casting a spell to get\n\t\ttemporary resistance to that damage type may not affect your enemies. In\n\t\tother situations enemies may simply change the type of damage that they&#8217;re\n\t\tdealing (spellcasters, etc.). The best use case for this is enemies dealing\n\t\tdamage of one type multiple times in small amounts, but of a type which\n\t\tthey&#8217;re not resistant to.

Curiously, the rules for the Nonlethal trait don&#8217;t specify\n\t\thow it affects objects, so dropping a nonlethal fireball into a room may\n\t\tstill incinerate everything in it while leaving the occupants merely\n\t\tunconscious.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Wizard-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bespell Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Wizards are terrible at using weapons.

So there&#8217;s a lot of overlap, and\n\t\tthe spells are functionally identical if you use the 1-action option. But\n\t\tthat&#8217;s probably not the right comparison to make. Instead, compare Force\n\t\tBolt to a cantrip.

You can have at most 3\n\t\tFocus Points, which means potentially three extra cantrips worth of damage\n\t\tearly in a fight when a little extra damage can be the most impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Tempest<\/span>: This is a big pile of\n\t\tdamage, but the 10-foot range is a serious problem for a wizard.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Charming Words<\/span>: A great option if you&#8217;re\n\t\tstuck in melee and need to safely escape, but since it doesn&#8217;t prevent hostile\n\tactions against your allies it won&#8217;t always be useful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dread Aura<\/span>: Decent radius and no\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Warped Terrain<\/span>: This is great for choke\n\t\tpoints like hallways, but just putting the effect between you and an enemy\n\t\tmight keep them just outside of melee reach, so even casting this with a\n\t\tsingle Action may be enough to achieve the desired effect.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Invisibility Cloak<\/span>: Invisibility is a\n\t\tgreat option for a Focus Spell because it&#8217;s useful in nearly every adventure,\n\t\tand being able to cast it without a spell slot makes it easier to justify\n\t\tcasting. The gradually improving duration is nice, too. Eventually you can\n\t\tcast this, then remain invisibile while you Refocus to regain your Focus\n\t\tPoints.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Call of the Grave<\/span>: Sickened 1 is a fine debuff, but you&#8217;ll quickly find that your leveled spells will be more impactful unless you can guarantee a Critical Success.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Life Siphon<\/span>: Healing never hurts, and\n\t\tWizards have terrible few options to restore their own hit points.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Physical Boost<\/span>: Cast as one action with no\n\t\tsomatic components, but its still a range of touch. I think that&#8217;s an error.\n\t\tEven so, this spell is garbage. The bonus is too small to justify rushing\n\t\tnearly into melee just to tap your ally on the shoulder to give them a +2\n\t\tbonus on a single check, and if you&#8217;re out of combat I don&#8217;t know why you\n\t\twould waste a Focus Point on any of the affected checks. You could use it on\n\t\tyourself, but that doesn&#8217;t help the situation much.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Shifting Form<\/span>: The speed options and sense\n\t\toptions are excellent. Even with the limited duration, you can spare a\n\t\tsingle Action in combat to get yourself Scent when there are invisible\n\t\tcreatures around.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-universalist\">Universalist<\/h3>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hand of the Apprentice<\/span>: This spell has some\n\t\tserious design problems. First: the damage is garbage, and it falls behind\n\t\tcantrips almost immediately. Cantrips will deal 1d4+Mod at first level,\n\t\twhich will match Hand of the Apprentice with any weapon the wizard is\n\t\tTrained with (short of feats, etc.). At 3rd level, 2d4+Mod will match\n\t\tone-handed martial weapons. At 5th level, 3d4+mod will match two-handed\n\t\tweapons.\n\t\t<p>Second: There&#8217;s no restriction on the weapon, so as-written you could use\n\t\t\tany weapon you&#8217;re capable of holding. Find a greataxe, lug it around, and\n\t\t\tmagically hurl it at people. As a GM, I would limit this to\n\t\t\tappropriately-sized weapons in which the caster is at least Trained to\n\t\t\tavoid abuse, but then the spell immediately stops being useful except\n\t\t\tpossibly for multiclassed fighters.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The only way to make this viable long-term is to use a big weapon and to put\n\t\t\tStriking runes on it. Even then, you&#8217;re spending a lot of gold for\n\t\t\tsomething you might do once or twice in each fight, and unless you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tspending a ton of gold and using a big weapon, the damage will still\n\t\t\tquickly fall behind your cantrips.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Alchemist<\/span>: Advanced Alchemy has a lot to\n\t\toffer. Alchemical Bombs are a tempting offensive option, but\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not proficient.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Barbarian<\/span>: I don&#8217;t know why you would want\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bard<\/span>: Charisma-based spellcasting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Champion<\/span>: The armor proficiency is\n\t\ttempting, but you never advance past Trained, so your unarmor\/light\n\t\tproficiencies will provide just as much AC and won&#8217;t impose a massive Check\n\t\tPenalty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cleric<\/span>: Your Wisdom won&#8217;t match your\n\t\tIntelligence, but it should be good enough to make Cleric spellcasting work.\n\t\tYou can also reserve your Cleric spells for non-offensive spells and use\n\t\tyour Wizard spells more offensively so that your comparatively low Wisdom\n\t\tisn&#8217;t an issue. If you take Domain Initiate (and possibly Advanced Domain),\n\t\tyour domain spells provide and additional option to use your Focus Points if\n\t\tyour school&#8217;s Focus Spells aren&#8217;t always useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Druid<\/span>: Very similar benefits to the\n\t\tCleric, and your can take Order Spell to get a Druid Focus Spell. You also\n\t\tget great Druid feat options like Animal Companion, which can provide a\n\t\tconvenient mount or something horrifying to throw a bunch of buff spells\n\t\tonto.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fighter<\/span>: Being Trained in martial weapons\n\t\twon&#8217;t suddenly make them a good idea. You can get them up to Expert if you\n\t\ttake Diverse Weapon Expert, but that&#8217;s two feats to still be comparably\n\t\tterrible at using weapons. Your Cantrips will <em>always<\/em> be a better\n\t\tidea.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk<\/span>: The best option I can think of is to\n\t\tlearn to throw Shurikens with the leftover Action after casting a 2-Action\n\t\tspell, but that&#8217;s a really terrible idea.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger<\/span>: I guess you could do something\n\t\tuseful with Snares, but I don&#8217;t see anything that you couldn&#8217;t do better\n\t\twith spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rogue<\/span>: If you really like to use Demoralize\n\t\twith your third Action after casting 2-Action spells, You&#8217;re Next is a\n\t\ttempting feat option, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth two class feats to make\n\t\tthat happen.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Charisma-based spellcasting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Wizard has been my favorite class since 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons.
