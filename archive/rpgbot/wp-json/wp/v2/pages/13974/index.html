With conflicting features and limited resources, Monks occasionally feel like they fall behind when judged on damage. The Kensei is susceptible to falling into the same traps as other Monks, but at least has a few ways to do some respectable damage numbers. If you want to be a martial arts weapons master, we\u2019ll make sure you put your best foot forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kensei is a little analogous to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/hunter\/\">Hunter Ranger<\/a>: it has a few different abilities for melee vs ranged weapons, and like the Hunter, the ranged option is better. They have Agile Parry for melee, which gives a little extra AC, vs Kensei\u2019s shot, where you do a little extra damage but also don\u2019t get hit by not walking into melee. This is one of the strengths of the Kensei when compared to other Monks: having an actual ranged option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, the example build down below shows what Kensei can bring to what would otherwise be every other Sharpshooter Crossbow Expert build. In particular, when Sharpen the Edge comes online, the ability to add +3 to attacks and damage ends up negating the penalties of Sharpshooter. With Unarmored Movement, this build is able to simply outrun many foes while turning the targets into pincushions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Way of the Kensei Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#way-of-the-kensei-ability-scores\">Way of the Kensei Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#way-of-the-kensei-races\">Way of the Kensei Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#way-of-the-kensei-feats\">Way of the Kensei Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#way-of-the-kensei-weapons\">Way of the Kensei Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#way-of-the-kensei-armor\">Way of the Kensei Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#way-of-the-kensei-multiclassing\">Way of the Kensei Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-way-of-the-kensei-build-why-dont-you-just-shoot-it\">Example Way of the Kensei Build &#8211; Why don&#8217;t you just shoot it?<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#but-i-dont-want-to-multiclass\">But I don&#8217;t want to Multiclass?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-if-we-just-played-champion-fighter-for-20-levels\">What if we just played Champion Fighter for 20 levels?<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

With only simple weapons and short swords,\n\t\t\t\tthe monk&#8217;s best weapon is a spear. Opening up most martial weapons means\n\t\t\t\taccess to weapon properties that are normally out of the Monk&#8217;s reach.\n\t\t\t\tI&#8217;ll address some interesting possibilities, but I won&#8217;t list every\n\t\t\t\tmartial weapon because that would take a ton of space without offering\n\t\t\t\tanything useful, but I&#8217;ll cover good options and options which look good\n\t\t\t\tbut aren&#8217;t. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of actually good\n\t\t\t\toptions, so expect every Kensei to end up using the same set of weapons.\n\t\t\t\t<p>It&#8217;s easy to look at this feature alongside the Dedicated Weapon Optional\n\t\t\t\t\tClass Feature and feel like it&#8217;s not very useful. In truth, if you can\n\t\t\t\t\tget proficiencies elsewhere (you race, most likely), Dedicated Weapon makes Kensei Weapons\n\t\t\t\t\tmostly redundant. The only advantages of Kensei Weapons are that you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\tnot limited to one weapon chosen at the end of a long rest so you can\n\t\t\t\t\tchange weapons to fit your situation (not that that happens much)\nand that you gain proficiency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Agile Parry<\/span>: The precise wording of\n\t\t\t\tthis ability is critical. You need to make an unarmed strike\n\t\t\t\t<em>as part of the Attack action<\/em>. So the Bonus Action attack(s)\n\t\t\t\tfrom Martial Arts or Flurry of Blows doesn&#8217;t count. Until you get Extra\n\t\t\t\tAttack you&#8217;ll want to forgo your weapon in favor of the AC bonus, and\n\t\t\t\tonce you get Extra Attack you&#8217;ll typically make just one attack with\n\t\t\t\tyour weapon.\n\t\t\t\t<p>While that&#8217;s an annoying reduction to your damage output for the\n\t\t\t\t\tturn, a +2 bonus to AC is excellent for a class notorious for having\n\t\t\t\t\tpoor durability. Unfortunately, that means that a smart Kensei will\n\t\t\t\t\tfrequently make at most one attack per turn with their weapon. At low\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels you need the AC, and at high levels the additional damage from\n\t\t\t\t\tyour weapon won&#8217;t be a big enough difference to justify struggling to\n\t\t\t\t\tuse your weapon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The Ki-Fueled Attack Optional Class Feature can address this issue to\n\t\t\t\t\tsome degree. If you spend Ki to use Deft Strike or the Focused Aim\n\t\t\t\t\tOptional Class Feature, that triggers Ki-Fueled Attack, allowing you\n\t\t\t\t\tto use your weapon to attack as a Bonus Action.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Kensei&#8217;s Shot<\/span>: Not a ton of damage,\n\t\t\t\tbut it makes ranged attacks competitive with your melee attacks and\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t cost Ki. Normally monks fighting at range totally sacrifice the\n\t\t\t\tpotential damage from their Bonus Actions, so it&#8217;s nice to have an easy\n\t\t\t\tway to turn that action into something useful. Since it&#8217;s extra damage,\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s multiplied on a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Way of the Brush<\/span>: One proficiency in a\n\t\t\t\ttool which will probably never get used.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-none\">One with the Blade<\/span>: Two mostly independent\n\t\tbenefits.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Kensei Weapons<\/span>: Normally the\n\t\t\t\tMonk needs to rely solely on their unarmed strikes to overcome damage\n\t\t\t\tresistance to non-magical attacks unless you can guarantee access to\n\t\t\t\tmagic weapons. This allows you to continue using your favorite weapons\n\t\t\t\twithout issue, even if they&#8217;re not magic.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Strike<\/span>: It&#8217;s rare that this will\n\t\t\t\tdo more damage than spending that Ki point to perform a Flurry of Blows,\n\t\t\t\tbut if you&#8217;re having a lot of trouble hitting you might need damage\n\t\t\t\twherever you can get it. The wording also says &#8220;extra damage&#8221;, which\n\t\t\t\tmeans that the damage is part of the attacks normal damage and is\n\t\t\t\ttherefore multiplied on a critical hit the same way Eldritch Smite and\n\t\t\t\tDivine Smite are, and much like those features you can decide to use it\n\t\t\t\tafter rolling your attack so it&#8217;s an easy damage boost if you roll a\n\t\t\t\tnatural 20.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Sharpen the Blade<\/span>: Extremely tempting,\n\t\tbut that&#8217;s a lot of Ki to spend on one attack per turn\n\t\t(Possibly 2 with Ki-Fueled Attack. Remember that you need to make one unarmed attack to trigger Agile Parry).\n\t\tThe additional attacks from Flurry of Blows will likely be\n\t\ta more useful way to spend Ki.\n\t\t<p>Your best use case for this is when fighting at range where Agile Parry\n\t\t\tis less crucial. Grab a longbow, put 3 Ki points into it, and start\n\t\t\tshooting. Consider using Deft Strike and\/or the Focused Aim Optional Class\n\t\t\tFeature so that you can trigger Ki-Fueled Attack and attack as a Bonus\n\t\t\tAction, but you&#8217;ll want to make that decision early since you want to use\n\t\t\tKensei&#8217;s Shot before you start attacking if you&#8217;re going to use it at\n\t\t\tall.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Unerring Accuracy<\/span>: You&#8217;re only going to\n\t\tbe making one attack with a weapon each turn unless you use the Ki-Fuelled\n\t\tAttack Optional Class Feature, so you might as well make it reliable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"way-of-the-kensei-ability-scores\">Way of the Kensei Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Way of the Kensei has a typical Monk ability spread.
