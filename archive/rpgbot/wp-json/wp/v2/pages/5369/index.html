Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character.

The\n\tspells are a great selection, and provide some excellent options.\n\tUnfortunately, because you only get a few polymorph spells, its hard to\n\tjustify devoting your character to polymorphing with this archetype.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">jump<\/span>: Very situational. Not on the Witch\n\t\tspell list.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">cat&#8217;s grace<\/span>: A useful buff, but many\n\t\tcharacters who need dexterity will invest in items which provide it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">haste<\/span>: One of the best buffs in the game.\n\t\tNot on the Cleric spell list.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">freedom of movement<\/span>: Excellent buff, but\n\t\tsituational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">polymorph<\/span>: Extremely versatile, but don&#8217;t\n\t\tplan to use it on yourself often unless you built for polymorph.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">cat&#8217;s grace (mass)<\/span>: You will rarely need\n\t\tto enhance the dexterity of more than one or two characters in the\n\t\tparty.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">ethereal jaunt<\/span>: Great for a variety of\n\t\tpurposes, including infiltration, spying, escaping, or killing etheral\n\t\tcreatures.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">animal shapes<\/span>: Very slightly better than\n\t\tPolymorph.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">shapechange<\/span>: The best polymorph spell in\n\t\tthe game.

If you have a Bard\n\tor Cleric in the party, skip this option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">bless<\/span>: A solid low-level buff.

If you like animals\n\tso much, play a Druid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">charm animals<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">speak with animals<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">dominate animal<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">summon nature&#8217;s ally IV<\/span>: Witches can\n\t\tlearn Summon Monster, which is almost always better.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">animal growth<\/span>: What are you going to use\n\t\tthis on? Your familiar?<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">antilife shell<\/span>: Great area control.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">beast shape IV<\/span>: One of the best Polymorph\n\t\tspells in the game, but you only get two polymorph spells, so you&#8217;re almost\n\t\tdefinitely not built for it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">animal shapes<\/span>: Worse for you than Beast\n\t\tShape IV, and it&#8217;s unlikely that your allies will need to be turned into a\n\t\tdinosaur.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"\">summon nature&#8217;s ally IX<\/span>: Witches can learn Summon\n\t\tMonster, which is almost always better.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"death\" class=\"rating-green\">Death<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the low level spells are situational, the high elvel spells are\n\texcellent save or die spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">deathwatch<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">blessing of courage and life<\/span>: A weird\n\t\tcombination of Remove Feat and Cure Light Wounds.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">speak with dead<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\tpowerful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">rest eternal<\/span>: Situational unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tin a campaign with necromancer enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">suffocation<\/span>: Excellent save or die spell.\n\t\tThe 3 round duration may seem like a handicap, but it means the target must\n\t\tsave three times to avoid being dropped to 0 hitpoints and unconcious.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">circle of death<\/span>: Expensive, but it&#8217;s hard\n\t\tto say no to an AOE save or die spell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">finger of death<\/span>: A huge pile of damage.\n\t\tTypically this should be enough to kill enemies of your CR, especially at\n\t\thigh level when enemies are less dependent on hit dice to survive.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">symbol of death<\/span>: Symbol spells are very\n\t\texpensive and hard to justify without Permanency, which isn&#8217;t a Witch\n\t\tspell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">power word kill<\/span>: The ultimate save or die\n\t\tspell.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"deception\" class=\"rating-orange\">Deception<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Deception domain has some very good spells, but most are very\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">ventriloquism<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">invisibility<\/span>: Fantastic buff for you or\n\t\tyour party&#8217;s Scout.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">blink<\/span>: Great defensive buff, but poor\n\t\tduration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">confusion<\/span>: Very difficult to use, and\n\t\tthe effects are not guranteed to be useful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">passwall<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\tuseful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">programmed image<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\tcool.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">invisibility (mass)<\/span>: Fantastic buff for\n\t\tyour whole party.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">scintillating pattern<\/span>: No save, but the\n\t\tlimited number of hit dice affected really handicaps this spell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">time stop<\/span>: One of the best spells in the\n\t\tgame.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"elements\" class=\"rating-blue\">Elements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blaster Witch&#8217;s go-to option. With the exception of Wall of Ice, every\n\tspell in the list is a damage spell, and the list includes many of the best\n\tBlaster spells around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">shocking grasp<\/span>: Excellent damage for such\n\t\ta low level spell, and you can cast it and let your familiar carry it around\n\t\tuntil its time to taze something.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">flaming sphere<\/span>: Good, not great, but it&#8217;s\n\t\ta good way to stretch one spell slot over several rounds of damage\n\t\toutput.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">fireball<\/span>: If you have one third-level\n\t\tspell, prepare Fireball. If you have two third-level spells, prepare\n\t\tFireball twice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">wall of ice<\/span>: Excellent area control, and\n\t\tyou can use it as a save-or-suck by encasing a target inside the hemisphere\n\t\toption.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">flame strike<\/span>: Like Fireball, but with a\n\t\thigher damage cap and half of the damage can&#8217;t be resisted.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">freezing sphere<\/span>: Like a bigger, colder\n\t\tfireball. It has the same damage cap as Flame Strike, but it also freezes\n\t\twater.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">vortex*<\/span>: Situational. How often do you\n\t\tfight on a body of water big enough to use this?<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">fire storm<\/span>: Fire damage in a huge area\n\t\twhich you have a lot of control over, and if they fail a reflex save they\n\t\ttake 4d6 damage each round until they die or pass a fairly difficult reflex\n\t\tsave to put themselves out.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">meteor swarm<\/span>: It totals 24d6 damage, which\n\t\tis nice, but allowing 4 saves makes it more likely that the target will pass\n\t\tone or more saves. The best option is to target one creature with touch\n\t\tattacks for the bonus 8d6 bludgeoning damage and the penalty on the saving\n\t\tthrows.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"enchantment\" class=\"rating-green\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enchantment school is one of the most powerful schools of magic, and\n\tincludes some very powerful save or suck spells. The first few spells aren&#8217;t\n\tgreat, but you get several fantastic high level options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">unnatural lust<\/span>: Like a hillarious version\n\t\tof Command. You get it a level early, which is good because this would be a\n\t\thorrible 2nd level spell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">calm emotions<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">unadulterated loathing<\/span>: Very\n\t\tsituational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">overwhelming grief<\/span>: The target gets almost\n\t\tall of the penalties of being Stunned. Hold Person might be better for\n\t\thumanoids, but this will work on monsters until you can cast Hold\n\t\tMonster.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">dominate person<\/span>: Perhaps the most iconic\n\t\tEnchantment spell around, and for good reason.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">geas<\/span>: Situational, but insanely\n\t\tpowerful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">euphoric tranquility<\/span>: Like a high level\n\t\tversion of Charm Monster. You get it a level early.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">demand<\/span>: Send this to your enemies&#8217;\n\t\tunintelligent minions, and tell them to steal the macguffin and bring it to\n\t\tyou.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">dominate monster<\/span>: Save or Suck, and you\n\t\tget a really powerful pet for a little while.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"endurance\" class=\"rating-orange\">Endurance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Endurance patron provides a collection of defensive buffs, Greater\n\tRestoration for some reason, and finished with Miracle. Altogether it&#8217;s a\n\tpassable support patron, but it doesn&#8217;t have anything especially exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">endure elements<\/span>: Very situational, and\n\t\talmost everyone has it on their spell list.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">bear&#8217;s endurance<\/span>: Ability enhancement\n\t\tspells are always nice, but this one is hard to use because of the small\n\t\trisk of dropping dead when the duration ends.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">protection from energy<\/span>: Always handy.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">spell immunity<\/span>: It is very hard to\n\t\tpredict what spells to pick.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">spell resistance<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to\n\t\tfight other spellcasters, there is no reason not to cast this. Unless they\n\t\thave Spell Penetration, this makes you 60% immune to the spells of\n\t\tspellcasters of your level.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">bear&#8217;s endurance (mass)<\/span>: Same issues as\n\t\tBear&#8217;s Endurance, en masse.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">restoration (greater)<\/span>: You rarely need\n\t\tthis spell, and it is very expensive to cast.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">iron body<\/span>: Interesting buff, but the\n\t\teffects which it protects you from are usually biger problems for your\n\t\tfront-line party members.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">miracle<\/span>: Basically Wish for divine\n\t\tcasters. The best spell that Witches can get.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"healing\" class=\"rating-orange\">Healing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the name, the Healing patron provides surprisingly little actual\n\thealing. If you have access to hit points from a wand or something, this\n\tpatron allows you restore other status conditions which hit points alone won&#8217;t\n\tfix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">remove fear<\/span>: Situational. Fear effects tend\n\t\tto be fairly gentle, so very few people bother to cast this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">lesser restoration<\/span>: Excellent way to\n\t\tremove ability damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">remove disease<\/span>: Situational, but nice to\n\t\thave when you eventually need it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">restoration<\/span>: You can generally get away\n\t\twith lesser restoration, but sometimes you need a little more power.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">cleanse<\/span>: Like a combination of Cure\n\t\tCritical Wounds and a bunch of status effect removal.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">pillar of life<\/span>: A combincatin of healing\n\t\tand area control against undead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">greater restoration<\/span>: You very rarely\n\t\tneed this, which is good because the cost is so high.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">mass cure critical wounds<\/span>: Not worth such a\n\t\thigh level spell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">true resurrection<\/span>: Sometimes people die at\n\t\thigh levels, and it&#8217;s good to be able to handle it.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"insanity\" class=\"rating-orange\">Insanity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Insanity domain contains a lot of bad options, and only a few truly good\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">memory lapse<\/span>: Very situational, and if you\n\t\tfail you might make things worse.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">hideous laughter<\/span>: Save or suck that will\n\t\ttake one target out of a fight for several rounds.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">distracting cacophony<\/span>: This is very rarely\n\t\ta better option than just killing the other spellcaster.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">confusion<\/span>: Very difficult to use, and\n\t\tthe effects are not guranteed to be useful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">mind fog<\/span>: Interesting area control\n\t\teffect, and great for laying an ambush. I really wish that this spell could\n\t\tbe made permanent.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">envious urge<\/span>: Great way to disable groups\n\t\tof enemies. Even if some of them pass their save, they still need to deal\n\t\twith their allies attempting to disarm or rob them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">insanity<\/span>: Permanent Confusion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">symbol of insanity<\/span>: Symbol spells are very\n\t\texpensive and hard to justify without Permanency, which isn&#8217;t a Witch\n\t\tspell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">overwhelming presence<\/span>: Excellent crowd\n\t\tcontrol, but there are several 9th level spells with the same DC that will\n\t\toutright kill things.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"light\" class=\"\">Light<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Light patron is difficult to assess purely due to the inclusion of\n\tSunbeam and Sunburst. The other options are generally good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">dancing lantern<\/span>: Just cast light on\n\t\tsomething that you&#8217;re wearing or carrying.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">continual flame<\/span>: You will probably only\n\t\tcast this once or twice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">daylight<\/span>: Nice to have, but\n\t\tsituational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">rainbow pattern<\/span>: Good crowd control, but\n\t\tit requires concentration so you will need your party to handle anything\n\t\tthat isn&#8217;t affected.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">fire snake<\/span>: Like a very precise\n\t\tfireball.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">sirocco<\/span>: Nice area control effect. A\n\t\tlittle bit of damage, knock things prone, and make them fatigued.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"\">sunbeam<\/span>: This spell is poorly written. How long does\n\t\tthe blindness last? Does the blindness end when you run out of rays? Or does\n\t\tit continue until the rounds\/level duration expires? It affects &#8220;fungi,\n\t\tmold, oozes, and slimes&#8221; as though they were undead, but of those four only\n\t\tOoze is a defined creature type. The wording regarding undead also makes it\n\t\tunclear if they are blinded in addition to the extra damage. The Pathfinder\n\t\tRules Questions forum has\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/search?q=sunbeam&amp;forum=v5748dmtz1gek\"\n\t\t\t>several threads about the spell<\/a\n\t\t>, all expressing similar concerns. I would interpret the spell as follows:\n\t\tNormal creatures take listed damage (4d6) and are permanently blinded.\n\t\tUndead take the bigger damage instead of the regular damage, and are blinded\n\t\tas normal. Oozes, and plant creatures which could be defined as &#8220;fungi,\n\t\tmold, or slime&#8221; (such as shambling mounds or mushroom creatures) are\n\t\taffected like undead. Consult your GM to be sure.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-none\">sunburst<\/span>: Though it suffers many of the\n\t\trules interpetation issues of sunbeam, sunburst is slightly easier to\n\t\tinterpret. Because the duration is instantaneous, the blindness effect is\n\t\tpermanent. The damage dealt to undead is still unclear (do they take damage\n\t\ttwice?), and the additional list of things affected like undead is still\n\t\tconfusing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">fiery body<\/span>: Excellent buff, but not quite\n\t\tas good for the Witch as it would be for a more combat-oriented class like a\n\t\tCleric.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"moon\" class=\"rating-orange\">Moon<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a very strong start, the Moon patron is mostly a collection weird\n\tsituational spells chosen solely because they are vaguely moon-related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">darkness<\/span>: You get this a level earlier\n\t\tthan anyone else, but won&#8217;t be able to use it much until your get\n\t\tDarkvision.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">darkvision<\/span>: With an hours per level\n\t\tduration, you can eventually afford to throw this on all of your allies so\n\t\tthat you can all fight within the area of Darkness.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">owl&#8217;s wisdom<\/span>: This is barely useful, and\n\t\tyou get it a level late.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">moonstruck<\/span>: Turn a weak-willed enemy into\n\t\ta scary, confused almost-werewolf.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">aspect of the wolf<\/span>: You are almost\n\t\tcertainly not built to take advantage of this, and a Witch is not a\n\t\ttripper.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">control water<\/span>: Get it? Because the moon\n\t\taffects the tides? Right? Pretty clever. Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">lunar veil<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">horrid wilting<\/span>: Decent single-target\n\t\tdamage, but at this level you can use save or die spells with the save\n\t\tDC.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">meteor swarm<\/span>: It totals 24d6 damage, which\n\t\tis nice, but allowing 4 saves makes it more likely that the target will pass\n\t\tone or more saves. The best option is to target one creature with touch\n\t\tattacks for the bonus 8d6 bludgeoning damage and the penalty on the saving\n\t\tthrows.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"occult\" class=\"rating-green\">Occult<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Occult patron is a really cool collection of spells. It involves things\n\tthat are creepy, weird, and generally&#8230; well, generally occult. Many of the\n\tspells are very good, especially at higher levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">detect undead<\/span>: Situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">command undead<\/span>: Great for acquiring new\n\t\tundead minions. Because the duration is days per level, you can stagger\n\t\tdaily castings to control huge numbers of undead. Also note that there is no\n\t\tsave for mindless undead and no hit die limit, so you can use this to\n\t\tcontrol the skeleton of an ancient wyrm at level 4. Your GM would be a fool\n\t\tto allow it, but it&#8217;s technically possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"\">twilight knife<\/span>: This spell is really cool, scales\n\t\twell with level, and does force damage. However, the spell description\n\t\tleaves out some very crucial information. How does the knife pick a target?\n\t\tHow fast can it move? Does it threaten? Can it provide a flanking bonus to\n\t\tallies even if it doesn&#8217;t threaten? You also need to attack a target to keep\n\t\tthe knife attacking, but it&#8217;s not clear if the knife attacks the same target\n\t\tthat you did and at what point during your turn it attacks.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">black tentacles<\/span>: One of the best area\n\t\tcontrol spells in the game.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">snake staff<\/span>: Conceptually cool, but it;s\n\t\tonly really useful if you carry around wagons full of garbage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">create undead<\/span>: Create some scary undead.\n\t\tThe spell is more expensive than Animate Dead, but the difference between a\n\t\tghoul and a zombie is pretty huge.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">waves of exhaustion<\/span>: Exhausted is very\n\t\tgentle as far as status conditions go. -6 Strength and Dexterity sounds\n\t\tscary, but anything that needs strength and dexterity will still have enough\n\t\tto ruin your day.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">trap the soul<\/span>: Despite being insanely\n\t\texpensive to cast on anything of reasonably high level, this allows a\n\t\tpermanent save-or-suck effect with no save if you&#8217;re clever. Once your\n\t\ttarget is inside the gem, they never die, so they can never be resurrected.\n\t\tThough the spell doesn&#8217;t state it, you likely need crazy magic like Wish or\n\t\tMiracle to get someone out of the gem if you don&#8217;t have the gem in hand.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">gate<\/span>: The ultimate summoning spell.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"plague\" class=\"rating-green\">Plague<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Rot&#8221; might be a more appropriate name for this patron since only two spells\n\t(Contagion and Giant Vermin) could be considered plagues. This patron centers\n\tmostly on the creation and control of undead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">detect undead<\/span>: Situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"4\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">command undead<\/span>: Great for acquiring new\n\t\tundead minions. Because the duration is days per level, you can stagger\n\t\tdaily castings to control huge numbers of undead. Also note that there is no\n\t\tsave for mindless undead and no hit die limit, so you can use this to\n\t\tcontrol the skeleton of an ancient wyrm at level 4. Your GM would be a fool\n\t\tto allow it, but it&#8217;s technically possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">contagion<\/span>: Blinding sickness is a great\n\t\tcombination of strength damage and permanent blindness. Because it&#8217;s a touch\n\t\tattack you can cast it well ahead of time and have your familiar deliver the\n\t\ttouch attack.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">animate dead<\/span>: Time to build an army. If\n\t\tyou create more undead than Animate Dead allows you to control, you can use\n\t\tCommand Undead to control the ones that fall out of control.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">giant vermin<\/span>: With minutes per level\n\t\tduration, this is a bit like a longer version of Summon Monster.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"12\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">create undead<\/span>: Create some scary undead.\n\t\tThe spell is more expensive than Animate Dead, but the difference between a\n\t\tghoul and a zombie is pretty huge.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">control undead<\/span>: Unintelligent undead still\n\t\tget a save, and the duration is shorter than Command Undead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"16\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">create greater undead<\/span>: Create some very\n\t\tscary undead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">energy drain<\/span>: Begative levels can really\n\t\tmess up your enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n<!-- ?wp:html -->\n\n<p\n\t>The Portents patron provides a list of useful Divination spells, combining\n\tsome good buffs with information-gathering spells.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t>The Shadow domain is largely defined by the Shadow Conjuration\/Evocation\n\tspells.
