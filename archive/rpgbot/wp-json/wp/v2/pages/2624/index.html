They have a ton of hit points, resistance to weapon damage types while raging, and Rage gives a nice bonus to damage. Barbarians don&#8217;t get much in the way of skills unless you add Optional Class Features, so generally they&#8217;re stuck as combat monsters, but they function equally well as a Defender and a Striker, and certain character options can even expand them into a limited Support role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because their tactics are frequently very simple (rage, smash the nearest enemy, repeat), some players find the Barbarian unappealing compared to classes that have more diverse and complex options. But don&#8217;t let the simplicity deter you: charging into melee, turning Reckless Attack, and shrugging off paltry amounts of damage while you carve through your enemies is a ton of fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Barbarians don&#8217;t deal consistently huge amounts of damage without serious optimization, but they do enough to be a threat, and their high Strength and easy access to Advantage on Strength checks means that the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"9129\">grapple\/shove combo<\/a> is always available to you, and leaning on that capability offers a great option that other charactes can&#8217;t easily match without spending precious resources like feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, you might enjoy our other supporting content:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/\">Barbarian Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11724\">Barbarian Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/barbarian-levels-1-4-the-frat-bro-of-the-dnd-world-rpgbot-podcast-s4e76\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28014\">BARBARIAN Levels 1 \u2013 4: The Frat Bro\u2019 of the DnD World \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E76<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/barbarians-levels-5-20-woohoo-smash-smash-smashy-smash-rpgbot-podcast-s4e77\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28129\">BARBARIANS Levels 5 \u2013 20: Woohoo!

The bonus damage isn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s reliable and consistent. The\n\tresistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage\n\tmultiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but your\n\tnumber of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid\n\tit.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unarmored Defense<\/span>: This is great flavor\n\tfor the Barbarian, but won&#8217;t do much good for you unless your ability scores are\n\tvery high. Your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers need to total +7 to match\n\tthe total AC bonus provided by half plate armor. That&#8217;s generally achievable\n\tby level 8 unless you rolled for ability scores, and assuming that you started\n\twith 14 Dexterity and largely ignored Strength. More realistically, you should\n\texpect to hit 20 Constitution by 12th level, and even then Unarmored Defense\n\twill only break even with Half plate. If magic armor is an option you&#8217;ll need\n\tto put an ability increase into Dexterity before you have a good reason to\n\tdrop your armor.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reckless Attack<\/span>: Rage makes you resistant to\n\tdamage from weapon damage types (other damage types still\n\twork fine), so Advantage on attacks against you doesn&#8217;t matter as much. Go\n\tcrazy. Kill all of the things. Reckless Attack also makes using\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/oversized-weapons\/\"\n\t\t>oversized weapons<\/a\n\t>\n\tviable under some circumstances.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Danger Sense<\/span>: In medium armor your dexterity\n\tprobably isn&#8217;t fantastic, but advantage on any save is fantastic.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Primal Path<\/strong>: Barbarian subclasses are briefly summarized\n\tbelow.

Advantage on initiative will allow you to go first\n\tfrequently, so be sure to get into position to keep enemies from reaching your\n\tsquishy allies.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brutal Critical<\/span>: This feature has several\n\tproblems. The intent is to make critical hits the Barbarian&#8217;s source of\n\tadditional damage at high levels where fighters get a third attack and\n\tpaladins get Improved Divine Smite. Unfortunately, the math just doesn&#8217;t work\n\tout. Reckless Attack allows you score a critical hit roughly 9.75% of the\n\ttime, which is more than average but not so often that they&#8217;re consistent.\n\tBrutal Critical also mandates that you use a greataxe to maximize the\n\tbenefits, which discourages you from using weapons like a greatsword or a\n\tmaul. Even then, each Brutal Critical die adds just 1.2 damage per round on\n\taverage with a greataxe (assuming 2 attacks and Reckless Attack). You need all\n\tthree of those dice to match Improved Divine Smite, and you don&#8217;t get the\n\tthird die until level 17.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>To summarize: Brutal Critical feels very satisfying, but the math is not\n\tgood.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless Rage<\/span>: This will keep you\n\tconscious for a long time if you get hit with a low number of high-damage\n\tattacks, but lots of small attacks will raise the DC too quickly for this to\n\tremain effective. Be sure to eliminate weak but numerous enemies before your\n\tHP starts getting scary.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Persistent Rage<\/span>: There are very few\n\teffects which can end your rage prematurely without knocking you\n\tunconscious.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Indomitable Might<\/span>: By now you might very\n\teasily have 20 Strength, so you&#8217;re guaranteed to get a ridiculously high roll\n\ton any Strength check. Remember that saves and attacks aren&#8217;t checks, so you\n\tstill need to roll high on those.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Champion<\/span>: The equivalent of 4 ability\n\tincreases all at once. Your abilities should be absurd by this point, so now\n\tmay be a good time to abandon your armor in face of running around slaying\n\tmonsters in your undergarments.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optional-class-features\">Optional Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything, Optional Class Features offer ways to add additional features or replace existing ones. These rules are optional, and you should not assume that your DM will allow these features without consulting them first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments and suggestions for specific Optional Class Features are presented here, but for more information on handling Optional Class Features in general, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\">Practical Guide to Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Knowledge<\/span> (Addition): The Barbarian\n\tis notoriously useless outside of combat because their class features are\n\talmost exclusively dedicated to acts of violence. The one tiny sliver of\n\tnon-combat functionality which they get is their skills, and while they get\n\tthe standard 2 class skills their skill options are often only situationally\n\tuseful so most barbarians are locked into Athletics and Perception because\n\tthose are the only consistently useful choices. Adding 2 more skill\n\tproficiencies does a lot to improve the Barbarian&#8217;s non-combat capabilities,\n\tand granting them past level 1 means that the barbarian can grow and develop\n\tas a character, learning new skills in addition to new and exciting ways to\n\thurt stuff.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend granting Primal Knowledge to all characters who take barbarian as\n\ttheir primary class and whose race doesn&#8217;t provide additional skill\n\tproficiencies. Even for races which do provide skill proficiencies, it&#8217;s\n\tprobably still a good choice to grant this but consider how your player feels\n\tabout their character&#8217;s capabilities outside of combat before you make a\n\tdecision.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend considering it on a case-by-case basis for class dips. Most\n\tmulticlassed barbarians will go to level 3 to get Reckless Attack, and the\n\tadditional skill may be an unneeded benefit for what may already be a very\n\tpowerful character.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Instinctive Pounce<\/span> (Addition): At this\n\tlevel the Barbarian has Fast Movement, so many barbarians will have either 35\n\tft. or 40 ft. speed. Moving half of that speed when you begin a rage allows\n\tthe Barbarian to get into melee faster, which is essential since the Barbarian\n\tis essentially a melee-only class.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Instinctive Pounce on all barbarians whose subclasses\n\tdon&#8217;t add a complicated secondary effect when they rage (such as the Path of\n\tWild Magic&#8217;s roll on the Wild Magic Table). The amount of extra movement isn&#8217;t\n\tgoing to break the game and it won&#8217;t be helpful in every fight, but it makes\n\tthe Bonus Action to Rage feel less like a tax and more like an actual tactical\n\tdecision point. It also allows the DM to set encounters in larger areas\n\twithout accidently punishing the Barbarian, thereby offering the DM more\n\toptions for encounter design.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Barbarians rely heavil on their physical ability scores. If your scores are good enough, you can forgo armor, so it&#8217;s nice to have adequate Dexterity and Constitution to beat the AC bonus provided by half plate. However, that&#8217;s also very expensive, so it&#8217;s rarely worth the effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Barbarians are all about lots of\n\tStrength and big weapons, so Strength should almost always be your best\n\tability.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: 14 Dexterity is great to boost your\n\tAC with half plate. If you prefer to go armor-less, look for an item to boost\n\tyour Dexterity so that you can spend your ability increases on Strength and\n\tConstitution.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Con<\/span>: Second only to Strength. Barbarians\n\ttake a lot of damage, so you need all the hit points you can get. Constitution\n\talso powers Unarmored Defense.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump stat. Intelligence saves are very\n\trare, and Barbarians don&#8217;t get any Intelligence-based skills.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Wisdom saves are common, so don&#8217;t\n\tdump it, but don&#8217;t put a ton of effort into improving it.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Charisma only matters for a couple of\n\tthe Barbarian&#8217;s skills, and for the Berserker&#8217;s Intimidating Presence. Most\nBarbarians can dump Charisma\n\tand use the points to boost your Wisdom.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Barbarian Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Look for bonuses to Strength, Constitutions, and medium size so that you can\n\teffectively use big weapons like a Greataxe and survive your relatively poor\n\tAC compared to a fighter or a paladin.
