Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Inventor Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Intelligence. With high Intelligence you&#8217;ll\n\tstart with numerous trained skills and you&#8217;ll be effective with Crafting,\n\twhich is great because you need to succeed at Crafting checks to use some of\n\tyour class features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+ hit points. This is plenty\n\tfor artificers who plan to fight at range, but if you&#8217;re planning to fight in\n\tmelee you need to be cautious. Your armor and hit points aren&#8217;t as good as\n\tclasses the like the Barbarian, the Championm, and the Fighter,\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: Trained in simple\n\tweapons, martial weapons, and up to medium armor (heavy if you select the\n\tArmor innovation). Your AC isn&#8217;t going to be amazing and you&#8217;re not going to\n\tbe amazing at attacks, either.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: The worst progression in the\n\t\tgame. Don&#8217;t dump Wisdom, and strongly consider using a skill for Initiative\n\t\tif possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Expert in Fort and Will\n\t\tto start, but you don&#8217;t adance to Master until higher level than most\n\t\tclasses. The Inventor&#8217;s Reflex saves are among the worst in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 4+Int Trained skills\n\t\tfrom your class, and since Intelligence is the Inventor&#8217;s Key Ability Score\n\t\tyou should start with a bunch of skills. You&#8217;ll advance in Crafting for free,\n\t\ttoo, so you have a slight edge over other other classes with similar starting\n\t\tskill proficiencies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attacks<\/span>: Simple and Martial weapons, and\n\t\tyour proficiency advances at the same rate as martial classes like the\n\t\tBarbarian and the Ranger.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defenses<\/span>: Medium armor and a similar\n\t\tproficiency progression to other martial classes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class DC<\/span>: The Inventor&#8217;s Class DC is used\n\t\tfor weapon critical specialization effects (though you only get those with\n\t\tthe Weaopon innovation by default), for the Explode activity, and for a\n\t\thandful of Inventor Class Feats like Megavolt. The Inventor&#8217;s Class DC\n\t\tfollows the best progression in the game.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Overdrive<\/span>: A small but meaningful damage\n\tboost. The Action cost is small, but can still be somewhat annoying since you\n\tlikely want to use this in every fight. Note that this requires a Crafting\n\tcheck and the DC will increase as you gain level. Fortunately, you get\n\timprovements to Overdrive at levels 3, 7, and 15, each of which also increase\n\tyour proficiency in Crafting for free so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it too\n\tmuch.<\/p>\n<p>Overdrive can be re-activate while it&#8217;s still running, potentially allowing\n\tyou to raise a Success to a Critical Success to get the larger damage bonus.\n\tIn most cases this isn&#8217;t worth the Action, but maybe you don&#8217;t have anything\n\tbetter to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Innovations<\/strong>: See our\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/inventor\/\">Inventor Innovations Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Explode<\/span>: The damage is decent, the scaling\n\tAOE is nice, and triggering Unstable generally isn&#8217;t all that bad since it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t prevent the item from working. Unstable is only a one in five chance\n\tto not malfunction, so don&#8217;t expect to use this more than once per combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Peerless Inventor<\/span>: You gain the\n\tconfusingly-named Inventory skill feat (confusing because it&#8217;s also your\n\tClass&#8217;s name, so searching for it is hard) long before you could reach Master\n\tproficiency. If you&#8217;re going to depend heavily on crafted items, formulas are\n\tgoing to be important, and you don&#8217;t want them to become a massive money sink.\n\tInstead, the Inventor feat can become a time sink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Block<\/span>: A significant boost to your\n\tdurability if you can spare a hand and an Action for a shield. So long as your\n\tInnovation isn&#8217;t a 2-handed weapon, you&#8217;ll at least have a free hand. If\n\tyou&#8217;re going for Armor or Construct, that&#8217;s easy. If you&#8217;re going for Weapon,\n\teither go for something one-handed or fight at range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inventor Feats<\/strong>: See Inventor feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Overdrive<\/span>: One more damage with\n\tOverdrive and Expert in Crafting. You get a Skill Increase at the same level,\n\twhich means that you can be Expert in two skills right at level 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Reconfigure<\/span>: The Inventor&#8217;s class mechanics\n\tare unique, so their retraining mechanics need to be unique, too. The fact\n\tthat this requires a Crafting check is really odd, and the fact that it&#8217;s a\n\thigh DC means that you&#8217;re expected to fail sometimes. If you&#8217;re going to\n\tretrain things, make sure that you have a few days to spare in case you mess\n\tit up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Inventor Weapon Expertise<\/span>: More weapon\n\tproficiency and you get access to Critical Specialization Effects with your\n\tinnovation if you chose the Weapon innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breakthrough Innovation<\/strong>: See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/inventor\/innovations\/\">Inventor Innovations Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: Your Reflex save\n\tproficiency is bad, so you need as much help as you can get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Overdrive<\/span>: Another +1 damage when you\n\tOverdrive, and Master in Crafting. That&#8217;s not a huge improvement at this\n\tlevel, but it&#8217;s hard to say &#8220;no&#8221; to more damage from something that you should\n\tbe doing anyway. At this level your Intelligence modifier is likely +4, so\n\tyou&#8217;re gaining +4 damage from a successful Overdrive and +6 from a Critical\n\tSuccess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: Couple with the\n\tOverdrive feature, you can deal quite a bit of damage with your Strikes.\n\tInventors with the Construct Innovation will benefit less.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inventive Expertise<\/span>: Improving your class DC\n\tmeans a higher save DC for things like Explode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Offensive Boost<\/span>: 1d6 damage isn&#8217;t huge, but\n\tit&#8217;s as much damage as a property rune like Flaming and it doesn&#8217;t cost\n\tanything or consume a rune slot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Medium Armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC and access\n\tto critical specialization effects if you have the Armor innovation. I think\n\tthe rules are supposed to say &#8220;armor specialization effects&#8221;, but they do say\n\t&#8220;critical specialization effects&#8221;, which definitely isn&#8217;t a thing for armor.\n\tSince the armor options are both Composite, that means resistance to piercing\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resolve<\/span>: Better Will saves. You&#8217;re still\n\tadvancing very slowly, but we&#8217;ll take what we can get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alertness<\/span>: Horrifyingly late.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Complete Reconfiguration<\/span>: This allows you\n\tto retrain huge portions of your build in a hurry. Do this cautiously or you\n\tmay find that other portions of your build stop working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inventor Weapon Mastery<\/span>: More attack\n\tbonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage\n\tis always nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Legendary Overdrive<\/span>: Yet another +1 increase\n\tto your Overdrive damage. That feels really small at this level, but by now\n\tyou likely also have a +5 Intelligence modifier, so you&#8217;re gaining +5 damage\n\tfrom a successful Overdrive and +8 from a Critical Success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Revolutionary Innovation<\/strong>: See our\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/inventor\/\">Inventory Innovations Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inventive Mastery<\/span>: More class DC is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Juggernaut<\/span>: More saves are always nice, and\n\tFortitude is likely your best save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Infinite Invention<\/span>: This allows you to\n\tchange huge portions of your build during your daily preparations. The concept\n\tis neat, but the practical implications are worrying. You&#8217;ve almost certainly\n\tbuilt huge portions of your character around your innovation, so changing your\n\tinnovation and all of its modifications is both a ton of bookkeeping and a\n\tpotentially ruinous change to your build. But at the same time, you also gain\n\ta ton of flexibility to customize your innovation to suit challenges that you\n\texpect to face. Use this cautiously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Medium Armor Mastery<\/span>: More AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Inventor is surprisingly MAD, even for Pathfinder 2e. You need\n\tIntelligence to support your class features and skills, but you&#8217;re also sort\n\tof a martial class so you need some combination of Strength, Dexterity, and\n\tConstitution. Your Will saves are poor, so you also need Wisdom. That leaves\n\tCharisma as a dump stat, but you&#8217;re going to have to weigh your other\n\tdecisions based on your other build decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using a Strength-based\n\tweapon (most melee weapons), you need all that you can get. If you&#8217;re using a\n\tfinesse weapon or a propulsion weapon you need a little bit for damage. If\n\tyou&#8217;re using a crossbow or a firearm or if you select the Construct\n\tinnovation, you may be able to dump Strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Inventors get medium armor\n\tproficiency, so you likely need 12 at minimum. If you choose the Armor\n\tinnovation and choose the Subterfuge Suit or if you&#8217;re using a finesse weapon\n\tor a ranged weapon, you need more Dexterity than you would otherwise.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points and Fortitude saves. This\n\tis especially important if you plan to be in melee because you only have 8+\n\thit points and medium armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Your Key Ability Score. Regardless of\n\tyour other build decisions, this is absolutely crucial.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: You need a bit to support your poor\n\tPerception and Will saves, but how much you can afford will depend on your\n\tother build choices.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because the Inventor is somewhat MAD, three Boosts can be very helpful.\n\tAccess to an Uncommon weapon can be great for the Weapon Innovation because\n\tyou can often start with better weapon properties than you could with Common\n\tweapons. Ancestries which offer access to better unarmed strikes may be\n\tappealing for Armor Innovation, though remember that the Armor Innovation does\n\tstill let you improve a regular weapon with things like Offensive Boost, so\n\tit&#8217;s not absolutely necessary. Damage resistances to common damage types\n\t(fire, etc.) can also be helpful. For Construct Innovation, consider options\n\trelated to skills, new support options, and potentially spellcasting if you\n\tcan get utility and support spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/ancestries\/catfolk\/\" class=\"rating-orange\">Catfolk<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: The Boosts\/Flaws are hard and the feats don&#8217;t help much.

Of course, at that\n\tpoint a human with Unconventional Weaponry might be easier.

The\n\tHalfling&#8217;s Strength flaw may be a problem, so consider the Optional Flaw rules\n\tto dump Charisma and put boosts into Strength.
