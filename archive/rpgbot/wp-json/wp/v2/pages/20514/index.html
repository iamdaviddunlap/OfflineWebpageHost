They have the best area damage spells, many of the best crowd control spells, and have access to most of the ritual spells in the game, making them fantastic both in combat and as a utility caster. However, because they&#8217;re so reliant on spell slots, the wizard can also present resource limitations and require frequent long rests when your spell slots run dry unless you get good at stretching your spell slots for an extended period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the Wizard&#8217;s dependence on long rests, they frequently do well in parties of other characters which also depend on long rests to recharge or don&#8217;t have rechargeable features at all. Barbarians, rangers, rogues, and other full casters (bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer) all do well alongside a wizard. Classes which depend more on short rests (monk, warlock) may have more trouble managing resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Lacking any proficiency in armor or shields, wizards can also be incredibly frail (Abjuration School is a notable exception). Be sure to cast Mage Armor to boost your AC, and keep a safe distance between yourself and your enemies, ideally with the rest of your party in between. Spells don&#8217;t suffer Disadvantage for attacking at long range like weapons do, so you&#8217;re just as effective at your maximum range as you would be anywhere else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, we strongly recommend our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/classes\/wizard\/spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"20565\">Wizard Spells Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#spellcasting\">Spellcasting<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#arcane-recovery\">Arcane Recovery<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Wizard Subclasses<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#rating-blue\">Abjuration School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#conjuration-school\">Conjuration School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#divination-school\">Divination School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#enchantment-school\">Enchantment School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#evocation-school\">Evocation School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#rating-orange\">Illusion School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#necromancy-school\">Necromancy School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li><a href=\"#transmutation-school\">Transmutation School<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Wizard Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Wizard Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dwarf\">Dwarf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dragonborn\">Dragonborn<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#drow\">Drow<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#elf\">Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gnome\">Gnome<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#githyanki\">Githyanki<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfelf\">Half-Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halforc\">Half-Orc<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfling\">Halfling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#human\">Human<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tiefling\">Tiefling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Wizard Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Wizard Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Wizard Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Wizard Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Wizard Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Wizard Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Wizard Example Build: Gale the Evoker<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skill-proficiencies\">Skill Proficiencies<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses a color coding scheme to rate individual character options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Wizards have a massive spell list which does basically everything that you can do with magic except healing. Wizards have many of the best offensive spells, buff spells, area control spells, crowd control spells, and utility spells. They get access to most of the game&#8217;s ritual spells, too, which allows them to solve many problems outside of combat without spending spell slots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to hoard scrolls to add to your spellbook. I really can&#8217;t overstate how important and useful it is to collect scrolls. The ablity to learn spells by spending a bit of gold and a scroll means that you effectively have the entire wizard spell list available (or as close as you can get with whatever scrolls you can find). You can then swap your prepared spells to suit your needs at any given moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even once you know a spell, scrolls can also provide easy access to spells that you don&#8217;t have prepared and complement your limited number of spell slots. Merchants that sell scrolls typically restock<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This even applies to cantrips, which is a major deviation form the tabletop rules. You can learn additional cantrips from scrolls, giving you the ability to have every wizard cantrip available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"arcane-recovery\">Arcane Recovery<\/h3>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Once per day out of combat, you can replenish expended&nbsp;Spell Slots.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The description is wildly unhelpful, so here&#8217;s how it actually works: You gain a number of charges equal to half of your wizard level (rounded down). At any time outside of combat, you can recover a spell slot by spending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot (1 charge for a 1st-level spell, 2 charges for a 2nd-level spell, etc.). You can do this whenever you like throughout the day until you expend all of your charges, which then reset when you take a long rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arcane recovery is great for recovering 1st-level slots that you&#8217;ve used for Shield, but you can also use it to recover one sepll slot of your highest spell level by spending all of your charges. Unlike the tabletop rules, you can use this at any time outside of combat and you can restore spell slots throughout the day until you run out of charges, rather than only doing so once when you complete a Short Rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Wizard Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"rating-blue\">Abjuration School<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Durability, plain and simple. Arcane Ward&#8217;s math makes it among the best defenses in the game, mitigating insane quantities of damage at little cost (potentially no cost if you multiclass). The ward&#8217;s protection is enough that you may be more durable than front-line characters like barbarians and fighters, and sharing its protection with allies means that your entire party is hard to kill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many wizard subclasses, Abjuration School rewards sticking to single-class wizard because the Ward&#8217;s maximum Intensity is determined by your wizard level.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-abjuration-savant\">2: Abjuration Savant<\/h4>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Halves the cost to learn&nbsp;Abjuration spells&nbsp;from&nbsp;scrolls. Learning these spells will only cost&nbsp;\u202f25\u202fgp&nbsp;per spell level.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard, and not especially important. In a game where pickpocketing merchants is comically easy, small amounts of gold aren&#8217;t a meaningful cost.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"2-arcane-ward\">2: Arcane Ward<\/h4>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The residual magic of your spells forms a ward around you that protects you from harm. Each time you cast an Abjuration spell, the intensity of the ward increases by the amount of the spell&#8217;s Level, up to a maximum of 2x your Wizard level. Each time you take damage, the ward blocks an amount of damage equal to its intensity, and its intensity decreases by 1. After each&nbsp;Long Rest, the ward&#8217;s intensity resets, and becomes the same as your Wizard level.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The exponential growth of the Arcane Ward makes it an absurdly powerful defense. Say that your ward was currently at Intensity 10. If you were to then take damage, that damage would be reduced by 10, then the intensity would be reduced to 9, which is barely a difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the tabletop rules you can multiclass into Warlock to get the Armor of Shadows invocation, which allows you to cast Mage Armor without spending a spell slot in order to fully charge the ward for free. However, in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 Mage Armor can&#8217;t target a creature that already has Mage Armor running, so that exploit doesn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"6-projected-ward\">6: Projected Ward<\/h4>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>As a reaction, when a nearby ally takes damage you can sacrifice your&nbsp;Arcane Ward&nbsp;to reduce the damage they take, and its intensity reduces by 1.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>All the wonderful shenanigans of Arcane Ward, and now you get to share it once per round.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"10-improved-abjuration\">10: Improved Abjuration<\/h4>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Each time you take a&nbsp;Short Rest&nbsp;the intensity of your&nbsp;Arcane Ward&nbsp;increases by an amount equal to your Wizard level.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking a long rest resets your ward to intensity equal to your level. One short rest then increases it by your level. You could take a long rest then immediately take a long rest and have a full ward, but that would be a bit silly since you only get two per day (three with a bard). If you&#8217;re using a Warlock dip to fill your ward, this doesn&#8217;t matter much. If you&#8217;re not, this is amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"conjuration-school\">Conjuration School<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Conjuration School has nothing to do with summoning creatures, which has been a source of confusion and frustration for DnD players for years.

Get summoned creatures, area effect spells, and crowd control spells up and running before enemies can respond. Of course, since initiative is rolled on a d4, having passable Dexterity is often sufficient.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dual Wielder<\/span>: Use two magic staves. At high levels you&#8217;ll find enough of them that choosing just one is hard, and this is the only way to use two.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Adept<\/span>: Wizards are among the best blaster casters in the game, and Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 is set up to make elemental damage both fun and effective. Ignoring resistance to your favorite damage type and removing the possibility of rolling 1s is a significant boost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lucky<\/span>: Good on every character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resilient<\/span>: Resilient (Constitution) dramatically improves your ability to maintain Concentration, as well as protects you from a common saving throw type.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell Sniper<\/span>: Wizards don&#8217;t depend on spell attacks enough to justify this, and the few attacks which they do use can be buffed by other mechanisms like high ground or having a crow familiar blind your target..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">War Caster<\/span>: Advantage on Concentration is great, but mathematically it&#8217;s about as good as a +3, so Resilient (Constitution) will be just as effective at level 5 with the added benefit of affecting normal Constitution saves. Yes, you can use this to cast Shocking Grasp as an Opportunity Attack, but you should not be making opportunity attacks enough for that to matter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Wizard Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wizards get very few weapon proficiencies, and they largely stop mattering beyond low levels. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dagger<\/span>: Until you find a magic staff, this is your go-to melee weapon. You really only need it for attacks of opportunity. Try to avoid using it as much as possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Light Crossbow<\/span>: Starting with 16 Dexterity will mean that crossbows deal more damage than your single-target cantrips until they improve at level 5.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quarterstaff<\/span>: You don&#8217;t actually want it as a weapon, but you&#8217;ll acquire magic staves which also function as a quarterstaff, so you  can bonk people from time to time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Wizard Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wizards are not proficient in armor, but the game includes many magic robes which will fill your armor slot. Your primary source of AC will be Mage Armor and your Dexterity score, but there are also numerous items that boost your AC. A few items, such as Bracers of Defense, only work while unarmored, and those items are a great fit for wizards, provided that you don&#8217;t have a monk (or possibly a barbarian) in the party who would also want them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Wizard Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Wizard&#8217;s multiclassing is somewhat unique because wizards in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 can learn spells of any level for which they have spell slots. This makes multiclassing considerably less costly, as the only things you give up are feats, subclass features, and prepared spells. Other classes don&#8217;t advance their access to high-level spells if they multiclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Barbarian<\/span>: You can&#8217;t cast spells while you rage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/span>: No ability score overlap. Anything that you want from the Bard you likely already have from the Wizard or you can get it better somewhere else. The biggest appeal here is an additional skill proficiency, plus Expertise if you get to level 3, without giving up spell slot progression.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: A single level to get access to powerful 1st-level spells like Healing Word, plus some 1st-level domain features are very powerful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid<\/span>: Everything you want from the Druid is probably better coming from the Cleric since they get better armor options.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: Starting your build with 1 level\n\t\tof Fighter gets you heavy armor, shields, a Fighting Style (take Defense),\n\t\tand proficiency in Constitution saves to help you maintain Concentration on\n\t\tyour spells. A second levels gets you Action Surge so that you can cast two\n\t\tbig spells in a single turn.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk<\/span>: Unarmored Defense works while in\n\t\trobes intended for wizards, but you likely won&#8217;t get any other benefit, and\n\t\tMage Armor will likely be more impactful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Paladin<\/span>: Everything you would want here\n\t\twill be better coming from the Cleric or the Fighter.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger<\/span>: No ability overlap. You can get everything you want from the Ranger from the Druid and\/or the Fighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue<\/span>: Cunning Action is tempting if you&#8217;re worried about getting stuck in melee and don&#8217;t want to spend spell slots on Misty Step. Three levels to get Fast Hands from the Thief subclass means that you can cast two Bonus Action spells in one turn, but there aren&#8217;t many of those, and unlike the tabletop rules, you don&#8217;t need to spend a Bonus Action to activate things like Flaming Sphere or summoned creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Starting tour build with a\n\t\tsingle level gets you proficiency in Constitution saves to help you maintain\n\t\tConcentration on your spells, plus you don&#8217;t give up any spell slot\n\t\tprogression. Use your tiny amount of sorcerer spellcasting for spells like\n\t\tShield which are great but don&#8217;t care about your spellcasting modifier.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warlock<\/span>: No ability overlap, but the Warlock has a few options which allow for some really abusable combos, such as taking Armor of Shadows to cast Mage Armor for free in order to charge Abjuration School&#8217;s Arcane Ward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Wizard Example Build: Gale the Evoker<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/BG3_Gale-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Gale the wizard looking sad and broody\" class=\"wp-image-20710\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Look at this poor, sad, magical man.

Cast Mage Armor, then immediately use Arcane Recovery to get that spell slot back. Grab the first shield you find. That&#8217;s your new left arm until you find one that&#8217;s magic. 15+Dex AC is pretty good, even with Gale&#8217;s inexplicable +1 Dexterity modifier.<br><br>On a custom wizard with 16 Dexterity, you&#8217;re rocking 18 AC at level 1 with a random wooden board you found on the ground strapped to your arm.<br><br>The spell list here is also taken directly from Gale.

If positioning works in your favor, use Thunderwave to shove multiple enemies off of cliffs. Otherwise, use Sleep to eliminate as many low-hp enemies as possible. Enemies with 7 max hp often do comparable damage to enemies with 30, so thinning their numbers is huge.<br><br>Don&#8217;t forget that Mage Hand can shove enemies, can be attacked, and can even make attacks (albeit for one damage), and can throw objects sitting on the ground (like that bottle of water that you just dropped), making it a decently useful combat summon. One attack against your mage hand is one not made against you and your party, and you might even use your mage hand to shove some enemies into pits.<br><br>[Spoilers]: I used Witch Bolt against probably the most Witch Bolt-friendly enemy in the entire game: the boss at the end of the prologue. They stand still and attack someone that isn&#8217;t in your party, they don&#8217;t attack you no matter how annoying you are, and I managed to get Advantage on the initial attack. I stood there and reactivated Witch Bolt for like 5 turns and after repeatedly rolling low single-digit damage against an enemy with resistance, I threw up my hands, declared Witch Bolt a lost cause, and crashed a space ship in disgust.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Subclass: Evocation School<br>Evocation Savant<br>Sculpt Spells<br>New Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Chromatic Orb<br>&#8211; Find Familiar<\/td><td>Sculpt Spells is among the most important features that an evoker can have.

Try to get high ground if you can.<br><br>Find Familiar is amazing and has the added benefit of being a Ritual that you can cast without a spell slot once per Short Rest.

It&#8217;s a bit complicated, and really the only way to get a hang of it is to practice. Be mindful of the flaming terrain that it leaves so that you don&#8217;t kill your party, and remember that the Flaming Aura is automatic damage with no save. Both will affect your allies and Sculpt Spells doesn&#8217;t apply, so be cautious around allies, and dismiss the summon as soon as combat ends or the AI will automatically walk the sphere right into the middle of your party and start eating hit points.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Elemental Adept (Fire)<br>New Cantrip Known: Acid Splash<br>New Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>Since we&#8217;re relying so heavily on fire damage, Elemental Adept is a great feat.<br><br>If you&#8217;re using Flaming Sphere, be extra mindful here.
