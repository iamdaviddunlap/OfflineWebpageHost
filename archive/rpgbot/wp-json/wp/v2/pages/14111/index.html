In Dungeons and Dragons 5e, the Swashbuckler is a Roguish Archetype specializing in a mix of Charismatic Panache and being an expert duelist. Some hear the name Swashbuckler and think pirate, and while that is a perfectly reasonable direction to take, there are plenty of other ways to play one. For every Captain Jack Sparrow among their ranks you\u2019ll also find a d&#8217;Artagnan, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, and Zorro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>What sets Swashbucklers apart from other Rogues right away is their Rakish Audacity, allowing one to reliably apply Sneak Attack damage while in one-on-one combat. Additionally, Fancy Footwork grants the Swashbuckler what amounts to a free disengage vs their dueling opponent, for the most daring of acrobatic movements about the battlefield to leave a foe in shambles and disarray.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of acrobatic maneuvers, more accomplished Swashbucklers can give themselves Advantage on Athletics and Acrobatics checks in order to pull off such marvelous stunts. Never discount the usefulness of a well-timed shove or a daring leap to get yourself out of a jam. With such graceful mobility, your opponents won\u2019t stand a chance against such a Master Duelist, turning a miss into a feint and exploiting the opening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In the example build provided below, we\u2019ll explore a fun way to build a Swashbuckler into a tough melee combatant that can hold its own with the best of them. Not a tank by any means, but not made of paper, the Thundering Thrillseeker shows off in combat as a nimble duelist that darts in and out of the fight with precision attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something a little more advanced than our typical example builds, we have a multi-classed build featuring <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/hexblade\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hexblade Warlock<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/hexbuckler\/\">The Boy Who Wouldn&#8217;t Grow Up<\/a>.

Using two\n\t\tlight-weapons for two-weapon fighting allows you to move past and attack two\n\t\tenemies if you feel the need. The choice between using Cunning Action to\n\t\tDisengage and relying on Fancy Footwork will depend both on what you&#8217;re\n\t\twielding and on how many enemies you need to evade.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rakish Audacity<\/span>: This is absurdly good.\n\t\tAny Rogue can Sneak Attack if an ally is within 5 feet of the target. Rakish\n\t\tAudacity allows you to Sneak Attack if no one except the target is adjacent\n\t\tto you, which means that as long as you&#8217;re not getting mobbed you can\n\t\treliably Sneak Attack whenever you hit.\n\t\t<p>As long as you can get away from other enemies (such as by using Cunning\n\t\t\tAction to Disengage) you&#8217;re nearly guaranteed to be able to Sneak Attack.\n\t\t\tSince you still need to be within 5 feet you&#8217;re likely making melee\n\t\t\tattacks, but you could technically use a crossbow with Crossbow Expert.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Oh, and as if this wasn&#8217;t absurdly good already, you add your Charisma\n\t\t\tbonus to Initiative checks on top of your Dexterity.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache<\/span>: Be sure to take Expertise in\n\t\tPersuasion to make this work. It&#8217;s worth the investment.\n\t\t<p>Tanking generally isn&#8217;t in the Rogue&#8217;s skillset, but the first portion of\n\t\t\tthis feature is a taunt mechanic. The DM could technically end the ability\n\t\t\tby having the creature walk out of the 60 foot range before returning, but\n\t\t\tthat would be a cheap metagame trick, so feel free to shame your DM if\n\t\t\tthey try it. With passable AC and Uncanny Dodge, you can easily handle\n\t\t\tbeing one creature&#8217;s sole focus for extended periods, leaving the rest of\n\t\t\tyour party to handle the rest of the encounter until one section of the\n\t\t\tparty comes to help the other.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Out of combat, you can use this to Charm creatures, making them a very\n\t\t\tloyal friend for a very brief period. The effect doesn&#8217;t let the creature\n\t\t\tknow it was charmed or that you did anything unusual, and since it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tgrant temporary immunity or have a usage limitation, you can use Panache\n\t\t\ton the same creature repeatedly to keep it Charmed. If you can succeed on\n\t\t\tthe initial Charisma (Persuasion) check, this will trivialize social\n\t\t\tinteractions with single creatures that aren&#8217;t already hostile to you.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Elegant Maneuver<\/span>: Advantage is great,\n\t\tespecially on a skill like Athletics which is used to Shove enemies prone.\n\t\tUnfortunately, this uses your Bonus Action just to grant you Advantage, so\n\t\tyou still need to use your Action to use the skill, leaving you no\n\t\topportunity to attack. You&#8217;re most likely to use this to escape grapples, to\n\t\tleap over difficult terrain, or do other fancy stuff like that.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Master Duelist<\/span>: Sometimes you can&#8217;t risk\n\t\tmissing, and in those cases this is a life saver. Most of the time you can\n\t\tstill use Fancy Footwork to move away and return to attack later, but\n\t\tsometimes that just isn&#8217;t an option and you need to deal damage right away\n\t\trather than letting things drag on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swashbuckler-rogue-ability-scores\">Swashbuckler Rogue Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, Rogues have <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#ability-scores\">some flexibility<\/a> in their scores, as after Dexterity and Constitution are shored up there are usually points left over to lean into different skill categories. The Swashbuckler however has features that care about their Charisma score, which means Swashbucklers tend to also take on the Face role in a party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: We end up with the ability to get Advantage on Athletics at 13th-level, so it\u2019s not a high priority by any stretch, but letting Strength be your 4th-highest score on a standard array spread is a decent option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: This is our AC, our attack with Finesse or Ranged weapons, and our Initiative checks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Don\u2019t get yourself killed doing ridiculous stunts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Reading books is for uncool people.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Being aware of our surroundings is for uncool people.

We later take Skill Expert and gain the Perception skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Expertise, at 1st level, we take Acrobatics and Deception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Skill Expert at 4th level, we take Insight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Expertise again, at 6th level, we take Intimidation and Persuasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together these Expertises make us an unrivaled Face as well as a paragon of acrobatic stunts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we take Skill Expert for a +1 to Dexterity, Perception Proficiency, and Insight Expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we take an ASI for +2 Dexterity. (18=&gt;20)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tenth level, we take the Inspiring Leader Feat. At this level this is 13 THP per short rest for the entire party and it will go up by one every level. That\u2019s not a lot per person at one time, but that\u2019s still between 52 and 78 damage across 4-6 people that won&#8217;t need to be healed later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, we take the Tough Feat. This will add 24 hit points right away, more than adding +2 to Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option that gives us less HP overall, but improves our saves and support capability, would be to take Resilient (Constitution) now at 12 and Chef at 19, resulting in the same total Constitution, with a higher save and with additional healing for the party during short rests.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we take an ASI for +2 Charisma. (16=&gt;18)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at nineteenth level, we take an ASI for +2 Constitution.

We do, however, have the Booming Blade Cantrip, which works well with Sneak Attack. It\u2019s not quite a gish, but it does give us that hint of gish flavor.<br>Work with your team to make sure you can deliver Sneak Attacks and try not to die on the way to 2nd-level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>Cunning Action<\/td><td>With Cunning Action we can Dash, Disengage, or make a Stealth check to hide as a bonus action.<br>Handy in all sorts of situations, this will get us out of many jams. We can immediately pretend to be a swashbuckler by walking into melee, using Booming Blade, then using Cunning Action to move away without provoking an Opportunity Attack.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>Swashbuckler-Fancy Footwork-Rakish Audacity<\/td><td>Swashbuckler comes with a lot as soon as it\u2019s acquired.<br>Fancy Footwork is like a free disengage against any target we make a melee attack against, hit or miss. Use Booming Blade to perform hit-and-run tactics.<br>Rakish Audacity does two things. First, it adds our Charisma modifier to our Initiative checks. Second, it also applies our Sneak Attack damage to targets as long as the target is the only creature within 5 feet of us. Make sure no one (including your allies) is crowding you.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>Feat: Skill Expert<br>&#8211; Skill: Perception<br>&#8211; Expertise: Insight<br>Dexterity 17 -&gt; 18<\/td><td>We take Skill Expert in order to get an extra skill, Perception, and to gain expertise in Insight. Our lower Wisdom score is a problem when reading people, so this will compensate for that.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>Uncanny Dodge<\/td><td>Spend a reaction when we get hit to take half damage from an attack. The nice thing to notice is that this isn\u2019t resistance to the attack, so it stacks with resistance.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>Expertise:<br>&#8211; Intimidation<br>&#8211; Persuasion<\/td><td>Get even better with the rest of the Face skills. Now we\u2019re basically the best negotiator.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>Evasion<\/td><td>This is a powerful ability, taking no damage on successful Dexterity saves, and half damage on failed saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>ASI: Dexterity 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>And here we cap our Dexterity. Now we\u2019ll have the best attacks and AC we can have.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>5d6<\/td><td>Panache<\/td><td>In combat this is an Interesting taunt mechanic, useful to get a target to tunnel vision us instead of the rest of the party. Out of combat, this just makes negotiation and other Face activities even easier.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>5d6<\/td><td>Feat: Inspiring Leader<\/td><td>Inspiring Leader ends up being a sizable chunk of temporary HP when totalled across the party. 13 per person sounds small, but across four targets that\u2019s still 52 damage that won&#8217;t need to be healed later per short or long rest.&nbsp;<br>On an average day with two short rests, that\u2019s 156 HP. And this will only get stronger with every level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><td>Reliable Talent<\/td><td>Reliable Talent is worded strangely, but the way I think about it is that it\u2019s Advantage where one of the dice is always a 10. That makes it really easy to remember.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><td>Feat: Tough<\/td><td>We could increase our Constitution, but it\u2019s better to do Tough first and then later increase Con if we still want more. With Panache encouraging our foes to tunnel vision us, it would be smart to have more hit points.<br>Alternatively, taking Resilient (Constitution) would give us no HP right now, but boost our save by +4 right now, with another +1 next level when PB hits +5.<br>If we go this route, then taking Chef at 19 instead of the Constitution ASI will round out the Con score and provide additional support options to the party.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>7d6<\/td><td>Elegant Maneuver<\/td><td>A little on-demand Advantage for Athletics and Acrobatics. It\u2019s nice and we\u2019ll get use out of it if we need to do daring flips and such. Also great to get out of a grapple.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>7d6<\/td><td>Blindsense<\/td><td>Finding hidden things is nice, but the range is rather short. Not bad; it won&#8217;t help us too often unless our allies like to rely on things like Darkness and Fog Cloud, but we\u2019ll be happy when it does.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>8d6<\/td><td>Slippery Mind<\/td><td>Wisdom save proficiency. Nothing fancy, just a really nice thing to have.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>8d6<\/td><td>ASI: Charisma  16 -&gt; 18<\/td><td>More Charisma. Good for initiative checks and Face skills, though we should already be winning those all the time with our Expertise and Reliable Talent.<br>And with this bump, our Inspiring Leader feat is now handing out 20 THP per person per short rest, which across four people is 80 THP. Across a full day with two short rests, that comes to 240 THP, which is about as much HP as an extra body at this level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>9d6<\/td><td>Master Duelist<\/td><td>Reroll a missed attack, but with Advantage, once per rest. Not a bad feature. Helps secure damage and kills.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>9d6<\/td><td>Elusive<\/td><td>This is a great little feature, nobody can get Advantage when attacking us unless we\u2019re incapacitated.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>10d6<\/td><td>ASI: Constitution 16 -> 18<\/td><td>More hit points, less dying.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>10d6<\/td><td>Stroke of Luck<\/td><td>This is similar to the feature we got from Swashbuckler at 17, but instead of a reroll, this one just makes the attack hit.<br>Unlike Master Duelist, this feature also works on failed ability checks, treating them as a 20.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Something has changed within me Something is not the same I&#8217;m through with playing by the rules Of someone else&#8217;s game Idina Menzel &#8211; Defying Gravity Introduction A Swashbuckler is a flashy, showy, bombastic adventuring type, usually but not necessarily a swordsman.
