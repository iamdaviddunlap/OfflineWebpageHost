They have a broad skill list, and can excel as Faces, Scouts, and Strikers. However, the class&#8217;s design and concept make it an exceptionally unique class with some important implications for your build, your play style, and your campaign in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most classes, Vigilantes have a very small set of fixed abilities, and instead have <em>two<\/em> types of talents, which makes them extremely customizable. The nature of the class mandates that these talents will very rarely interact. Your Social Talents will take the fore while you are in your &#8220;Social&#8221; identity, but your Vigilante Talents will take over when you switch to your &#8220;Vigilante&#8221; identity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>When consider the Vigilante class, it&#8217;s crucial to consider what style of campaign you are playing. The Vigilante is <em>absolutely not<\/em> a conventional adventurer. If your party delves dungeons, hunts monsters, and faces foes like Callifax the Mad Mage, who enjoys summoning demons, raising the dead, and weilding evil artifacts then the Vigilante will be a largely useless appendage. If your party faces foes like Lord Cicily of Crestfall, who enjoys political corruption, widespread injustice, and the occasional dinner party, then the Vigilante is a good choice. The Vigilante excels in highly social and RP-heavy games, and in games which don&#8217;t change locales frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In all things related to the Vigilante, consider Batman your gold standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Vigilante Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points is common for\n\tRogue-like Strikers. You won&#8217;t stand up to damage like a Fighter, but you\n\tshouldn&#8217;t need to.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB is typical for a\n\thigh-skill class. If you want full BAB, you cantake the Avenger\n\tspecialization.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Good Reflex and Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Considerably better\n\tproficiencies than the Rogue. Medium armor and shields, plus martial weapons.\n\tThat&#8217;s a good range of options, but in medium armor you&#8217;ll probably still opt\n\tfor a Dexterity-based build over Strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: The Vigilante&#8217;s skill list is very\n\tlong, which provides lots of options, but they only get 6+ skill ranks so they\n\tface the same issue as Rogues: far too many options to grab everything you\n\twant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dual Identity<\/span> (Ex): The defining feature of\n\tthe class. Your ability to switch between identities defines which skillsets\n\tare available to you. Generally your &#8220;Social&#8221; identity will command the bulk\n\tof your character&#8217;s in-world time, but when weapons come out your &#8220;Vigilante&#8221;\n\tidentity should too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Seamless Guise<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but it\n\tmostly eliminates the need for the Disguise skill since you can generally make\n\tdo with just your social and vigilante identities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Social Talent<\/span>: Social Talents determine how\n\tyou do stuff outside of combat.See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/vigilante\/social_talents\">Vigilante Social Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor help selecting talents.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Vigilante Specialization<\/span> (Ex): Your choice\n\tof specialization determines how you fight more than any other decision within\n\tthe class. Avengers are more of a straight-forward Fighter-like option, while\n\tStalkers fight more like Rogues.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Avenger<\/span>: Fighter BAB is great if you want\n\t\tto go for a straight-up fighter approach. When you pick up Vigilante Strike\n\t\tat 20th level, you get to aumatically confirm critical threats on your\n\t\tVigilante Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stalker<\/span>: Mechanically this is very\n\t\tsimilar to Sneak Attack, but it&#8217;s a bit harder to apply because you can&#8217;t\n\t\tapply it to a target by feinting or by restraining them. The damage while\n\t\tsurprising targets is better, but the damage while flanking is worse, which\n\t\tis unfortunate since flanking and TWF is such a reliable tactic for Sneak\n\t\tAttack users. The phrase &#8220;unaware of his presence&#8221; is open to\n\t\tinterpretation. It&#8217;s not clear if this means the characters specific\n\t\tlocation, or simply that the Vigilante is in the general area. If it&#8217;s the\n\t\tlatter, invisibility and sniping are less useful. When you pick up Vigilante\n\t\tStrike at 20th level, you get to apply two rider effects to Hidden Strike\n\t\twith Vigilante Strike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilante Talent<\/span>: Vigilante Talents\n\tdetermine how you fight. In a game like Pathfinder, you do a lot of that. See\n\tmy\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/vigilante\/vigilante_talents\">Vigilante Talents Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor help selecting talents.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Unshakable <\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Startling Appearance<\/span> (Ex): The way this is\n\tworded is really helpful. The target remains flat-footed for the duration of\n\tyour turn, so Stalker Vigilantes can apply Sudden Strike on all of their\n\tattacks, and the target is denied their Dexterity bonus the whole time rather\n\tthan only against the first attack as is sometimes the case (like when you\n\tbreak invisibility). The penalty to the target&#8217;s attacks against you is\n\ttotally unnecessary, but I&#8217;m rarele one to complain about free bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Frightening Appearance<\/span> (Ex): The AOE is\n\tsmall, but Shaken is a fantastic status condition and with a decent entrance\n\tyou can start encounters with a considerable advantage. The wording is\n\tsomewhat ambiguous, but I take &#8220;the target of his attack and any enemies\n\twithin 10 feet who can see the attack&#8221; to mean 10 feet of the target, not 10\n\tfeet of the Vigilante. Otherwise ranged builds would be absolutely non-viable.\n\tFrightening the target of your attack potentially prevents them from attacking\n\tyou, which is especially useful when attacking single targets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Appearance<\/span> (Ex): Stunning a target\n\tcauses them to drop whatever their holding (namely weapons), and robs them of\n\ttheir turn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vengeance Strike<\/span> (Ex): Versatile and\n\texceptionally powerful. You get to stack up to 5 effects, which can be\n\tabsolutely devastating.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">+4 Circumstance Bonus to Attack Roll<\/span>: +4\n\t\tis a solid bonus, but the ability to increase your effective d20 roll is\n\t\tconsiderably better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">+3d6 Precision Damage<\/span>: Sometimes damage\n\t\tis enough, and this is the obvious option for Stalker Vigilantes. Stack up\n\t\tto 15d6 precision damage, plus 10d8 damage from Hidden Strike. That&#8217;s 97.5\n\t\t(52.5+45) damage on average before you even consider you weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Increase d20 roll by 2<\/span>: You can stack this\n\t\tup to a 10 point increase in your roll, giving you a 55% of rolling a\n\t\tnatural 20. That makes a solid case for using an x4 crit weapon like a heavy\n\t\tpick or a scythe. Back that up with Power Attack, high Strength, and a\n\t\tdecent enhancement bonus and you&#8217;re looking a massive pile of damage and a\n\t\tguranteed hit with a likely critical (guaranteed for Avengers!).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Vigilantes can be very MAD if you let them. Be sure to emphasize what you need to get by, and don&#8217;t be afraid to go into the game with several 16&#8217;s instead of one 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Take a bit for damage. 12 is fine. 14\n\tmight be too much just because going from 13 to 14 costs more point-buy points\n\tthan from 11 to 12. Only two-handed builds really need strength, and most\n\tVigilantes won&#8217;t go that route.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Most Vigilantes will be in medium armor\n\tat most, so you need at least a little bit of Dexterity. Lethal Grace makes\n\tthis especially true because the level bonus to damage will scale much fast\n\tthan your Strength bonus could.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Everyone needs hit points, and\n\tFortitude is the Vigilante&#8217;s bad save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Vigilantes are too MAD to put a lot\n\tinto Intelligence, which is a shame since they have so many good skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wis<\/span>: The closest thing you&#8217;ve got to a dump\n\tstat. Fortunately Vigilantes get good Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cha<\/span>: The Vigilante is a Face by nature, and\n\tmany of the Vigilante&#8217;s abilities rely on Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 16<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Great to move around in\n\t\tcombat without getting killed, but you only need to be able to reliably hit\n\t\ta DC of 15, so you don&#8217;t need to invest a ton of skill ranks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Appraise<\/span> (Int): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Helpful for any face, and\n\t\tfeinting is a nice way for melee Rogues to get some self-sufficiency in\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any\n\t\tface.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disable Device<\/span> (Dex): Essential for Scouts\n\t\twho need to handle traps.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disguise<\/span> (Cha): A big part of the\n\t\tVigilante&#8217;s flavor, but with Seamless Guise you really don&#8217;t need it.

The go-to option for TWF builds and as a\n\t\tbackup weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glaive<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going for a Vital\n\t\tPunishment build, a Glaive is your weapon of choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greatsword<\/span>: Two-handed builds are\n\t\tpossible, but the Vigilante doesn&#8217;t get a lot that supports it. It&#8217;s also\n\t\thard to sneak around with a giant sword without drawing attention to\n\t\tyourself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longbow<\/span>: Archers&#8217; weapon of choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapier<\/span>: Commonly accepted as a decorative\n\t\taccessory in noble circles of many cultures in many settings, it&#8217;s often\n\t\teasy to bring into many perfectly civil social situations.

Pick up\n\t\ttalents like Up Close and Personal, and use a shield once you can eliminate\n\t\tthe Armor Check Penalty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortsword<\/span>: A bit more damage than a\n\t\tdagger, but you sacrifice the versatility, subtlety, and the ability to\n\t\tthrow them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Choose the armor which most closely matches your max dex bonus.
