The\n\tSorcadin held sway for a long time before being supplanted by the Hexadin as\n\tthe go-to multiclass build. But while those two builds are certainly the most\n\twell-known paladin multiclass combos, there is another way: The Bardadin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Bardadin doesn&#8217;t have the Sorcerer&#8217;s ability to melt high-level spell slots into efficient 1st-level smites, and they don&#8217;t have the Warlock&#8217;s ability to recharge their smites slots on a short rest, but Bard makes up for those capabilities with <em>panache<\/em>. By combining that with the Paladin&#8217;s durability and divine smite, you also conveniently solve one of the biggest problems with martial bards: their poor damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Bardadin is an excellent example of the cost\/benefit analysis inherent in\n\tmulticlassing. The Bard and the Paladin both have good multiclass break points\n\tat levels 2 through 6, and making that trade means giving up powerful\n\thigh-level features like 9th-level bard spells or the Paladin&#8217;s Aura\n\tImprovements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Subclass Options<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a lot of flexibility in your choice of subclasses here. The\n\tPaladin&#8217;s proficiencies cover a lot of what&#8217;s granted by martial bard\n\tsubclasses, which alters the decision somewhat. The advice offered in our\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>\n\tstill mostly applies, but there&#8217;s some extra nuance beyond what that article\n\tcan reasonably cover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bard<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This section is in addition to the advice on the Bard&#8217;s core features\n\tdetailed in our\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/#bard\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>, and only covers a subset of subclasses which we believe are obviously\n\trelevant to the Bardadin. Other subclasses may still be great here, but they\n\tdon&#8217;t need additional explanation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>College of Swords<\/strong>: The armor proficiencies are redundant,\n\t\tand Extra Attack only matters if you don&#8217;t get to level 5 in paladin (which\n\t\tyou might not do). Fighting style is nice, but Blade Flourish won&#8217;t be\n\t\timpactful unless you go to level 5 to get Font of Inspiration. It&#8217;s hard to\n\t\tjustify this on a paladin-heavy build, but it&#8217;s fine on a bard-heavy\n\t\tbuild.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>College of Valor<\/strong>: The armor proficiencies are redundant,\n\t\tand Extra Attack only matters if you don&#8217;t get to level 5 in paladin (which\n\t\tyou might not do). Battle Magic would be amazing on a bardadin, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tsuch a high-level feature that it doesn&#8217;t justify how little you get for the\n\t\trest of your career. I only recommend college of valor at high\n\t\tlevels once Magical Secrets comes online.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>College of Whispers<\/strong>: The most obvious and appealing thing\n\t\there is Psychic Blades. Much like Divine Smite, the damage is multiplied on\n\t\ta critical hit. So if you can fish for critical hits (consider paralyzing\n\t\tyour target first) you can drop a fistful of dice on them with one attack.\n\t\tIf you&#8217;re going paladin-heavy, I recommend stopping at 3 levels of whispers\n\t\tbard. If you&#8217;re going bard-heavy, I recommend starting in bard for the extra\n\t\tskills, paladin 2, then back to bard.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paladin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This section is in addition to the advice on the Paladin&#8217;s core features\n\tdetailed in our\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/#paladin\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>, and only covers a subset of subclasses which we believe are obviously\n\trelevant to the Bardadin. Other subclasses may still be great here, but they\n\tdon&#8217;t need additional explanation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Oath of Devotion<\/strong>: Sacred Weapon neatly solves much of your\n\t\tMAD issues, allowing you to focus almost exclusively on Charisma much like a\n\t\tHexadin does. It only works once per rest, but that might be fine if you\n\t\tonly want to swing a weapon part time. If you take this to level 5 in a\n\t\tBard-heavy build, access to Lesser Restoration will let you fill in for most\n\t\tof the functions of a cleric, but it&#8217;s fine to stop at 3 if you&#8217;re more\n\t\tfocused on bard things.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Oath of Vengeance<\/strong>: Vow of Enmity provides easy Advantage,\n\t\tbut you only get it once per rest. That might be fine if you only want to\n\t\tswing a weapon part time. You also get Hunter&#8217;s Mark, which is decent but\n\t\tcompetes for your Concentration with a lot of other great buffs which may be\n\t\tmore impactful, especially with the Bard&#8217;s improved spellcasting compared to\n\t\tthe Paladin. If you go this route, the subclass features stop being\n\t\tinteresting for the Bardadin after level 3.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Oath of Glory \/ Oath of the Watchers<\/strong>: Both make good\n\t\tsupport options, so if you&#8217;re trying to build a supportive Defender, these\n\t\tare a good combination. But you&#8217;re basically only here for Channel Divinity,\n\t\tso consider stopping at paladin 3.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Oath of the Ancients<\/strong>: Ensnaring Strike is really good if\n\t\tyou have the Charisma to make the save DC reliable and the spell slots to\n\t\tkeep using it. Fortunately, bards have both. If you can hit a target early\n\t\tin a fight, you can effectively put them in time out while your party deals\n\t\twith the rest of the encounter. Sure, you could get the same spell from two\n\t\tlevels of ranger, but that&#8217;s not why we&#8217;re here. Ancients has several great\n\t\tpoints and you might go all the way up to paladin 7 for Aura of Warding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-the-whispering-vengeance-bardadin\">Example Build &#8211; The Whispering Vengeance Bardadin<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;I swear to all the gods, I&#8217;m going to smite you so hard right now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In this build, we&#8217;ll combine College of Whispers and Oath of Vengeance to\n\tcreate a high-damage crit fishing build. We&#8217;ll lean into College of Whispers\n\tto create a sort of infiltrator spy character. Our go-to tactic will be Vow of\n\tEnmity combined with Elven Accuracy to get a roughly 14% crit chance per\n\tattack, and then drop Psychic Blades and Divine Smite together on a crit for a\n\tbig pile of damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, Hold Person is a safer way to get crits, and we&#8217;re going to do that, too. But things with Legendary Resistances exist, and those things can&#8217;t stop us from crushing them under a pile of damage dice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For another example build, see <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/bardadin-punching-bag\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"16539\">Bardadin: The Portable Punching Bag<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Like other paladins, the Bardadin is MAD, requiring high stats in three ability scores. The Bard also has a smaller hit die than the Paladin, so you don&#8217;t have the staying power to tank as many hits as a typical paladin. This build is still primarily a caster, but with the ability to occasionally dive into melee and stab things for a huge pile of damage, so we&#8217;re going to focus primarily on Charisma and we&#8217;re going to build around Dexterity and light armor to support our skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to have to settle for poor Constitution so that we can get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/customization-options#Prerequisites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">enough Strength to multiclass<\/a> out of paladin. It&#8217;s frustrating, but we can compensate with magic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Custom Origin Half High Elf.

Piercer also gets us some extra damage output on a crit, further improving our terrifyingly high crit damage when we dive into melee.<br><br>DPR with Booming Blade initial damage, Advantage, Psychic Blades, and 4th-level Smite on crits: 28.20(Dexterity improved, piercer bonus damage die included, but reroll disregarded)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17 &#8211; Bard 13<\/td><td>Song of Rest (d10)<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>We also get 8th-level spell slots and 7th-level bard spells.<br><br>Yet again, no real standout spells here for our tactics. Teleport to get in or out before or after smite-botting someone is nice, but we also have an impossibly high Stealth modifier (18 Dex, Expertise, Pass Without Trace, possibly Enhance Ability) so maybe you&#8217;re fine with walking in and out of places.

Another level in bard gets us an ASI or a feat and another 5th-level spell slot. Another level in paladin gets us Extra Attack and access to 2nd-level paladin spells.<br><br>Extra Attack doubles our chances to crit (or increases it by 50% if you attempt two-weapon fighting), and that&#8217;s very tempting for a smite-bot, so let&#8217;s call that the default here.<br><br>DPR with Booming Blade initial damage, Advantage, Psychic Blades, and 4th-level Smite on crits: 36.05<br><br>DPR with Extra Attack, Advantage, Psychic Blades, and 4th-level Smite on crits: 42.97<br><br>That&#8217;s a pretty steep gap in DPR.<br><br>To get here however, we\u2019ve certainly made some sacrifices. In order to make our multiclass minimums, we\u2019ve chosen to leave our Constitution at 13 and never picked up the save proficiency, leaving us with a +1 for Concentration saves for our entire career. We could have continued until Paladin 6 and Aura of Protection would have at least compensated for that issue, but it would have cost the last improvement to Psychic Blades.<br><br>We\u2019ve also elected to go for Elven Accuracy and Finesse weapons instead of just wearing the Heavy Armor and using that Strength we needed to have for multiclassing anyway. This does let us crit more often, but following the unpredictability of critical hits can often result in wasting a Critical Psychic Smite on something that only has 1 hit point left. The build&#8217;s DPR relies on big, inconsistent damage spikes from crits, and those are just as likely to come at the end of a fight as they are at the beginning.<br><br>To summarize: The DPR looks really exciting, and the critical hits will feel very satisfying, but his build&#8217;s weapon attacks aren&#8217;t consistently reliable, and when you can&#8217;t count on your weapon attacks you&#8217;re reduced to a bard several levels behind the party. To make the build consistent, you need to rely heavily on Hold Monster, which doesn&#8217;t come online until most published campaigns have ended.<br><br>Still.

The Sorcadin held sway for a long time before being supplanted by the Hexadin as the go-to multiclass build. But while those two builds are certainly the most well-known paladin multiclass combos, there is another way: The Bardadin. The Bardadin doesn&#8217;t have the Sorcerer&#8217;s ability to melt high-level spell slots into efficient 1st-level smites, and they don&#8217;t have the Warlock&#8217;s ability to recharge their smites slots on a short rest, but Bard makes up for those capabilities with panache.
