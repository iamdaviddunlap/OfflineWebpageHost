While their skill options are often limited, Fighters excel in combat. They are durable, dangerous, and deeply customizable to suit a variety of playstyles. Fighters get more Weapon Mastery options, more attacks, and, thanks to Action Surge, they get more Actions than anyone else, making the Fighter a lot of fun to build and play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Fighters are a great example of &#8220;opt-in complexity&#8221; in DnD 5e. The core of the class is simple and resilient, but the complexity of the subclasses varies significantly. The Champion adds almost no complexity, but they&#8217;re still satisfying to play and nearly unstoppable at high levels. Subclasses like the Battle Master add substantial additional complexity, but can bring fantastic new tactical options. This makes the Fighter a great choice for players of all experience levels and for players with a broad range of preferences, allowing you to build a character that you find mechanically appealing without making it more work than you might like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Fighters excel as Defenders and Strikers, but can add additional roles depending on your build choices.  A bit of work allows the Fighter to also serve as a Face (Purple Dragon Knight) or Librarian (Eldritch Knight, Psi Warrior), and even with middling Charisma or Intelligence, you can use Tactical Mind to add 1d10 to your skill checks, easily making up the difference. You can also explore a role as a Scout if you&#8217;re built around Dexterity, allowing you to succeed with skills like Stealth and with tools like Thieves&#8217; Tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

See Fighting Styles under Feats, below, for help picking a Fighting Style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Second Wind<\/span>: A great way to keep yourself going in combat without begging spellcasters for help in combat. Be sure that you&#8217;ve used this at least once before each Short Rest to help conserve your Hit Point Dice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: Absolutely fantastic. Most martial classes get just 2 Weapon Mastery slots, but Fighters start with 3 and eventually get 6. Since the rules for weapon attacks allow you to draw or stow a weapon with each attack, you can rapidly switch between weapons to benefit from different Weapon Mastery options in quick succession.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that at level 9 you&#8217;ll get Tactical Master, which allows you to use Weapon Mastery even more flexibly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on Weapon Mastery, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/weapon-mastery\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"29315\">Weapon Mastery Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Action Surge<\/span>: A second Action can let you do a lot of things. In most cases, that&#8217;s going to be a second Attack action. You eventually get 3 uses per Short Rest, at which point you can comfortably use Action Surge at least once in every encounter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, two-weapon fighting builds don&#8217;t benefit from Action Surge as much as other builds. You don&#8217;t get a second Bonus Action, and even if you use a weapon with the Nick mastery, Nick says &#8220;You can make this extra attack only once per turn.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Action Surge explicitly prohibits the Magic action, you can&#8217;t use Action Surge to cast a spell, activate many magic items, and use many class features from other classes. The Eldritch Knight&#8217;s War Magic and Improved War Magic features notably bypass this because you&#8217;re not taking the Magic action to cast spells, but it&#8217;s not clear if this is intentional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Tactical Mind<\/span>: The Fighter generally has few good skill options, which makes it difficult for them to contribute outside of combat. This gives you a huge boost to ability checks a few times per day, allowing you to be effective will skills even if your modifier is relatively poor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Fighter subclasses are briefly summarized below. See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-fighter\/fighter-subclasses\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28269\">Fighter Subclasses Breakdown<\/a> for help selecting your subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Battle Master: Use powerful combat maneuvers to\n\t\tapply rider effects to your attacks, and use the same pool of resources to\n\t\tsupport skill checks outside of combat, allowing you to thrive both on and\n\t\toff the battlefield.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Champion: Do you like critical hits?

This isn&#8217;t quite Legendary Resistance, but, with your level as an added bonus, you&#8217;re very likely to succeed on any given saving throw. You eventually get up to 3 uses per Long Rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Tactical Master<\/span>: This massively expands what you can do with Weapon Mastery, allowing you to more easily benefit from multiple mastery options in quick succession. Having essentially permanent access to these masteries does mean that weapons with those masteries are less useful, so you may want to change weapons unless you have a magic weapon that you&#8217;re enjoying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>11. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Two Extra Attacks<\/span>: More attacks than anyone except the Monk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Studied Attacks<\/span>: Absolutely fantastic. With as many attacks as the Fighter gets, you&#8217;re bound to miss some, but Advantage on your next attack means that you&#8217;ll rarely miss two in a row. Combine this with a Vex weapon and you&#8217;ll have Advantage on every attack after the first whether you hit or miss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>20. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Three Extra Attacks<\/span>: 4 attacks is a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-fighter-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Fighter Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes to the Fighter were almost purely additive, so there are a lot of buffs here compared to the 2014 Fighter. The only thing lost was the ability to do magic with Action Surge, which almost never helped the Fighter anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Persuasion added to list of skill proficiency options<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Fighting Style. Fighting Styles are now feats, making them more broadly accessible. Fighters get 1 for free, and can change it each time they gain a level. Previously you were locked in permanently, which was frustrating in a game where you might find cool magic items that don\u2019t fit your Fighting Style.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Second Wind. Now 2 uses per Long Rest, and you get 1 back on a Short Rest. Uses per long rest improve with level. This allows you to use them sporadically as-needed throughout the day, rather than hoping that they\u2019ll be equally useful between each rest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Weapon Mastery. New.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Action Surge. Now prohibits the Magic action, so you can no longer use Action Surge to cast spells.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Tactical Mind. New. Spend Second Wind to add 1d10 to a failed ability check; retain the use of Second Wind if you still fail.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Tactical Shift. New. Move up to half your speed without Opportunity Attacks when you use Second Wind.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>9. Indomitable. The reroll now adds a bonus equal to your Fighter level, generally removing the frustration of rerolling and failing again.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>9. Tactical Master. New. Use the Push, Sap, or Slow Weapon Mastery with any weapon. This will make weapons that already have those masteries unappealing from level 9 onward.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11. Two Extra Attacks. Renamed. Thank god, they found a better name than \u201cExtra Attack 2\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>13. Studied Attacks. Advantage on your next attack against the same target when you miss. Removes the frustration of making numerous attacks and missing with all of them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Three Extra Attacks. Renamed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Fighter Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Increases to either Strength or Dexterity are absolutely required, and\n\tincreases to Constitution are helpful.
