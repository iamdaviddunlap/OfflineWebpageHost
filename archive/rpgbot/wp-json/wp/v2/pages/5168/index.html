They are adaptable, capable, and deeply customizable while only having a single major decision point (the &#8220;Rogue Racket&#8221;). While nearly all rogues will excel in stealth, thievery, and ambush tactics, the number of options which are both viable and interesting for the Rogue mean that you can build an effective rogue in a dizzying number of combinations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rogue&#8217;s primary role in the party is as a Scout and Striker, excelling in both evading notice and in detecting danger, and thanks to Sneak Attack the Rogue excels at ambush tactics and at quickly eliminating single targets. Thanks to their massive number of skills, Skill Increases, and Skill Feats, the Rogue can serve their party in a number of skill-based roles, including as a Librarian and as a Face. They can dip their toe into a Defender role with the Ruffian Racket, but due to the Rogue&#8217;s 8+ hit points this is likely not a good choice unless you have another Defender in the party to assist you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Rogue Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Rogue Rackets<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities-mastermind\">Mastermind<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities-ruffian\">Ruffian<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities-scoundrel\">Scoundrel<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities-thief\">Thief<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Rogue-feats\">Rogue Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Rogue-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Rogue-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ruffian-weapons\">Ruffian Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-armor-runes\">Armor Property Runes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-weapon-runes\">Weapon Property Runes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-talismans\">Talismans<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Rogue Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: By default, your Key Ability is Dexterity. However, your Racket may allow you to choose a different ability. This can make rogues exceptionally diverse, but it also means that you need to plan out your characters options right from level 1 because emphasizing the wrong ability score can make a lot of options less effective. In many cases Dexterity will still be your best option, so if your Racket offers other options you may still not want to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+ hit points is hard if\n\tyou&#8217;re in melee. The Rogue is not a front-line Defender by any means, even if\n\tyou go for the Ruffian Racket to get medium armor. Be sure to pad your hit\n\tpoints with high Constitution and strongly consider Toughness if you plan to\n\tfight in melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: Rogues are the\n\tuncontested master of skills and Perception, but they have limited weapon and\n\tarmor options.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span>: The best Perception\n\t\tprogression in the game. You should still put some Ability Boosts into\n\t\tWisdom because it&#8217;s so important.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: The best Reflex saves in\n\t\tthe game and average Will saves, but the worst Fortitude saves in the game\n\t\t(seriously, the Rogue matches the Wizard).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 8+int skills, plus one\n\t\tore more from you Rogue&#8217;s Racket.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attacks<\/span>: Simple weapons plus a tiny\n\t\thandful of martial options. Your proficiency improves at the same rate as\n\t\tmartial classes like the Barbarian, but your weapon options are much more\n\t\tlimited.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Only light armor, but the\n\t\tRogue is totally dependent on Dexterity, so light armor is your best option\n\t\tanyway. The Ruffian is an exception, and they get medium armor as well.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class DC<\/span>: Only the Druid has a worse\n\t\tClass DC progression, which is disappointing because the Rogue has several\n\t\tinteresting options that depend on the class DC, including core class\n\t\tfeatures like Master Strike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue Racket<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Rogue Rackets&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span>: This brings the damage for a\n\trapier or short sword up to match the damage from a greatsword, and the extra\n\tdamage from Sneak Attack increases at roughly the same levels where players\n\tare expected to add Runes of Striking to their weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Surprise Attack<\/span>: Making enemies flat-footed\n\tcan be done in a wide variety of ways, but having enemies flat-footed in round\n\tone allows you to start the fight with a flurry of Sneak Attack damage without\n\tneeding to rush into position to flank enemies and without waiting for your\n\tallies to shuffle into position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue Feats<\/strong>: See Rogue feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skill Feats<\/span>: Rogues get one at every\n\tlevel.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skill Increases<\/span>: Rogues get one at every\n\tlevel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deny Advantage<\/span>: There is a huge number of\n\tways to make a creature Flat-Footed, and Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s encounter balancing\n\trules are written so that facing a single creature of the party&#8217;s level is\n\tunusual. Most of the time you&#8217;ll face multiple foes below your level. In\n\teither case, Deny Advantage applies. If you&#8217;re fighting something above your\n\tlevel, it&#8217;s a significant threat and you need to be exceptionally cautious\n\tanyway.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Tricks<\/span>: Better attack bonus is always\n\tgreat, and you can apply Critical Specialization effects whenever you score a\n\tcritical hit with a weapon which meats the same requirements as Sneak Attack.\n\tThe Ruffian has had that capability since 1st level, but it&#8217;s great that\n\teveryone else gets it too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Reflex saves are the most common\n\ttype of &#8220;Basic Save&#8221;, and often Basic Saves are the ones where the difference\n\tbetween a Success and a Critical Success is the most significant. This will\n\tprotect from a lot of damage from area effects like fireballs and breath\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilant Senses<\/span>: The best Perception\n\tprogression in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: Since your\n\tProficiency with weapons improves at the same rate as martial class like the\n\tBarbarian and the Champion, you&#8217;ll start at the +3 bonus in most cases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Debilitating Strike<\/span>: The default effects\n\taren&#8217;t great, but they add a little extra something for free when you hit a\n\tFlat-Footed target. You can also enhance Debilitating Strike with class feats\n\tlike Critical Debilitation, and you&#8217;ll pick up Double Debilitation at 15th\n\tlevel to make this even more effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span>: Better saving throws is\n\talways great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue Expertise<\/span>: The second-worst class DC\n\tprogression of any class with a Class DC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Evasion<\/span>: Great for all the same\n\treasons that Evasion is great. Taking half damage on a failure means that a\n\tFailure and a Success on a Basic Save are functionally identical.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Senses<\/span>: The best Perception\n\tprogression in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Light armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Tricks<\/span>: More attack bonus is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Double Debilitation<\/span>: By this level you&#8217;ve\n\thad ample opportunity to pick up class feats to improve Debilitating Strike.\n\tIf you&#8217;ve done that (and you should), this is fantastic. If you haven&#8217;t, this\n\tis borderline worthless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More\n\tdamage!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slippery Mind<\/span>: Your Will save progression is\n\troughly average, but any imrovement is welcome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Armor Mastery<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Strike<\/span>: Your Class DC improves (very\n\timportant), and you get a new Free Action which you can apply when hit a\n\tFlat-Footed target. Because of the way Free Actions work, you can&#8217;t combine\n\tthis with Debilitating Strike, but this is considerably better and you can use\n\tDebilitating Strike as a follow-up with additional attacks if the target\n\tsucceeds on their save. This is good enough that you should start every\n\tencounter by trying this once on every enemy in the encounter. Paralysis for 4\n\trounds will take creatures out of most fights for their duration, and if the\n\ttarget gets a Critical Failure you can outright kill them (or knock them\n\tunconscious for two hours if you need them alive for some reason).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Rogue Rackets<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"eldritch-trickster\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Eldritch Trickster<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eldritch Trickster&#8217;s spellcasting options are impressively versatile, allowing you to select any spellcasting class which offers the appropriate multiclass archetype feats as the basis for your subclass. The Wizard is a classic dating back to early editions of Dungeons and Dragons, and has long been the default for rogue\/spellcaster builds (typically called an &#8220;Arcane Trickster&#8221; in every edition of Dungeons and Dragons, and even in Pathfinder 1e), but if you want to explore something exotic like the Druid that&#8217;s totally fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Charisma-based spellcasting class is typically your best bet for the class that gives you your magic. Since multiclass archetype feats give you one to two spell slots of each spell level, you&#8217;ll want Innate Spellcasting to pad your magic options, and Innate Spells are nearly always based on your Charisma. Your choice of Ancestry is absolutely crucial here, so look at options like the Elf, the Gnome, and the Kobold. If you&#8217;re fine doing without innate spellcasting (or with limiting those spells to buffs and utility spells), you can absolutely get away with any spellcasting class that you like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with all of the above possibilities in mind, the Eldritch Trickster is conceptually exciting but mechanically underwhelming. Other subclasses get significant mechanical changes to the way the class works. The Eldritch Trickster gets one free Multiclass Dedication feat, and you can take Magical Trickster two levels early. Level 1 is going to absolutely suck, and you still need to put class feats into your multiclass archetype to get more spellcasting, adding a feat tax which other rogue subclasses don&#8217;t face unless you&#8217;re somehow happy with only the most basic spellcasting. You also still need to follow the usual rule of taking two feats from one multiclass archetype before you can pick up another archetype, so multiclassing is unusually difficult for the Eldritch Trickster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expectation is that you&#8217;re going to take Magical Trickster and attack using spells. The scaling damage on cantrips makes that an appealing option, but you&#8217;ll need to work to make enemies flat-footed since flanking won&#8217;t be as easy and shouting verbal components makes stealth difficult. You may fare better at low levels by relying on weapons, and you might prefer to stick to weapons for your whole career. But at that point, play a Thief and take the Minor Magic Class Feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, that&#8217;s a good idea. Play a Thief, take the Minor Magic Class Feat, and take whatever multiclass feats you need to get the spellcasting that you want. That&#8217;s almost certainly going to produce a more effective character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a quick fix, this whole archetype would shoot up to\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span> or possibly\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Blue<\/span> if you got some of the spellcasting\n\tadvancement feats from your multiclass archetype for free. I&#8217;d settle for the\n\tBasic and Expert feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mastermind\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mastermind<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to lean heavily on Recall Knowledge and knowledge skills like Arcana and Occultism, Mastermind is an interesting choice. Mastermind can use Recall Knowledge to make foes Flat-Footed against your attacks, allowing you to make them Flat-Footed at range and without worrying about things like trying to Feint a creature with a high Perception DC. Counting on a Critical Success is hard, but in the rare cases where it happens you suddenly get a massive action economy advantage over other rogues because you&#8217;re not spending an Action every turn to Step into flanking position, to Feint, or to do whatever else you might to do in order to qualify for Sneak Attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your party lacks another high-Intelligence character such as a wizard, the Mastermind is a welcome addition to the party. Recall Knowledge can provide helpful tactical insights, and combined with other effects like the Ranger&#8217;s Monster Hunter feat tree and the Automatic Knowledge feat, you can make it a very powerful tool beyond just enabling Sneak Attack. The Mastermind&#8217;s high Intelligence will give you abundant Trained skills at first level, allowing you to explore more skills than most rogues even with the Rogue&#8217;s already impressive number of Skill Increases and Skill Feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ruffian\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ruffian<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ruffian allows you to effectively build a burly, strong rogue. If you couldn&#8217;t decide between the Fighter and the Rogue, the Ruffian is a happy middle ground. Ruffians don&#8217;t get a built-in way to make enemies Flat-footed, so expect to rely on Athletics to Trip enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ruffian has the option to choose Strength as their key ability score. If you want to use weapons that lack the Finesse trait, you also get the ability to deal Sneak Attack damage with simple weapons that lack Agile or Finesse, including options like maces and longspears. You gain access to Critical Specialization Effects when using simple weapons (allowing you to us them 4 levels before other rogyes), adding an extra motivation to use simple weapons over a short sword or a rapier, which would otherwise still be among your best options. You&#8217;re limited to weapons that use d8 or smaller damage dice, which unfortunately rules out the Heavy Crossbow, but you can use weapon familiarity eats from your Ancestry to make additional weapons Simple Weapons for you, thereby expanding your weapon options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruffians also add medium armor proficiency, and the proficiency will keep pace with the Rogue&#8217;s proficiency with Light Armor. This allows you get around with as little as 12 Dexterity, but your armor&#8217;s Check Penalty applies to important skills like Stealth, so if you can manage high enough Dexterity you may still prefer light armor. You never get Armor Specialization Effects, so using light armor instead of medium armor is no great loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Ruffian is Trained in Intimidation for free. Intimidation is a crucial Face skill, and with a little bit of Charisma and some Skill Feats you can turn it into a useful combat option too. the Ruffian is less dependent on Agile weapons than other rogues, so Multiple Attack Penalties can be a problem, which makes your third Action in a turn bad for attacking but great for Demoralize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"scoundrel\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Scoundrel<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scoundrel is all about being deceptive, rather than being sneaky. You&#8217;ll see a scoundrel right in front of you, but that doesn&#8217;t make them any less dangerous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curiously, the Scoundrel also makes a good multiclassed spellcaster due to their ability to make Charisma their Key Ability Score. Expect to multiclass into Bard and\/or Sorcerer, and look at feats like Minor Magic and Magical Trickster. The Scoundrel is also unusually effective with Innate Spellcasting since Innate Spellcasting is Charisma-based by default.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scoundrels get unique ability which makes Feint dramatically more effective. If you succeed on a Feint, you get the Critical Success effect. If you critically succeed, the target is Flat-Footed against <em>all<\/em> attacks until the end of your next turn. Both results offer ample opportunity for you to deal Sneak Attack. However, Feint requires that the target be in your reach, which can be hard if you want to use ranged weapons or if you want to rely on spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scoundrels are Trained in both Deception and Diplomacy, making them a great option for your party&#8217;s Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"thief\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Thief<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Thief is the closest thing to a &#8220;default&#8221; rogue. They&#8217;re heavily dependent on Dexterity, even using it to replace Strength on their weapon damage with Finesse weapons. The Thief is trained in Thievery, giving you one of the Rogue&#8217;s most essential skills for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its simplicity, the Thief should not be overlooked. It has the fewest and the simplest Racket-specific feats, but the options are nearly always effective and easy to rely upon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"abilities-eldritch-trickster\">Eldritch Trickster<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eldritch Trickster <em>may<\/em> (not must, but may) choose to make their spellcasting ability their Key Ability Score. If you do so, consider the advice here. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll likely do well by following the advice under Thief, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting your spellcasting class is the most crucial part of determing your ability scores since the class you pick will choose your spellcasting ability score, which will then determing which other ability scores make senss to put Boosts into. You&#8217;ll need to cut something no matter what you do, so pick whichever option best supports your role within the party and your vision for your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Intelligence-based class like the Wizard will give you more skills at level 1 and makes you effective with skills like Arcana and Crafting, helping you to craft items like alchemical tools and even magic items. A Wisdom-based class like the Cleric makes you good at Perception and at skills like Medicine and Religion, helping you to provide inexpensive healing and other solutions often provided by spellcasters. A Charisma-based class like the Sorcerer makes you effective with Face skills like Deception and Diplomacy, helping you explore options like Bon Mot and Demoralize, and making it easier to expand your spellcasting with Innate Spellcasting from your Ancestry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Spells don&#8217;t care about your\n\tStrength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Still crucial for your AC and many of\n\tyour most important skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Always important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Int<\/span>: See above.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Wis<\/span>: See above.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Cha<\/span>: See above.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities-mastermind\">Mastermind<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While Dexterity is absolutely crucial for the Mastermind, just as it is for most rogues, it may make sense to make Intelligence your Key Ability Score rather than Dexterity. The loss of attack bonus from your Dexterity modifier being one point lower is offset by making foes Flat-Footed when you use Recall Knowledge, and having a lightly higher Intelligence will help with Recall Knowledge so that it&#8217;s easier to make foes Flat-Footed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Intelligence only covers half of the four knowledge skills (Arcana and Occultism), so your other knowledge skills (Nature and Religion) won&#8217;t be as realiable, so you&#8217;ll want your Dexterity high to make sure that your attacks work even when Recall Knowledge isn&#8217;t as reliable as you want it to be. If you increase Nature and Religion before putting Skill Increases into Arcana and Occultism, you can keep all four skills roughly even, which might negate the minor numerical issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all of that sounds frustrating and confusing, that&#8217;s totally fine. Just make Dexterity your Key Ability Score and keep Intelligence and Wisdom roughly even and you&#8217;ll be totally fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Take a little bit for extra damage\n\twith your attacks unless you plan to use crossbows or spells in combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Defines your attacks, your AC, and many\n\tof your most important non-knowledge skills. Making Dexterity your Key Ability\n\tScore is probably both the easiest and best option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Always important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Possibly your Key Ability Score.\n\tYou&#8217;ll get additional skills at level 1 and bonuses with Arcana and\n\tOccultism.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Nature and Religion are both\n\tWisdom-based skills which you&#8217;ll need for Recall Knowledge, and Perception\n\tremains absolutely crucial.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Necessary for Face skills, but you\n\tmay need to dump it in order to focus elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities-ruffian\">Ruffian<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Ruffian looks very similar to the Fighter in a lot of ways.

You get Low-Light Vision and\n\tDarkvision is an option with the Cavern Elf Heritage, and the Elf&#8217;s Ancestry\n\tFeats offer a lot of really great options. Ancestral Longevity further\n\tincreases the Rogue&#8217;s superiotity with skills, and Otherworldly Magic offers\n\taccess to cantrips without spending Class Feats on Minor Magic or on a\n\tmulticlass archetype. As you gain levels, you gain access to Ancestry Feat\n\toptions which improve your ability to use Perception to search for traps, and\n\tallow you to Step more than 5 feet in a single action, both of which can be\n\tvery helpful for the Rogue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Constitution and Charisma are great, especially for a scoundrel, and a\n\tStrength Flaw is only a problem if you wanted to play a Ruffian and make\n\tStrength your Key Ability Score.

You get\n\tlow-light vision by default, and Darkvision is an option with Umbral Gnome.\n\tFor a rogue interested in spellcasting, spells are available from severale\n\theritage options, as well as from the Fey World Magic feat chain, and with\n\tAnimal Accomplice you can even get a familiar!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Goblin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Dextertity and Charisma are a great start, and your get Darkvision by\n\tdefault.

Many of the Ancestry Feats are excellent, too. Goblin\n\tWeapon Familiarity makes the Dogslicer and the Horsechopper Simple Weapons for\n\tyou, making the Dogslicer an interesting alternative to the Short Sword, but\n\tremember that it&#8217;s only for the purposes of proficiency, so even ruffians\n\tcan&#8217;t use horsechoppers with Sneak Attack since they&#8217;re not actually simple\n\tweapons.

The biggest problem is that you don&#8217;t get Low-Light Vision (though it&#8217;s\n\tavailable with the Twilight Halfling Heritage), and Darkvision isn&#8217;t an\n\toption. However, the Halfling still has several excellent feat options.\n\tHalfling Weapon Familiarity makes the Filcher&#8217;s Fork and the Halfling Sling\n\tStaff Simple Weapons, making the Dagger, the Rapier, and the Short Sword\n\tobsolete by combining all of their most important traits on a single weapon\n\tthat you can also use as a cooking implement. The Distracting Shadows feat\n\tchain is great if you plan to fight at range or if you spend a lot of time in\n\tcrowded cities, and Halfling Luck is literally always good. However, Adopted\n\tAncestry makes Ancestry Feats accessible to other races, so the Halfling&#8217;s\n\tbiggest appeal is easily accessible to other races with the ability to see in\n\tthe dark.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Despite lacking Low-Light Vision or Darkvision by default, the Human is\n\tstill a great option.

Two\n\tFlexible Ability Boosts is probably plenty, but you could easily use the\n\tOptional Flaw rules to get a third if you really want it.

Planting evidence on someone\n\t\t\tis something that takes a lot of forethought to actually make it matter,\n\t\t\tand you&#8217;re not going to do that often enough to justify the feat cost.\n\t\t\tYour best bet is to use this to plant explosive or poisons on the target\n\t\t\twhich you can somehow trigger later.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tumble Behind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: In a one-on-one fight this is a great substitute for Feint since it uses\n\t\ta Dexterity-based skill. Most rogues use Dexterity at their Key Ability\n\t\tScore, and not needing Feint makes it easier to dump Charisma. It also helps\n\t\tyou safely get into positiong to flank the target, reducing or removing the\n\t\tneed to use Tumble Through again until you&#8217;ve eliminated the target.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trap Finder<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design.

Your second attack will still suffer the Multiple\n\t\tAttack Penalty, so recommend making your secon attack with an Agile weapon.\n\t\tFlat-footed reduces the target&#8217;s AC by -2, so you&#8217;re effectively only taking\n\t\t-2 if your second attack is with an Agile weapon. You might instead prefer\n\t\tto use the Feint Action and make a single attack. This uses the same number\n\t\tof Actions and won&#8217;t have a Mutliple Attack Penalty on your attack, but it\n\t\talso has an extra point of failure (the Deception check) and you don&#8217;t have\n\t\ta chance to hit twice.

Turning your Reaction into movement is a great trade in many cases,\n\t\tbut it&#8217;s not always necessary and it&#8217;s hard to gamble on a critical hit.\n\t\tThis isn&#8217;t useful often enough to justify a class feat.

This proficiency never improves, so\n\t\tstay away from attack options unless you&#8217;re building an Eldritch Trickster.\n\t\tInstead, stick to defensive options like Shield, buff options like Guidance,\n\t\tand utility options like Prestidigitation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mobility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Makes Stepping obsolete.

If you do take\n\t\tthis, plan to retrain it when you get Precise Debilitations: Precise\n\t\tDebilitations provides the same effect and doesn&#8217;t require a critical\n\t\thit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Underhanded Assault<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: There is some buried complexity here because using this feat involves\n\t\tboth the Stride and Sneak actions, Reactions, the Flat-Footed, Hidden, and\n\t\tUndetected conditions, and of course the Stealth skill.\n\t\t<p>At it&#8217;s most basic, you use this feat to expend 2 Actions to Stride half\n\t\t\tyour speed and then Strike. So it&#8217;s a slightly less than even trade in\n\t\t\tterms of Actions if you just want to Stride and then Strike. However,\n\t\t\tdepending on the results of your Stealth check you can get some exciting\n\t\t\tbenefits, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re here for.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The first Action which you take with this feat is the Sneak Action. This\n\t\t\tallows you to Stride half your speed and make a Stealth check at the end\n\t\t\tof your movement. With Underhanded Assault you can do this even if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tcurrently observed by the creature, but you do make this check with a -2\n\t\t\tpenalty. As far as I can tell, the other normal rules for Sneak apply. If\n\t\t\tyou roll a Success on the Stealth check you&#8217;re Undetected by the creature\n\t\t\t(you can also make a melee Strike which we&#8217;ll discuss below), but I think\n\t\t\tthat goes away at the end of the Underhanded Assault Activity unless you\n\t\t\twould be able to hide normally. If you roll a Failure, you&#8217;re Hidden\n\t\t\tinstead, so the creature may be able to take Reactions such as Attack of\n\t\t\tOpportunity, but they do get a DC 11 Flat Check to automatically miss you\n\t\t\t(effectively a 50% chance to miss you automatically).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you succeed on your Stealth check, you get to make one melee Strike.\n\t\t\tSince you&#8217;re Unobserved by the target, it&#8217;s automatically Flat-Footed\n\t\t\tagainst your Strike, allowing you to deliver Sneak Attack. Making the\n\t\t\tStrike reveals your location, but since you&#8217;re now in melee with the\n\t\t\ttarget you&#8217;re almost certainly revealed anyway.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Taken as a whole, this is a good feat for melee builds who are going\n\t\t\tall-in on Stealth. You&#8217;re essentially gambling your second Action with\n\t\t\tUnderhanded Assault, so unless you can reliably pass Stealth checks this\n\t\t\tis probably too risky to use. I would take this on a hief and on\n\t\t\tsimilarly-built rogues, but for other Rackets I would likely look\n\t\t\telsewhere.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Rogue-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battle Assessment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Pathfinder has a dizzying number of creatures, and their strengths and\n\t\tweaknesses aren&#8217;t always obvious. Knowing even one of a creature&#8217;s\n\t\tweaknesses can dramaticaly change how well a fight goes for your party.\n\t\tUnfortunately, the characters most likely to benefit from this are\n\t\tspellcasters; even if an enemy is weak to bludgeoning damage you&#8217;re unlikely\n\t\tto drop your +2 greater striking rapier in favor of a nonmagical club.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dread Striker<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Extremely easy to rely upon if there is even one person in the party\n\t\tbuilt to use Intimidation.

Ruffians do even better because they can\n\t\tafford to invest in Strength and in weapons with the Shove trait. Shove the\n\t\ttarget prone, hit them with Head Stomp, and your entire party can capitalize\n\t\ton the target&#8217;s AC penalty for a full round. The more allies you have who\n\t\trely on Strikes, the better this gets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reactive Pursuit<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Keeping an enemy in melee is great, especially since the Rogue doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tget something like Attack of Opportunity. However, be cautious with this: If\n\t\tan enemy is running back to the comparable safety of wherever its allies are\n\t\tstanding you may find yourself standing in the middle of a bunch of hostile\n\t\tcreatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sabotage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magical Trickster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Your proficiency with the cantrips granted by Minor Magic never improves,\n\t\tso the only way to make this meaningful is if you&#8217;re using Archetypes to\n\t\timprove your spellcasting.

Many enemies either don&#8217;t rely on equipment or won&#8217;t be\n\t\tcarrying items which matter to them in combat. If they have things like\n\t\tpotions, wands, or alchemical items this will cause them a lot of trouble,\n\t\tbut those items are a rarity in game where humanoid enemies are typically a\n\t\tminority. Trolls and dragons typically don&#8217;t care if you try to pick their\n\t\tnonexistent pockets. But if your game features humanoid or near-humanoid\n\t\tenemies (intelligent undead, fey, etc.) which frequently use items, this may\n\t\tbe a useful option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Poison is a complicated mechanic, and this is a great way to get into it.\n\t\tThe free damage poisons are nice, but their damage is negligible and using\n\t\tone in combat will generally be a waste of an Action, so your best bet is to\n\t\tpoison a weapon immediately before ambushing an enemy. If you have the first\n\t\tprinting of the Core Rulebook, errata has clarified the wording of the feat:\n\t\tyou need a free hand to draw a poison and apply it to a weapon, so if you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing two weapons or a shield or something you&#8217;ll need to drop it. If you\n\t\twant to use this, strongly consider spending class feats to multiclass into\n\t\tAlchemist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Predictable<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Most creatures aren&#8217;t proficient in Deception, so expect to use the Hard\n\t\tDC option most of the time. A Hard DC is very achievable if your Wisdom is\n\t\tdecent, especially since the Rogue gets the best Perception progression in\n\t\tthe game. Unfortunately, the AC bonus is worse than just using Raise a\n\t\tShield or a weapon with the Parry trait, so you&#8217;re mostly only here for the\n\t\tbonus to a saving throw against the target. Even then, I don&#8217;t know if\n\t\tgambling an Action for a possible +1\/+2 bonus is worth the cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scout&#8217;s Warning<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is great for most characters, but it&#8217;s not always a great option for\n\t\tthe Rogue. You can use Stealth for Initiative checks if you&#8217;re hiding when\n\t\tcombat starts, and since your Stealth bonus will almost certainly exceed\n\t\tyour Perception bonus, you want to do that whenever possible. If you do\n\t\tthat, you&#8217;re actively working to invalidate the the function of this feat. I\n\t\twould take this feat on literally any character who isn&#8217;t trying to be\n\t\tstealthy. It&#8217;s great for many characters multiclassing into the Rogue, but\n\t\trogues should probably avoid it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Harder They Fall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: The bonus damage is small, but still welcome for the Ruffian since they\n\t\toften rely on Trip to makes for Flat-Footed. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s rare for\n\t\tyour foes to already be Flat-Footed before you Trip them, so you&#8217;ll rarely\n\t\tbe able to add Sneak Attack damage. Since The Harder They Fall&#8217;s damage only\n\t\tscales by means of your Sneak Attack damage scaling, that means that you&#8217;ll\n\t\trarely get more than the 1d6 bonus damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Twin Distraction<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Situational.

Unless you roll a Critical Success when you use Recall Knowledge\n\t\tagainst the target, you&#8217;re going to spend an Action every turn to Recall\n\t\tKnowledge in order to make the target Flat-Footed against your attacks. That\n\t\tleaves you two Actions, and one is going to be a Strike. You could make a\n\t\tsecond Strike, but the target likely won&#8217;t be Flat-Footed, so you&#8217;re giving\n\t\tup Sneak Attack. Instead, you can use Analyze Weakness to double dour bonus\n\t\tdamage from Sneak Attack. That means that you&#8217;re spending 3 Actions to make\n\t\ta single high-damage Strike, so it&#8217;s high risk, but if you hit you&#8217;re\n\t\tdealing a mountain of damage.\n\t\t<p>For non-mastermind rogues (and for masterminds who managed a Critical\n\t\t\tSuccess to Recall Knowledge against the target), this can be a more\n\t\t\treliable damage option than making three Strikes in a turn. Even with an\n\t\t\tAgile weapon, the -8 Multiple Attack Penalty is crippling, and applying\n\t\t\tAnalyze Weakness is a more reliable damage bonus, provided that the target\n\t\t\tis already Flat-Footed. You can apply this to any Sneak Attack made during\n\t\t\tthe same turn, so if you use Analyze Weakness and then make two Strikes\n\t\t\tyou have two chances to apply the damage bonus.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anticipate Ambush<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: This feat isn&#8217;t formatted or worded especially well.

Unfortunately, you can only use on Exploration Activity at\n\t\ta time (with some exceptions to that rule, but those don&#8217;t matter for the\n\t\tpurposes of this feat), and both Avoid Notice and Scout are more effective.\n\t\tAvoid Notice allows you to roll Stealth for initiative, and for most rogues\n\t\tthat means that you&#8217;re going to have a higher bonus to initiative than you\n\t\twould with Perception. Scout gives your entire party a +1 bonus to\n\t\tinitiative even if your enemies don&#8217;t surprise you. Sure, Anticipate\n\t\tAmbush&#8217;s -2 penalty to your enemies is larger than Scout&#8217;s +1 bonus, but\n\t\tScout applies to every encounter while Anticipate Ambush only applies to\n\t\tambushes, which are typically infrequent. Unless your GM absolutely loves\n\t\tambushes, this feat is not useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gang Up<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A tempting crutch if you&#8217;re fighting in melee and having trouble making\n\t\tenemies Flat-Footed by other means, but if you can&#8217;t make enemies\n\t\tFlat-Footed by other means you may need to reconsider how you&#8217;re playing\n\t\tyour rogue. There are tons of great options, and you need to have at least\n\t\tone that can rely on consistently that doesn&#8217;t require you to wait for an\n\t\tally to stumble into melee. That said, this mgiht still be an important\n\t\toption if you&#8217;re using a reach weapon, and if you have numberous allies\n\t\tfighting in melee this could allow you to quickly change targets to spread\n\t\teffects like Debilitating Strike without needing to constantly move between\n\t\ttargets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Far Throw<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: If Strong Arm isn&#8217;t enough, you need to either switch to a bow move\n\t\tcloser.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Light Step<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, and you can frequently deal with difficult terrain by\n\t\tjumping over it or by moving somewhere else.

Choosing to Step out of melee\n\t\tafter you&#8217;ve finish attacking means that enemies are often forced to spend\n\t\ttheir own Action to follow you or to attack one of your allies instead, such\n\t\tas your party&#8217;s Defender who is better suited to endure those attacks. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re fighting using a ranged weapon, this allows you to safely move out of\n\t\treach without cutting into your attacks, making this a crucial option if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re forced into melee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Twist the Knife<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Not nearly enough damage to justify spending an Action. If you want\n\t\tPersistent Bleed damage, use the Critical Specialization effect with a\n\t\tweapon in the Knife category. It will deal more damage, it won&#8217;t require you\n\t\tto spend an Action, and you get acces to Critical Specialization effects at\n\t\t5th level which trigger against the same targets which Twist the Knife\n\t\tapplies to. Admittedly you need to deal a Critical Hit, but I still don&#8217;t\n\t\tthink Twist the Knife is worth a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Watch Your back<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: This is not a good feat on its own, but in a party which likes stacking\n\t\tfear effects it can be worthwhile. You have few options to capitalize on the\n\t\tpenalty to the target&#8217;s Will DC on your own, and most of them are from the\n\t\tIntimidate skill. Demoralize is your go-to at low levels, and Scare to Death\n\t\tworks at high levels, but both of those options require the exact same check\n\t\tas Watch Your Back so there&#8217;s basically no reason to spend the Action on\n\t\tWatch Your Back.\n\t\t<p>If you have allies who rely on fear effects (other Demoralize users,\n\t\t\tspellcasters who like fear spells, etc.), the 1-minute duration can put\n\t\t\tyou at a mathematicaly advantage for the duration of the encounter. If\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re in such a party, in many fights it&#8217;s smart to spend your first turn\n\t\t\tusing Watch Your Back and Demoralize to get enemies set up to suffer more\n\t\t\tserious fear effects produced by your allies. This produces amuzing mental\n\t\t\timages of rogues popping out of hiding places to jeer at their foes and\n\t\t\twarn of impending doom before your party&#8217;s spellcasters start dropping\n\t\t\tmagical nightmares into the encounter.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Rogue-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blind-Fight<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a very well-written feat.

This is a great option if you don&#8217;t have Low-Light\n\t\tVision or Darkvision because it makes you more effective in poor light\n\t\tconditions, and it&#8217;s a lifesaver if you&#8217;re facing invisible enemies and\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have magical options to counter invisibility.

Unfortunately the value of feat scales linearly based on the\n\t\tsize of your party, so if your party is you and two others you&#8217;ll get much\n\t\tless benefit than if you have four other player characters in the party.\n\t\tGenerally minions like Animal Companions won&#8217;t be impactful enough to\n\t\tjustify one of the four slots, but if you have spaces it may come down to\n\t\tthe pet or leaving a slot unused.\n\t\t<p>The wording isn&#8217;t perfectly clear, but I think the RAI is that you can\n\t\t\tonly use this on four allies each day, rather than targeting groups of\n\t\t\tfour allies 10 minutes at a time. Consult your GM.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Loaner Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Allowing you to cast a spell of up to 3rd level is good. You can use\n\t\tself-targeting spells which your allies can&#8217;t cast upon you, or you could\n\t\tuse it for spell attacks, or to get buffs or area control spells running\n\t\tearly in a fight. But you need to have an allied spellcaster who prepare\n\t\tspells rather than using a Spell Repertoire, and they need to be willing to\n\t\tdonate a spell slot to make this feat work. That can be a really big ask. If\n\t\tyou can make it happen, the spell&#8217;s DC and attack modifier will be good\n\t\twithout investing heavily in spellcasting via multiclass archetype feats.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<p>You also need to compare this to other ways to get the ability to cast a\n\t\t\t3rd-level spell. If you just want one spell per day, a wand will suffice.\n\t\t\tIf you need to change the spell from time to time, scrolls will suffice.\n\t\t\tIf you want the ability to change the spells or cast more spells, two\n\t\t\tfeats to take a multiclass dedication feat and the basic spellcasting feat\n\t\t\tfor the same class will get you two cantrips and leveled spells at levels\n\t\t\t1, 2, and 3, so for double the cost to you (and no cost to your allies)\n\t\t\tyou can get considerably more spellcasting. Your save DCs and spell\n\t\t\tattacks won&#8217;t scale automatically with your class DC, and your spell\n\t\t\toptions may be more limited than if you borrowed a spell from an ally, but\n\t\t\tif you stick to buffs and utility options you&#8217;ll probably find that the\n\t\t\tbenefits are worth the trade.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nimble Roll<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This does two things: First, it allows you to take a Reaction to get a +2\n\t\tCircumstance bonus on Reflex saves (see Nimble Dodge).

If\n\t\tthey&#8217;re already flat-footed, you can deal an extra 2d6 damage, which isn&#8217;t\n\t\tconceptually exciting but it&#8217;s a bunch of extra damage so it&#8217;s always useful\n\t\teven when your other Debilitating Strike options might not be.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sneak Savant<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Take Assurance with Stealth instead.

If you hit, the target makes a Reflex Save against your\n\t\tClass DC (the Rogue has a poor Class DC progressin). If the target fails the\n\t\tsave, they fall but they&#8217;re not harmed by the fall. This is ineffective,\n\t\tunreliable, and unimpressive.

Inspired\n\t\tStratagem, Nimble Dodge, and No Escape all qualify, but those are rarely so\n\t\timpactful that you need to do two of them (or the same one twice) in the\n\t\tsame round, and spending an Action to guess when you <em>might<\/em> want to\n\t\tuse two Reactions is a terrible gamble.

Getting into the stance in order to\n\t\tenable you to Feint at horrifyingly short range (again: you need to use the\n\t\t&#8220;listed range increment&#8221; and you&#8217;re probably using a daggger) costs an\n\t\tAction, plus the Action to Feint. So the feat cost is high, the action\n\t\teconomy is bad, and benefits are mediocre. Get into melee and feint or look\n\t\tfor a way to hide or some other way to make the target Flat-Footed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spring from the Shadows<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Similar to Sudden Charge.

However, it requires that they be in reach of the target, that they\n\t\thaven&#8217;t used their Reaction already, and that you score a Critical Hit to\n\t\ttrigger this. Even then, your ally might prefer to not use their Reaction\n\t\tthis way because it removes the deterrent against your enemy moving away\n\t\tfrom your and your ally.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sense the Unseen<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Hopefully by this level your party has plenty of options for handling\n\t\tinvisible enemies, but if they don&#8217;t this is a good fallback.

That makes it difficult to steal a spell\n\t\tand use it to good effect, especially since you likely have no way to know\n\t\twhat spell you stole.\n\t\t<p>It may actually be your best bet to simply let the spell expire and\n\t\t\tcontinue to repeatedly use Steal Spell. if you&#8217;re invisible (easy via\n\t\t\tnumerous means at this level) you can spend several minutes working your\n\t\t\tway down your victim&#8217;s daily spell slots until they&#8217;re down to cantrips\n\t\t\tand spells without targets (which are generally not harmful to you or your\n\t\t\tallies).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The wording of the feat also notably only clearly addresses how it\n\t\t\taffects spellcasters with a Spell Repertoire. I think the intent is that\n\t\t\tfor prepared spellcasters like clerics and wizards you steal a random slot\n\t\t\twhich was used to prepare a qualifying spell, and you get that specific\n\t\t\tspell rather than a spell randomly selected from the Wizard&#8217;s spellbook or\n\t\t\tsomething equally silly.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You may also be able to use this against allies, which they might not\n\t\t\tappreciate, but if you can time it right you could work with an ally and\n\t\t\tget an extra 9th-level spell cast in round one of combat.

You can also use this to avoid area effects, which is helpful for\n\t\tarea effects that aren&#8217;t covered by Improved Evasion and your spectacular\n\t\tReflex saves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Incredible Initiative<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Going first will often make it easier to strike enemies while they&#8217;re\n\t\tstill flat-footed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Incredible Scout<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup> The Scout Activity is a\n\t\tgreat choice for the Rogue while your party is moving around somewhere\n\t\tdangerous, and the +2 Circumstance bonus for your whole party can make a big\n\t\tdifference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Block<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Rogues are frail, and a shield can go a long way to keep you alive in\n\t\tmelee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Perception<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent for any character fortunate enough to get Legendary proficiency\n\t\tin Perception, but it feels especially fitting on the Investigator.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dagger<\/span>: Despite having a slightly smaller\n\t\tdamage die than the shortsword or the Rapier, the Dagger is a fantastic\n\t\tweapon. It&#8217;s Agile so you can make several attacks with it with reduce\n\t\tMultiple Attack Penalties and you can throw it. Even if you&#8217;re not using\n\t\tdaggers as your primary weapon, keeping one in your off hand can be a great\n\t\tway to keep a ranged attack ready when you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to get into\n\t\tmelee range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Main-Gauche<\/span>: Agile, Finesse, Parry, and\n\t\tVersatile (Piercing and Slashing). It works offensively, but gives up the\n\t\tdagger&#8217;s ability to be used effectively at range in exchange for Parry. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going for a two-weapon build or just need a way to boost your AC but\n\t\tdon&#8217;t want a shield, the Main-Gauche may be a good choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapier<\/span>: Perhaps the most deadly single\n\t\tweapon available to the rogue, the Rapier is a great weapon if you don&#8217;t\n\t\tplan to spend every Action attacking. If you plan to use Twin Feint, the\n\t\tRapier is a good first weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sap<\/span>: A tragic victim of the transition from\n\t\tthe Pathfinder 1e to Pathfinder 2e. Nonlethal weapons are basically useless.\n\t\tYou can choose to take a -2 penalty with a lethal weapon to make the attack\n\t\tnonlethal, and so long as you make that choice when you reduce the creature\n\t\tto 0 hit points you&#8217;re fine. You don&#8217;t need to spend a ton of gold on a sap\n\t\tjust to have the ability to knock foes unconscious without killing them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortsword<\/span>: Basically a dagger with\n\t\tslightly large damage dice, but you lose the ability to throw it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortbow<\/span>: The same damage as the hand\n\t\tcrossbow, but no Reload. The Shortbow does add Deadly d10, which is quite a\n\t\tbit of damage on a Critical Hit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ruffian-weapons\">Ruffian Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Ruffian can fight effectively with every published simple weapon except the heavy crossbow, and in some cases you can take an Ancestry Feat to make a Martial Weapon a Simple Weapon for you, further expanding your options. Carrying several weapons to support a diverse set of weapon traits is tempting, but the cost to keep your weapon upgraded quickly becomes prohibitive so you&#8217;ll generally want to stick to one favorite weapon. If you want to use multiple weapons, buy a Shifting rune.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Most rogues will wear light armor, but Ruffians can (and often should) wear medium armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explorer&#8217;s Clothing<\/span>: Once you reach 10th\n\t\tlevel, your Dexterity could reach 20. At that point, Explorer&#8217;s Clothing\n\t\tprovides the same AC as Leather Armor, but without a check penalty and with\n\t\tless Bulk. You&#8217;ll still want to put runes on it to boost your AC, but\n\t\ttransferring runes from your previous armor is easy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leather<\/span>: Most rogues will live in Leather\n\t\tarmor until they raise their Dexterity to 20, and even then you only need to\n\t\tchange to Explorer&#8217;s Clothing if you don&#8217;t have 10 Strength.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Studded Leather<\/span>: If you start with 16\n\t\tDexterity, this may be the right choice. You&#8217;ll get the same AC as Leather\n\t\tarmor with 18 Dexterity, and since the Dex cap doesn&#8217;t matter beyond your\n\t\tAC, raising your Dexterity doesn&#8217;t mandate changing armor. However, the\n\t\tStrength Threshold is higher than Leather, so if you don&#8217;t have 12 Strength\n\t\tyou might change to Leather once you have 18 Dexterity, provided that you\n\t\thave 10 Strength to meet Leather&#8217;s Strength Threshold.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chain Shirt<\/span>: Noisy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hide \/ Scale Mail<\/span>: Fine options if you\n\t\twant to stop at 14 Dexterity and strike a middle ground between being a Ruffian\nand being sneaky. The choice between the two comes down to whether you want a check penalty to\nAcrobatics\/Athletics or to Stealth, and weighing that decision might convince you to change\nother builds choices to lean further in either direction.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Chain Mail<\/span>: For Ruffians planning to entirely forgo\nStealth, this is your best bet because Flexible prevents the check penalty from affecting Athletics\nchecks for things like shoving and grabbing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Breastplate<\/span>: Only better than Chain Mail if you&#8217;re\nplanning to be stealthy, but with 12 Dexterity it&#8217;s a hard prospect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-armor-runes\">Armor Property Runes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility<\/span>: The ability to produce\n\t\tinvisibility without an ally&#8217;s help is a huge benefit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapon-runes\">Weapon Property Runes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Grievous<\/span>: Not every critical\n\t\tspeicalization effect is appealing, and many effects don&#8217;t improve enough\n\t\twith Grievous, and some of the effects will be redundant with Debilitating\n\t\tStrike or with other key options like Feint.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Returning<\/span>: A dagger is a great choice of\n\t\tweapon for many rogues, and the ability to throw it without giving up your\n\t\tweapon means that you can easily make ranged attacks with spending a bunch\n\t\tof Actions to switch weapons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-talismans\">Talismans<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodseeker Beak<\/span>: Persistant damage is\n\t\talways great, but by the time 20gp is easy to afford the 1d4 bleed damage\n\t\tisn&#8217;t significant enough to justify spending a bunch of money on single-use\n\t\titems. Still, this is a nice option to have for difficult fights or when\n\t\tyou&#8217;re expecting an enemy to run away.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Goggles of Night<\/span>: If you don&#8217;t get\n\t\tDarkvision from your Ancestry\/Heritage, this is essential.
