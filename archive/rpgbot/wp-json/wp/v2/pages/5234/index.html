If you can spare the 10 minutes to cast this\n\t\tahead of time, the elementals are big bags of hit points to defend you in\n\t\tcombat. However, the biggest elemental you summon is CR 9, which won&#8217;t be\n\t\tvery scary at this level.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"cloud\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/cleric\/domains\/paizo-domains\/air-domain\/cloud\">Cloud Subdomain<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The cloud domain doesn&#8217;t improve the spell Air domains spell list, but the Thundercloud power is fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Power(s): Electricity resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thundercloud<\/span> (Su): This is a great area\n\tcontrol power.

The early benefits are terrible, so this domain should largely be ignored until level 5. Because the animal companion is on par with a ranger, the Boon Companion feat is almost mandatory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Speak with Animals<\/span> (Sp): Very situational.\n\tAnimals aren&#8217;t very smart, so they have very little of interest to say.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Companion<\/span> (Ex): An Animal Companion\n\tis like a furry fighter.

It\n\t\t\taffects &#8220;fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes&#8221; as though they were undead, but\n\t\t\tof those four only Ooze is a defined creature type. The wording regarding\n\t\t\tundead also makes it unclear if they are blinded in addition to the extra\n\t\t\tdamage. The Pathfinder Rules Questions forum has\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/search?q=sunbeam&amp;forum=v5748dmtz1gek\">several threads about the spell<\/a>, all expressing similar concerns. I would interpret the spell as\n\t\t\tfollows: Normal creatures take listed damage (4d6) and are permanently\n\t\t\tblinded. Undead take the bigger damage instead of the regular damage, and\n\t\t\tare blinded as normal. Oozes, and plant creatures which could be defined\n\t\t\tas &#8220;fungi, mold, or slime&#8221; (such as shambling mounds or mushroom\n\t\t\tcreatures) are affected like undead. Consult your GM to be sure.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">sunburst<\/span>: Though it suffers many of the\n\t\t\trules interpetation issues of sunbeam, sunburst is slightly easier to\n\t\t\tinterpret. Because the duration is instantaneous, the blindness effect is\n\t\t\tpermanent. The damage dealt to undead is still unclear (do they take\n\t\t\tdamage twice?), and the additional list of things affected like undead is\n\t\t\tstill confusing.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">prismatic sphere<\/span>: Very powerful area\n\t\t\tcontrol, and it&#8217;s not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\t<h4 id=\"day\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/cleric\/domains\/paizo-domains\/sun-domain\/day\">Day Subdomain<\/a><\/h4>\n\t<p>Day&#8217;s resurgence isn&#8217;t as cool as Sun&#8217;s Blessing, but if you don&#8217;t\n\t\tencounter a lot of undead and magical darkness, Day&#8217;s resurgence can be a\n\t\tnice source of healing.

You can also use it on your allies to get\n\t\tthem into position to full attack, or to get them out of dangerous\n\t\tlocations.<\/p>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">slipstream<\/span>: Nice buff with a decent\n\t\t\tduration. Throw it on your mobile characters to help them move around the\n\t\t\tfield. Not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">water walk<\/span>: Situational, and it&#8217;s\n\t\t\talready on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">tsunami<\/span>: A bit of damage, and some\n\t\t\texcellent area control. Throw it at groups of enemies. Not on the Cleric\n\t\t\tspell list.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\t<h3 id=\"weather\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/cleric\/domains\/paizo-domains\/weather-domain\">Weather Domain<\/a><\/h3>\n\t<p>The Weather domain has a couple of interesting powers, though they don&#8217;t do\n\t\ta lot of damage. The spell list has some great area control effects, but the\n\t\tdamage spells are among the worst options available. Overall the domain\n\t\ttries to find a nice space between area control and damage output, and\n\t\tmanages to fail at both.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Storm Burst<\/span> (Sp): Similar to the generic\n\t\tenergy bolt attacks, but Storm Burst deals nonlethal damage. Instead of real\n\t\tdamage, the target takes a penalty to its attacks for round. Potentially\n\t\tuseful at low levels, despite the damage limitations.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Lord<\/span> (Sp): Replicates the\n\t\teffect of a decent damage spell, but the ability to hit more than one target\n\t\tat a time makes this miles better than Call Lightning. However, the damage\n\t\tis fairly small, even at 8th level, and doesn&#8217;t scale with level.<\/p>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">obscuring mist<\/span>: Occasionally useful as\n\t\t\tan escape mechanic.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">fog cloud<\/span>: A better, ranged version of\n\t\t\tObscuring Mist. Not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">call lightning<\/span>: Because the bolts are\n\t\t\tvertical, this will likely get used as a single-target damage spell.\n\t\t\tInstead of spending your standard action doing something helpful, you can\n\t\t\tdeal 3d6 damage. That&#8217;s an average of 10.5. Even at level 5, that barely\n\t\t\texceeds your weapon damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">sleet storm<\/span>: Excellent area control,\n\t\t\tespecially against clumsy foes. Not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">ice storm<\/span>: This is a mediocre area\n\t\t\tcontrol spell, and you get it a level late.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">control winds<\/span>: Allows you to prevent\n\t\t\tenemies from flying, and isn&#8217;t on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">control weather<\/span>: Situational, and already\n\t\t\ton the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">whirlwind<\/span>: Great crowd-control effect,\n\t\t\tand it&#8217;s not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">storm of vengeance<\/span>: This is a weird\n\t\t\tspell. It&#8217;s hard to time, it&#8217;s hard to use, and it&#8217;s hard to not do just\n\t\t\tas much damage to your party. It&#8217;s also on the cleric spell list already\n\t\t\tat the same level.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\t<h4 id=\"seasons\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/cleric\/domains\/paizo-domains\/weather-domain\/seasons\">Seasons Subdomain<\/a><\/h4>\n\t<p>The only clearly good option in Seasons is Goodberry. A first level spell\n\t\thardly makes a domain. Seasons gives up the two best spells on the Weather\n\t\tspell list and replaces them with Blight, which is terrible, and Sunburst,\n\t\twhich is hard enough to interpret that I would probably never use it.<\/p>\n\t<p>Replaced Power(s): storm burst.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Untouched by the Seasons<\/span> (Su): Very\n\t\tsituational, and only replaces the effect of a first level spell which is\n\t\talready on your spell list.<\/p>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">goodberry<\/span>: Often overlooked, Goodberry\n\t\t\tis an excellent healing option. Cast it repeatedly on off days, and the\n\t\t\tberries will remain potent when its time to adventure. Use them to heal\n\t\t\tthose last few hit points without spending a prepared spell or potion.\n\t\t\tThey also reduce the need to purchase food. Not on the Cleric spell\n\t\t\tlist.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">blight<\/span>: Very situational. If you need\n\t\t\tto kill plants, Flame Strike them. Most plants take double damage from\n\t\t\tfire. Not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-none\">sunburst<\/span>: Though it suffers many of the\n\t\t\trules interpetation issues of sunbeam, sunburst is slightly easier to\n\t\t\tinterpret. Because the duration is instantaneous, the blindness effect is\n\t\t\tpermanent. The damage dealt to undead is still unclear (do they take\n\t\t\tdamage twice?), and the additional list of things affected like undead is\n\t\t\tstill confusing.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\t<h4 id=\"storms\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/cleric\/domains\/paizo-domains\/weather-domain\/storms\">Storms Subdomain<\/a><\/h4>\n\t<p>Storms doesn&#8217;t meaningfully change the feel of the Weather domain. It is\n\t\tstill a poor mix of damage and control spells, with too little damage and\n\t\ttoo little control to be of any real interest.<\/p>\n\t<p>Replaced Power(s): lightning lord.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gale Aura<\/span> (Su): Decent area control\n\t\teffect. Helpful for slowing highly movile enemies. Giving up lightning lord\n\t\tmight seem disappointing, but lightning lord barely qualifies as green due\n\t\tto its pitiful damage.<\/p>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">call lightning storm<\/span>: The duration is\n\t\t\tnice, but at 9th level when you get this spell, Wizards can throw\n\t\t\tfireballs for twice as much damage. Not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">sirocco<\/span>: Nice area control effect. A\n\t\t\tlittle bit of damage, knock things prone, and make them fatigued. Not on\n\t\t\tthe Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\t<h3 id=\"mult\">Multi-Domain Subdomains<\/h3>\n\t<p>Multi-Domain Subdomains can be taken as a subdomain of two base domains.<\/p>\n\n\t<h4 id=\"archon\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/cleric\/domains\/paizo-domains\/good-domain\/archon\">Archon Subdomain<\/a><\/h4>\n\t<p>The Archon domain is a lateral shift from the Good and Law domains. You\n\t\tgive up the ability to enhance your weapons for an aura to debuff your\n\t\tenemies. In addition, you give up Protection from and Magic Circle against\n\t\tEvil\/Law for some more general buff spells. Archon is more of a support\n\t\tdomain, where Good and Law are more geared toward getting into melee with\n\t\tyour foes. You also get to keep the excellent Touch of Law power if you take\n\t\tthe domain.<\/p>\n\t<p>Associated Domains: Good, Law<\/p>\n\t<p>Replaced Power(s): Holy lance (Good domain) or Staff of order (Law\n\t\tdomain).<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Menace<\/span> (Su): The -2 to AC and\n\t\tAttakc is prety nice, but the -2 to saves is fantastic. This won&#8217;t do much\n\t\tat low levels due to the limited duration, but at high levels it&#8217;s going to\n\t\tbe very useful. Note that it doesn&#8217;t allow a save.<\/p>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">divine favor<\/span>: This is good, especially\n\t\t\tbecause it&#8217;s a luck bonus, but it&#8217;s already on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">prayer<\/span>: Good, but already on your\n\t\t\tspell list.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">planar ally (archon only)<\/span>: Very\n\t\t\tpowerful, and not on the Cleric spell list.
