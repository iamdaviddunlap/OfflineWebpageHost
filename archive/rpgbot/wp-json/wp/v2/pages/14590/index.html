While it\u2019s not going to do the most damage of any Ranger subclass, Swarmkeeper gives options for what to do each turn when attacking. This allows for some very tactical decision making in combat and if that appeals to you, read on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If I may draw a comparison from an older edition, the features and expanded spells of Swarmkeeper remind me of the Seeker class from D&amp;D 4E.

Keep in mind that this only\n\t\tworks once per turn so it&#8217;s no replacement for something like Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\tMark\/Favored Foe in terms of sheer damage output, and you&#8217;ll want to have a\n\t\tplan at the start of your turn before you start attacking. This will be more\n\t\treliable if you&#8217;re making multiple attacks, so consider two-weapon fighting\n\t\tuntil you get Extra Attack.  One more subtle note: The trigger is any attack, so it\u2019s not restricted to weapon attacks and can include spell attacks.\n\t\t<p>While each of the options below are rated as\n\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> to indicate that they are only\n\t\t\tsituationally useful, their combined capabilities are excellent. It&#8217;s like\n\t\t\thaving a toolbox with three tools in it: any one tool can only do a couple\n\t\t\tthings, but between the three of them you can do a lot.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Damage<\/span>: Your go-to option in most\n\t\t\t\tcases, but also your option of last resort. Use the other options if\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;re going to have any significant impact. Otherwise, the 1d6 damage\n\t\t\t\tis a small but satisfying bonus. Unfortunately, since this is from a\n\t\t\t\tseparate source rather than &#8220;extra damage&#8221; added to your attack, the\n\t\t\t\tdamage isn&#8217;t multiplied on a critical hit. Creatures which resist piercing damage typically have resistance to piercing damage\n\t\t\t\t<em>from non-magical attacks<\/em>. This isn&#8217;t an attack, so those\n\t\t\t\tresistances don&#8217;t apply.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Move Target<\/span>: Moving enemies can\n\t\t\t\tforce them to break grapples with your allies, and can put them into bad\n\t\t\t\tplaces like ongoing area damage, open pits, etc.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Move Self<\/span>: This is the option you\n\t\t\t\tare least likely to use, but it&#8217;s still helpful. Moving yourself 5 feet\n\t\t\t\tcan get you out of melee reach, out of grapples, out of area effects,\n\t\t\t\tand generally out of trouble.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Swarmkeeper Magic<\/span>: Some really good\n\t\tutility options, but the offensive options will be hard to rely upon.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd-Level<\/span>: Mage hand is a good\n\t\t\t\tcantrip, and rangers generally don&#8217;t get cantrips. Even if you take\n\t\t\t\tDruidic Warrior, Mage Hand isn&#8217;t an option. Faerie Fire is a great\n\t\t\t\tcombat option, but your save DC will likely be low, so save it for when\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re facing a crowd (statistically some of your enemies will still\n\t\t\t\tfail their save) or when you&#8217;re facing enemies which have poor Dexterity\n\t\t\t\tlike ogres or the Tarrasque.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-Level<\/span>: Web is one of the best area shutdown spells in the game.a hard choice. It\u2019s like a persistent version of Entangle, where creatures can be subjected to the spell over and over just for being in the area. Thrown over a group of foes, statistically some of them will fail their saves and even if they all make the strength check, not save, to escape, we\u2019ve made them all lose an action. And we have a great forced movement ability so we can just shove people back inside when they escape. Now, they might burn their way out of the webs if they happen to have a way to do fire damage but then just don\u2019t web the Red Dragon and you can avoid that one issue.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th-Level<\/span>: A great way to infiltrate\n\t\t\t\tplaces, to escape, to scout, and generally to go somewhere without other\n\t\t\t\tcreatures causing you trouble. The move speed is very limited, so\n\t\t\t\tcombine this with buffs like Longstrider to boost your speed and get\n\t\t\t\tmore done in the 1-hour duration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th-Level<\/span>: Even though you get it\n\t\t\t\tmuch later than dedicated spellcasters, Arcane Eye is still one of my\n\t\t\t\tabsolute favorite divination options for scouting from a safe\n\t\t\t\tdistance.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">17th-Level<\/span>: Constitution saves tend\n\t\t\t\tto be high and ranger&#8217;s save DCs tend to be low, which is a hard\n\t\t\t\tcombination. But with a 10-minute duration and half damage on a\n\t\t\t\tsuccessful save, with a particularly good damage type, if you can trap enemies in an enclosed space or\n\t\t\t\trepeatedly knock them into the area with Gathered Swarm, you can still\n\t\t\t\tdeal huge amounts of damage even if enemies consistently pass the saving\n\t\t\t\tthrow. If nothing else, you can plug a choke point while the full casters concentrate on other impressive effects.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Writhing Tide<\/span>: Flight of any kind is\n\t\tgreat, but 10 ft. speed definitely isn&#8217;t much. You can get off the ground\n\t\tand over small obstacles, but don&#8217;t expect to travel like this. Remember\n\t\tthat you can Dash if necessary, so if you have nothing else to do you can\n\t\tfly up to 200 feet on one usage. You can also boost your speed with buffs\n\t\tlike Longstrider and Haste, which will go a long way to make this more\n\t\tuseful both in and out of combat.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mighty Swarm<\/span>: Huge improvements to the\n\t\tmovement options. The damage option improves so little I&#8217;m confused why they\n\t\tbother to improve it at all.<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Damage<\/span>: 1d6 to 1d8 is not a meaningful\n\t\t\t\tdifference.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Move Target<\/span>: Knocking the target prone\n\t\t\t\tis great if you have melee allies who will benefit from them being prone\n\t\t\t\tor if you need to cut the target&#8217;s movement. However, if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tattacking at range you&#8217;ll make your own life harder by knocking your\n\t\t\t\ttarget prone.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Move Self<\/span>: +2 AC for one round. If\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re fighting in melee that&#8217;s a huge benefit and you should consider\n\t\t\t\tusing this every turn.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Swarming Dispersal<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\thave plenty of daily uses for this. Use it to gain Resistance against\n\t\thigh-damage attacks like critical hits or high-level spells, and also to get\n\t\tyourself out of melee combat if you don&#8217;t want to be there. You can\n\t\ttechnically use this by willingly taking damage in order to trigger the\n\t\tteleportation, but it&#8217;s probably not a significant abuse case because the\n\t\tuses per day are limited and the range is so short. Still, if you need to\n\t\tget out of somewhere nasty (a grapple, a pool of acid, an ongoing spell\n\t\teffect, etc.) you can always slap yourself for 1+Str damage to trigger the\n\t\tteleportation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swarmkeeper-ability-scores\">Swarmkeeper Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We have some options as a Swarmkeeper.

Note, this drops down to <span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span> if you\u2019re multiclassing, because either one level of Fighter for the Archery style or one level of Druid to grab the cantrips would be far better ways to go about this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resilient (Constitution)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: All five of the leveled spells granted to Swarmkeepers are concentration spells, so boosting Constitution saves is very helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Warcaster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: We\u2019ve got all these concentration spells, and this is a nice way to keep those spells running, but unless you have an offensive cantrip to use in place of your Opportunity Attack, Resilient is better for most of the level range.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swarmkeeper-weapons\">Swarmkeeper Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With a small exception, the list from the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/#weapons\">Ranger Handbook<\/a> will serve you well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sling<\/span>: If you gain the Magic Stone cantrip (Druidic Warrior, Multiclassing, Magic Initiate) and want to apply Sharpshooter to the stones, then put the stones into a Sling. It becomes an interesting hybrid of rules text: A ranged spell attack with a ranged weapon. The nuance here is that the very important part of Sharpshooter that allows -5 to attack rolls for +10 to damage applies because of \u201cattack with a ranged weapon\u201d but the first two features do not apply unless your DM is nice because this is not technically a \u201cranged weapon attack\u201d.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swarmkeeper-armor\">Swarmkeeper Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Ranger Handbook has <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/#armor\">good advice<\/a> for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Plate<\/span>: If you take the route of making a Wisdom-based Druidic Warrior Swarmkeeper, try to at least get 14 Dexterity and put on some Half-Plate for your AC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swarmkeeper-multiclassing\">Swarmkeeper Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget the advice from the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/#multiclassing\">Ranger Handbook<\/a>.

First and foremost, we will be making attacks with Wisdom. This by itself would be ok, but there\u2019s an extra quirk to this cantrip. If you put the stones into a sling, they become a \u201cspell attack with a ranged weapon\u201d which causes all sorts of strange rules interactions.

Our race is Custom Lineage and we\u2019re accounting for the +1 to Constitution from the Crusher feat in this table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Racial\/Feat Adjustment<\/strong><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Level 20<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">8<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">8<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">14<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">14<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">15<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">16<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">10<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">10<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">15<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">17<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">8<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">8<\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\">8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re using Custom Lineage because the bonus feat is great for us, allowing us to grab Crusher right away and round out our Constitution. Crusher adds us a tiny bit of extra control because magic stones do Bludgeoning damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also take Darkvision and put the +2 into Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For our background, we take Investigator for Perception and Insight. We also gain Disguise Kit and Thieves\u2019 Tools proficiencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>From Ranger we take Stealth, Nature, and Investigation. With Deft Explorer, we gain Expertise in Investigation to make up for our average Intelligence. Together with Perception and Insight and especially Thieves\u2019 Tools from Investigator, this allows us to perform the Scout role in a party.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing-potential\">Multiclassing Potential<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re ok with some Multiclassing, this build could benefit from anything described above in the Multiclassing section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Of the three options, I would likely take the \u201cstart as Fighter with the Archery style\u201d path in order to start with the proficiency in Constitution saves. In this arrangement, after fourth level, with Archery from Fighter 1 and Druidic Warrior and Swarmkeeper from Ranger 2 and 3, you could either stay Ranger or hop back into Fighter. If someone else in the party already has lots of dangerous area control so that we don\u2019t need to stay Swarmkeeper for more control, sticking with Fighter eventually gets the second Extra Attack at Fighter 11, which works wonderfully with the three stones from magic stone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The other path I would strongly consider is starting Druid and then eventually taking a 2nd level for Circle of Stars because of how strong the dip really is. Going that route, we\u2019d still need to take Resilient (Constitution), but we can align rocks from first level instead of waiting for Ranger 2nd.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Custom Lineage, we get a bonus feat at first level alongside five ASIs from Ranger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first level, we take Crusher, putting the +1 into Constitution. Because we\u2019re going to be flinging magical rocks at people, smacking people around a bit for forcing them into bad places is helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we take Sharpshooter. Because of the way the feat is written, placing a magic stone from the cantrip into a sling counts as an attack with a ranged weapon, satisfying the final bullet point (but only the final bullet point) of Sharpshooter. This will allow us to get some extra damage, which is always good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we take an ASI, adding +1 to Wisdom and +1 to Constitution. This pushes Wisdom to 18 and Constitution to 17 in preparation for Resilient (Constitution) later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, an ASI for +2 Wisdom pushes us to 20. Optionally, we could have taken Resilient (Constitution) now and this at sixteenth level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we\u2019re taking Resilient (Constitution), rounding out to an 18 Constitution and gaining proficiency in Constitution saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At nineteenth level, we\u2019re taking an ASI for +2 Constitution, capping at 20 Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optionally, if we don\u2019t want the extra utility of Crusher, Resilient (Constitution) could be the bonus feat at first level. In this alternate path, at 8th we would take a half feat with +1 to Wisdom like Chef, Fey Touched, Shadow Touched, or Skill Expert and we just substitute in an ASI for +2 Constitution where the original path took Resilient (Constitution).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Deft Explorer (optional)<br>Favored Foe &#8211; 1d4 (optional)<br><br>Skills<br>-Insight<br>-Investigation (Expertise)<br>-Nature<br>-Perception<br>-Stealth<br><br>Tools<br>-Disguise Kit<br>-Thieves\u2019 Tools<br><br>Bonus Feat<br>-Crusher<\/td><td>This level is going to be a little rough.<br><br>Our best ability score is Wisdom, but we can\u2019t really use it till we take Druidic Warrior next level, so for just this level, rely on the Longbow we get for being a Ranger.<br><br>Also pickup a quarterstaff from the starting equipment options. We\u2019ll be choosing Shillelagh as our other cantrip from Druidic Warrior. We don\u2019t <em>want<\/em> to be in melee but we will still end up there sometimes and with Crusher we can easily bonk away an opponent.<br><br>Then buy a sling for 1 silver and wear the best medium armor you can afford.<br><br>Try not to die, things are rough out there.<br><br>Favored Foe is usually better than Favored Enemy, even if it competes for our Concentration. Really it\u2019s just extra damage if we want to save on spell slots.<br><br>The only time Favored Enemy can be better is if we\u2019re level 20 for Foe Slayer and we\u2019ve chosen types well.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Fighting Style<br>-Druidic Warrior<br>\u2013Magic Stone<br>\u2013Shillelagh<br><br>Spellcasting<br>1st-level Spells<br>-Absorb Elements<br>-Entangle (c)<\/td><td>We pick up Druidic Warrior, giving us Magic Stone and Shillelagh, so now we can fight with Wisdom.<br><br>We also get our 1st-level Spells.<br><br>Absorb Elements will save your life from time to time, so it\u2019s worth learning.<br><br>Entangle is pretty nice because it restrains targets and costs them an Action to escape.

We can pick whatever our swarm is shaped like so how about a swarm of tiny rocks, like some sort of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asteroid_belt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asteroid belt<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ring_system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">planetary ring<\/a>. We are the rock guy after all. Flavor is free.<br><br>Gathered Swarm will allow us to add a lot of control in the form of forced movement every round in combat. There is a save, but we\u2019re building to account for that.<br><br>Mage Hand is a nice utility cantrip.<br><br>Faerie Fire is a good way to get Advantage while attacking multiple targets for our party.<br><br>Fog Cloud is good for a lot of situations. Like if we\u2019re surrounded by wolves with pack tactics, this negates the advantage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Sharpshooter<\/td><td>Sharpshooter will apply to Magic Stone, but only when fired from a sling.<br><br>I know it\u2019s weird, but that\u2019s how the rules work.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br><br>Swarmkeeper Magic<br>-Web (c)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>2nd-level Spells<br>-Pass Without Trace (c)<\/td><td>Fling two stones. Twice the pain.<br><br>Web is basically the best 2nd-level spell in the game so it\u2019s great that we get access to it.<br><br>Pass Without Trace is good for stealth missions. Sure, we have multiple Concentration spells now, but this would be for out of combat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Deft Explorer<br>-Roving<br><br>Favored Foe &#8211; 1d6<\/td><td>Walk 5 ft. faster as well as gain climb and swim speeds.<br><br>Increased die size for Favored Foe.

Less useful in a fight.<br><br>Enhance Ability is another good utility spell for getting free Advantage on checks out of combat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI:<br>+1 Wisdom (18)<br>+1 Constitution (17)<br><br>Land\u2019s Stride<\/td><td>Land\u2019s Stride is a weird feature. It won&#8217;t come up often, but it\u2019s nice when it does help us.<br><br>As mentioned above, we split the ASI here to prepare our Constitution for taking Resilient later.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Swarmkeeper Magic<br>-Gaseous Form (c)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>3rd-level Spells<br>-Revivify<\/td><td>Pay the Revivify Tax.<br><br>Also we can turn into a cloud. Well, technically I think the idea is to turn into a swarm of whatever your Swarmkeeper spirits are, while mechanically being a cloud. So we\u2019re like a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nebula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nebula<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oort_cloud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oort cloud<\/a>.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Hide in Plain Sight<br><br>Tireless<\/td><td>Hide in Plain Sight is ok. It allows making camouflage in order to hide in plain sight. Exactly what it says on the tin.<br><br>Tireless is free temporary HP PB times per day (currently 4). Also recover from a level of Exhaustion after only a short rest. This is good because Exhaustion is awful and removing it can require several days or expensive magic.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Mighty Swarm<br><br>Spellcasting<br>3rd-level Spells<br>-Conjure Barrage<br>\u2013or\u2013<br>-Elemental Weapon (c)<\/td><td>An upgrade to Gathered Swarm.<br><br>The damage increase is fine. It\u2019s more than nothing.<br><br>The wording on the forced movement is pretty nice. The option to knock prone is in addition to also moving the target. Knock something prone and also deliver it right to the feet of your melee ally of choice.<br><br>And the option to have +2 to AC and Dex saves from half cover for a turn is great.<br><br>Good upgrades all around.<br><br>Alright so I know Conjure Barrage is called out as red on the Ranger spell breakdown. But that list makes assumptions that are not true about this build, like having bad spell DCs or foes won&#8217;t be restrained by Web or Entangle.<br><br>But mostly, a 60-ft. cone is great if you get to those real cinematic battles where you\u2019re participating in a large skirmish for the fate of Krynn. Or for shotgunning rocks across an enemy spelljammer.<br><br>But if you don\u2019t expect to need a 60-ft. cone, Elemental Weapon will make our sling magical and add extra elemental damage to the attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>ASI: Wisdom +2 (20)<\/td><td>Capped Wisdom for magic rock attacks and spell DCs.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Swarmkeeper Magic<br>-Arcane Eye (c)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>4th-level Spells<br>-Guardian of Nature (c)<\/td><td>Arcane Eye. Great spell. Spy on your foes with your space rock. The space rock that totally does not have a suspicious camera. Like a not suspicious at all spy satellite.<br><br>Guardian of Nature is a cool buff. We can turn into a big ole space-rock tree to get Advantage on our rock flings. Kinda neat. And impose difficult terrain within 15 feet. I dunno. Wacky space gravity or something. Free Flavor etc.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Vanish<br><br>Favored Foe&nbsp; &#8211; 1d8<\/td><td>Hide as a bonus action and leave no trail. Alright.<br><br>Favored Foe gets stronger. Which is ok, but we\u2019ve got a lot of nice Concentration spells now. It\u2019s alright and still a good way to not spend spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Swarming Dispersal<br><br>Spellcasting<br>4th-level Spells<br>-Freedom of Movement<\/td><td>A reaction to take half damage and teleport PB times per day.<br><br>Freedom of Movement is a decent buff. Rangers don\u2019t get a lot of good 4th-level spells, but at least this is good.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient (Constitution)<br>+1 Constitution (18)<\/td><td>Getting this will boost up our Concentration saves. Good deal. Sure it\u2019s a bit late, but we had other things that took priority.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Swarmkeeper Magic<br>-Insect Plague (c)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>5th-level Spells<br>-Conjure Volley<\/td><td>Insect Plague is an ok damage effect in an area. Since it\u2019s a spell and it\u2019s piercing, almost nothing is going to resist magical piercing damage.<br><br>Conjure Volley is in a similar situation to Conjure Barrage. We have good Wisdom so we can use this to drop a decent amount of AoE damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Feral Senses<\/td><td>See invisible foes and no longer have Disadvantage to hit things we can\u2019t see.<br><br>This can even combo with fog cloud, giving us Advantage because we would count as an unseen attacker.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Constitution (20)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>5th-level Spells<br>-Steel Wind Strike<\/td><td>Capped Constitution. Good for our HP and saves.<br><br>Steel Wind Strike is kinda neat. Normally this spell is a let down for other Rangers because it\u2019s a spell attack, which means it keys off of our primary ability score, Wisdom.<br><br>So we can just pull out our Quarterstaff and bust a few skulls. The best part is that we can still trigger Gathered Swarm, which would go off during the spell, and if the target fails the save we can slide it to better decide where we land.<br><br>Maybe even position to provide flanking for an ally if that optional rule is in play.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Foe Slayer<\/td><td>This boosts Favored Foe greatly as a Wisdom-based Ranger.<br><br>Because we can apply it before or after a roll, we can decide to either add +5 to the attack roll if we nearly hit or +5 to the damage roll if we make the hit.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Swarmkeeper Ranger is designed to add a bit of control effects to a Ranger with a mixture of forced movement effects and area control spells.

This allows for some very tactical decision making in combat and if that appeals to you, read on.
