Enchantment and Illusion\n\tspells both offer fantastic options, giving the Arcane Trickster powerful\n\toptions utility and trickery, but also bringing powerful offensive magic\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it&#8217;s the only rogue subclass with a spell list (or with any decision\n\tpoints made after level 3), the Arcane Trickster is the most complex rogue\n\tsubclass to build and in many ways it&#8217;s also the most complex to play because\n\tyou have so many options to consider in any given situation. I don&#8217;t recommend\n\tthe Arcane Trickster for new players, but managing the Arcane Trickster&#8217;s\n\tspellcasting is not nearly as complex as that of a full spellcaster like the\n\tSorcerer or the Wizard, so an arcane trickster may be a good stepping stone if\n\tyou&#8217;re nervous about playing a spellcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because your choice of spells is so central to the Arcane Trickster, I strongly encourage you to read my <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2671\">Rogue Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/arcane-trickster\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14502\">Arcane Trickster Rogue Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Arcane Tricksters\n\t\tdefining feature. You&#8217;re limited almost exclusively to Enchantment and\n\t\tIllusion spells for your leveled spells, but both of those schools work very\n\t\twell for Arcane Tricksters. When selecting spells, remember that Sneak\n\t\tAttack requires Dexterity-based weapon attacks, so you can&#8217;t apply it to\n\t\tspell attacks. Instead, you&#8217;ll generally rely on spells like Booming Blade\n\t\tand Shadow Blade.\n\t\t<p>For help selecting spells, see our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/spells\/\">Rogue Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mage Hand Legerdemain<\/span>: Controlling the\n\t\thand as a Bonus Action means that you can pick locks and pick pockets while\n\t\tyou&#8217;re doing other things like fighting or casting other spells, and, since the\n\t\thand is invisible, you can send it off to do those things unnoticed while you\n\t\tand your allies are busy hiding, fighting, carousing, or whatever else you\n\t\tdo with your day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Ambush<\/span>: Since your spell DC likely\n\t\twon&#8217;t be as good as that of a dedicated spellcaster, this can really do a lot\n\t\tto improve the reliability of your spells. I&#8217;m still nervous to recommend\n\t\tspells which require saving throws as a go-to option for the Arcane\n\t\tTrickster, but mathematically it makes sense. Disadvantage works out to\n\t\tslightly more than a -3 penalty, so if your Intelligence is 14 or higher\n\t\tyour spells can be roughly as reliable as those of a wizard with 20\n\t\tIntelligence.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Versatile Trickster<\/span>: Advantage allows you\n\t\tto Sneak Attack the target, which is primary appeal of Versatile Trickster. However,\n\t\tit has some problematic limitations due to the limitations of Mage Hand.\n\t\t<p>Mage Hand takes an action to cast, and with a 1-minute duration you&#8217;re likely\n\t\t\tgoing to do that in combat or while at a safe distance before rushing the\n\t\t\tmove the hand into wherever you&#8217;re expecting a fight. This could be neatly\n\t\t\tsolved by allowing the Arcane Trickster to cast Mage Hand as a Bonus Action,\n\t\t\tbut that&#8217;s not the world we live in and a feat or class dip to get Quickened\n\t\t\tSpell is too expensive to justify.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Once your Mage Hand is up, you need to keep the hand\n\t\tin range of your target. You can use your Cunning Action to move the hand thanks to Legerdemain, and enemies won&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re doing so since the hand is invisible. However, this\nmeans not using Cunning Action, Steady Aim, or two-weapon fighting, and you also can&#8217;t activate the\nAdvantage effect the same turn. If your enemy moves even slightly, they&#8217;ll be out of range of your\nhand and you&#8217;ll be forced to move it again. In effect, your Bonus Action is monopolized by having\nyour hand chase enemies around so that you can <em>sometimes<\/em> get Advantage. And that&#8217;s to say\nnothing of the Mage Hand disappearing if it&#8217;s ever more than 30 feet away from you.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>At best, this is redundant with the Steady Aim class feature, and since most rogues only make one attack per turn, they\n\t\t\thave the same benefit. You could use Versatile Trickster with spell attacks like Scorching\n\t\t\tRay, but hitting with Sneak Attack is less expensive and deals comparable\n\t\t\tdamage so that&#8217;s generally a bad combination. You&#8217;re much more likely to\n\t\t\tuse your hand to get Advantage before attacking when you can&#8217;t be\n\t\t\tinvisible or hidden for whatever reason, and if your DM doesn&#8217;t allow you to use\n\t\tSteady Aim.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Thief<\/span>: The obvious use is to steal\n\t\tspells from enemy spellcasters, but, in a game when you might go several\n\t\tlevels without seeing a spellcaster, a better option may be to &#8220;steal&#8221; spells\n\t\tfrom your party&#8217;s other spellcasters. Unfortunately, this is difficult since\nthey&#8217;re unlikely to fail the save and it robs your ally of their known\/prepared spell for\n8 hours, so while it&#8217;s a more reliable source it&#8217;s also very difficult and costly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"assassin\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/rogue#Assassin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Assassin<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Assassins are good at two things: Infiltration and (you guessed it)\n\tassassination.

However, they lack utility\n\toptions for handling situations outside their specialized skillset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assassins have a weird divergence in their subclass features where Assasinate\n\tand Death Strike emphasize frequent combat, while Infiltration Expertise and\n\tImposter both work in campaigns where you&#8217;re doing a lot of spying,\n\tinfiltration, and intrigue. This doesn&#8217;t stop them from being excellent in\n\tyour typical dungeon crawl, but if you&#8217;re going from levels 1 to 20 in a full\n\tcampaign you may rarely see some features come into play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because their premise and their features are so simple, the Assassin is one of the easiest rogue subclasses to play. They don&#8217;t have resources to track or complicated additional mechanics, so if you&#8217;re comfortable with the complexity of the Rogue&#8217;s core features you&#8217;re already ready to handle the Assassin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/assassin\/\">Assassin Rogue Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Both tool kits are\n\t\tfantastic and open up wonderful options for the Rogue.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Assassinate<\/span>: To make this work, you really\n\t\twant to go first in combat for that free Advantage. Maximize your Dexterity\n\t\tas soon as possible, and consider the Alert feat. If magic items are\n\t\tavailable to you, try to get a Weapon of Warning.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Free Advantage is well and good, but what about those automatic Critical\n\t\t\thits? For those we\u2019ll need to work harder. Surprised can be thought of as\n\t\t\ta Condition and it\u2019s not easy to impose on a foe. By the rules, to\n\t\t\tSurprise a target your whole side has to succeed at Stealth checks versus\n\t\t\ta foe\u2019s Passive Perception. Each foe may or may not be Surprised on an\n\t\t\tindividual basis, but essentially your whole party has to win at\n\t\t\tStealth.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This might sound tough, but the Surprised condition is rather\n\t\t\tdebilitating even without this feature, and will benefit your whole party\n\t\t\timmensely. I don\u2019t suggest you try to force your party into a Stealth\n\t\t\tsetup, but rather see if they want the tactical advantages and are willing\n\t\t\tto try it out. Anyone that can cast Pass Without Trace will do wonders to\n\t\t\tamplify such a party, of course, but even simply having everyone get\n\t\t\tStealth proficiency is helpful.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infiltration Expertise<\/span>: Rules as\n\t\tWritten, Surprised is Stealth versus Perception, but Surprised is also up to\n\t\tthe DM. If you\u2019re playing an Assassin (or if you have an Assassin player in\n\t\tyour game), I would suggest that Deception versus Insight is equally valid\n\t\tfor imposing Surprise. You\u2019re not a band of murder hobos, you\u2019re a humble\n\t\tmerchant and this is your staff. And then you Surprise them with murder.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Obviously this is only useful if your campaign has situations where lying\n\t\t\tlike this will be helpful. Many campaigns just don\u2019t have situations where\n\t\t\tyou can be an operative on the inside.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Impostor<\/span>: Infiltration Expertise is for\n\t\tmaking up a whole new person, but this is for taking over as an existing\n\t\tperson. It should be useful about as often as Infiltration Expertise, which\n\t\tis to say that it very heavily depends on the campaign.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Death Strike<\/span>: If Surprised is so hard to\n\t\tpull off, why is this rated so highly? Well, if you\u2019re playing such a high\n\t\tlevel Assassin, I would assume your whole party has bought into the Surprise\n\t\tattack way of doing things. With even a small amount of magical support,\n\t\tSurprise is far easier to achieve.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"inquisitive\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/rogue#Inquisitive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inquisitive<\/a> <sup>(<\/sup><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be really good at Insight and Perception, this is the way to\n\tdo it.

It\n\twould be great in a campaign that includes lots of traps, hidden doors, and\n\tpeople who lie to you, but in situations not specifically tailored to the\n\tInquisitive&#8217;s skillset they fall back on basic Rogue class features. In\n\tcombat, the Inquisitive&#8217;s only new features are Insightful Fighting and Eye\n\tfor Weakness. Insightful Fighting can be replaced by having one ally who&#8217;s\n\tfighting in melee, and Eye for Weakness is weak compared to other subclass\n\tfeatures at the same level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/inquisitive\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"29663\">Inquisitive Rogue Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ear for Deceit<\/span>: This only applies to\n\t\tWisdom (Insight) check to determine if a creature is lying, and while it&#8217;s\n\t\tnice to have that level of insurance, it&#8217;s still only situationally useful\n\t\tand it&#8217;s easy to misread this and assume that it applies to Eye for Detail\n\t\tand Insightful Fighting.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eye for Detail<\/span>: Finding hidden creatures\n\t\tnormally requires an Action to attempt, which is a serious problem if you&#8217;re\n\t\tever attacked by stealthy enemies which like to hide and snipe at you from\n\t\tafar. Of course, in a typical party you can handle invisible enemies with\n\t\tmagical options like Faerie Fire or Glitterdust.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Insightful Fighting<\/span>: I hope you took\n\t\tExpertise with Insight, because it&#8217;s your signature feature and if you can&#8217;t\n\t\treliably pass this check you&#8217;re basically back to core rogue features in\n\t\tcombat.\n\t\t<p>The effect lasts for a full minute so you have plenty of time to benefit\n\t\t\twithout repeatedly spending your Bonus Action on the same target. Even if\n\t\t\tyou lose the opposed check, you can try again the following round, and the\n\t\t\tevery round after that until you succeed. Of course, if you have another\n\t\t\tally fighting your target in melee, this gets you absolutely nothing.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Compare this to the Steady Aim Optional Class Feature: Steady Aim is a\n\t\t\tBonus Action, doesn&#8217;t require a check that you might fail, and grants\n\t\t\tAdvantage on your attack rather than simply enabling you to use Sneak\n\t\t\tAttack. Insightful Fighting lasts for a full minute, but only if you don&#8217;t change\n\t\t\ttargets.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Steady Eye<\/span>: Combined with Eye for Detail\n\t\tyou&#8217;re extremely reliable at spotting traps and hidden enemies, but the\n\t\tlimitation on movement might be a problem in combat, especially if you&#8217;re\n\t\tbuilt for melee. If the movement issue isn&#8217;t a problem, this makes\n\t\tInsightful Fighting much more reliable.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Unerring Eye<\/span>: Wisdom isn&#8217;t an especially\n\t\tuseful ability score for most rogues beyond skills, so it&#8217;s frustrating that\n\t\tthis ability is Wisdom-based. The effect is extremely useful, but you&#8217;ll\n\t\tlikely get no more than two or three uses per day, and you need to either\n\t\talready know that illusions are present or you need to guess.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eye for Weakness<\/span>: Extra damage never\n\t\thurts, but it&#8217;s not very exciting and compared to other subclasses this is a\n\t\tpittance. Compare this to the Thief&#8217;s Thief&#8217;s Reflexes feature or the\n\t\tAssassin&#8217;s Death Strike feature. In a long fight, additional Sneak Attack\n\t\tdamage may eventually outshine other options, but a typical fight lasts just\n\t\t3 to 4 rounds, and you need to climb the mountain of additional damage\n\t\tthat&#8217;s being dealt by the Arcane Trickster with bonus damage from spells\n\t\tlike Shadow Blade, the Assassin with Assasinate, and the Thief with a second\n\t\tturn from Thief&#8217;s Reflexes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mastermind\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/rogue#Mastermind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastermind<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Mastermind Rogue works best in a game with a lot of intrigue and social interactions.

In combat, knowing the target&#8217;s lowest mental stat can be helpful\n\t\t\tinformation for your party&#8217;s spellcasters so that they can target your\n\t\t\tenemies with save-or-suck spells.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Misdirection<\/span>: I think the intent is to use\n\t\tenemy creatures as cover while you&#8217;re being attacked at range, but that\n\t\tsimply doesn&#8217;t happen. Few enemies rely on ranged attacks, and most which do\n\t\tso can also produce area effects, or they could target one of your allies,\n\t\tsuch as that soft, squishy Wizard over there.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>In the rare situation where you are targeted by a ranged attack, your\n\t\t\tbest bet is to hide behind an ally. It can be a bit rude to shuffle\n\t\t\tattacks onto an ally, but if you&#8217;re using a well-armored ally as cover,\n\t\t\tsometimes your ally may be better suited to absorb the attack, and your\n\t\t\tparty&#8217;s Defender generally goes into combat explicitly hoping that they&#8217;ll\n\t\t\tdraw attacks away from you and your other squishy allies.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Lightfoot Halflings have the ability to hide behind creatures one size\n\t\t\tlarger than they are, which will often also give you cover.

What if, like, you got class\n\tfeatures from talking to dead people? And what if those class features\n\tincluded necrotic damage and turning into a ghost? Enter the Phantom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Phantom is a novel exploration of interactions with the dead as a class\n\tfeature, making necrotic damage and death-related stuff available to a class\n\twith no ability to cast spells. Normally, interacting with the dead is\n\tprimarily done by clerics and certain necromancy spells. The Phantom has a\n\tmuch more direct connection to the spirits of the dead, gaining proficiencies,\n\tdamage output, and the ability to turn (mostly) into a ghost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Phantom&#8217;s most novel and interesting mechanic is their pool of Soul\n\tTrinkets. These trinkets allow the Phantom to fuel their most interesting\n\tfeatures by gathering trinkets when creatures die nearby, then spend those\n\ttrinkets for extra damage or to ask dead creatures questions. Tragically, this\n\tfeature doesn&#8217;t become available until 9th level. Waiting for creatures to die\n\trather than being reduced to 0 hit points also makes it important for the DM\n\tto track death saves for enemy creatures, which is a minor annoyance that most\n\tDMs are happy to avoid, so discuss how your DM would prefer to handle that\n\taspect of the subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players may also find that Wails from the Grave is underwhelming at low levels compared to other subclass features at the same level. Phantom definitely builds slowly, and may not feel really satisfying until level 9. As a quick fix, give players the Soul Trinket mechanic at level 3 instead of level 9, but don&#8217;t grant them Advantage on Constitution saves or the ability to spend Soul Trinkets to ask dead creatures questions until they reach level 9. Essentially, you&#8217;re splitting the Tokens of the Departed feature into two. At low levels, the player&#8217;s low Proficiency Bonus will keep Wails from the Grave from getting out of hand, and even if they&#8217;re spamming it constantly the damage is minor so it&#8217;s not going to result in a massive boost in damage output. This change will make the subclass more satisfying to play and will give access to the subclass&#8217;s signature features earlier without significantly changing the balance of the subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/phantom\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"13090\">Phantom Rogue Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Whispers of the Dead<\/span>: The ability to pick\n\t\tup a proficiency on short notice is incredibly useful. If you can combine\n\t\tthis with other buffs like Enhance Ability and Guidance, you can get around\n\t\tnearly any skill-based or tool-based challenge if you have time to prepare.\n\t\t<p>Most of the time you can leave this on a low-importance skill\n\t\t\tproficiency, but most tools won&#8217;t come up unless you&#8217;ve got time for a\n\t\t\tshort rest. No one is going to ambush you and ask you to break out the\n\t\t\tBrewer&#8217;s Tools and make them some beer (I&#8217;ve made beer. It takes a few\n\t\t\thours, and spending one hour to take a nap first isn&#8217;t a big ask. I&#8217;ve\n\t\t\tdone that, too.).<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wails from the Grave<\/span>: Starts very slow\n\t\t(1d6 twice a day), but ramps up exponentially as your Sneak Attack damage\n\t\tand your Proficiency Bonus increase. The damage is necrotic, which is rarely\n\t\tresisted, and it&#8217;s automatic provided that you made a successful Sneak\n\t\tAttack so it&#8217;s great for enemies that may be difficult to hit. Even as it\n\t\tgains in power, you don&#8217;t want to throw this around needlessly. You&#8217;ll never\n\t\tget more than 6 uses (not counting Tokens of the Departed) and they&#8217;ll never\n\t\tdeal more than 5d6 damage, so you need to be strategic.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tokens of the Departed<\/span>: I love everything\n\t\tabout this feature. The theme is cool, the mechanic is fun, the resource\n\t\tpool is appropriately limited but easy to restore, and the benefits are fun,\n\t\tthematically appropriate, and really good. You get three benefits at level\n\t\t9, but at level 13 you can recharge Ghost Walk with a trinket and at level\n\t\t17 you wake up from longs rests with a free soul tinket.\n\t\t<p>The first benefit is without doubt the best of the three, and it&#8217;s good\n\t\t\tenough that you should nearly always keep a Soul Trinket handy. Advantage\n\t\t\ton Constitution saves isn&#8217;t quite as good as proficiency, but it&#8217;s close.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, the Phantom doesn&#8217;t need to worry about Concentration\n\t\t\tunless you take Magic Initiate or Multiclass, so you don&#8217;t get to wave\n\t\t\tyour token around every time you cast a Concentration spell.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The second benefit helps with Wails of the Grave, and it&#8217;s easily your\n\t\t\tmost frequent way to spend trinkets. Wails from the Grave is a decent bit\n\t\t\tof damage by this level, matching what a spellcaster can do with many\n\t\t\tcantrips. However, the Proficiency Bonus usage limit won&#8217;t get you far, so\n\t\t\tyou can destroy a trinket to get a free bit of damage. Every time you\n\t\t\tthink &#8220;is a new trinket worth my Reaction right now?&#8221;, remember that it&#8217;s\n\t\t\ta small pile of easy necrotic damage when you need it later.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The third benefit is basically Speak with Dead, but you only get one\n\t\t\tquestion. Otherwise, it has all the same problems where the subject can be\n\t\t\tvague, misleading, or otherwise unhelpful. Very situational, but if you\n\t\t\tcan somehow make it work it&#8217;s excellent. This also has a curious edge case\n\t\t\twhere the creature which allowed you to produce the token might be alive\n\t\t\tagain, especially in cases where your allies die and a raised from the\n\t\t\tdead. You might use this to ask a question of a creature who is currently\n\t\t\talive, leading to hilarious situations where the ghostly apparition of a\n\t\t\tliving creature appears in the same room as that creature only to say\n\t\t\tsomething totally unhelpful before disappearing.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The one flaw in the whole thing is that it falls prey to the classic &#8220;Bag\n\t\t\tof Rats&#8221; trick. You can kill any creature to generate a new Soul Trinket,\n\t\t\tso if you have a bag of rats or access to other easily-expendable\n\t\t\tcreatures, you can kill them out of combat to recharge. Your DM might\n\t\t\tjustifiably make some adjustments to disallow that (requiring a CR above 0\n\t\t\tmay be sufficient, especially at 9th level), so try not to lean on the\n\t\t\tabuse case too much. This generally won&#8217;t work with summoned creatures\n\t\t\t(they need to die, not just be reduced to 0 hit points), and since death\n\t\t\tand being reduced to 0 hp suddenly mean different things, I encourage DMs\n\t\t\tto start tracking death saves for enemies.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghost Walk<\/span>: A 1-minute duration on this\n\t\twould be good. A 10-minute duration on this is fantastic. 10 minutes is\n\t\tobviously plenty if you&#8217;re using this in combat, but it&#8217;s more important\n\t\toutside of combat where you might need to move through walls, floors, or\n\t\tceilings while scouting. The 10 ft. move speed is tiny, but remember that\n\t\tyou have Cunning Action so you can Dash as a Bonus Action. If you can get\n\t\tbuffs like Longstrider, they&#8217;ll do a lot to help both because any flat\n\t\tnumeric increase is relatively large compared to 10 ft. and because you can\n\t\tessentially double the effect by dashing without spending your Action.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Death\u2019s Friend<\/span>: At this level Wails of\n\t\tthe Grave deals 4d6 damage, just short of its maximum at 6d6. Adding that\n\t\tdamage to your primary target when you use Wails of the Grave means that\n\t\tyour Sneak Attack deals 50% more damage, though it&#8217;s not clear if you can\n\t\tmultiply the damage on a critical hit. I believe that you can&#8217;t because the\n\t\tdamage is applied to the target from a separate source rather than added to\n\t\tthe damage of original attack like effects like Divine Smite.\n\t\t<p>The second benefit of this feature ensures that you have at least one\n\t\t\tSoul Trinket at the end of a Long Rest. This is a crucial benefit so that\n\t\t\tyou can benefit from Advantage on your Constitution saves, so try not to\n\t\t\tburn your trinket the first time you want to use Wail of Souls. But since\n\t\t\tyou get the trinket for free, this also makes it easier to spend your last\n\t\t\ttrinket right before you take a long rest. Of course, you could just use\n\t\t\tthe bag of rats trick to get free Soul Trinkets, so this benefit isn&#8217;t as\n\t\t\timpactful as WotC wanted it to be when they wrote it.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"scout\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/rogue#Scout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scout<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Scouts easily outcompete Rangers in skill use with Nature and Survival, but\n\tlack any of the actual Ranger flavor.

Cunning Action can also solve\n\t\tthe same problem, so Skirmisher feels like a miniscule addition to your\n\t\tcapabilities.\n\t\t<p>You can&#8217;t use this until an enemy ends their turn, so they&#8217;ve already\n\t\t\tdone any attacking which they plan to do, and you may have used your\n\t\t\tReaction on Uncanny Dodge to mitigate damage from a hit. If you&#8217;re built\n\t\t\tfor melee, using this often means spending more movement on your turn to\n\t\t\tget back into melee, so reserving your Reaction for Uncanny Dodge is a\n\t\t\tbetter investment. If you&#8217;re built to fight at range, you can use this to\n\t\t\tget out of almost any creature&#8217;s reach, then you&#8217;ll still have your\n\t\t\tmovement and your Bonus Action on your turn to use Cunning Action for\n\t\t\tsomething else more exciting than Disengage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Survivalist<\/span>: Two new skills and Expertise\n\t\tin both of them, giving you Expertise in a total of four things (provided\n\t\tthat you&#8217;re not also getting Expertise from other places). \nExpertise will\n\t\teasily make up for a relatively poor ability scores in Intelligence and\/or Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Superior Mobility<\/span>: Really helpful in\n\t\tconjunction with Skirmisher and your need to stay as far away as you\n\t\tcan.

Rolling dice to use your subclass features is almost never a gamble for the Soulknife, and few other classes\/subclasses with similar resources can say that.

Even the Psi Warrior gambles their Psionic Energy Dice to some degree.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With some exceptions, the Soulknife <em>always<\/em> get something for their Psionic Energy Dice, and if you fail on whatever roll you often get to keep the die you used.

This is a conversation to have with your group and deciding the answer is beyond the scope of this article, but I have a suggestion for how to run it: because you choose to roll the Psi-die after you see what you rolled and the results of the initial d20 roll, my suggestion is that the Psi-die is only considered spent if the results are different after rolling it.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Whispers<\/span>: So what if your party always had walkie-talkies?

You can attack with the blades equally well in melee and at\n\t\trange, and with a range of 60 feet your range is much greater than that of a\n\t\trogue using daggers, and this is one of the best features if you want to be a ranged rogue. The fact that this deals psychic damage is great, too,\n\t\tsince it&#8217;s so rarely resisted and easily bypasses common resistances to\n\t\tnon-magical weapon damage. Oh, and it&#8217;s a d6 damage die instead of the\n\t\tdagger&#8217;s d4.\n\t\t<p>The ability to make a second attack as a Bonus Action if you have another\n\t\t\tfree hand is great. Two-weapon fighting is already a great fallback option\n\t\t\tand since you don&#8217;t need to draw daggers to repeatedly throw them you\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t need to strain your Free Item Interaction every turn to keep your\n\t\t\thands full of pointy things. But the benefits go further. The second\n\t\t\tattack applies your Ability Modifier to damage since you&#8217;re not actually\n\t\t\tusing the two-weapon fighting rules. Sure, the second blade uses a\n\t\t\tslightly smaller damage die, but who cares? That&#8217;s such a tiny,\n\t\t\tmeaningless difference that I&#8217;m surprised they bothered to print it.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>However, this feature does have some drawbacks. The blades only manifest when you take the Attack action, so you&#8217;ll be unarmed after\n\t\t\tattacking with both blades, which means that you can&#8217;t use Opportunity\n\t\t\tAttacks to get extra Sneak Attack on other people&#8217;s turns (unarmed strikes\n\t\t\tare still possible, but don&#8217;t qualify for Sneak Attack) and you won&#8217;t benefit\nfrom allies using things like a Battlemaster using Commander\u2019s Strike or Order Domain Clerics\u2019 Voice of Authority feature. Remember that Sneak Attack is once per turn, not per round, so you\u2019re giving up a substantial piece of rogue optimization. These also don\u2019t gain attack bonuses like a magic weapon, and you\u2019re locked into a damage type that some things (unintelligent creatures, especially) have unmitigatable resistance or even immunity to.<\/p>\n<p>You can mitigate\n\t\t\tthe off-turn attack limitations somewhat by drawing and stowing a dagger before or after attacking on\n\t\t\talternate turns, but that trades your Free Item Interaction every turn for\n\t\t\tthe ability to make meaningful attacks as a Reaction every other turn at most.\n\t\t\tThat&#8217;s a hard trade, not to mention how annoying it is. You could also get\n\t\t\tFighting Style (Thrown Weapon) which will allow you to draw a dagger as\n\t\t\tpart of the making the Opportunity Attack, but that may not be worth the\n\t\t\tcost to do so unless you&#8217;re really leaning into the ability to Sneak Attack with\nyour Reaction.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Also, since your Psychic Blades can only deal psychic damage, if you run\n\t\t\tinto something immune to it you lose half the functions of your subclass.\n\t\t\tYou&#8217;ll need to carry a dagger (ideally a magic one) as a backup.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul Blades<\/span>: Two ways to turn your Psychic\n\t\tEnergy Dice into solutions to frequent problems. This is also the first time where your psychic dice are consistently useful in combat.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Homing Strikes<\/span>: Use this on the last\n\t\t\t\tattack of your turn (maybe you don&#8217;t want to attack with both of your\n\t\t\t\tPsychic Blades every turn; Cunning Action also exists), provided that\n\t\t\t\tyou can deal Sneak Attack with that attack. If you miss the \n\t\t\t\tattack roll, you can try to turn a near miss into a hit. If you still miss,\n\t\t\t\tthis costs you nothing. If you do hit, you&#8217;re trading your Psionic\n\t\t\t\tEnergy Die for a Sneak Attack. That&#8217;s a very good trade a lot of the\ntime. Even so, you don&#8217;t want to use this constantly because it will deplete your psionic dice pool too quickly. Use it when you need it to land that crucial blow.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Teleportation<\/span>: A bonus action short ranged combat teleport. Even moving\n\t\t\t\tthe minimum of 10 feet is enough to get you out of grapples and many\n\t\t\t\tarea control effects, as well as through many tight openings like arrow\n\t\t\t\tslits. However, if you need to cross a large gap you&#8217;ll find that the\n\t\t\t\tunpredictable range is frustrating. Fortunately, you choose whether or\n\t\t\t\tnot you want to teleport <em>after<\/em> you roll the die so you never\n\t\t\t\tneed to worry about accidentaly teleporting yourself above a pit of acid\n\t\t\t\tor something, but you&#8217;re committing to spend the die before you roll it\n\t\t\t\tso look for other options if you&#8217;re not likely to get as far as you need\n\t\t\t\tto go.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Veil<\/span>: Invisibility for a full\n\t\thour, and you get it once per day for free. An hour is a long time, and you\n\t\tcan do a lot of things without breaking Invisibility, including things like\n\t\tdisarming traps and taking the Help action to help allies in combat. Combined with Psychic Whispers and Expertise, you&#8217;re an amazing scout.\n<p>You can\n\t\tspend a Psionic Energy Die to recharge it, but that&#8217;s an easy way to spend\n\t\tyour dice very quickly when mundane Stealth checks will often suffice.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rend Mind<\/span>: Note quite as good as Hold\n\t\tMonster, but about as close as you can get without casting it. Stunned takes\n\t\tthe target out of the fight and makes it very easy to kill them. Since the\n\t\tDC is Dexterity-based your DC will match that of spellcasters, and the one-minute\nduration is nice.\n<p>You get this\n\t\tonce per day for free, but spending a quarter of your Psionic Energy\n\t\tDice to recharge it is very costly, so you want to save this for powerful single\nfoes rather than using this in every encounter.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"swashbuckler\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/rogue#Swashbuckler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swashbuckler<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Rogue&#8217;s biggest challenge in combat is applying Sneak Attack reliably.\n\tWhile that&#8217;s relatively easy in 5e, there are still times when you won&#8217;t\n\tmanage to Sneak Attack. The Swashbuckler all but eliminates these times,\n\tmaking the Rogue an even more reliable source of damage. In addition, the\n\tSwashbuckler has fantastic abilities for moving through combat, evading\n\tenemies, and even forcing them to engage the Swashbuckler, thereby allowing\n\tthe Rogue to serve as the party&#8217;s Defender on top of their typical roles as a\n\tScount and Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of their excellent combat abilities, the Swashbuckler encourages you to invest in Charisma and play a Face, allowing the Swashbuckler Rogue to thrive both in combat and in social situations. If you diversify your skill proficiencies, you can be just as effective in exploration scenarios as other rogues, but you may find that you&#8217;re strained for skill proficiencies unless you get extra from your race or pick up a feat like Skill Expert. It&#8217;s hard to be amazing at all three pillars of the game (exploration, social interaction, and combat), but the Swashbuckler manages it without relying on magic. Few characters can say that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/swashbuckler\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14111\">Swashbuckler Rogue Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fancy Footwork<\/span>: You only need to\n\t\t<em>attack<\/em> the target, not hit them, so if you miss and don&#8217;t want to\n\t\tstay in melee range you&#8217;re free to retreat unimpeded. Using two\n\t\tlight-weapons for two-weapon fighting allows you to move past and attack two\n\t\tenemies if you feel the need. The choice between using Cunning Action to\n\t\tDisengage and relying on Fancy Footwork will depend both on what you&#8217;re\n\t\twielding and on how many enemies you need to evade.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rakish Audacity<\/span>: This is absurdly good.\n\t\tAny Rogue can Sneak Attack if an ally is within 5 feet of the target. Rakish\n\t\tAudacity allows you to Sneak Attack if no one except the target is adjacent\n\t\tto you, which means that as long as you&#8217;re not getting mobbed you can\n\t\treliably Sneak Attack whenever you hit.\n\t\t<p>As long as you can get away from other enemies (such as by using Cunning\n\t\t\tAction to Disengage) you&#8217;re nearly guaranteed to be able to Sneak Attack.\n\t\t\tSince you still need to be within 5 feet you&#8217;re likely making melee\n\t\t\tattacks, but you could technically use a crossbow with Crossbow Expert.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Oh, and as if this wasn&#8217;t absurdly good already, you add your Charisma\n\t\t\tbonus to Initiative checks on top of your Dexterity.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache<\/span>: Be sure to take Expertise in\n\t\tPersuasion to make this work. It&#8217;s worth the investment.\n\t\t<p>Tanking generally isn&#8217;t in the Rogue&#8217;s skillset, but the first portion of\n\t\t\tthis feature is a taunt mechanic. The DM could technically end the ability\n\t\t\tby having the creature walk out of the 60 foot range before returning, but\n\t\t\tthat would be a cheap metagame trick, so feel free to shame your DM if\n\t\t\tthey try it. With passable AC and Uncanny Dodge, you can easily handle\n\t\t\tbeing one creature&#8217;s sole focus for extended periods, leaving the rest of\n\t\t\tyour party to handle the rest of the encounter until one section of the\n\t\t\tparty comes to help the other.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Out of combat, you can use this to Charm creatures, making them a very\n\t\t\tloyal friend for a very brief period. The effect doesn&#8217;t let the creature\n\t\t\tknow it was charmed or that you did anything unusual, and since it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tgrant temporary immunity or have a usage limitation, you can use Panache\n\t\t\ton the same creature repeatedly to keep it Charmed. If you can succeed on\n\t\t\tthe initial Charisma (Persuasion) check, this will trivialize social\n\t\t\tinteractions with single creatures that aren&#8217;t already hostile to you.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Elegant Maneuver<\/span>: Advantage is great,\n\t\tespecially on a skill like Athletics which is used to Shove enemies prone.\n\t\tUnfortunately, this uses your Bonus Action just to grant you Advantage, so\n\t\tyou still need to use your Action to use the skill, leaving you no\n\t\topportunity to attack. You&#8217;re most likely to use this to escape grapples, to\n\t\tleap over difficult terrain, or do other fancy stuff like that.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Master Duelist<\/span>: Sometimes you can&#8217;t risk\n\t\tmissing, and in those cases this is a life saver. Most of the time you can\n\t\tstill use Fancy Footwork to move away and return to attack later, but\n\t\tsometimes that just isn&#8217;t an option and you need to deal damage right away\n\t\trather than letting things drag on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thief\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/rogue#Thief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thief<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Thief is the iconic Rogue, but that is not to say that it&#8217;s boring. A\n\tThief is reliable and very effective at the tasks which you most associate\n\twith Rogues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the Thief&#8217;s complexity is tied up in Fast Hands, and if you can&#8217;t get a good understanding of Fast Hands you&#8217;re going to struggle with the Thief.

This is the most complex part of the Thief, so I\n\t\tstrongly recommend reading my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/fast-hands\">Practical Guide to Fast Hands<\/a>\n\t\tto get clarity on how this works.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Second-Story Work<\/span>: Very situational, and\n\t\tseveral years into 5e&#8217;s life, this feels like a weird relic from much\n\t\tearlier in the games history. At this point, there are abundant options for\n\t\tclimb speeds and magical flight, so this is only impactful when those\n\t\toptions are unavailable to you. Still, adding up to 5 feet to your jump\n\t\tdistance makes it easy to jump over difficult terrain and other\n\t\tobstacles.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Supreme Sneak<\/span>: If you combine this with\n\t\tExpertise, you are as close to undetectable as you can get without being\n\t\tmagically silenced and invisible. But as nice as this is, you can replicate\n\t\tit with a Cloak of Elvenkind, which is an Uncommon magic item.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Use Magic Device<\/span>: This opens up all\n\t\tmanner of weapons, wands, and staves which are normally limited to specific\n\t\tcharacters. Go poke around in the magic item sections of my class handbooks\n\t\tand look for treasures to steal.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thief&#8217;s Reflexes<\/span>: Two entire turns is\n\t\tcrazy. You can Sneak Attack twice and use Fast Hands to throw two vials of\n\t\talchemist&#8217;s fire, possibly all before enemies get a chance to act if your\n\t\tinitiative roll was really
