In most cases, you&#8217;ll get more damage out of Fire\n\t\t\tBolt, and you have a strict limitation on how many cantrips you know so\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s hard to justify taking Acid Splash instead. Still, for the Alchemist\n\t\t\tthis may be your go-to offensive option since it works with Alchemical\n\t\t\tSavant. Like most other multi-target spells, you roll damage just once and\n\t\t\teach creature makes its own saving throw, so you can apply the damage\n\t\t\tbonus to both targets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Booming<\/span>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Blade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent for the Armorer and the Battle Smith, but most other artificers should never be\n\t\tin a position to use this.\n\t\t<p>Note that Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything published an updated version of\n\t\t\tBooming Blade.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Bonfire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: A low-budget area control spell. It does as much initial damage as most\n\t\tcantrips, but the ongoing damage only applies when a creature enters the\n\t\tarea or ends their turn there, so you can only get extra damage if you can\n\t\tforce an enemy into the space or if you cast it on them and they remain in\n\t\ttheir space. If you have an ally who likes to grapple enemies, or if you\n\t\tneed to block a narrow space like a hall or doorway, this is extremely\n\t\tuseful if you&#8217;re not already commiting Concentration to something else.\n\t\t<p>However, Create Bonfire&#8217;s reliance on Concentration can become a problem\n\t\t\tas you gain levels because Concentration is such a precious resource, and\n\t\t\tmany of the best spells require Concentration. If your game doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tinclude an option to retrain cantrips, I would skip Create Bonfire\n\t\t\tentirely. If you have a way to retrain cantrips, consider taking Create\n\t\t\tBonfire at low levels, but be prepared to replace it if you find that\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not using it consistently.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dancing Lights<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An amusing distraction, but you can usually accomplish the same thing\n\t\tusing Mage Hand and a candle or torch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire Bolt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The go-to damage option for everyone except the Battlesmith.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Frostbite<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Low damage for a cantrip (d6-based), but the big appeal is Disadvantage\n\t\ton the target&#8217;s next weapon attack. Unfortunately, it works on Constitution\n\t\tsaving throws, and those tend to be relatively high compared to other saving\n\t\tthrows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Green-Flame<\/span>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Blade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent for the Armorer and the Battle Smith, but most other artificers\n\t\tshould never be in a position to use this.\n\t\t<p>Note that Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything published an updated version of\n\t\t\tGreen-Flame Blade.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guidance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: As long as you&#8217;re not concentrating on something with a long duration\n\t\tbetween fights, you should be constantly throwing this on your allies. Your\n\t\tRogue should have Guidance for every skill check they make while searching,\n\t\tsneaking, handling traps, etc. If you&#8217;re not already concentrating on\n\t\tsomething, someone in the party should walk into every fight with Guidance\n\t\trunning so that they can use it on their Initiative roll (remember: it&#8217;s a\n\t\tDexterity check!).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Disposable magic light is fantastic, but if you don&#8217;t have room for the\n\t\tcantrip you&#8217;ll do fine with torches.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Lure<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but potentially useful for melee artificers to pull enemies\n\t\tinto melee. Despite the 15-foot range, this can be a great option for melee\n\t\tartificers. Against enemies with poor Strength (like many enemy\n\t\tspellcasters), you can use this to drag them into melee with you and force\n\t\tthem to teleport or Disengage in order to get away from you unharmed. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re flying, you may even be able to pull enemies into the air to cause a\n\t\tsmall amount of falling damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Hand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The ability to move objects at a safe distance is profoundly useful. Use\n\t\tit to pull levers, open doors, sort your laundry, and all manner of other\n\t\timportant but potentially hazardous tasks where you wouldn&#8217;t want to risk\n\t\tyour own hands.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Stone<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 1d6+Int is an average of 6.5 at first level (assuming 16 Intelligence).\n\t\tThat&#8217;s 1 more than Fire Bolt&#8217;s 5.5 average, and it improves when your\n\t\tIntelligence improves. However, once cantrip damage starts to improve Magic\n\t\tStone falls behind unless you get Extra Attack. If you do get Extra Attack,\n\t\tMagic Stone&#8217;s average damage will exceed that of Fire Bolt until level 17.\n\t\tEven then, if you enhance a sling with Enhanced Weapon, the +2 bonus to\n\t\tattack and damage will keep your Sling+Magic Stone combination equal to Fire\n\t\tBolt&#8217;s damage output. The combination of benefits makes this an enticing\n\t\toption for the Battlesmith until you gain Battle Ready at 3rd level because\n\t\tit allows you to attack using your Intelligence modifier in a way which\n\t\ttransitions nicely into using another weapon like a crossbow or pistol.\n\t\t<p>However, you need two hands to use a sling (you need a free hand to load\n\t\t\tit), and Repeating Shot won&#8217;t load your enchanted pebbles for you. The\n\t\t\tmost likely case for this is for artificers to use this at levels 1\n\t\t\tthrough 4, then switch back to Fire Bolt (fortunately, artificers can\n\t\t\tretrain cantrips unlike most spellcasters). For the Battlesmith, you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\tlikely use Magic Stone at levels 1 and 2, then switch to using a weapon\n\t\t\tonce you can use Battle Ready. The 1d6+Int from a hand crossbow will deal\n\t\t\tthe same damage, but you won&#8217;t need to spend Bonus Actions to constantly\n\t\t\tcharge pebbles.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mending<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The Artillerist and the Battlesmith need this cantrip by 3rd level. You\n\t\tget too much out of Mending to live without it. Unfortunately, it takes a\n\t\tfull minute to cast so your party might need to get accustomed to keeping\n\t\tthemselves busy while you magically glue your constructs back together. If you&#8217;re playing\nSpelljammer, you&#8217;ll want this to repair your ship.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Message<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational. Use this to send messages without revealing your position.\n\t\tOf course, the spell requires Verbal components and it&#8217;s not clear how loud\n\t\tverbal components are intended to be, so take precautions if possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison Spray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Constitution saves are frequently high, and the range is short enough\n\t\tthat it&#8217;s basically only usable in melee. Poison resistance and immunity are\n\t\talso common, so the damage type doesn&#8217;t help either.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prestidigitation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Versatile and fantastic, a creative rogue can do a lot between this and\n\t\tMinor Illusion. For suggestions on how to use Prestidigitation to its\n\t\tfullest, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/prestidigitation\">Practical Guide to Prestidigitation<\/a>.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ray of Frost<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You have a limited number of cantrips, Frostbite is much better, and the\n\t\tneed diversifying the damage types you can deal is too important to take two\n\t\tcold damage cantrips.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Considerably more difficult to use than Guidance. Your best bet is to\n\t\tthrow this on an ally before going into combat, but if you have that luxury\n\t\tyou should be casting a better Concentration spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shocking Grasp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The damage is worse than Fire Bolt and it&#8217;s touch range. Advantage\n\t\tagainst enemies in metal armor is nowhere near enough to make this\n\t\tappealing. If you hit the target can&#8217;t take Reactions like Opportunity\n\t\tAttacks or casting Counterspell, but I still don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough to\n\t\tjustify rushing into melee to use this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spare the Dying<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Buy a Healer&#8217;s Kit instead. You don&#8217;t need proficiency to use it to\n\t\tstabilize a creature and it takes the same Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sword Burst<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent for handling crowds in melee. Melee artificer subclasses like\n\t\tthe Battle Smith will find this very effective, but even the Artillerist may\n\t\tfind it tempting since Arcane Firearm&#8217;s damage bonus applies to all of the\n\t\ttargets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thorn Whip<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially fantastic for the Battlesmith. You can use this to pull\n\t\tenemies away from frail allies, or to pull them into your melee reach. The\n\t\tdamage is unremarkable, so this likely isn&#8217;t your primary source of damage\n\t\toutput.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderclap<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: Thunder damage is worse than Sword Burst&#8217;s force damage, and Thunderclap\n\t\tuses Constitution saves, which tend to be high.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Absorb Elements<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: You get spellcasting later and slower than anyone else, so you have very\n\t\tfew options for protecting yourself from non-weapon damage. This will handle\n\t\tthat issue, but it will eat your spell slots quickly so be sure to eliminate\n\t\tthe source of the elemental damage as quickly as possible so that you don&#8217;t\n\t\trun through your spell slots too quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alarm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Not worth a spell slot, but it&#8217;s great to cast this at least once as a\n\t\tRitual any time that you take a long rest. But you may want to wait until\n\t\tyou&#8217;re high enough level that you don&#8217;t mind spending one of your prepared\n\t\tspells to keep it handy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Catapult<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: Where Catapult shines is its reliability: If a target passes their saving\n\t\tthrow, the object continues moving until it hits something or runs out of\n\t\trange. If you can line up two or more targets, you odds of hitting and\n\t\tdealing damage improve considerably. If your DM allows it, you might be able\n\t\tto Catapult items like Acid or Alchemist&#8217;s Fire to add additional\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cure Wounds<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Unless you&#8217;re an alchemist, this is your best way to restore hit points\n\t\tin combat. The ability to bring dying allies back into a fight is too\n\t\tpowerful and important to forgo, so you absolutely want this. If you&#8217;re an\n\t\talchemist, you get Healing Word prepared for free, and that&#8217;s a better\n\t\toption in combat so you can typically skip this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Detect Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Someone in the party needs this, and ideally it should be someone with\n\t\tthe ability to cast rituals. Unless there&#8217;s a wizard in the party, that&#8217;s\n\t\tprobably you. Unfortunately, that creates a near-permanent tax on your\n\t\tnumber of prepared spells, but this is simply too important in DnD to go\n\t\twithout it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise Self<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Learning a single spell is cheaper than proficiency in a Disguise\n\t\tKit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Expeditious Retreat<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational and poorly named. Expiditious Retreat is great for chases and\n\t\tfor running long distances, but those situations aren&#8217;t common enough to\n\t\tjustify preparing this unless you know it&#8217;s going to happen. The duration is\n\t\tgood and Dash as a bonus action offers a lot of extra speed, but since this\n\t\trequires Concentration you&#8217;ll almost always want a different buff\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Faerie Fire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The lowest-level option to deal with invisible creatures, and Advantage\n\t\ton attacks against creatures which fail their save means that this remains a\n\t\tpowerful support option well into high levels, especially against bug bulky\n\t\tenemies with high AC but poor Dexterity saves. Hopefully you won&#8217;t run into\n\t\tany invisible creatures at 1st level, but but it&#8217;s important to have some\n\t\tway to deal with invisibility just in case.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">False Life<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great defensive buff. This can close the gap in hit points between the\n\t\tArtificer and more durable classes like the Fighter. If you can, save False\n\t\tLife for a Spell-Storing Item, and pile it on top of Aid if you can spare\n\t\tthe spell slots to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feather Fall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Someone in the party needs to have this at all times, and you&#8217;re someone.\n\t\tFalling damage is a silly, embarassing way to die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Grease<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Even if creatures fall prone, that only eats half of their movement, and\n\t\twith a radius of just 10 feet most creatures can walk out unimpeded once\n\t\tthey&#8217;re no longer prone.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Identify<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Even if you encounter a magic item, this typically isn&#8217;t necessary\n\t\tbecause you can usually identify a magic item by spending a Short Rest in\n\t\tcontact with it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Jump<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Longstrider<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A helpful buff for highly-mobile characters, and with an hour-long\n\t\tduration it can be a great use of low-level spell slots once your 1st-level\n\t\tspells start lagging in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Purify Food and Drink<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Cast this as a ritual and you&#8217;ll never need to worry about spoiled food\n\t\tagain. One of many reasons that Dungeons and Dragons makes a terrible\n\t\twilderness survival game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanctuary<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially forcing enemies to give up an attack is great, and this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t prevent you from attacking. Sanctuary also has a Bonus Action\n\t\tcasting time, so you can attack or cast a cantrip in the same turn. However,\n\t\tsince Sanctuary allows the attack to retarget their attack, Sanctuary isn&#8217;t\n\t\tas effective against ranged attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snare<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Good for setting a trap, or if you&#8217;re resting somewhere dangerous with a\n\t\tconvenient choke point like a narrow halway. Targets are restrained for at\n\t\tleast one round, which is hopefully enough for you to fight your way out of\n\t\tyour bedroll and grab a weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tasha&#8217;s Caustic Brew<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: This is a challenging spell, but it&#8217;s very effective and the Artificer\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t have another 1st-level AOE damage option. With a 1-minute duration\n\t\tand 2d4 damage each round, you can deal a total of 20d4 damage to each\n\t\ttarget (average 50) which is enough to kill many creatures up to CR 2 or 3\n\t\t(ignore the table in the &#8220;creating a monster&#8221; rules in the DMG; real monster\n\t\tstats tend to have high &#8220;offensive CR&#8221; and low &#8220;defensive CR&#8221; so very few of\n\t\tthem have hit points which line up with those rules).\n\t\t<p>However, you&#8217;re almost certainly not going to get the full damage, and\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s probably fine. If you spend an Action and a spell slot to cast this\n\t\t\tand a target spends their Action to remove the effect, you have traded\n\t\t\tyour Action for theirs and probably also did a bunch of damage. In\n\t\t\tencounters where your party outnumbers your enemies, that&#8217;s a winning\n\t\t\ttrade for you. In encounters where your enemies outnumber your party,\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re in a target-rich environment and may be able to hit 3 or more\n\t\t\ttargets, in which case trading your own Action for one Action from several\n\t\t\tenemies is a great way to offset your enemies&#8217; numerical advantage.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Lines are a difficult AOE because it&#8217;s often difficult to catch more than\n\t\t\ttwo enemies in a straight 5-foot wide line. It&#8217;s also all-or-nothing, so\n\t\t\tcreatures which pass the save are totally unharmed. This requires\n\t\t\tConcentration, so if you don&#8217;t affect multiple targets you may need to\n\t\t\tweigh the benefits of whatever ongoing damage you&#8217;re getting against the\n\t\t\tability to spend your Concentration on a different spell instead.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aid<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With an 8-hour duration and three targets, this is a staple buff that&#8217;s\n\t\tworth casting literally every day. Keep in mind that this actually increases\n\t\tthe targets&#8217; hit point maximum, so temporary hit points can be added, too.\n\t\t<p>Aid&#8217;s casting time allows it to be used in combat, which is unusual but\n\t\t\toffers an interesting option. With three targets and a 30-foot range, you\n\t\t\tcan cast it to both buff and heal your allies during combat. Targets\n\t\t\tcurrent hit points and hit point maximum both increase, so allies at 0 hit\n\t\t\tpoints are healed in addition to having their hit point maximum raised,\n\t\t\tthereby allowing Aid to serve a similar function to Mass Healing Word.\n\t\t\tHowever, since spells don&#8217;t stack with themselves, it&#8217;s hard to repeat\n\t\t\tthis trick. You&#8217;ll need to cast Aid again using higher-level spell slots,\n\t\t\twhich can get expensive quickly, so Mass Healing Word is probably better\n\t\t\tif Aid is already running and if Mass Healing Word is an option for your\n\t\t\tparty.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Alter Self<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Two situational effects and a combat buff. Alter Self allows you to\n\t\thandle breathing underwater and can replace the benefits of Disguise Self.\n\t\tWhile it&#8217;s not especially powerful, but benefits are great on a class like\n\t\tthe Artificer where you get new options slowly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Lock<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Easy to overlook and definitely situational, but surprisingly good. With\n\t\ta permanent duration and the ability to designate creatures who can pass\n\t\tunimpeded and a verbal password, if your party has a permanent base you\n\t\tshould consider putting this on every door and window. If you&#8217;re resting\n\t\tsomewhere dangerous like a dungeon, try to find a room with a door and put\n\t\tthis on the door to make it harder to break or unlock. However, beware of\n\t\tthe 25gp material component cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blur<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A good option if you&#8217;re drawing a lot of fire in combat and your AC isn&#8217;t\n\t\tdoing the job. It has a range of &#8220;self&#8221; so you can&#8217;t share it, which means\n\t\tthat most spellcasters who can cast this are too frail to be drawing attacks\n\t\teven if they have this running.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Continual Flame<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Having reliable, constant light is really nice. Cast this on a shield, a\n\t\tnecklace, a weapon, or maybe a whole bunch of different things to guarantee\n\t\tthat you always have adequate light without casting light or lighting a\n\t\ttorch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Darkvision<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Crucial if your group does anything in the dark and if not everyone has\n\t\tDarkvision from their race.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhance Ability<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Fantastic and versatile. Eagle&#8217;s Splendor on your party&#8217;s Face make\n\t\tsocial interactions much easier, and Bull&#8217;s Strength provides a huge edge\n\t\twhile grappling. Enhance your spellcasting ability (or that of an ally) to\n\t\tget Advantage on the ability checks to counter spells and to dispel\n\t\tmagic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enlarge\/Reduce<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Enlarging your party&#8217;s Defender (possibly yourself) is a great way to\n\t\tdraw fire toward them and away from everyone else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heat Metal<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design, but against nearly any humanoid in metal armor,\n\t\tthis spell is a death sentence. The damage will be slow, but disadvantage on\n\t\tattack rolls and ability checks makes martial characters (the ones typically\n\t\tin metal armor) basically useless. Upcasting the spell is suprisingly\n\t\tefficient since the additional damage applies every round, so if you&#8217;re\n\t\tfortunate enough to encounter a suitable enemy, use this to its fullest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An essential scouting and infiltration tool, and as you get higher-level\n\t\tspell slots you can affect more of your party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lesser Restoration<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Crucial, but you probably don&#8217;t need to bring it every day.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Levitate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A low-level substitute for both telekinesis and flight, but somehow\n\t\t\talso a save-or-suck spell.\n\t\t\t<p>Getting 20 feet off the ground doesn&#8217;t feel safe, but it&#8217;s high enough\n\t\t\t\tthat you can&#8217;t be reached by most creatures which rely solely on melee\n\t\t\t\tattacks, a surprising number of creatures. If you&#8217;re happy fighting at\n\t\t\t\trange, you can comfortably snipe at your foes from relative safety.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>You can also use this to lift heavy objects, allowing you to bypass\n\t\t\t\tsome obstacles by moving them out of the way temporarily. If your party\n\t\t\t\tis light enough, you could levitate a suitable object such as a table\n\t\t\t\tand have your allies sit or stand upon it like an elevator. You can also\n\t\t\t\tuse to rescue allies from things like pit traps, pools of acid, or other\n\t\t\t\tunpleasant things which can&#8217;t fly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Used offensively, this allows you to raise foes off the ground, making\n\t\t\t\tmelee-only creatures essentially harmless so long as the spell persists.\n\t\t\t\tThey&#8217;re basically pi\u00f1atas at that point.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>The 10-minute duration means that you can easily use this to ascend\n\t\t\t\tcliffs or tall walls, or raise targets high enough into the air that you\n\t\t\t\tmight not be able to see them. In 10 minutes you can raise the target\n\t\t\t\t2,000 feet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>Levitate&#8217;s big challenges are its Action economy, Concentration, and\n\t\t\t\tthat it allows a Constitution save. In combat, spending an Action to\n\t\t\t\traise the target an additional 20 feet into the air is rarely worth the\n\t\t\t\tAction cost, though enemies using ranged weapons might be forced to\n\t\t\t\tsuffer Disadvantage on their attacks if you can put them at long range.\n\t\t\t\tConstitution saves are more of a\n\t\t\t\tproblem since Constitution saves are frequently high, and enemies with\n\t\t\t\trelatively poor Constitution save bonuses tend to be spellcasters or\n\t\t\t\tother creatures well-equipped to fight at range.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Kinetic Jaunt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a><\/sup>: This makes opportunity attacks a non-issue, but it&#8217;s not necessarily a go-to option for every\nartificer. However, the Artificer doesn&#8217;t get access to Misty Step, and Boots of the Winding\nPath don&#8217;t help if you start a turn in your enemy&#8217;s reach, so Kinetic Jaunt is a great choice\nfor melee artificer builds, especially if you can combine it with Booming Blade. As you gain\nlevels, you might consider replacing this with Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride, but if you&#8217;re not frequently\nin encounters with numerous enemies, Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride may not be worth the higher-level spell\nslot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Mouth<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational, but it&#8217;s cast as a ritual so it&#8217;s easy to keep handy.\n\t\tThis more useful if you have a permanent base, but you can also place the\n\t\teffect on portable objects (like a piece of paper) in order to perform\n\t\tvarious shenanigans. Honestly, the most fun part of this spell is coming up\n\t\twith silly ways to abuse it. For example: if you can cast Thaumaturgy\n\t\tsomehow, Magic Mouth still recites the message in the volume at which you\n\t\toriginally spoke so you can turn a piece of paper into an extremely\n\t\tunpleasant (though harmless) surprise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: While certainly a fine spell, Magic Weapon monopolizes your Concentration\n\t\tfor an hour at a time, and you can get the same effect from the Enhance\n\t\tWeapon Infusion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection From Poison<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but poison is common across the full CR range, so this is a\n\t\tfantastic defensive option at any level. The 1-hour duration means that you\n\t\tcan get a lot of mileage out of a single spell slot even if you cast it\n\t\tahead of time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pyrotechnics<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, slightly annoying to set up, and when it does\n\t\twork the effects aren&#8217;t good enough. The flame doesn&#8217;t need to be especially\n\t\tlarge, so a torch or even a candle will suffice. Drop a torch on the ground,\n\t\trun out of range, and cast the spell. The <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#blind\">blinding<\/a> effect isn&#8217;t spectacular\n\t\tbecause it only lasts on round and it&#8217;s on a Constitution save. The\n\t\tsmoke cloud option is objectively worse than similar options like Fog Cloud\n\t\tor Darkness, but it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration which allows you to more\n\t\teasily combine Pyrotechnics with other powerful spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rope Trick<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: In previous editions, this was a cheap option to create a magically safe\n\t\tplace to rest overnight. The duration has been reduced to one hour, but\n\t\tthat&#8217;s still sufficient to take a Short Rest. Tragically, this can&#8217;t be cast\n\t\tas a ritual, so unless your party has some other way to make Short Rests\n\t\tsafe, you may want to keep this prepared while traveling anywhere dangerous\n\t\tin case you and your party need to suddenly vanish somewhere safe.\n\t\t<p>Note that the rope can be <em>up to<\/em> 60 ft. long, and that the portal\n\t\t\tappears when the rope is perpendicular to the ground, so its full length\n\t\t\truns straight up and down. No mention is given to what happens if the rope\n\t\t\thits a ceiling, but I imagine that the spell would simply fail.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Unless you relish the idea of your wizard with 8 Strength climbing a\n\t\t\t60-foot rope, I recommend carrying a much shorter length of rope for just\n\t\t\tthis purpose. 10 feet at most is typically sufficiently tall that none of\n\t\t\tyour party members need to duck, and any medium sized creature in party\n\t\t\tcan lift any small or frail allies nearly to the top of the rope. 10 ft.\n\t\t\tof rope should also reach its full length before hitting a ceiling in most\n\t\t\tlocales, but if you&#8217;re worried you can always shorten the rope before\n\t\t\tcasting Rope Trick.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to handle invisible foes, though you might prefer Faerie\n\t\tFire.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skywrite<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: Only useful as a novelty. Still, it&#8217;s hard to resist the ability to\n\t\tinsult someone by writing nasty things about them in the sky for everyone to\n\t\tsee for miles around.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spider Climb<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Even when flight becomes an option, Spider Climb remains an inexpensive\n\t\tand reliable way to get off the ground, to sneak into places, and to manage\n\t\tmany other problematic obstacles.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vortex Warp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a><\/sup>:\nBasically Misty Step but for anyone but you. The tactical benefits of teleporting an ally adjacent\nto a frail enemy or teleporting a frail enemy into a dangerous location are numerous. Keep in mind\nthat this is a Constitution save, and those tend to be high, so choose your targets carefully.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Web<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent combination of area control and crowd control, but if your\n\t\tenemies have a good way to set fire to the webs don&#8217;t waste your spell\n\t\tslot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">FToD<\/a><\/sup>: Bonus action casting time, and the damage doesn&#8217;t allow a save. Cast this\n\t\tearly in a fight against multiple opponents, then start every turn by\n\t\trunning around to apply the damage to every enemy in the encounter. Just\n\t\tremember that it applies to your allies and to unattended objects, so be\n\t\tmindful of your surroundings or you might find that you&#8217;ve burnt down your\n\t\town house. If you just need to get out of melee, Misty Step will work\n\t\tfine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blink<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 1-minute duration, cast an Action, it only has a 50% chance to work on\n\t\tany one turn, and you find out the results at the end of your turn when you\n\t\tno longer have the ability to do anything about it. I would prefer Blur or\n\t\tsomething similar over Blink, though admittedly Blink doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\tConcentration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catnap<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: A Short Rest is typically one hour. In most campaigns, that will be fine\n\t\tmost of the time unless the DM is deliberately creating a time crunch which\n\t\tprevents resting or otherwise sitting about wasting time. In those cases you\n\t\tmight be able to squeeze in a Catnap, but more than likely the 10-minute\n\t\tduration will still be problematic. If danger is the driving concern, cast\n\t\tRope Trick instead and spend an hour in a pocket dimension.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Create Food and Water<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Rations are cheap, but it&#8217;s good that you can prepare this if you somehow\n\t\tfind yourself somewhere without food for extended periods. This also lets\n\t\tyou create 30 gallons of water, which is enough for a nice bath but not\n\t\tenough to fill a 5-foot cube.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dispel Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Essential in any party, and while you&#8217;re just as good at the Ability\n\t\tCheck as anyone else, you don&#8217;t have the spell levels or spell slots to\n\t\tautomatically dispel a spell by casting Dispel Magic at a higher level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you have a weapon that&#8217;s worth casting Elemental Weapon upon, it&#8217;s\n\t\tworth the Enhance Weapon infusion which will mean that Elemental Weapon\n\t\tcan&#8217;t target it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Arrows<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: At a glance, the artificer may be the first class that can justify using\n\t\tthis spell. Since the Artificer doesn&#8217;t get AOE damage spells like Erupting\n\t\tEarth or Fireball which are available to other spellcasters at this level,\n\t\tthere&#8217;s more room for this to be effective. However, Flame Arrows needs to\n\t\tcompete with Elemental Weapon. Elemental Weapon uses a smaller damage die,\n\t\tbut allows you to pick the damage type. That alone is enough to make\n\t\tElemental Weapon better but Elemental Weapon also adds a +1 bonus to\n\t\tattacks and doesn&#8217;t have the infuriatingly small cap of 12 pieces of\n\t\tammunition. The one advantage that Flame Arrows has is that it works with\n\t\tweapons that are already magical, and as an artificer it&#8217;s likely that your\n\t\tweapon is the target of one of your Infusions. Even then, if you need fire\n\t\tdamage grab a spare weapon, hit it with Elemental Weapon, and you&#8217;ll likely\n\t\tdo better than using Flame Arrows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fly<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Winged Boots are too good to waste spell slots on Fly. You get access to Fly one level before you can get Winged Boots,\nbut aside from that very tiny window of time, go for the boots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glyph of Warding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Depending on how your DM handles it, this is either a situationally useful defensive measure or a reality-bending way to break the game from the comfort of your own home. See our <a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/glyph-of-warding\/\">Practical Guide to Glyph of Warding<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Haste<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent buff for nearly any martial character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intellect Fortress<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Technically situational, but an absolutely spectacular defense against\n\t\tenemies which rely on spells or common effects like charm and fear effects.\n\t\tUnlike racial traits like the Gnome&#8217;s Cunning or the Satyr and Yuan-Ti\n\t\tPureblood&#8217;s Magic Resistance, this applies to <em>all<\/em> Intelligence,\n\t\tWisdom, and Charisma saving throws, providing broad and effective protection\n\t\tagainst many of the most dangerous save-or-suck effects in the game. You\n\t\talso get resistance to psychic damage, which is nice if you&#8217;re fighting mind\n\t\tflayers, aboleths, or bards who enjoy Vicious Mockery. With a 1-hour\n\t\tduration, the Concentration requirement can be problematic, but it also\n\t\tmeans that you can carry this through multiple encounters at low cost, so in\n\t\tsituations where you need this it&#8217;s not going to eat all of your spell\n\t\tslots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection From Energy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An important, staple defensive option, but it&#8217;s single-target and\n\t\trequires Concentration so you can&#8217;t afford to keep it running constantly.\n\t\tKeep in mind that you can also use Infusions to provide resistance to some\n\t\tdamage types, so this isn&#8217;t as crucial as it is for other spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revivify<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Everyone who is capable of casting this should keep it handy. It&#8217;s simply\n\t\ttoo good to forgo.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tiny Servant<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: With an 8-hour duration, Tiny Servant is in many ways a temporary\n\t\tfamiliar. Unlike a familiar it has fixed stats and it can attack, but\n\t\tattacking is definitely not its intended function. With 60-foot blindsight,\n\t\tit&#8217;s a portable sentry. It&#8217;s not smart enough to follow complex commands and\n\t\tit can&#8217;t see, so it can&#8217;t discern invisible foes from visible ones, but you\n\t\tcan command it to inform you of approaching creatures, or you could command\n\t\tit to chase a specific foe which you know to be present but can&#8217;t see. I\n\t\trecommend casting this on something small, portable, and loud like a hand\n\t\tbell so that the servant can communicate by ringing itself. Still, as good\n\t\tas this spell is I would wait until you&#8217;ve got plentiful 3rd-level spells\n\t\tbefore you consider it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Water Breathing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but crucial when you need it. It&#8217;s a ritual so it won&#8217;t eat a spell slot, but artificers do need\nto prepare spells to cast them as a ritual..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Walk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Usually flight is a better option than walking across a liquid.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Eye<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: One of the best scouting spells in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Bane<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to overcome damage resistance to your favorite spells. Note\n\t\tthat the extra damage is <em>per turn<\/em>, so if your allies can deal the\n\t\tsame type of damage you can pile up a lot of damage very quickly.\n\t\tUnfortunately, the save is Constitution-based and Constitution saves tend to\n\t\tbe high.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fabricate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: I really wish that this spell was better, but it&#8217;s simply too\n\t\tsituational. It only works on raw materials, so you can&#8217;t pull tricks like\n\t\tturning a door into toothpicks or something equally useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Freedom of Movement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a great buff with a 1-hour duration, but you don&#8217;t have enough\n\t\tspell slots to use this frequently. If you need this effect, use your\n\t\tInfusions to create a Ring of Free Movement.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Leomund&#8217;s Secret Chest<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Extremely situational. The best case I can think of to use this item is\n\t\tif you need to sneak a chest of items into a place. Unfortunately, the\n\t\tlimited size of the chest makes it difficult to bring weapons or armor of\n\t\tany great size. A longsword could fit if placed diagonally (they&#8217;re\n\t\ttypically up to 4 feet long, including the hilt), but longer weapons like a\n\t\tgreataxe or a quarterstaff like would not.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mordenkainen&#8217;s Faithful Hound<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The primary appeal of this spell is to watch for invisibile foes while\n\t\tyou rest, but you can use Tiny Servant as a ritual with double the radius of\n\t\tdetection. Faithful Hound does have one advantage, in that it&#8217;s meaningfully\n\t\tuseful in combat, but the hound takes up one square, can&#8217;t move, and can\n\t\tonly attack creatures within 5 feet so unless you can pin a foe in on place\n\t\tthe hound is going to spend most of its time barking and doing nothing\n\t\telse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mordenkainen&#8217;s Private Sanctum<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is hard to justify. It&#8217;s great for protecting a &#8220;home base&#8221; of some\n\t\tkind if you have magically-inclined enemies, but it doesn&#8217;t block passage so\n\t\tenemies can still walk right into it. If you&#8217;re going to rely on this, you\n\t\tlikely need to combine it with some other form of protection like a building\n\t\tor Leomund&#8217;s Tiny Hut.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Otiluke&#8217;s Resilient Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save or suck on a Dexterity save. Your spell DC will be\n\t\tjust as good as a wizard&#8217;s, and Dexterity saves tend to be low for many\n\t\tenemies, so you can often take a target out of a fight for the duration\n\t\twhile you deal with its allies or set up unpleasant traps for it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Shape<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is one of the most useful spells in the game. Castles, dungeons,\n\t\tcaves, mountains, and all manner of other locales include an abundance of\n\t\tstone. The ability to reshape that stone to your purposes in an instant is\n\t\timmensely useful. This is a spell limited only by your imagination. A 5-foot\n\t\tcube is plenty of space to wreak all kinds of havoc if you&#8217;re clever..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stoneskin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A decent buff, but at this level magic attacks are common.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Summon Construct<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Summon a pet Defender. Since summon spells depend heavily on spell level\n\t\tthis won&#8217;t be as good for you as it is for the Wizard, but it&#8217;s still a big\n\t\tbag of hit points and its attacks will still be effective so your summoned\n\t\tconstruct can still contribute meaningfully in combat.\n\t\t<p>For more help, see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/summoning#summon-construct\">Practical Guide to Summoning Spells<\/a>.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Animate Objects<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: By the time that you can cast this it&#8217;s obsolete.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bigby&#8217;s Hand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Versatile and very powerful, even though you get it very late compared to\n\t\tfull spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Creation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This spell is limited by its maximum volume and by your creativity. It\n\t\ttakes a full minute to cast so it&#8217;s not going to be useful in combat, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s an amazing utility option. A 5-foot cube may not sound like a lot, but\n\t\tthat&#8217;s enough to get up to all sorts of mischief. Need to block a hallway?\n\t\tHow about a 5-foot cube of wood or stone? Need a quick trap? 5-foot sphere\n\t\tof something heavy, roll it down a hill. Short on ammunition? Enough arrows\n\t\tto fill a 5-foot cube. Food? 5-foot cube of non-living vegetable matter\n\t\tsounds a lot like food to me. Fancy clothes for a party? The finest cotton.\n\t\tNeed to bribe someone you hate? Gems only last 10 minutes, so make it\n\t\tfast.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Restoration<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you don&#8217;t have a Cleric in the party, you need this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skill Empowerment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is great, but it competes for space with Enhance Ability. Advantage\n\t\ton a check isn&#8217;t as mathematically beneficial as doubling your Proficiency\n\t\tBonus at high levels, but Enhance Ability is a considerably lower-level\n\t\tspell. If you have allies who can cast Enhance Ability, try combining the\n\t\ttwo to spectacular effect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transmute Rock<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Turning rock into mud is a great way to restrain a group of targets, but\n\t\tthe ultimate goal is to transmute that muck back into rock while the targets\n\t\tare still inside the area. This is incredibly difficult to do because it\n\t\trequires that the targets fail two saves and that they don&#8217;t climb out of\n\t\tthe mud on their turn, which may be easy despite the movement cost because\n\t\tthe 40-foot cube only requires that targets move 20 ft. at the absolute\n\t\tmost. Creatures near the edges are nearly guaranteed to escape. Then, once\n\t\ttargets get caught in the stone, the DC to escape is only 20, so creatures\n\t\taren&#8217;t guaranteed to be stuck unless their Strength is below 10. That&#8217;s a\n\t\tlot of points of failure to turn two spell slots into a single AOE\n\t\tsave-or-suck.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Stone<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: While not so broadly useful as Stone Shape, this is still a great way to\n\t\tsolve many terrain problems, and you can use it to split encounters so that\n\t\tyour party can focus on a few enemies at a time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e Artificer&#8217;s spell list.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":2619,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"post-templates\/article-page.php","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[24,17],"tags":[36],"class_list":["post-2622","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","category-dnd","category-dnd5","tag-dnd"],"rankMath":{"parentDomain":"rpgbot.net","noFollowDomains":[],"noFollowExcludeDomains":[],"noFollowExternalLinks":false,"featuredImageNotice":"The featured image should be at least 200 by 200 pixels to be picked up by Facebook and other social media sites.","pluginReviewed":false,"postSettings":{"linkSuggestions":true,"useFocusKeyword":false},"frontEndScore":false,"postName":"spells","permalinkFormat":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/%pagename%\/","showLockModifiedDate":true,"assessor":{"focusKeywordLink":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-admin\/edit.php?focus_keyword=%focus_keyword%&post_type=%post_type%","hasTOCPlugin":{"simpletoc\/plugin.php":"SimpleTOC"},"primaryTaxonomy":false,"serpData":{"title":"","description":"The Artificer's spell list takes a lot from the Wizard's spell list, but also includes several excellent options from the Cleric spell list.
