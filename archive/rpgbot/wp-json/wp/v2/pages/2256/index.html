With poor AC and hit points, but a combat skillset devoted entirely to melee the Monk is a glass cannon designed to be a placed in a room full of hammers. Flurry of Blows, the Monk&#8217;s iconic combat ability, often amounts to a flurry of misses due to the Monk&#8217;s 2\/3 BAB. The rest of the Monk&#8217;s abilities are either situational, unusable, or don&#8217;t combine with Flurry of Blows, often forcing the Monk to make a single lousy attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these massive limitations, monks are popular for class dips on a variety of complex builds, especially for their AC bonus. Thanks to the prolific number of splat books in 3.5, there are enough feats and alternate class features to cobble together a few functional monk builds. A vanilla Monk is a Defender or Striker, but the Monk can serve as a slightly underwhelming Scout.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#class-features\">Monk Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#substitution-levels\">Substitution Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#unearthed-arcana\">Unearthed Arcana<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rings\">Rings<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wands\">Wands<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#faq\">Monk FAQ<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#can-monks-enchant-their-unarmed-strikes\">Can Monks enchant their unarmed strikes?<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which tend to be more consistent than 3.5 handbooks. Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Monk Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points is hard for a\nmelee-only class, and coupled with the Monk&#8217;s garbage AC you&#8217;re going to have a\nlot of problems.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB can usually be\novercome with a bit of optimization, but Monks have a lot of trouble hitting,\nespecially at low levels before the penalties for Flurry of Blows go away.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Saves<\/span>: Every save is good, and with dependency\non almost every ability your saves should be excellent.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Monks get a very small number\nof weapons, and only a subset of those weapons can be used with Flurry of Blows.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill points is enough to get the\nimportant options from the Monk&#8217;s skill list. The Monk has a few skills for\nbeing a Scout and a few for being a Face, but can&#8217;t really do either.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">AC Bonus<\/span> (Ex): This will never match real\narmor, but it&#8217;s a cool ability, and it&#8217;s one of the many things which make the\nMonk such a good class dip. If it weren&#8217;t for Flurry of Blows requiring that you\nbe unarmored, I might recommend that Monks wear armor and ignore this ability.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Flurry of Blows<\/span> (Ex): The Monk&#8217;s signature\ncombat tactic. At low levels it&#8217;s functionally Rapid Shot for melee attacks, but\nthe penalty drops at level 5 and goes away at level 9, at which point Flurry of\nBlows provides several extra attacks for free. Unfortunately, due to the Monk&#8217;s\nlow BAB and issues with BAB they tend to have trouble hitting. Flurry of Blows\nis often referred to as Flurry of Misses, and for good reason. At low levels,\nconsider using a Quarterstaff instead of fighting unarmed because the extra\nStrength bonus to damage may outweigh the slightly larger damage dice you might\nget from fighting unarmed.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmed Strike<\/span> (Ex): Assuming that you can\nhit, this makes your damage slightly better, but you won&#8217;t exceed a longsword\nuntil level 12 unless you do other stuff like enlarge yourself (see Permanent\nSpells, below), get a Monk&#8217;s Belt (see Magic Items, below), or pick up the\nSuperior Unarmed Strike feat (see Feats, below).\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span> (Ex): Bonus feats are always\nfantastic, and the ability to ignore the prerequisite is particularly nice for\nthe Monk&#8217;s 6th-level options\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1st\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Grapple<\/span>: Because of their 2\/3\n\t\t\t\tBAB, Monks have a lot of trouble grappling.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Fist<\/span>: Stunning enemies robs\n\t\t\t\tthem of a turn, and makes them extremely vulnerable to attack.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>2nd\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Great for\n\t\t\t\tDefenders.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflect Arrows<\/span>: Worthless. Hugely\n\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>6th\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Disarm<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Trip<\/span>: Always a fantastic\n\t\t\t\toption. Using Improved Trip in place of a standard opportunity attack is\n\t\t\t\tobjectively better unless the target is considerably larger and stronger\n\t\t\t\tthan you.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic on any character at any\nlevel.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Movement<\/span> (Ex): Great for getting around\nthe battlefield quickly, but you can&#8217;t use it an Flurry of Blows at the same\ntime.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Still Mind<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but Enchantment\nis one of the scariest schools.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Ki Strike<\/span> (Su): Overcoming DR is one the\nMonk&#8217;s biggest issues, and this helps a bit. Unfortunately, there isn&#8217;t a lot\nthat has DR\/lawful, and by the time you can bypass DR\/adamantine you&#8217;ve been\nfacing earth elementals and iron golems for a long time.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Slow Fall<\/span> (Ex): Easily replaced by a 1st-level\nspell or any number of inexpensive magic items.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Purity of Body<\/span> (Ex): Disease becomes fairly\ncommon at high levels, but the diseases tend to be supernatural or magical.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Wholeness of Body<\/span> (Ex): This helps with the\nMonk&#8217;s lousy hit points, but it&#8217;s not enough to justify using in combat, so your\nparty&#8217;s wand of Lesser Vigor is more useful.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic on any\ncharacter, especially with the Monk&#8217;s fantastic saves.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Diamond Body<\/span> (Ex): Poison becomes very common\nat high levels, and immunity is nice.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Abundant Step<\/span> (Su): Amusin, but because you\ncan only use it once per day it&#8217;s not particularly useful\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Diamond Soul<\/span> (Ex): Spell resistance is great,\nbut remember that it also applies to friendly spells, and it takes a standard\naction to lower spell resistance.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Quivering Palm<\/span> (Su): 1\/week save or die. Cool\nand flavorful, but Wizards can do this several times a day and have been doing\nit for several levels.\n\n<span class=\"rating-none\">Timeless Body<\/span> (Ex): Very rarely matters within a normal\ncampaign, but the ability to stop adventuring until you reach old age could mean\na +3 to your mental ability scores.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/span> (Ex): Tongues has\nbeen around for a very long time, and the Monk rarely has anything useful to\nsay.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Empty Body<\/span> (Su): Great for infiltration,\nescape, and for punching ghosts.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Perfect Self<\/span>: You can no longer be effected by\nEnlarge Person. The buffs gained from this are nice, but easily overcome by such\nhigh level.\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Decisive Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: This looks great at first glance, but it&#8217;s roughly equivalent to using\n\t\tFlurry of Blows. Essentially you can choose to deal roughly half of your\n\t\tdamage output every time or all of your damage output half of the time.\n\t\tUseless for Monk class dips. The biggest draw is that it&#8217;s better for\n\t\thandling DR. If this worked as a standard action instead of a full round\n\t\taction it would be blue without question.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Draconic Fist<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Dr<\/a><\/sup>: Trade in the utility of Stunning Fist for some extra elemental damage.\n\t\tWorks one round at a time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Feign Death<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">EoE<\/a><\/sup>: Considerably better for Rogues. Monks have good enough saves that they\n\t\tcan largely resist the listed effects to which they aren&#8217;t already\n\t\timmune.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Holy Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Monks have absolutely no way to overcome DR\/good, but DR\/magic can be\n\t\tovercome with a 1st-level spell. The 1d6 bonus damage is nice, too. Evil\n\t\tMonks can reverse the alignments on this, but Neutral Monks are out of\n\t\tluck.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisible Fist<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">EoE<\/a><\/sup>: This is <em>amazing<\/em>. Sure, it has a 3 round cooldown, but with no\n\t\tdaily limit that&#8217;s a very gentle limitation. This makes Monk\/Rogue\n\t\tcross-class builds extremely potent. Because you can use this as an\n\t\timmediate action, you can use it when enemies move into reach, effectively\n\t\tturning this into an abusable dodge mechanic in addition to the obvious\n\t\toffensive potential.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prayerful Meditation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Still Mind is very situational, but the vast majority of enemies will\n\t\toppose you on at least one alignment axis, which may mean that this gives\n\t\tyou a +2 bonus on saves against spell and effects from every enemy you\n\t\tface.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Soulwarp Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Stunning Fist has the same DC, affects roughly the same subset of\n\t\tcreatures, and is considerably more debilitating.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Reflection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Only useful in extremely caster-heavy campaigns. Relatively few spells\n\t\tuse attack rolls, so this won&#8217;t come up nearly as often as Evasion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Standing Jump<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DS<\/a><\/sup>: Jumping is ridiculous when flight exists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wall Walker<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DS<\/a><\/sup>: Even less useful than standing jump.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Water Step<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SW<\/a><\/sup>: Walking on water doesn&#8217;t come up very often, but it&#8217;s way cooler than\n\t\tSlow Fall.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"substitution-levels\">Substitution Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling Monk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoD<\/a><\/sup>: Dropping the monk&#8217;s hit die one step is just cruel. Monks are already\n\t\textremely flimsy, so it&#8217;s just one more insult to a class which really\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t need it. On top of this, you&#8217;ve still got the issue of being small.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">1st level<\/span>: Finding this option really\n\t\t\t\tperplexed me. Conceptually, skirmish on a monk is <em>amazing<\/em>. So\n\t\t\t\tmuch of the Monk makes sense with skirmish, but the scaling on this is\n\t\t\t\tabsolutely <em>garbage<\/em>. A 20th-level halfling monk gets as much\n\t\t\t\tskirmish as a 7th-level scout. On top of all of that, the tricks to\n\t\t\t\toptimize skirmish have a ton of overlap with the tricks to make the Monk\n\t\t\t\tmobile while still using a full attack. So once you add all of those\n\t\t\t\ttricks, Flurry of Blows becomes the better option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3nd level<\/span>: Weapon Finesse is a good\n\t\t\t\tfeat for a lot of builds. For halfling characters consider a Monk dip,\n\t\t\t\tthis make a second level very tempting. For dedicated Monks, see my\n\t\t\t\tassessment of Weapon Finesse below.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">6th level<\/span>:<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Planar Monk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PH<\/a><\/sup>: Planar Monk levels open up a few cool abilities, and access to Knowledge\n\t\t(The Planes).\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5th level<\/span>: Immunity to non-magical\n\t\t\t\tdiseases won&#8217;t cover much, and with the Monk&#8217;s saves they&#8217;re not really\n\t\t\t\tan issue. However, 5 points of energy resistance isn&#8217;t much better. If\n\t\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t need anything specific, go for fire.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">13th level<\/span>: Slightly better spell\n\t\t\t\tresistance, but considerably less versatile.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">16th level<\/span>: Considerably more enemies\n\t\t\t\tare weak to Cold Iron than to Adamantine.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unearthed-arcana\">Unearthed Arcana<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Content from Unearthed Arcana is generally considered optional variant rules. Many of these options are poorly balanced, so be sure to consult your DM before selecting any such options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"\">Combat Styles<\/span>: Combat styles are a great concept, but\n\t\tmost of them are hampered by requiring you to take a really lousy feat to\n\t\tget a tiny bonus from the 6th-level ability.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cobra Strike<\/span>: Spring Attack is a really\n\t\t\t\tbad option for Monks because they only get one attack instead of their\n\t\t\t\twhole Flurry of Blows. If you&#8217;re going for the Halfling Monk racial\n\t\t\t\tsubstitution levels this could be helpful since Spring Attack works so\n\t\t\t\twell with Skirmish, but remember that if you take the level 2\n\t\t\t\tsubstitution level it will break your Cobra Strike progression so you\n\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t get Mobility or any of the 6th-level stuff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Denying Stance<\/span>: All of the feats are\n\t\t\t\ttaken from the default options available to Monks, and you can do better\n\t\t\t\twith Improved Trip than with Improved Disarm.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hand and Foot<\/span>: All of the feats are\n\t\t\t\ttaken from the default options available to Monks, and you can do better\n\t\t\t\twith Combat Reflexes than Deflect Arrows. The bonuses to resist special\n\t\t\t\tattacks aren&#8217;t enough to justify this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Invisible Eye<\/span>: Combat Reflexes\n\t\t\t\tearlier than normal is helpful for dipping Monk, and Lightning Reflexes\n\t\t\t\tand Blind Fight aren&#8217;t terrible. The 6th-level ability makes Combat\n\t\t\t\tExpertise a bit more attractive, but you need to take Agile to qualify\n\t\t\t\tfor it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Overwhelming Attack<\/span>: This could be a\n\t\t\t\tgood option if you plan to go for Shock Trooper and Leap Attack.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Passive Way<\/span>: This is a fantastic Trip\n\t\t\t\tbuild option, but I wouldn&#8217;t use it past a 2 level class dip.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sleeping Tiger<\/span>: only useful for a\n\t\t\t\tclass dip if you want Weapon Finesse.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Undying Way<\/span>: Awful. All of the feats\n\t\t\t\tare bad, and the 6th-level ability is mediocre.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Variant Monk<\/span>: DR is tempting when your\n\t\tAC is terrible, but dropping the Monk&#8217;s AC further may only make the issue\n\t\tworse.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Monks are extremely MAD, needing 4 abilities. They have 1 or two dump stats, but that isn&#8217;t enough to make their abilities easy to balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s primary duty is punching\nthings, so Strength is your top priority. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to start\nwith 18 because Monks don&#8217;t really use two-handed weapons, so the difference\nbetween 16 and 18 is still only a +1.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Essential for the Monk&#8217;s garbage AC, and\nhelpful for Reflex saves. Picking up Shadow Blade will cost you three feats, but\nif your Dexterity is high enough the bonus damage can be well worth it.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: You need hit points. d8 isn&#8217;t going to\ncut it by itself.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: 4 skill ranks gets you everything a Monk\nneeds from their skill list, so 10 is plenty.

It&#8217;s interesting to note that AC Bonus specifies that you can&#8217;t wear a shield, but Flurry of Blows doesn&#8217;t, instead simply using the term &#8220;unarmored&#8221;. I think the RAI interpretation is that you can&#8217;t use Flurry of Blows with a shield, but it&#8217;s a bit unclear. Check with your DM to be sure. If you can get away with a shield, then a very inexpensive shield may be a useful option.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Focus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (+1): This would be\n\t\tgreat if it also allowed the weapon to use your unarmed strike damage, but\n\t\tas written it&#8217;s not very useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scorpion Kama<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: A +1 kama which uses your unarmed strike damage. You can use a cheaper\n\t\tmundane or magical kama for special attacks, or you can use your unarmed\n\t\tstrikes to hit things, and you can magically enhance your hands, so this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t really offer anything useful except the ability to attach weapon\n\t\tcrystals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Counterspells<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Not an especially exciting option, the Ring of Counterspells is\n\t\tfrequently overlooked. Monks can get a lot from permanent spells, but the\n\t\tproblem with permanent spells is that if they are dispelled they&#8217;re gone\n\t\tforever and you lose all of that gold you spent. Enter the ring of\n\t\tcounterspells, which you can fill with three spells. I recommend Dispel\n\t\tMagic, Greater Dispel Nagic, and either a second greater dispel magic or\n\t\tReaving Dispel depending on your level. Suddenly you&#8217;re protected against\n\t\tyour biggest counter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fanged<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DM<\/a><\/sup>: Improved Natural Weapon (Unarmed Strike) on a ring. See the Feats\n\t\tsection, above. It&#8217;s interesting to note that sincer unarmed strikes\n\t\ttechnically aren&#8217;t a natural weapon, Improved Natural Weapon (Unarmed\n\t\tStrike) should be an invalid feat. However, this ring seems to indicate that\n\t\tit&#8217;s allowed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Force Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: The description specifies that the shield effect is encumbrance-free, so\n\t\tyour DM may allow you to use this without interrupting your Monk AC bonus.\n\t\tIf that&#8217;s the case, this can be a helpful way to get some more AC once your\n\t\tcheaper options have been enhanced quite a bit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Adamantine Touch<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: If you give up Ki Strike (Adamantine) this is a cheap way to replace\n\t\tit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: With such poor AC, Monks need all of the help they can get.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mage Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With no ability to wear armor, a wand of Mage Armor is a fantastically\n\t\teconomical option. I don&#8217;t recommend the eternal version because 2 hours may\n\t\tnot be enough to get you through a day, but 50 charges should last long\n\t\tenough for you to upgrade to Greater Mage Armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Armor, Greater<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: As a third level spell, the minimum caster level is 5 so you get 5 hours\n\t\tper charge. Get an eternal wand and you&#8217;re covered for 10 hours a day for\n\t\tjust over 10,000gp. That&#8217;s somewhere between the cost of +3 and +4 armor or\n\t\tbracers of armor, and you&#8217;re getting +6 instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Fang<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 750gp gets you 50 hours of +1 hands, which may be enough to get you by\n\t\tuntil you can afford to permanently enhance your hands. Of course, you still\n\t\tneed a caster who can use it, but Magic Fang is on nearly every full\n\t\tcaster&#8217;s spell list.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Amulet of Natural Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: The AC boost is great, but Periapt of Wisdom does more for the Monk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Amulet of Mighty Fists<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: This is a trap. See Greater Magic Fang under Permanent Spells, below. For\n\t\tless than the price of a +2 amulet you can make your hands permanently\n\t\t+5.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Armbands of Might<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Fantastic if you want to use Power Attack and\/or special attacks like\n\t\tTrip.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Belt of Battle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: A fantastic way to get some extra actions. Use on charge to get a move\n\t\taction, then move into place to make a Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Belt of Strength<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: The bonus to hit and damage are crucial.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bracers of Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A trap for people who don&#8217;t like wands. A wand of mage armor will do much\n\t\tbetter for much less gold.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Vest of Resistance is identical and takes up a much less useful slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gauntlets of Strength<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Great for the Strength bonus, but it&#8217;s usually better to get a belt so\n\t\tthat you can get Gloves of Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gloves of Dexterity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Great for your AC, and the boost to Reflex saves is always nice with\n\t\tEvasion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monk&#8217;s Belt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Tempting, but the effects total to +1 to AC and a tiny bit of unarmed\n\t\tstrike damage. Leave this for Clerics and Druids.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Necklace of Natural Weapons<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SS<\/a><\/sup>: Throw some elemental enhancements on this. You don&#8217;t need to make it +1\n\t\tbefore applying enhancements, so you can use permanent greater Magic Fang to\n\t\tget +5 hands, and add caustic\/flaming\/shocking to the amulet for piles of\n\t\tenergy damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Periapt of Wisdom<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Essential for many Monk abilities, including the AC bonus. However, the\n\t\tNecklace of Natural Weapons is probably a better choice. Ask your DM if\n\t\the&#8217;ll let you move this to your head slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rags of Restraint of Wisdom<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: A very cheap healing mechanic exclusive to Monks and Ninjas, but wands of\n\t\tLesser Vigor are very cheap, and someone in your party should know how to\n\t\tuse one.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rapidstrike Bracers<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: +2 to your attacks with Flurry of Blows, but only 3\/day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Absolutely essential despite the penalty to your AC. Large size gets you\n\t\ta bunch of additional unarmed strike damage, reach, and improves your checks\n\t\twith things like Trip and Grapple.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Magic Fang<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Because Monks can&#8217;t actually enhance their hands, permanent Natural\n\t\tWeapon is the best that a Monk can hope for. 8650gp can get you a permanent\n\t\t+5 to attacks\/damage, assuming that your DM allows you to hire a 20th-level\n\t\tcaster to help enhance your hands (550 for permanency from 11th-level caster\n\t\t+ 7500 for xp cost + 600 for a 20th-level cast to cast Greater Magic Fang).\n\t\tIf you can&#8217;t afford 8650gp, pick up a wand of Magic Fang for 820gp until you\n\t\tcan. If your DM won&#8217;t allow you to hire a 20th-level caster (very\n\t\treasonable), have a caster in your party keep Greater Magic Fang prepared\n\t\tfor you every day, and buy them a Pearl of Power to help replace the spell\n\t\tslot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Despite its shortcomings, the Monk still offers a lot of great abilities and bonus feats at low levels, making it a great choice for a one or two level class dip. For this reason, people typically dip into Monk instead of dipping into other classes and returning to Monk. If you plan to remain primarily as a Monk, it is a good idea to multiclass after level 11 when you get Greater Flurry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ninja<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAd<\/a><\/sup>: Ascetic Stalker requires two levels of Ninja to do anything interesting.\n\t\tGhost Step is a great way to become invisible and either move safely through\n\t\tcombat or get an advantage over an enemy. Sudden Strike allows you to\n\t\tqualify for Craven, which can add up to a big pile of damage when combined\n\t\twith Flurry of Blows. The addition of Trapfinding helps the Monk to serve as\n\t\ta Scout, but without Search or Disable Device you will still have issues\n\t\thandling traps.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Paladin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Much like the Sorcerer, Paladin makes the Monk more MAD than you can\n\t\thandle. The Paladin&#8217;s low level abilities are very tempting, especially\n\t\tDivine Grace, but the Paladin gets a lot more from the Monk than the Monk\n\t\tgets from the Paladin.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The Monk and the Ranger share nothing in common, their combat styles\n\t\tdon&#8217;t mesh, and their class bonus feats don&#8217;t work together. Your best bet\n\t\tmight be a Zen Archery build, but even that is a bit of a stretch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Likely a better choice than Ninja with Ascetic Stalker, you can use\n\t\tAscetic Rogue with only one level of Rogue. A second level gets you Evasion,\n\t\twhich you can trade in for a Rogue ACF because Monks already get it, or your\n\t\tcan keep it and get Invisible Fist. Like the Ninja, the Rogue adds\n\t\tTrapfinding and opens up Craven to add a flat bonus to Sneak Attack damage.\n\t\tBecause Rogues get real Sneak Attack instead of Sudden Strike, the Rogue can\n\t\tmake the Monk a very scary flanker.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sorcerer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Despite Ascetic Mage, the Sorcerer offers very little which improves the\n\t\tMonk. Sorcerer makes the Monk even more MAD, and the ability to burn spell\n\t\tslots has a very poor payoff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Swordsage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: One level saves you the two feats you need to get Shadow Blade, the\n\t\teffect of Weapon Focus with Unarmed Strike (Tale Discipline Focus in Shadow\n\t\tHand), and it a pile of maneuvers to use (focus on swift action options).\n\t\tTwo levels get you access to the Swordsage&#8217;s version of AC Bonus, which\n\t\tallows the use of light armor (potentially useful, but a wand of Greater\n\t\tMage Armor will be better long term). Some people might argue that the\n\t\tSwordsage&#8217;s AC Bonus stacks with the Monk&#8217;s, but I think adding your Wisdom\n\t\tas a Dodge bonus to AC twice pretty clearly violates the &#8220;no two bonuses\n\t\tfrom the same source to the same thing&#8221; rule. TL;DR: Dip one level of\n\t\tswordsage to save yourself two feats if you want Shadow Blade.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"faq\">Monk FAQ<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Monk is cause for a lot of speculation, experimentation, rules lawyering, and incorrect interpretation. Here are some of the biggest issues and questions Monks encounter.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-monks-enchant-their-unarmed-strikes\">Can Monks enchant their unarmed strikes?<\/h5>\n\n\n<p>This question arises from the wording of the Monk&#8217;s Unarmed Strike ability:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;A monk&#8217;s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The easy mistake to make is to assume that Monk&#8217;s unarmed strikes can be enchanted becaused magical enhancements are an effect that enhances or improves manufactured weapons. However, we must also look at the requirements for enchanting a weapon. For a weapon to be enchanted, it must be either Masterwork quality, or already Magically enchanted. The next logical error is based on the Ki Strike ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;At 4th level, ki strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons <strong>for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction<\/strong>.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people miss the second half of the sentence. Instead of enchanting the unarmed strikes, have a caster use Permanency to make a Greater Magic Fang effect permanent.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide
