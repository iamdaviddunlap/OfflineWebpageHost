Warlocks are primarily a Blaster, Face, and Striker, relying on their spellcasting and their Eldritch Blast in combat and relying on their Charisma outside of combat..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the Warlock is primarily a spellcaster, they don&#8217;t get full spellcasting like the Cleric or the Wizard. Their spellcasting progresses much slower, but you get Pact Boon, Pact Magic, and <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/tov\/classes\/warlock\/eldritch-invocations\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27065\">Eldritch Invocations<\/a> to make up the capability gap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Pact Boon lets you pick a playstyle, choosing from weapons, a pet, or additional focus on spellcasting. Pact Magic allows the Warlock to cast spells from their subclass list a few times without spending a spell slot and recharges on a Short Rest, giving them an easily-renewable source of spells. Eldritch Invocations work like a small Talents, offering a great degree of additional customization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#changes-from-5e\">Changes from 5e<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Warlock Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Warlock Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Warlock Lineages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritages\">Warlock Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Warlock Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Warlock Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#talents\">Warlock Talents<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-talents\">Martial and Technical Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Warlock Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#pact-of-the-blade-weapons\">Pact of the Blade Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Warlock Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Warlock Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Warlock Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-rare\">Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-very-rare\">Very Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-legendary\">Legendary Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Warlock Example Build &#8211; Zalbikar &#8220;Zal&#8221; Andrialix, Valiant Six Fiend Warlock<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineage\">Lineage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritage\">Heritage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improvements-and-talents\">Improvements and Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

This isn&#8217;t a change to the class itself, but it certainly impacts how the class is played.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eldritch Blast: Now a class feature instead of a spell. 4th ray at level 14 instead of level 17.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pact Boon: Moved from level 3 to level 1.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pact of the Blade: Use CHA mod for attack\/damage with your pact weapon.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pact of the Chain: Add Blink Dog as a possible familiar, and your familiar takes its turn immediately after yours instead of rolling its own initiative<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eldritch Invocations: Now learn up to 10 instead of 8\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Invocations tied to specific Pact Boons have mostly gone away. Warlocks get things like Thirsting Blade automatically. Chains of Carceri and Lifedrinker are notable exceptions, though they no longer require specific pacts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spellcasting: Warlocks are now half casters. No more 2014 Pact Magic (though their new Pact Magic feature is pretty great). Warlocks cast spells from the Wyrd spell list, and are the only core class to do so. They also don\u2019t get spellcasting until level 2 like the Paladin and the Ranger.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pact Magic: Cast any of your subclass spells at your highest warlock spell circle without spending a spell slot 2 times per short rest, scaling up to 4 per short rest at level 17.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhanced Boon: No more invocation tax to upgrade your pact boon!\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Blade: Multiattack.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chain: Your familiar gets temporary hp when you rest and can grant you Advantage on attacks as a Reaction, though the timing of your familiar\u2019s turn will make this difficult to use safely.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tome: Gain the ability to cast rituals and add rituals that you find to your tome.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heroic Boon: Choose a 1st-Circle or 2nd-Circle spell from any spell and gain the ability to cast them either with spell slots or with Pact Magic or add exploding dice to your Eldritch Blast.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mystic Arcanum: Gone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patron\u2019s Favor: New. Use Pact Magic to cast any spell you know of 5th-circle or lower. It specifies that it can be from any use, which has weird implications for multiclassing or if you can learn spells from other sources like Talents.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Epic Boon: Once per long rest, recharge all of your Pact Magic uses if you start a turn without any. This means a total of 16 total uses in a day with two short rests, and every one of those is a 5th-Circle Spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Warlock Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 is pretty good for a\n\tdedicated spellcaster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Wisdom and Charisma saves are great\n\tfor resisting things like mind control and paralysis which might subdue you,\n\tbut Warlocks will have lots of issues with effects that affect their\n\tbodies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor, shields, and simple\n\tweapons are decent. If you want better weapons, Pact of the Blade solves that issue. You get two skills and access to a couple of Face skills, but\n\tmost of your non-Face skills are Intelligence-based.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Blast<\/span>: The Warlock&#8217;s go-to attack option.

Warlocks know their spells permanently, so you have a limited list of options on any one Warlock. Warlocks select spells from the Wyrd spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Warlock subclasses are briefly summarized below.

These spells are limited to your subclass&#8217;s spell list, making your subclass&#8217;s spell options very impactful. Since you always cast Pact Magic spells at the same Circle as your highest-Circle Warlock spells, these spells can be very powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhanced Boon<\/span>: Excellent mechanical improvements to your chosen Pact Boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>10: <strong>Heroic Boon<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Echoes of Knowledge<\/span>: Access to a ton of fantastic buffs, defenses, and utility options.

If you start with 16 DEX at level 1, a crossbow is better DPR than cantrips or Eldritch Blast until you get Agonizing Blast at level 2. But with medium armor, there&#8217;s little incentive to have more than 14 DEX.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pact-of-the-blade-weapons\">Pact of the Blade Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Pact of the Blade makes the Warlock good at using weapons, but you do have some unusual considerations compared to martial classes like the Fighter or the Paladin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Weapon Option saves are based on either your STR or DEX modifier, that affects your choice of weaponry in ways that most characters don&#8217;t need to worry about. Bash, Hamstring, and Ricochet Shot don&#8217;t allow saves, so weapons with those Weapon Options are more likely to be effective for you. Many martial melee weapons will have two Weapon Options, and in almost every case one of them will allow a save. If you&#8217;re unsure, a longsword or a warhammer is an easy choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For ranged builds, use a heavy crossbow until you hit level 6, then switch to a Longbow so that you can attack twice. Unfortunately, you don&#8217;t have a better choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Warlock Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Warlock is proficient in light armor, medium armor, and shields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/bfrd.net\/armor\/breastplate\">Breastplate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/tov\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a>)<\/sup>:\n\tLess AC than half plate, but no Disadvantage on Stealth checks.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/bfrd.net\/armor\/half-plate\">Half Plate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/tov\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a>)<\/sup>:\n\tThere is nearly no reason to wear anything lighter than half plate.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/bfrd.net\/armor\/shield\">Shield<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/tov\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a>)<\/sup>:\n\tYou need one hand for either your focus or your Pact of the Blade weapon.

Sell most of the weapons.<br><br>At this level we have our familiar, we have Eldritch Blast, and we have skills. We&#8217;re very simple.<br><br>Zal picks a pseudodragon as his familiar, and at low levels it&#8217;s a great choice. The Pseudodragon&#8217;s 12 hp will beat most 1st-level player characters, and its Sting attack does good damage and might poison your targets.<br><br>Unfortunately, without a way to pad your familiar&#8217;s hit points and boost its attack bonus, it will stop being a useful combat pet after a few levels.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Eldritch Invocations:<br>&#8211; Agonizing Blast<br>&#8211; Eldritch Spear<br>Spellcasting<br>Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Grave Touch<br>&#8211; Guidance<br>Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Disguise Self<br>&#8211; Hellish Rebuke<\/td><td>Agonizing Blast and Eldritch Spear add extra damage and extra range to Eldritch Blast.<br><br>Grave Touch won&#8217;t see much use. The rider effect against undead is neat, but not especially effective. Guidance will see constant use. It&#8217;s awesome.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Subclass: Fiend<br>Dark One&#8217;s Blessing<br>Fiend Pact Spells<br>Pact Magic (2\/rest)<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Faerie Fire<\/td><td>3rd level brings our subclass. Dark One&#8217;s Blessing encourages us to last-hit enemies to get temporary hp, which is a great excuse to spend our time dealing lots of damage.<br><br>Our subclass spells give us Burning Hands and Command.<br><br>Pact Magic isn&#8217;t listed in the class progression table, but we do get Pact Magic at this level, letting us cast a subclass spell without spending a spell slot twice per rest.<br><br>We already know all of the spells listed on Ral&#8217;s pregen character sheet, which I believe is a weird omission in the character sheet. But that does mean that we get to pick more of our own spells, which is nice.<br><br>We&#8217;ll add Faerie Fire to our spells known. It&#8217;s a fantastic support spell and a reliable counter to invisibile enemies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; CHA 16 -&gt; 18<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Message<\/td><td>Zal takes a +2 CHA increase at level 4.<br><br>Message is Zal&#8217;s last cantrip listed on the pregen character sheet.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Eldritch Blast (2 Beams)<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Beyond Sight<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Darkness<\/td><td>5th level brings a second beam for Eldritch Blast as well as 2nd-Circle spells. Pact Magic now casts spells at 2nd Circle, and our subclass spells add Scorching Ray and Suggestion.<br><br>Beyond Sight lets us see in magical darkness, which is super convenient because we can now cast Darkness. This allows us to make attacks at Advantage because enemies can&#8217;t see us, and if enemies manage to target us, they attack us at Disadvantage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Enhanced Boon<\/td><td>Oour pseudodragon now gets some temporary hit points, which keeps it alive a bit better. It&#8217;s still frail, especially with 13 AC, so don&#8217;t expect it to survive multiple attacks.<br><br>By now your pseudodragon&#8217;s +4 to hit is unreliable to the point that attacking is rarely worthwhile. This means that your familiar&#8217;s best combat option is now to move into melee, Help you to give you Advantage on an attack, then use its Reaction with Enhanced Boon to give you Advantage on a second attack.<br><br>You can cast Darkness now, which also gives you Advantage, but you do have a limited number of spell slots. When you do use Darkness, your pseudodragon has Keensense, allowing it to attack effectively in magical darkness, so you might walk your Darkness spell onto enemies to support your familiar&#8217;s attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Repelling Blast<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Hold<\/td><td>Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck lets you save a bad ability check or save. I almost always save effects like these for saves.<br><br>Repelling Blast makes our Eldritch Blast even better.<br><br>We&#8217;ll add Hold as a great save-or-suck option.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; CHA 18 -> 19<br>&#8211; Talent: Combat Casting<\/td><td>Combat Casting will help us maintain Concentratio non our limited number of spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Eldritch Blast (3 Beams)<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Patron&#8217;s Anchor<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Fear<\/td><td>9th level brings a third beam for Eldritch Blast as well as 3rd-Circle spells. Pact Magic now casts spells at 3rd Circle, and our subclass spells add Fireball and Stinking Cloud.<br><br>Patron&#8217;s Anchor makes it much easier to concentrate on our spells, allowing us to maintain Darkness even if we get hit with area damage by enemies frustrated by our nonsense.<br><br>Fear is really good crowd control. If we&#8217;re caught by surprise without Darkness running or if we&#8217;re facing a big group of enemies, it&#8217;s a great way to thin the herd.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Heroic Boon: Echoes of Power<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/practical-guide-to-illusions\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15461\">Minor Illusion<\/a><\/td><td>Echoes of Power provides a small boost to our Eldritch Blast damage.<br><br>Minor Illusion adds a fantastic utility option.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Fiendish Resilience<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Mystic Arcanum (Eyebite)<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Revivify<\/td><td>Fiendish Resilience is great. You&#8217;ll want to pick a common damage type which you don&#8217;t otherwise have resistance to. Poison, Slashing, and Fire are my personal favorites, but if you know what enemies you&#8217;ll be facing in any given day, adjust your resistance to match.<br><br>11th level gets us access to Mystic Arcanum for the first time, which lets us access spells above 5th Circle. This feels odd since our regular spellcasting is only up to 3rd-Circle spells, but try to ignore that. <br><br>We&#8217;ll grab Eyebite. It puts us into save-or-suck mode for a full minute for a single spell slot, making it a fantastically effective option for our whole career. <br><br>Revivify is a great addition to any party, so we&#8217;ll add that to our regular spellcasting.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; CHA 19 -> 20<br>&#8211; Talent: Ritualist<\/td><td>Ritualist adds some very welcome utility options.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Pact Magic (3\/Rest)<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Mystic Arcanum (Plane Shift)<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Banishment<\/td><td>13th level brings 4th-Circle spells. Pact Magic now casts spells at 4th Circle, and our subclass spells add Blight and Wall of Fire.<br><br>We&#8217;ll grab both Banishment and Plane Shift at this level.

If they&#8217;re from the plane that you&#8217;re on, Plane Shift them somewhere inhospitable.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Eldritch Blast (4 Beams)<\/td><td>More damage!<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Hurl Through Hell<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Visions of Distant Realms<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; <\/td><td>Hurl Through Hell lets us ruin someone&#8217;s day when we hit them with Eldritch Blast.<br><br>Arcane Eye is among the best scouting options in the game. Getting to cast it at will without spending a spell slot is absolutely amazing. This does mean picking Visions of Distant Realms in place of Mystic Arcanum, but you might retrain a different Invocation to also select Mystic Arcanum and get an 8th-Circle spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; <br>&#8211; Talent: <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Pact Magic (4\/Rest)<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Mystic Arcanum (<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/wish\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2788\">Wish<\/a>)<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Telekinesis<\/td><td><br>17th level brings 5th-Circle spells.
