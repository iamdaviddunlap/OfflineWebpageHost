They have many of the absolute best divine spells,\n\t\tincluding most of the best healing options, a ton of great support options,\n\t\tand many fantastic divinations. Unfortunately you&#8217;ll need to split your\n\t\tfocus between normal arcane spells and pretending to be a cleric, but the\n\t\tpossibilities for combinations are amazing.\n\t\t<p>You also gain an additional spell known at level 1 based on your\n\t\t\talignment. One spell doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but it&#8217;s still very useful\n\t\t\tfor the Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Good<\/span>: Important in most parties, but\n\t\t\t\tHealing Word is more frequently useful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Evil<\/span>: Beyond low levels the damage\n\t\t\t\tis poor, the scaling is bad compared to many sorcerer spells, and\n\t\t\t\tgetting into melee to use this is risky.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Law<\/span>: A fantastic buff at any\n\t\t\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Chaos<\/span>: Decent but difficult to rely\n\t\t\t\tupon, and if you&#8217;re going to force Charisma saves you really want failure\n\t\t\t\tto be more meaningful than a small debuff. Still, Bane may be a good\n\t\t\t\tway to burn through Legendary Resistances.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Neutral<\/span>: A fantastic defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuff.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Favored by the Gods<\/span>: Most features like\n\t\tthis only grant 1d6, which has a lower average and is less reliable because\n\t\tit&#8217;s only a single die. This also recharges on a short rest, making it a\n\t\tfrequent and reliable defensive option.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Empowered Healing<\/span>: The problem with this\n\t\tability is the problem with healing in combat. If you&#8217;re in a fight, healing\n\t\tis rarely the best option. Death is easy to prevent in 5e, and if you&#8217;ve got\n\t\tHealing Word you can get an ally back into the fight as a bonus action.\n\t\tBeing massively injured isn&#8217;t much of an impediment, so allies can limp\n\t\taround at 1 hp and still be perfectly effective. With the exception of Heal,\n\t\tgetting a creature back to full hit points should generally be reserved for\n\t\thealing out of combat. Once you&#8217;re out of combat and your action economy\n\t\tisn&#8217;t limited, you usually don&#8217;t need to expend limited resources like spell\n\t\tslots to scrape together every last hit point. Sit down and spend some hit\n\t\tdice.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Otherworldly Wings<\/span>: Persistent flight is\n\t\tamazing at any level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Unearthly Recovery<\/span>: This could be a lot\n\t\tof healing, but by this level you probably know Heal.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divine-soul-ability-scores\">Divine Soul Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No change from standard Sorcerer, but, since this class is so ripe for multiclassing, just make sure to assign points where you\u2019re going to want them to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Standard Array<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divine-soul-races\">Divine Soul Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re playing the example build below, you might be tempted to pick up a race with innate spellcasting like the Fairy or Yuan-ti, but the wording on Order Cleric&#8217;s Voice of Authority requires you to spend spell slots to trigger it, which means they don\u2019t interact.

With that said, we don&#8217;t really care about move speed and even have a way to counteract it if you&#8217;re really worried about that extra movement in your game.

You can get two Greater Restorations for the price of one.<br><br>Also at this level, all of those touch spells you have can now be cast at a 30ft range instead. Sadly you can\u2019t both Distant and Twin a spell, so keep in mind which you may want to do on a given casting.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12- Sorcerer 11<\/td><td>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Heal<br>Retrain Spell: Guiding Bolt -&gt; Disintegrate<\/td><td>Twin Spell casting Heal is the single most time-efficient way to restore HP in the game until characters get 9th level spells.<br><br>Meanwhile, you can Twin or Empower Disintegrate as needed.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13- Sorcerer 12<\/td><td>Feat:<br>&#8211; Inspiring Leader<\/td><td>Every rest lets you put 17 temp HP on each party member. That may not seem like a lot at this level, but on an average party of 4 members, in a day where you wake up, have a fight, short rest, have another fight, short rest again, fight one last time, and then sleep, that\u2019s over 200 points of possible healing you don\u2019t have to do.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14- Sorcerer 13<\/td><td>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Resurrection<br>Retrain Spell:<br>Lesser Restoration -&gt; Teleport<\/td><td>At this level, our friends may need bringing back from the dead. Again, being a pretend cleric means we have to permanently learn this spell, so we do this now because, again, we can Twin Spell it for the same material components. Bring your two dead party members back to life at the same time.<br><br>Speaking of material components, we don\u2019t really mind the cost of all the diamond dust we spend on Greater Restoration at this level and so we lose Lesser to gain access to some much-needed utility.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15- Sorcerer 14<\/td><td>Otherworldly Wings<\/td><td>You can now just fly, period.

This is here because, as a high-level servant of a deity, it seems likely that said deity will be asking you to fight high-level devils and we would like to be immune to one of their most common tricks.<br><br>If your campaign isn\u2019t about that, feel free to swap them, or even disregard this entirely in favor of something else with a Con bump. Just not Chef, because we already distribute tons of temp HP from Inspiring Leader.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18- Sorcerer 17<\/td><td>New Spell: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/wish\/\">Wish<\/a><br>Metamagic:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Even more than most things that can cast Wish, you need Wish to expand on your lack of versatility.<br><br>Pick whichever Metamagic seems like fun to you.

Of course, being a Sorcerer, you\u2019re still only going to get to know 16 of those spells at any one time, so the hardest choice by far becomes knowing which spells are worth taking and when.&nbsp; Being able to function as your party\u2019s main divine caster while still picking up some staple arcane utility and damage is an incredible feeling.
