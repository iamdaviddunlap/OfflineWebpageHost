In terms of flavor, lizardfolk are\n\tsufficiently alien that they truly feel like a unique race rather than a human\n\twith scales and a tail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge of building a lizardfolk using the original\n\tversion of the Lizardfolk is their ability score increases. Constitution is\n\tfine, but an ability increase in Wisdom doesn&#8217;t support many class options.\n\tBecause they need Dexterity to complement their Natural Armor, it&#8217;s frequently\n\tbetter to build lizardfolk to emphasize Dexterity over Strength. Unfortunately\n\tthat means that Hungry Jaws will be less useful because the attack is\n\tStrength-based. This means that the race itself is MAD, which is uniquely\n\tfrustrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>One advantage of the original version of Hungry Jaws which is easy to\n\toverlook:\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/811640192058523648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it&#8217;s expended on a hit, but not a miss<\/a>.

Keep in mind that the state of the meta periodically changes as new source materials are released, and the article will be updated accordingly as time allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lizardfolk-versions\">Lizardfolk Versions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Lizardfolk effectively has three versions. The original version of the Lizardfolk was published in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/vgtm\/character-races#LizardfolkTraits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Volo&#8217;s Guide to Monsters<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of the custom origin rules in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/character-options#CustomizingYourOrigin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything<\/a> gave use the second version of the Lizardfolk. This was a big benefit to the Lizardfolk because their ability scores no longer locked them into Wisdom-based caster builds, and also the Lizardfolk&#8217;s skills were no longer restricted to a fixed list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/motm\/fantastical-races-continued#Lizardfolk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Monsters of the Multiverse<\/a> gave us an updated version of the Lizardfolk which made some changes to their traits. The Lizardfolk&#8217;s skill proficiencies are once again selected from a list, and while the list heavily Wisdom-based, there are enough options that basically any character can find something meaningful. Hungry Jaws was updated to work PB\/long rest rather than once per short rest, you no longer retain the attempt if you miss, and the amount of temporary hp is now your Proficiency Bonus rather than your Constitution modifier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cunning Artisan was removed entirely, and while mechanically it&#8217;s no great loss, it does feel like we lost something special and unique. Finally, the damage type of the Lizardfolk&#8217;s bite was changed from piercing to slashing, but it&#8217;s not clear why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Natural Armor and Other Sources of AC<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering races with natural armor, it&#8217;s important to understand how natural armor interacts with other sources of Armor Class, including manufactured armor and the Unarmored Defense ability. Each such ability provides a new armor class calculation, and each of these calculations is mutually exclusive. Many of these calculations specify that they only work while unarmored, but generally you use whichever calculation gives you the highest AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be absolutely explicit: None of these AC calculations are bonuses. Because they are not bonuses, there is no stacking to consider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: Lizardfolk&#8217;s natural armor states that while unarmored, a lizardfolk&#8217;s AC is 13 + Dex. If the lizardolk has 14 Dexterity and 14 Constitution and takes a level of Barbarian, they gain the Unarmored Defense ability. Unarmored Defense states that while unarmored, the barbarian&#8217;s AC is 10 + Dex + Con. That means that the lizardfolk&#8217;s AC is 15 via natural armor or 14 via Unarmored Defense, so the lizardfolk uses their natural armor. If a wizard were to come along and cast Mage Armor on the lizardfolk, this adds a third AC calculation method, setting the lizardfolk&#8217;s AC to 13 + Dex, which matches the lizardfolk&#8217;s natural armor.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-custom-origin\">Lizardfolk Classes (Customizable Origins and MMoM)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section assumes that you&#8217;re using the option &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/character-options#CustomizingYourOrigin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Customizing Your Origin<\/a>&#8221; rules presented in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything.

If you can get 16 Constitution at first level, Unarmored Defense matches Natural Armor and will improve as you increase your Constitution. The two extra skills overlap heavily with the Barbarian&#8217;s class skill list, but two more skills means that you have more options outside of combat where barbarians frequently struggle to be useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bard\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\">Bard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>13+Dex AC is better than most bards can hope for, but building to make Hungry Jaws useful is a struggle so you may just need to ignore it.

The two skills are nice, and if you&#8217;re using the Monsters of the Multiverse option you get several Wisdom-based options. Natural Armor is among the Druid&#8217;s best AC options, which is great since poor AC is one of the Druid&#8217;s biggest weaknesses compared to the Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fighter\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\">Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hungry Jaws is great on Strength-based builds and Natural Armor is great on Dexterity-based builds. Two additional skills help you be useful outside of combat. Unfortunately there isn&#8217;t a good way to make both Hungry Jaws and Natural Armor useful in combat at the same time, but Dexterity-based builds can still use Hungry Jaws on a bag of rats to get temporary hp between encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monk\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\">Monk<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hungry Jaws will be useless in combat, but it&#8217;s still a few temporary hit points if you have a bag of rats.
