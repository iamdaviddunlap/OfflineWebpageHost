For the vast majority of monks, you&#8217;ll want Dexterity, Wisdom, and Constitution in roughly that order. Races which provide three increases are very appealing because you can start with 16 in all three of those ability scores, which is frequently your best option as a monk at first level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Additional skills are great if you want to play a Scout since the Monk&#8217;s list of skill choices is so limited and with only the standard 2 skills, the Monk will find it difficult to match the Ranger and Rogue&#8217;s skill capabilities. Darkvision can also be helpful unless someone in your party can provide it with a spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>You may also look for ways to make yourself more durable to help keep yourself alive at low levels. Things like the Goliath&#8217;s Stone&#8217;s Endurance and the Orc&#8217;s Adrenaline Rush can pad your relatively low hit points. Resistances to common damage types like poison can be helpful, and AC boosts from races like the Warforged are rare but excellent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Innate spellcasting can work on the monk, but it&#8217;s difficult to find options which complement the Monk&#8217;s capabilities without actively conflicting with your tactics in combat. That&#8217;s not say that it&#8217;s impossible, but you need to be prudent about what spells your race might offer and consider how they fit into your character more broadly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2658\">Monk Handbook<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Monk Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dragonmarks\">Dragonmarks<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Lineages<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"app-root\">\n\t<p>Filter controls are loading.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/js\/dnd5RacesPageFilters.js?version=12\"><\/script>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Monk Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that not all races will be available in every game.

Mechanically, the final racial traits are\n\t\tidentical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Handling<\/span>: While the ability\n\t\tscores work, the innate spellcasting isn&#8217;t useful enough and monks have no\n\t\tway to gain access to spellcasting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Making<\/span>: Bad ability spread, and\n\t\twhile you can cast Magic Weapon on a spear or quarterstaff, you can&#8217;t cast\n\t\tit on your unarmed strikes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: The ability scores are\n\t\tgreat, but the innate spellcasting is redundant with Abundant Step and\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll never benefit from the expanded spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Sentinel<\/span>: Thematically this\n\t\tworks very well, but without access to the expanded spell list you&#8217;re\n\t\tmissing many of the benefits and without a Dexterity increase you&#8217;ll suffer\n\t\tin combat.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lineages\">Lineages<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Published in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything and beyond, no Lineage exists prior to the introduction of the Customizing Your Origin rules, and as such each lineage has flexible ability score increases. Every Lineage has the choice of +2\/+1 increases or three +1 increases except for the Custom Lineage which only receives a single +2 increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lineages are applied on top of a base race. While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait. Despite selecting a base race, you do not count as a member of your race for the purposes of any other effect, such as qualifying for feats or using magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-custom-lineage\" class=\"rating-blue\">Custom Lineage<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Variant Human&#8217;s split increases are typically a better fit for the Monk,\n\tbut the Custom Lineage is absolutely viable. I recommend looking for feats\n\twhich provide an increase to one of your ability scores so that you can get\n\tincreases to both Dexterity and Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-dhampir\" class=\"rating-orange\">Dhampir<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>Spider Climb and Ancestral Legacy are both good options for the Monk, but it&#8217;s unclear if Vampiric Bite works with Martial Arts, and RAW it appears that it does not based on a very strict reading of the text. Without that capability the Dhampir is basically just two skills and fancy climb speed, which you can get from the Tabaxi. I go into the rules around Vampiric Bite in The Dhampir Handbook.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-hexblood\" class=\"rating-orange\">Hexblood<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>Hex feels like a great choice for the Monk, but with only one use per day it&#8217;s unlikely to be consistently effective.

For the vast majority of monks, you&#8217;ll want Dexterity, Wisdom, and Constitution in roughly that order. Races which provide three increases are very appealing because you can start with 16 in all three of those ability scores, which is frequently your best option as a monk at first level. Additional skills are great if you want to play a Scout since the Monk&#8217;s list of skill choices is so limited and with only the standard 2 skills, the Monk will find it difficult to match the
