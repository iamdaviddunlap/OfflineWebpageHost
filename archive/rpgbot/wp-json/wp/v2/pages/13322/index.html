This Oath empowers a Paladin with the tools necessary to combat that which should not be. If you wish to stand against the tide of the unknown, you might enjoy the Oath of the Watchers. If however, you face a more terrestrial threat, fret not. The Oath of the Watchers have many tools that still work just fine against such relatively mundane foes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Watchers\u2019 toolset includes an array of utility spells and debuffs as well as protections that keep your party safe from some of the worst spells. One of the greatest ways to protect your world from threats within and without is to be proactive, and there\u2019s no better way to be proactive than your team going first in combat, which is another important tool on the Watchers\u2019 belt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>When sailing the Astral Sea and exploring the Wildspace of Spelljammer, there&#8217;s no better ally to have on the team than an Oath of the Watchers Paladin. When neck deep in such an extraplanar adventure, all of the Watchers&#8217; advantages against such foes stay relevant the entire time. Consider adding one of these fine adventurers in your next Spelljamming crew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The example build below takes advantage of an often overlooked weapon to put out competitive DPR with less feat investment than similar builds using conventional weapons.

Moonbeam is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational, but it makes sense considering your intended foes.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, your save DC is likely poor so it won&#8217;t be reliable.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th-Level<\/span>: Counterspell is a\n\t\t\t\tfantastic spell, but unless you have the Charisma to back it up you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tstruggle with the ability check to counter things. Nondetection seems\n\t\t\t\tlike an odd choice on a paladin, but many of the enemies which Oath of\n\t\t\t\tthe Watchers cares about can cast spells, including divinations.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">13th-Level<\/span>: Aura of purity offers a\n\t\t\t\tlot of useful defenses, but it&#8217;s technically situational. Banishment is\n\t\t\t\ta staple a save-or-suck spell, but you may not have the Spell Save DC to\n\t\t\t\tback it up. The only truly unfortunate thing to note about these two spells is that they are already on the Paladin spell list.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th-Level<\/span>: Hold Monster is a great\n\t\t\t\tsave-or-suck spell, but you may struggle with a low save DC unless\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;ve gotten your Charisma up to 20 by this level. Scrying is\n\t\t\t\tsituational, so it&#8217;s annoying to have prepared every day, but it&#8217;s also\n\t\t\t\tnot on the Paladin&#8217;s spell list so it&#8217;s nice that it&#8217;s available.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Channel Divinity<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Watcher&#8217;s Will<\/span>: Protection from\n\t\t\t\tmental saves for one minute. Note that you are not counted in the number\n\t\t\t\tof targets, so it&#8217;s you plus a number of creatures equal to your\n\t\t\t\tCharisma modifier. The duration is only one minute, but this is still a\n\t\t\t\tgreat buff when you face enemy spellcasters or enemies with charm or\n\t\t\t\tfear abilities (both of which are common). Enemy spellcasters can\n\t\t\t\toften resort to AOE damage spells or spells which target your physical\n\t\t\t\tsaves (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) in many cases, but at least\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;re not mind-controlling your party.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abjure the Extraplanar<\/span>: Technically\n\t\t\t\tsituational, but between 5 creature types you have enough coverage to\n\t\t\t\talmost guarantee that this is useful in any campaign where it makes\n\t\t\t\tsense for an Oath of the Watchers Paladin to exist. Turning a foe takes\n\t\t\t\tthem out of combat up a full minute unless you bother them, and in group\n\t\t\t\tencounters where you&#8217;ll use this you can greatly simplify an encounter\n\t\t\t\tby removing a portion of your opponents temporarily.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of the Sentinel<\/span>: Keep your allies\n\t\tclose while in marching order. This bonus is significant. If you&#8217;re worried about being caught in an\n\t\tAOE, remember that Aura of Protection has the same 10-foot range. The range\n\t\tdoes eventually expand at the same time as your other auras (level 18), at\n\t\twhich point you&#8217;re slightly less likely to have your entire party fireballed\n\t\tat the same time. Note the specific wording of this ability, \u201ca bonus to initiative equal to your proficiency bonus.\u201d While you can\u2019t add your proficiency bonus to a check more than once, if for example if a Harengon (Hare Trigger) or Bard (Jack of all Trades) are under the effects of this aura, because of the wording of the ability these abilities will stack because it\u2019s not a proficiency bonus, it\u2019s just a bonus reading PB to get a value.\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vigilant Rebuke<\/span>: Situational. Against\n\t\tenemies that use these effects, this is very powerful especially when\n\t\tcombined with Watcher&#8217;s Will. However, it&#8217;s absolutely useless against many\n\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"20\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mortal Bulwark<\/span>: Truesight is a\n\t\tfantastic ability, but the rest only applies against suitable enemies. It\n\t\talso doesn&#8217;t include a way to keep enemies banished, and at this level many\n\t\tof the affected types of creatures can cast Plane Shift.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-the-watchers-ability-scores\">Oath of the Watchers Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We are the bulwark.

Most of the time we\u2019ll want someone else that can ritual cast to use Detect Magic, but casting as a ritual doesn\u2019t remove the concentration part. If our usual detect magic user has something important running, we can step in if it\u2019s important and urgent.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Skill Expert<br>+1 Strength (17=&gt;18)<br>Proficiency: Intimidation<br>Expertise: Athletics<\/td><td>We\u2019re on the front line, we have lots of Strength, shove monsters, hit them with Advantage.<br><br>Alternatively, take Slasher so monsters cannot run.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-2nd-level spells<\/td><td>Swing twice <em>or<\/em> shove someone, then swing once with Advantage, then swing with Advantage as a bonus action because double-bladed scimitar.<br><br>For 2nd-level spells, Find Steed is always useful, as is Magic Weapon, but something that can be incredibly useful at this level is having a Gentle Repose in your back pocket. We can\u2019t have Revivify for a few more levels, but full casters can, so hitting a fresh corpse with a Gentle Repose will extend the 1-minute window to ten days.<br><br>Moonbeam and See Invisibility are nice additions from our Oath. Invisible foes can be problematic for martials, but See Invisibility handles this easily. Moonbeam can be harder to use, but setting it down and dragging an enemy into it with a grapple can be a viable tactic.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Aura of Protection<\/td><td>Adding our Charisma modifier to all our saves is great. Adding it to all our allies within 10 feet is what makes a Paladin amazing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Aura of the Sentinels<\/td><td>This aura adds a bonus to Initiative checks that scales with our Proficiency Bonus.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: Strength +2 (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>Get Stronger, hit harder.<br><br>Alternatively, we could take Resilient now and take this ASI at twelfth level. Both options are fine. We can just ride on Aura of Protection for now if we feel confident.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-3rd-level spells<\/td><td>Now we can put Revivify in our back pocket for emergencies as long as we have a 300gp diamond, too.<br><br>At this level, the Oath gives us Counterspell and Nondetection. Counterspell is nice to have, even if we don\u2019t often combat spellcasters, it\u2019s handy when we do. Nondetection is useful as well, but less frequently, as monsters don\u2019t usually rely on divination magic to enhance their senses.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, Nondetection and Invisibility together <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/does-nondetection-plus-invisibility-beat-true-seeing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bypass the spell True Seeing<\/a>, but not the inherent creature ability truesight.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Aura of Courage<\/td><td>Immune to fear as a 10-foot aura. It\u2019s nice, fear is annoying.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Improved Divine Smite<\/td><td>This is pretty nice, +1d8 damage to every attack. This is really why we wanted to use the double-bladed scimitar, to get an extra swing for an extra +1d8.<br><br>At the cost of our bonus action, this is better DPR than a Greatsword from an identical Paladin, with or without GWM, with or without Advantage.&nbsp;<br><br>Alternatively, against a Paladin using Polearm Master and GWM, which would limit the character to +4 Strength modifier at this level, with Advantage, we lose by 4 DPR, but that Paladin had to invest in two feats to get there. In fairness though, those feats do have additional properties beyond this DPR, so don\u2019t take this to mean those feats are bad choices, just that our choices do not cause us to trail by more than a marginal amount.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient<br>Constitution +1 (15=&gt;16)<\/td><td>We have some good Concentration spells to cast that we don\u2019t want to lose by getting hit on the front line. This will bump us up by +4, for a total of +9 thanks to this and Aura of Protection.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-4th-level spells<\/td><td>Our 4th-level list isn\u2019t that great except for Find Greater Steed. Good thing we have Divine Smite and lower level spells that upcast fine like Command.<br>Our Oath grants Aura of Purity and Banishment with our 4th-level spells. Well, grants is not the right word as Paladins already have access to these spells, but thanks to the Oath they always come prepared for free. Aura of Purity is a great spell to just have ready whenever we\u2019re up against the laundry list of bad status effects it defends against.<br><br>Banishment is interesting. Most of the time, the spell is thought of in terms of offense and used to send extraplanar baddies home, and that\u2019s certainly an option. It targets Charisma which is generally easy to land, except that a majority of Demons and Devils have proficiency and high Charisma modifiers.<br><br>But think of it from another angle. We\u2019ve fought the devils, pushed through a portal and are engaged in combat on the Nine Hells, cut off with no retreat. So we find a place to barricade in, it only needs to last a few minutes, for we are not in our home plane. Sure, at this level we can only send one person home, but in a few levels, we can send two with a 5th-level slot. Good thing we always have this magical evac on our tool belt.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Cleansing Touch<\/td><td>Punches so hard we break magic. As an action we can break spells on ourself and allies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Vigilant Rebuke<\/td><td>A fun little reaction ability. It won&#8217;t come up often, but it has no usage limit beyond using our reaction, so we can spam it whenever it triggers.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>ASI: Charisma +2 (16=&gt;18)<\/td><td>More willpower. Or whatever Charisma is a nebulous measurement of. More importantly, Spell DCs go up and +1 to all saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-5th-level spells<\/td><td>We can cast Holy Weapon. +2d8 radiant damage on all attacks. Good thing we get three of those.<br><br>On top of Improved Divine Smite, this is an extra +3d8 over any Paladins not using the double-bladed scimitar or investing into Polearm Master.<br>Because everyone adds the same +2d8 on top of the comparisons from eleventh level, we stay 4 DPR behind the Great Weapon Polearm Master, but not needing those two feats means we get to cap Charisma with those two ASIs.<br><br>Hold Monster, or as it should be called Automatic Critical Smite Dispenser. This spell right here is most of why we\u2019re investing Charisma for our last two ASIs. We want this to stick when we have to cast it because free critical hits change a 1st-level smite into a 3rd-level smite, and that\u2019s not counting the rest of the party.<br><br>Scrying is cool. It\u2019s a tool that gets used occasionally, and Paladins don\u2019t normally have it, so it\u2019s nice to be able to scry cam someone from time to time.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Aura Improvements<\/td><td>Everything grows to 30ft.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>ASI: Charisma +2 (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>Maximum Charisma. +5 to all saves, maximum save DCs.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Mortal Bulwark<\/td><td>Truesight is nice.
