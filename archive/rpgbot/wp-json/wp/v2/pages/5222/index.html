Spell Conduit is the key mechanic of the Blood Conduit, but with the Bloodrager&#8217;s very limited number of spells, the Bloodrager doesn&#8217;t have enough spells to get through the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Contact Specialist<\/span> (Ex): An extra feat\n\tis\n\talways welcome, and the Bloodrager gets to ignore prerequisites for this\n\tfeat. Unfortunately, almost all of the choices are bad.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Bull Rush<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Grapple<\/span>: The Bloodrager\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get anything special that makes for a good grappler.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Reposition<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Trip<\/span>: Fantastic for many melee\n\t\tcharacters, and lets you avoid the Combat Expertise requirements.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Unarmed Strike<\/span>: The\n\t\tBloodrager doesn&#8217;t get anything that makes them good at unarmed\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Conduit<\/span> (Su): This feels a bit\n\tlike\n\tthe Magus&#8217;s Spellstrike ability. I&#8217;m not certain if you can deliver touch\n\tspell while tripping with a weapon, but based on the flavor of the ability\n\tI\n\twould assume that you can&#8217;t. Either way, this is a great way to add some\n\textra damage. Keep in mind that Bloodragers don&#8217;t get a lot of spells per\n\tday, so you want to use this sparingly, and you may want to invest in a\n\twhole bunch of pearls of power. Much like the Magus, Shocking Grasp is\n\tlikely your best option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reflexive Conduit<\/span> (Ex): Situational.\n\tVery few enemies use combat maneuvers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bloodline Feats (Altered), Fast Movement, Uncanny Dodge, Improved Uncanny Dodge, Indomitable Will<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Bloodrider, Crossbloosed Rager, Greenrager, Primalist<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bloodrider\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/bloodrider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloodrider<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If mobility is a problem for you, the Bloodrider can go a long way to fix it by adding a mount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Rider<\/span> (Ex): Make your horse even\n\tfaster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Feral Mount<\/span> (Ex): Like most Mount\n\tabilities, the Bloodrider&#8217;s option are very limited. The bonus to the Feral\n\tMount&#8217;s Strength while Bloodraging is nice, but not very big.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Bond<\/span> (Su): This really helps keep\n\tyour mount alive, and it allows you to buff both yourself and your mount\n\twhen you start a Bloodrage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bloodline Feats (No level is listed. Errata soon, I hope.), Fast Movement, Uncanny Dodge, Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Blood Conduit, Crossbloosed Rager, Greenrager (? Depends on which feats get replaced), Primalist<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"crossblooded-rager\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/crossblooded-rager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crossblooded Rager<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming that your Wisdom isn&#8217;t absolute garbage, this archetype should be an easy choice. You get all of the best parts of two bloodlines, and can skip the worst parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: More options is always\n\tbetter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: This allows you to bypass\n\tbad spells on your bloodline&#8217;s list of bonus spells, and pick and choose\n\tfrom among both bloodlines.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline Powers<\/span>: Much like the Bonus\n\tSpells, this allows you to pick and choose your abilities, potentially\n\tgetting the best of both bloodlines.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Drawbacks<\/span>: Really? That&#8217;s all? -2 to Will\n\tsaves? You can overcome this with the Iron Will feat. Losing the extra +2\n\twhile Bloodraging is annoying, but hardly difficult to overcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bloodline (Altered)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Blood Conduit, Bloodrider, Greenrager, Metamagic Rager, Primalist, Rageshaper, Spelleater, Steelblood<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"greenrager\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/greenrager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greenrager<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Woodland Stride is worthless, and the Bloodrager is not a good summoner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Unfettered Fury<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Summoning Rager<\/span> (Sp): By the time you get\n\tthese spells the creatures you can summon are so weak that they are\n\tworthless in combat. With no real skill at handling animals, the Bloodrager\n\tcan&#8217;t expect to use these animals as anything but bait.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Furious Summoning<\/span> (Su): This hardly fixes\n\tthe fact that you&#8217;re summoning creatures too weak to be helpful in a fight.\n\tTheir attacks might be slightly better, but their hit points are still puny\n\tand their ACs will be garbage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: blood sanctuary, bloodline feats (6th, 9th)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Blood Conduit, Metamagic Rager, Primalist, Spelleater, Steelblood<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"metamagic-rager\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/metamagic-rager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metamagic Rager<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Improved Uncanny Dodge is like a fish with a bicycle. It&#8217;s kind of nice to have so that you can look at it, but it&#8217;s totally useless. If you don&#8217;t take another archetype which sacrifices Improved Uncanny Dodge, take this. It&#8217;s fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Meta-Rage<\/span> (Su): With some limited\n\tspellcasting, metamagic is generally too difficult for the Bloodrager. This\n\topens up a lot of great options, but be careful not eat all of your\n\tBloodrage rounds before you get into a fight. When selecting metamagic\n\tfeats, forego feats which emphasize damage. Instead, focus on utility\n\timprovements like Extend and Quicken Spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: improved uncanny dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Cross-Blooded Rager, Greenrager, Primalist, Untouchable Rager (Won&#8217;t actually work, but technically allowed)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"primalist\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/primalist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Primalist<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost no Bloodrager Bloodlines have a perfect list of abilities. The Primalist can trade in some of their Bloodline abilities for Rage Powers. This allows you to pick and choose your best options, giving you a lot of flexibility in your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Choices<\/span>: Barbarian Rage Powers\n\toffer a huge number of fantastic options for improving Rage. This opens up\n\tthose options at nearly no cost, and allows you to trade in bad bloodline\n\tpowers for awesome Rage Powers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: bloodline (altered)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Blood Conduit, Bloodrider, Crossblooded Rager, Greenrager, Metamagic Rager, Rageshaper, Spelleater, Steelblood<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"rageshaper\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/rageshaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rageshaper<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bloodrager gets access to Beast Shape I and II, Vermin Shape I, and Elemental Body I. Beast Shape is the only good choice, and you get it so late that it&#8217;s not a great option. The Rageshaper improves these options a little bit, but the additions aren&#8217;t really meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bestial Aspect<\/span> (Su): The Bloodrager\n\tdoesn&#8217;t get a lot of polymorph spells, but many Bloodrage powers offer\n\tnatural attacks or new movement types. Boosting natural weapon damage by\n\tone\n\tdie will almost always amount to an extra d6, but doing 2d6+ damage on two\n\tclaw attacks is pretty nice. At high levels the Bloodrager gets access to\n\tBeast Shape I and II. These will be pretty far behind what a full caster\n\tcan\n\tdo at the sam level, but the extra damage and movement help a little bit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Furious Transformation<\/span> (Su): Extending\n\tpolymorph spells is very helpful, but by the time the Bloodrager gets\n\taccess\n\tto any polymorph spells their duration should be adequate based solely on\n\tthe Bloodrager&#8217;s caster level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: blood sanctuary, improved uncanny dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Crossblooded Rager, Primalist, Untouchable Rager<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"spelleater\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/spelleater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spelleater<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spelleater adds some nice self-healing mechanics to the Bloodrager. Much like the Barbarian, the Bloodrager often has low AC and draws a lot of damage. This helps keep you up and raging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood of Life<\/span> (Su): This should say that\n\tincreases to your effective DR add to your fast healing. Fast Healing is\n\tfantastic. It applies in rounds when you don&#8217;t take damage, and it applies\n\twhen you take damage from energy and spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Eating<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s like a crappy\n\tversion of Cure X Wounds. This is nice in a pinch, but don&#8217;t plan to rely\n\ton\n\tit or you&#8217;ll waste all of your offensive options on crappy healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, damage reduction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Crossblooded Rager, Greenrager, Primalist<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"steelblood\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/steelblood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steelblood<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Steelblood addresses the Bloodrager&#8217;s AC issue at the expense of some mobility. This is a fair tradeoff, so if you want to be on the front lines and not constantly take damage, Steelblood can be an excellent option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Because\n\tthey\n\tcan&#8217;t use shields and cast spells, and because Bloodrage applies an AC\n\tpenalty, Bloodragers suffer the same AC issues as Barbarians. Heavy Armor\n\tgoes a long way to fix this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Indomitable Stance<\/span> (Ex): Very\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Armored Swiftness<\/span> (Ex): 25 ft. in Full\n\tPlate is pretty good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Training<\/span> (Ex): Armor Check Penalty\n\tdoesn&#8217;t matter most of the time, but the additional maximum dexterity bonus\n\twill allow you to increase your AC a bit more as you level and acquire\n\tenough gold to get a belt which enhances all of your physical ability\n\tscores.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Deflection<\/span> (Su): Hopefully you\n\twon&#8217;t need to rely on this much, but if an attack is really close to a miss\n\tthis can save you from a bunch of damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Proficiency, Fast Movement, Uncanny Dodge, Improved Uncanny Dodge, Damage Reduction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Crossblooded Rager, Greenrager, Primalist<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"untouchable-rager\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/bloodrager\/archetypes\/paizo-bloodrager-archetypes\/untouchable-rager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Untouchable Rager<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Untouchable Rager is fantastic for killing spellcasters, but lacks much of the versatility and fun of the Bloodrager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Raging Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Spell Resistance\n\tis great, and the scaling is excellent. Most monsters will have problems\n\tovercoming your spell resistance at any given level. However, this ability\n\tcosts most of the Bloodrager&#8217;s iconic abilities, which can make for a very\n\tboring build.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resistance Control<\/span> (Ex): Very helpful to\n\tprotect yourself from ambushes and magical traps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: spells, blood casting, eschew materials, bloodline<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Metamagic Rager, Rageshaper<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Bloodrager is primarily a Striker, but is supplemented by magical abilities.
