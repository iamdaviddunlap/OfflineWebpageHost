Monks are effective Defenders and Strikers, and typically fill a role in a party as a Fighter-equivalent or Rogue-equivalent depending on your subclass and proficiencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Monk can be difficult to play compared to the Fighter or the Rogue. They are severely MAD (multiple ability dependent), needing three high ability scores to function effectively with very little room to ignore any of them, and the Monk isn&#8217;t as durable as the Fighter nor as lethal as the Rogue. Monks also lean heavily into using Bonus Actions right from level 1, which can be briefly confusing for new players who are still acclimating to the game&#8217;s mechanics. Subclasses can introduce additional complexity to the class, but that complexity also brings a lot of diversity and a lot of fun options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite those challenges, the Monk can be incredibly satisfying to play. I&#8217;ve had all kinds of fun slapping enemies prone, launching them through air, stunning them before unleashing a flurry of blows, and otherwise making my presence felt on the battlefield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#changes-from-5e\">Changes from 5e<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Monk Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Monk Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Monk Lineages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritages\">Monk Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Monk Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Monk Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#talents\">Monk Talents<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-talents\">Magic and Technical Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Monk Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Monk Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Monk Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Monk Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-rare\">Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-very-rare\">Very Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Open Hand Monk Example Build &#8211; Personal Space Enthusiast<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#lets-discuss-semantics\">Let\u2019s Discuss Semantics<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lets-discuss-geometry-and-physics\">Let\u2019s Discuss Geometry and Physics<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#is-this-really-allowed\">Is this really allowed?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#is-this-going-to-cause-problems\">Is this going to cause problems?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineage\">Lineage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritage\">Heritage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improvements-and-talents\">Improvements and Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

You&#8217;re expected to use &#8220;monk weapons&#8221;. Essentially you&#8217;ll be using a 1d6 weapon with\n\tversatile until level 10 (which means either a quarterstaff or a spear), then\n\tyou&#8217;ll use your bare hands from then on unless you&#8217;ve found a magic weapon.\n\tMonks get the typical 2 skills, and the Monk skill list includes a lot of\n\tmediocre options which depend on Abilities which Monks don&#8217;t generally need\n\tand therefore can&#8217;t afford to invest in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Martial Arts<\/span>: Martial Arts is why you play a\n\tMonk. It removes the need for Strength, and gives you all the benefits of\n\ttwo-weapon fighting without the need for weapons, feats, or combat styles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martial Arts also gives you the ability to block and return ranged weapon attacks. This won&#8217;t come up often since so few enemies use ranged weapons, but it feels awesome when it does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Unarmored Defense<\/span>: 20 Dexterity and 20\n\tWisdom is an eventual goal for every Monk. With both, you have 20 AC, which\n\tmatches the AC of a character in full plate with a shield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Techniques<\/span>: <\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flurry of Blows<\/span>: At low levels this isn&#8217;t\n\t\ta great option because you won&#8217;t have a lot of Ki, but as you grow in level\n\t\tit will become less costly. Keep in mind that Martial Arts already grants\n\t\tyou a single extra attack as a Bonus Action, so you&#8217;re only getting one\n\t\tattack for your Ki point. This is the floor of effectiveness on using a ki\n\t\tpoint. If a thing you could do with Ki is worse than Flurry of Blows, you\n\t\tshould never do that thing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Patient Defense<\/span>: When your health is low\n\t\tthis is a great fallback option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Step of the Wind<\/span>: Similar to Cunning\n\t\tAction, but with a point cost. Don&#8217;t overlook the improved jump distance:\nthe ability to jump over difficult terrain can be very useful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmored Movement<\/span>: Some extra speed is\n\tnice for a class so strictly bound to melee, and the ability to run across\n\twater and up vertical surfaces really adds to the mystical feel of the\n\tMonk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Monk subclasses are briefly summarized below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Flickering Dark: <a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open Hand: Expand on the Monk&#8217;s core capabilities by adding additional effects to Flurry of Blows, as well as defense and utility options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>5: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Multiattack<\/span>: Essential for martial characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>5: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Strike<\/span>: There&#8217;s no limit on how\n\tmany times you can do this (except running out of TP), so against particularly\n\ttough opponents it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to spend TP on each of your attacks\n\tuntil you succeed, or to just stun-lock a single foe for the duration of a\n\tfight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding and using Stunning Strike effectively is absolutely crucial to playing the Monk effectively. The Stunned condition robs the creature of turn, prevents them from making opportunity attacks or casting reaction spells like Shield or Counterspell, grants Advantage on attacks to hit them (including any other attacks that you make that turn), causes them to automatically fail Str\/Dex saves (ex: Disintegrate), and Stunning Strike lasts until the <em>end<\/em> of your next turn, so you could spend your whole next turn attacking them with Advantage, not to mention whatever your party can do with a full round to pile on the damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>6: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Empowered Strikes<\/span>: Especially important\n\tin games with few or no magic items.

If you can get resistance or immunity to poison from another source (Dwarf Lineage, Periapt of Proof Against Poison), skip this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Purity of Mind<\/span>: Broadly useful mental defenses. WIS saves are common, and both Charm and Fear effects are common. If you can take Mental Fortitude, do that instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>13: <span class=\"rating-green\">Astral Teachings<\/span>: An easy way to quickly cover proficiencies which your party might lack. Most of the time you&#8217;ll set this to something reliable like Insight or Perception, then temporarily replace that with something you need for a specific situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Diamond Soul<\/span>: Dramatically improves your\n\tsurvivability. Notably this also applies to Death Saving Throws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>17: <span class=\"rating-green\">Timeless Self<\/span>: Most of this will have very little impact on the game, but preventing your hit point maximum from being reduced is helpful because many enemies (especially undead) can reduce your hp maximum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Empty Body<\/span>: A crucial high-level tactic for the Monk. Activating this makes you hard to target, much more durable, and also grants Advantage on all of your attacks. Many fights will begin with you activating this, but definitely try to activate it before initiative is rolled if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astral Projection is situational, but by this level a safe means to explore<br>the outer planes is very welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20: <strong>Epic Boon:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boundless Technique<\/span>: 4 TP means that you&#8217;ll start encounters with enough to activate Empty Body. 2 TP on other turns means that you will always have enough TP for the Monk&#8217;s Techniques and for Stunning Strike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Monk Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Monk is extremely MAD. While DEX is their primary ability score, they also need both CON and WIS to function. Fortunately, you have very little use for Strength, Intelligence, or Charisma, so it&#8217;s easy to dump three scores and focus on the three that we care about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Point Buy rules give us 1 too few points to put a 16 in each of DEX, CON, and WIS, so you&#8217;ll need to balance where you put those points. DEX is still your highest priority, but the choice between making CON or WIS higher will depend on your exact build. If you&#8217;re planning to rely heavily on save DCs or features which are tied to WIS,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">STR<\/span>: Monks are proficient in STR saves, which\n\treduces the need for Strength, but a little bit of Strength will help stretch\n\tthe effectiveness of that proficiency. Athletics is also a nice option if you\n\twant to Shove enemies prone, but monk subclasses and Weapon Options already offer options\n\tto knock foes prone without resorting to Athletics.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">DEX<\/span>: Dexterity rules the Monk. Almost all\n\tmonks rely on Dexterity for attacks, so it sets your attacks, damage, and AC,\n\tand having good Dexterity will help avoid AOE damage which can quickly cut\n\tinto your d8 hit points. Evasion helps, but it&#8217;s more effective if you succeed on\n\tthe save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">CON<\/span>: With only d8 hit dice, CON is\n\tvery important for the Monk.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">INT<\/span>: Generally dump, unless you really need\n\tto use knowledge skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">WIS<\/span>: WIS fuels Monk&#8217;s AC and many of\n\ttheir special abilities. It notably sets the save DC for class features which\n\tallow targets to make saving throws, so it&#8217;s especially important for\n\tsubclasses which rely heavily on offensive special abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">CHA<\/span>: Dump.

Use a breath weapon,\n\t\tactivate items (as long as doing so doesn&#8217;t make you cast a spell), steal\n\t\tthings, use the Help action, pick locks, disarm traps, take long rests, etc.\n\t\tcan all be done while totally invisible without limit. However, the second\n\t\tyou roll initiative the Cloak of Invisibility becomes more powerful because\n\t\tits invisibility isn&#8217;t broken by you attacking or casting spells.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Open Hand Monk Example Build &#8211; Personal Space Enthusiast<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This build strongly resembles our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/subclasses\/open-hand\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"13825\">5e Way of the Open Hand Monk Handbook<\/a>, which I suppose isn&#8217;t surprising since it&#8217;s the same subclass. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the power of this build depends on the ability to forcibly move our targets. A combination of our exceptionally high speed and two options to push enemies away from us gives us a lot of control over positioning in combat. Using that capability to force enemies into dangerous locations can make you extremely effective beyond just your ability to directly damage your enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting enemies into an ongoing area effect like a Wall of Fire can boost your damage output considerably. Forcing enemies into reach of your party&#8217;s Defender can prevent enemies from approaching your more fragile allies while also helping your Defender&#8217;s ability to attack them. You might also force enemies out of range, preventing them from closing to melee in order to attack your party, effectively locking them out of combat while you and your allies safely wear them down with ranged attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This synergizes very well with allied spellcasters, especially blasters who rely heavily on area damage effects. Forcing enemies into a small area makes it easier to target them with area damage effects, thereby making blaster casters multiplicatively more effective. <\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lets-discuss-semantics\">Let\u2019s Discuss Semantics<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Before we dig into the actual build, let\u2019s discuss the definition of the word \u201caway\u201d, specifically in the context of moving something away from something else. In this context, \u201caway\u201d simply means that it will be at a greater distance than it was previously. The rules text for Open Hand notably omits the word \u201cdirectly\u201d, as in \u201cdirectly away\u201d, which means that when you move something away from something else, you can move it at an angle so long as it ends that movement at a greater distance away.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lets-discuss-geometry-and-physics\">Let\u2019s Discuss Geometry and Physics<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>You know a build is going to do something silly when it leads with discussions about semantics, geometry, and physics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ToV, by default, does not make diagonal movement on a grid cost more than horizontal movement. If you can consider a baseball diamond, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd bases are all considered equidistant from home plate. This also means that spheres are cubes, but that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. It\u2019s important to remember this rule when creatures are moved away from other creatures. Being able to move a creature diagonally the same number of squares simplifies how movement works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ToV also does not handle parabolic movement (I promise this matters) in any way, nor does it handle the concept of momentum. This is not a simulation of physics: it\u2019s high-stakes fantasy chess with play acting. Keep this in mind when a creature is repositioned into the air: moving into the air then falling are effectively two independent movements where the target begins and ends at rest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-this-really-allowed\">Is this really allowed?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>By a RAW reading of the rules, yes. It\u2019s not perfectly clear if the designers intended for effects like Open Hand Technique to allow creatures to be moved vertically, or if that possibility was even considered. The ToV text likely copied with 5e text without modification in order to stay close to the original version. Your DM might very reasonably rule that \u201caway\u201d means \u201cdirectly away\u201d, which would absolutely break this combo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Furious Charge feat does us the text &#8220;directly away&#8221;, which gives us ground to argue that Open Hand Technique intentionally did not include that text.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-this-going-to-cause-problems\">Is this going to cause problems?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Maybe, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">Grapple\/Shove<\/a>&nbsp;combo is more annoying, more reliable, and more effective, especially once you start moving the grapple to drag enemies into hazards. The combo on which this build depends has a strictly limited resource cost (Technique Poins) and allows a Strength saving throw. Strength saves tend to be high for most creatures that are going to be targeting by this, and for everything else, grappling them would be much easier and more reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have taken the 5e version of this build into a game. It was hilarious when the combo worked, but the resource limitations and save requirements meant that it was by no means unstoppable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll use the ability scores recommended above.

Your spear is your go-to weapon for most of your career, though you might collect a few other weapons specifically for the Weapon Options that they provide. A handaxe, a quarterstaff, and a few javelins can really diversify your options.<br><br>At level 1, we have 16 AC, which is fine, but hardly safe for a melee-only class. We get two attacks: one with our spear, and one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action. This gives us better than normal damage output for a level 1 character.<br><br>If you have other melee allies, strongly consider using the Trip Weapon Option on your spear so that you can make your Martial Arts attack at Advantage and leave your target Prone for your allies to also attack them with Advantage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Techniques<br>Unarmored Movement +10 ft.<\/td><td>Techniques is where we start to really feel like a Monk. Flurry of Blows will be the primary way that we spend TP for our entire career, but until you have enough TP to use it every turn, you&#8217;ll want to save it for when it&#8217;s going to have a big impact, such as when you have Advantage on your attacks.<br><br>Unarmored Movement stacks with the speed bonus from Quick, raising our speed to 50 feet. This is novel for the moment, but will quickly become a core part of our tactics.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Subclass: Open Hand<br>Focus Intent<br>Open Hand Technique<\/td><td>Focus Intent only works a few times per day, but you can use it to debuff big attacks from enemies or to help yourself and your allies get past an enemy&#8217;s high AC. The uses per day won&#8217;t last long, unfortunately.<br><br>Open Hand Technique is amazing. No additional TP cost and it works when you use Flurry of Blows, which you were probably going to do anyway. If you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll hit with both attacks and get to use Open Hand Technique twice in the same turn.<br><br>However, remember that the save DC is WIS-based, and our WIS will lag a bit for most of our career. Expect enemies to pass the saves reasonably often, and choose between the STR save and the DEX save depending on what you know about your target.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; DC 17 -&gt; 18<br>&#8211; Talent: Furious Charge<\/td><td>An excellent level for us. Our DEX modifier improves, boosting our attacks and our defenses.<br><br>Furious Charge immediately becomes a central part of our tactics. Combining the push effect from Open Hand Technique with the push effect from Furious Charge allows us to launch enemies up to 25 feet, including up to 15 feet into the air thanks to Open Hand Technique. <br><br>This is also where our 50-foot speed starts to have a major impact. In our ideal scenario, we begin our turn 20 feet away from an enemy. Move forward 20 feet, attack as an Action, and use Furious Charge to deal bonus damage and move them 10 feet away. Move back 10 feet, then forward again 20 feet, using all off our 50 feet of movement. Use Flurry of Blows, and if you hit at least once, you can launch your target 25 feet, including 15 feet into the air, causing them to fall prone.<br><br>Our enemy then begins their turn 25 feet away and prone, likely forcing them to spend half of their movement to stand. Most enemies have speed somewhere around 30 feet, but enemies with speed as high as 45 feet will only be able to move 20 feet, forcing them to Dash if they want to get back into melee with us.<br><br>This combo gets easier as we add more movement speed. Unarmored Defense will gradually improve, and we can look for buffs like Longstrider<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Multiattack (2)<br>Stunning Strike<\/td><td>Multiattack means even more damage without dipping into our TP.<br><br>We likely won&#8217;t use Stunning Strike much, instead relying on launching our enemies or crowd control purposes. However, it&#8217;s a great fallback in tight spaces where we can&#8217;t force our enemies away from us. It also prevents enemies from taking actions, which is great against enemies that prefer to fight at range, such as spellcasters.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Empowered Strikes<br>Evasion<br>Unarmored Movement +15 ft.<\/td><td>Empowered Strikes allows us to overcome resistance to non-magic weapon damage, which is increasingly common by this level. If you find that enemies are resistant to your spear, resort to slapping them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Wholeness of Body<\/td><td>This encourages some careful management of your hit points and hit dice. If you&#8217;re taking a Short Rest and Wholeness of Body would get you back to full hp, skip spending Hit Dice.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; DEX 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>18 AC is very respectable, and it should do a lot to keep us alive.

This makes wandering into dangerous places much safer, possibly prevent you from being ambushed or from being attacked if you roll poorly on initiative.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; WIS 16 -&gt; 17<br>&#8211; Talent: <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Astral Teachings<\/td><td>Excellent for filling gaps in your party&#8217;s proficiencies.

We have Touch of Luck, too, so you&#8217;re likely generating at least 2 Luck per turn and can consistently keep 3 Luck and 1 TP available in order to reroll any failed saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Quivering Palm<\/td><td>Dealing damage and possibly killing enemies with this will be rare. CON saves are generally high, so anything targeting a CON save is disproportionately likely to fail.<br><br>The effect on a successful save is a decent consolation prize. Stunning an enemy for a full minute isn&#8217;t going to happen, but you and your party can at least land a few hits before your target can respond.<br><br>Regardless, you&#8217;re unlikely to use this often in combat. One action to apply the vibrations, then another to activate them means two turns where you&#8217;re otherwise not attacking, and you can&#8217;t afford to gamble two turns worth of attacks in any combat where your enemies are important enough to use this.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; WIS 17 -&gt; 18<br>&#8211; Talent: <\/td><td>Better save DCs and 19 AC.<br><br><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Timeless Self<\/td><td>Neat, but rarely impactful.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Empty Body<br>Unarmored Movement +30 ft.<\/td><td>Every encounter that&#8217;s going to be meaningfully threatening should start with you activating Empty Body unless you can activate it before initiative is rolled.<br><br>Our movement speed bonus from Unarmored Movement hits its maximum. Between our base speed of 30 feet, the Quick Talent, and Unarmored Movement, our speed is no 70 feet. If you can convince an ally to spare a 1st-level spell slot for Longstrider, you can hit 80 feet before consider possible magic items.<br><br>If you find some Boots of Speed, your speed becomes truly absurd, allowing you race around the battlefield at breakneak speed, angling ourselves however we want to put enemies exactly where we want them. With a movement pool as high as 160 feet, you&#8217;ll frequently run out of attacks long before you run out of movement.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; WIS 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>Maximum Wisdom means maxed DCs, maximum uses of Focus Intent, and 20 AC before considering magic items.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Epic Boon: Boundless Technique<\/td><td>You now always have enough TP for the Monk&#8217;s Techniques and for Stunning Strike.
