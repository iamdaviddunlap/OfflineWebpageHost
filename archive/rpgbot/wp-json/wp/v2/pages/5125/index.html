Characters with\n\t\tpoor weapon or armor proficiencies can take Armor Proficiency or Weapon\n\t\tProficiency, or you could take Toughness to pad your hit points. Unlike\n\t\tother heritage options which will remain unchanged as real-world time\n\t\tpasses, every new rules supplement which includes new general feats will\n\t\tmake this heritage better.

Since it&#8217;s an\n\t\tinnate spell, it&#8217;s Charisma-based, so this is an easy choice for Charisma-based casters like bards and sorcerers. If you stick to defenses and utility options, your stats don&#8217;t matter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cooperative Nature<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Aid is generally not a good use of an Action in combat unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tinvesting a lot into making it effective. The bonuses are too small to\n\t\tjustify spending an Action on your turn <em>and<\/em> your Reaction unless\n\t\tyou have a reasonably high chance of rolling a Critical Success. Cooperative\n\t\tNature offers an impressive +4 bonus on your skill check to Aid, which\n\t\tsignificantly increases the likelihood of a Critical Success. At 1st level\n\t\twith a Trained skill, you&#8217;ll get a bonus of 3 + your ability modifier, so if\n\t\twe consider a best-case scenario where it&#8217;s a skill that uses your Key\n\t\tAbility Score, you&#8217;re looking at a +7 bonus against a DC of 20 to Aid.\n\t\tThat&#8217;s a 40% chance of success, which isn&#8217;t great. Cooperative Nature raises\n\t\tthat to 60%, which <em>still<\/em> isn&#8217;t great. My advice: If you&#8217;re going to\n\t\tbuild around Aid, you&#8217;ll definitely want this feat, but wait until your\n\t\tskill bonus is better.\n\t\t<p>If you do plan to build around Aid, the Half-Elf Heritage will do a lot\n\t\t\tto improve your options because it has exclusive feats related to Aid.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Courteous Comeback<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: The benefit is good, but it&#8217;s just too restrictive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Devil&#8217;s Advocate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: Unless you&#8217;re playing almost exclusively in Chelaxia, this won&#8217;t matter\n\t\tenough to justify the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Spirit<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: All good offensive cantrips. This is an easy choice for sorcerers with an\n\t\tarcane bloodline, but remember that innate spells are Charisma-based. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not a Charisma-based caster, your stats will lag\n\t\tenough that this won&#8217;t remain useful beyond low levels. Arcane Tattoos is likely a better choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">General Training<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: There are a lot of very good General Feats.

Even while limited to\n\t\t1st-level Class Feats, you still have several excellent options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Natural Skill<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Trained in a skill gets you quite a bit, and for many skills being\n\t\tTrained is all that you&#8217;ll ever need. You do get Skill Increases as you gain\n\t\tlevels, but the list of skills is long and getting more Trained skills at\n\t\t1st level means that you can use your Skill Increases to improve your\n\t\texisting skills rather than learning new ones.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Quah Bond<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: Not amazing, but a skill and a Skill Feat is a good trade for one\n\t\tAncestry Feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saoc Astrology<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: Not quite as reliable as Guidance, but similarly useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tupilaq Carver<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: Summon spells are decent and Summon Construct is only on the Arcane spell\n\t\tlist by default, so for other spellcasters this can be very useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unconventional Weaponry<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only Fighters are Trained in Advanced Weapons, so this is a great way for\n\t\tother classes to get access to a weapon which is a defining part of your\n\t\tbuild, like the Sawtooth Saber for a two-weapon fighting build. Even simple\n\t\tweapon users can benefit from better access to weapons, like rogues looking\n\t\tto use a Dogslicer or Filcher&#8217;s Fork.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats-5\">Level 5<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Adaptive Adept<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Taking a multiclass archetype&#8217;s feats is often a better option. Rather\n\t\tthan forcing you to lock one of your limited known\/prepared cantrips and one\n\t\tof your limited known\/prepared spells, you get additional cantrips and\n\t\tspells slots of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level. Compared to being locked into a\n\t\tsingle 1st-level spell that you can&#8217;t heighten, that&#8217;s a massive\n\t\timprovement.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clever Improviser<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If your character has few Trained skills and you&#8217;ve chosen to invest your\n\t\tskill increases into improving the few skills that you have, you&#8217;ll be\n\t\tUntrained in a wide variety of skills. Untrained Improvisation will grant\n\t\tyou a number of useful options with very little investment, and Clever\n\t\tImproviser grants access to Train-Only Actions, giving you a massive library\n\t\tof new Action options. There&#8217;s little way to guarantee that this will be\n\t\tuseful unless you look for opportunities to make it useful, and it&#8217;s less\n\t\tuseful in a large party or in a party with one or more skill-focused\n\t\tcharacters, but at a bare minimum this covers every Lore skill so your party\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t need to throw Skill Increases at Lore skills which they&#8217;ll likely\n\t\tnever use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Darkseer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: Get this from another ancestry\/heritage, from a spell, or from an\n\t\titem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ornate Tattoo<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: Buy a wand.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sense Allies<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This might be useful if you have multiple allies who like to be stealthy\n\t\tduring combat so that you can still target them with buffs, healing, and\n\t\tother support effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wavetouched Paragon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CG<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and you can usually replace this with spells\n\t\tor items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats-9\">Level 9<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cooperative Soul<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Let&#8217;s assume that you&#8217;re using a skill in which you&#8217;re at least Expert,\n\t\tand we&#8217;ll add a +2 bonus for your Ability Modifier just for the sake of\n\t\targument, and we&#8217;ll call that roughly average for skills where you&#8217;re\n\t\tproficient to some degree and have an Ability Modifier that&#8217;s positive. You\n\t\talso add the +4 bonus from Cooperative Nature since it&#8217;s required. At this\n\t\tlevel, that&#8217;s a total bonus of +19. The DC to Aid is 20. On anything except\n\t\ta Natural 1 (which lowers your degree of success by one, so even though you\n\t\thit 20 you still rolled a Failure), you match the DC 20 to Aid (provided\n\t\tthat your GM doesn&#8217;t alter the DC for some reason, which they&#8217;re absolutely\n\t\tallowed to do).\n\t\t<p>So this is useful with some skills where you have less than a +2 ability\n\t\t\tmodifier for the very tiny window of levels 9 and 10, and after that all\n\t\t\tit does is protect you from natural 1&#8217;s.

The spell itself isn&#8217;t awful, and it&#8217;s fantastic that\n\t\tthe spell scales as you gain levels, but it&#8217;s still only useful for\n\t\tCharisma-based casters like the Sorcerer and the Summoner.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Group Aid<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational.

By this level a skill in which you&#8217;re trained has a bonus of\n\t\t+11 before considering Ability Modifiers, etc., and DCs will typically scale\n\t\ta bit to keep pace. Untrained Improvisation is intended to help cover skills\n\t\tin which you&#8217;re not proficient, and Incredible Improvisation adds a bonus on\n\t\ttop of that. At this level, Untrained Improvisation gives you a +9 (remember\n\t\tthat starting at level 7 you get your full level as a bonus rather than half\n\t\tyour level), and Incredible Improvisation adds +4 on top of that once per\n\t\tday.
