While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait. Despite selecting a base race, you do not count as a member of your race for the purposes of any other effect, such as qualifying for feats or using magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-custom-lineage\" class=\"rating-blue\">Custom Lineage<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>+2 Int, a feat, and either a skill or Darkvision.

But beyond that, the Dhampir&#8217;s other capabilities aren&#8217;t especially useful for the Artificer. Spider Climb is neat, but seems silly when flight is on the table and you can infuse Slippers of Spider Climbing. The ability to attack with Constitution makes the Artificer, famously able to thrive on only Intelligence, unnecessarily dependent on Constitution. Perhaps the most redeeming trait is the ability to use Vampiric Bite to boost your Ability Checks, allowing the Artificer to further stack bonuses onto their skill and tool use..<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-hexblood\" class=\"rating-green\">Hexblood<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>Darkvision, Eerie Token, and the ability to cast Hex add some interesting options.
