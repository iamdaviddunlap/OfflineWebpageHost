If you ever walk into a room without knowing who and what is inside it and what you&#8217;re going to do about it, you aren\u2019t casting enough Divinations. A well-played diviner should always have a plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With divination spells (and spell slots thanks to Expert Divination) in abundance, School of Divination makes the diviner wizard an excellent Scout in addition to the Wizard&#8217;s common roles as a Blaster, Controller, Striker, and Support. While rangers and rogues need to go look around in person, you can scout distant locales from great distances, potentially negating problems long before your enemies even know you exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest problem with relying heavily on divinations is that they can quickly eat your spell slots, often with little tangible effect. Fortunately, Expert Divination dramatically reduces the cost of casting divination spells. Portent provides a wonderful mechanic to influence rolls, allowing you alter the outcome of critical roles in significant and powerful ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to play a diviner, you and your DM need to be prepared to handle divinations and how they work. The DM may be forced to predict the future for you, to offer cryptic hints, or to improvise the idle activities of creatures who are generally just sitting in a room waiting for your party to come fight them. You need to remember to use your divinations to mitigate risk and to solve problems that can\u2019t be solved using Fireball and the like. But, if you put in the work, School of Divination will reward you for your efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">School of Divination Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-divination-ability-scores\">School of Divination Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-divination-races\">School of Divination Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-divination-feats\">School of Divination Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-divination-armor-and-weapons\">School of Divination Armor and Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-probability-and-i-dont-get-along\">Example Build &#8211; Probability and I Don&#8217;t Get Along<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The other\n\t\teffects are replicated with See Invisibility and Comprehend Languages, which\n\t\tcost next to nothing to cast thanks to both Expert Divination and the\n\t\tWizard&#8217;s ability to cast rituals, but having See Invisibility running at all\n\t\ttimes is a helpful defense since See Invisibility only lasts for an\n\t\thour.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Portent<\/span>: Not a game changer, but\n\t\tPortent is fantastic, and this makes it 50% more powerful.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-divination-ability-scores\">School of Divination Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Diviners have largely the same ability score needs as <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">other wizards<\/a>.

In defiance of all statistics and plausible odds, their dice rolls seem to be perpetually cursed, while dice rolls to resist their abilities seem inexplicably blessed. Maybe you are that someone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build is a gift to those among us who view dice rolls as a threat. You are not alone, and together you and I will spit in the face of the dice gods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking a big game here, but this is a wizard build. We&#8217;re going to lean hard into options which manipulate dice rolls, which protect us from bad outcomes, and which generally move the odds in our favor. We&#8217;ll lean on Portent, obviously, but we&#8217;ll also build around tactics which consistently give us tactical advantages in any situation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better: We&#8217;ll avoid rolling dice as much as possible. If you make even one attack roll with this build, something has gone horrifically wrong. There will inevitably be some saving throws rolled against our spells, but we&#8217;ll generally only resort to those when we can make them exceptionally reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build assumes that you&#8217;re using the Optional Class Feature in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything to add additional spells to the Wizard&#8217;s spell list. Many of those spells are divinations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Author&#8217;s Note:<\/strong> Random has informed me that this was the perfect time for a thri-kreen diviner build called &#8220;Forewarned is Four-Armed&#8221;. The pun was right there, and I just ignored it like some kind of&#8230; humorless automaton. But I had a mission to spite probability, and sometimes sacrifices must be made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We can afford to de-emphasize Intelligence in favor of other stats by focusing on non-offensive spells, but this build is feat-heavy, so we&#8217;re going to put a lot into Intelligence so we don&#8217;t fall too far behind.

But now that 3rd-level slot for Tongues gets you Tongues and a 2nd-level slot that you can spend on Borrowed Knowledge to temporarily get proficiency in Persuasion plus a 1st-level slot.<br><br>As you gain levels, give Mind Spike some consideration. It&#8217;s the only divination spell which deals damage, and paired with Expert Divination it&#8217;s a cheap single-target damage option which can largely replace cantrips. Start with one high-level spell slot and work your way down the spell levels. Of course, it requires Concentration, which means dropping Concentration on something more interesting, so this isn&#8217;t always an easy go-to option.<br><br>Dispel Magic lets us remove annoying magic, and you can pair it with Enhance Ability for Advantage on the check if you feel the need and want to spend portent. Counterspell would be good, too, so consider paying to add it to your spellbook.<br><br>Tiny Servant is a portable pet with Blindsight for 8 hours. Turn a hand bell into a little friend and tell it to ring itself when it detects an enemy. If you don&#8217;t see an enemy, it&#8217;s time to break out See Invisibility.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Arcane Eye<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/summoning#summon-abberation\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/summoning#summon-abberation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Summon Aberration<\/a><\/td><td>4th-level spells, which means we finally get Arcane Eye! Arcane Eye is the safest and most efficient way to remotely scout an area. Even better, it has built-in Darkvision so you don&#8217;t need to provide your own. At this point, if you walk into a place, you should already have a map of the area and know generally what&#8217;s inside it. With a 1-hour duration you can easily look around, check for traps, identify enemies, read text, and generally do anything that doesn&#8217;t require hearing or touching things. Ideally this will let you walk into every room buffed for whatever you&#8217;ll encounter, though closed doors and windows may present a problem.<br><br>Pick up Divination (the spell). You can cast it as a ritual, so it&#8217;s a great way to cover anything you can&#8217;t scout with Arcane Eye. &#8220;What is behind this door?&#8221; is a fine question to ask, and the DM needs to give you a truthful answer. But, like Augury, it has a cumulative failure chance each day, so be cautious.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: Lucky<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Banishment<br>&#8211; Raulothim&#8217;s Psychic Lance<\/td><td>Lucky is always great. You can safely reserve Portent for harming enemies and helping allies, and you can use Lucky to support your own saves and for ability checks for things like Counterspell and Dispel Magic.<br><br>Banishment removes extraplanar enemies, but you can also take other enemies out of the fight while you deal with their allies, allowing you to split encounters and make them considerably less dangerous. Raulothim&#8217;s Psychic Lance targets Intelligence, and, while the damage isn&#8217;t amazing, it makes the target <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#incapacitated\" data-type=\"page\">Incapacitated<\/a>, robbing them of everything except movement on their next turn. If you have the spell slots, you can repeatedly hit enemies with this and trivialize encounters against single enemies.<br><br>Banishment and Psychic Lance give us options for taking saves that are often weak. We can use Web to target enemies with poor Dexterity, Psychic Lance for Intelligence, Hypnotic Pattern or Suggestion for Wisdom, and Banishment for Charisma. If enemies still pass their save, use Portent or Silvery Barbs. That gives our offensive spells a lot of insurance.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Telekinesis<br>&#8211; Wall of Force<\/td><td>5th-level spells.<br><br>For divinations, you&#8217;ve got four great options at this level. Contact Other Plane is amazing, but risky despite your relatively high Intelligence, and you can&#8217;t concentrate on Enhance Ability while casting it, so be prepared to use Portent to keep from going insane. Legend Lore is &#8220;Ask the DM about the plot&#8221; as a spell. Rary&#8217;s Telepathic Bond is a ritual and if you should keep it running any time there&#8217;s even a remote chance of danger.<br><br>Scrying is only really useful against named antagonists, but, when it is useful, you should frequently spy on anyone you consider to be a problem.<br><br>5th level also brings Skill Empowerment as an option. Expertise in a skill is typically more effective than Advantage on the check, but the gap is small until your Proficiency Bonus improves and Skill Empowerment is 3 levels higher than Enhance Ability and not a divination so we can&#8217;t mitigate the cost. Stick to Enhance Ability.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>The Third Eye<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Hold Monster<br>&#8211; Synaptic Static<\/td><td>The Third Eye provides a passive sense. We can get Darkvision for 8 hours from a 2nd-level spell and Greater Comprehension can be replaced by casting Comprehend Languages as a ritual. The range on seeing invisible stuff is only 10 feet, which is laughably small, and we have our tiny servant&#8217;s blindsight for that. Seeing into the ethereal plane is the gap in our defenses, so go for that.<br><br>Hold Monster is riskier than Hypnotic Pattern because targets get an additional save at the end of their turn. However, you have the odds stacked in your favor: You have Portent, Silvery Barbs, and Mind Sliver to repeatedly debuff a target&#8217;s saves while our party auto-crits them to death.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/contingency\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"12581\">Contingency<\/a><br>&#8211; Otto\u2019s Irresistible Dance<\/td><td>6th-level spells. I love Contingency so much.<br><br>Otto&#8217;s Irresistible Dance is named as such because the effect is automatic and targets don&#8217;t get a save until the end of their turn. That&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re short on stuff like Portent and need to handle some enemies.<br><br>For divinations, grab True Seeing. It&#8217;s the only option at this level. The 25gp component is meant to deter you, but by this level you have so much gold that if you saw 25gp on the ground you might not bother picking it up. You don&#8217;t need to run it constantly, but, if there&#8217;s ever a chance you&#8217;ll need it, you should cast it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Fey Touched (Int 17 -&gt; 18)<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Chain Lightning<br>&#8211; Eyebite<\/td><td>For Fey Touched, we&#8217;ll select Bane as our 1st-level spell. This is a weird choice, but hear me out: Math.<br><br>Bane is a 1st-level spell and the effect is super annoying. For legendary creatures, you give them an impossible decision: Do they burn a legendary resistance to resist a 1st-level spell? Or do they spend the rest of the encounter subtracting a d4 from their attacks and saves? If they decide to spend a Legendary Resistance, you can do it again on your next turn. It&#8217;s a 1st-level slot. If they suffer the effect, you can upgrade to something like Blindness\/Deafness or simple damage spells like Catapult, and that&#8217;s before considering whatever your allies are doing.<br><br>Throw Synaptic Static on top of Bane&#8217;s penalties to attacks, and they&#8217;re subtracting 1d4+1d6 (average 6 total) from their attacks, making them massively less dangerous. For enemy spellcasters, you have Counterspell and Lucky to back up your ability checks. Enemies that rely on special abilities will still be a problem, but you have other spells for those enemies.<br><br>Chain Lightning and Eyebite are excellent and reliable offensive options.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Forcecage<br>&#8211; Reverse Gravity<\/td><td>7th-level spells. This is the first level where there are literally no divination spells to select. It feels weird. We won&#8217;t see more divinations until 9th level.<br><br>Melee-only enemies? Reverse Gravity. Throw rocks at them until they&#8217;re not a problem. Otherwise, strongly consider Forcecage. No save, no risk.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Greater Portent<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Plane Shift<br>&#8211; Simulacrum<\/td><td>50% more portent!<br><br>Plane Shift is equal parts transportation and upgrade from Banishment. You can deliver the spell via your familiar, allowing you to send anything with poor Charisma off to a plane that&#8217;s very hostile to it.<br><br>Get yourself a Simulacrum. They can cast rituals for you, keep watch, use skills, and generally be very helpful. Since they&#8217;re a separate creature, their failure chances for Augury and Divination are separate from yours. They can&#8217;t regain spell slots, unfortunately, so save their slots for important stuff.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Clone<br>&#8211; Maze<\/td><td>8th-level spells. Still no new divinations.<br><br>Clone adds to your layers of insurance. Now we have insurance against death by any means and we&#8217;re functionally immortal. Clone your whole party and you now have a team of immortal high-fantasy superheroes.<br><br>Maze removes an enemy from a fight without a saving throw, and most of the Monster Manual will struggle to pass the Intelligence check to escape. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (18 -&gt; 20)<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Antimagic Field<br>&#8211; Maddening Darkness<\/td><td>Finally 20 Intelligence!<br><br>Maddening Darkness is area control over a large area.

You don&#8217;t necessarily need that, but it&#8217;s hard to think of a better use for a free divination spell since Augury has a cumulative failure chance.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient (Con) (Constitution 13 -&gt; 14)<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>A total of +7 added to our Constitution saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Signature Spells<br>&#8211; Dispel Magic<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Signature Spells is so much worse than Spell Mastery that I don&#8217;t understand why their order isn&#8217;t reversed.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Forewarned is fore-armed, and School of Divination is all about forewarning and forethought.
