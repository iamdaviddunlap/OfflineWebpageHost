Early on in fifth edition, there were two (and a half, I&#8217;m not really counting arcane trickster) options for gish characters: Eldritch Knights and Bladesingers. The former were very much \u201cwhat if a fighter could cast spells\u201d while the latter made a stab at letting wizards not die in melee. For two whole years, Bladesinger reigned supreme as the most damaging spellsword\u2026 and then Hexblade happened and immediately blew both other options out of the water. All three were rated blue on the site before I wrote this article, but as part of doing so we moved Bladesinger down for several reasons as you&#8217;ll see below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hexblade solved the main problem faced by gish characters: multiple ability dependence. If I have to swing a sword, that&#8217;s going to take strength or dexterity. My spells are going to be powered (for either of the subclasses mentioned) by intelligence. Since I&#8217;m a front-line character, I&#8217;m going to be frequently targeted by enemies and therefore I need constitution to not die and maintain concentration on my spells. But the Hexblade says no no, let&#8217;s cut that down to just our spellcasting stat, enough dexterity to fill out medium armor (which Bladesingers can&#8217;t use) and then I can put the rest into Con. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in the face of a pile of disadvantages, why would you still play a Bladesinger? Because, at its heart, it&#8217;s still a subclass of the single most powerful class in the game: Wizard. You will have <em>far<\/em> more flexibility to handle your issues than a Hexblade ever will, and you can still buckle some swashes with the best of them. Let&#8217;s dig in and see what that looks like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is specifically for the Bladesinger Wizard, and omits sections of typical class handbooks when those sections aren&#8217;t meaningfully different from other members of the class.

Performance proficiency (which is\n\t\talready hard to use) on an severely MAD class that doesn&#8217;t want Charisma\n\t\tfeels like a ribbon. Getting access to light armor while not getting it as\n\t\tpart of character creation feels mean because you either have to carry a set\n\t\tof studded leather around with you for a whole level that you can&#8217;t use or\n\t\tyou have to try buying it in the wild, but at least it helps your AC a\n\t\tlittle if you don&#8217;t feel like spending a spell slot on mage armor (which\n\t\tmakes sense at low level when you don&#8217;t have all that many). Getting access\n\t\tto a single melee weapon makes whip shenanigans much harder because you can\n\t\teither have a damaging weapon like a rapier or a whip but not both, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tcertainly better than the dismal list of weapons wizards have access to\n\t\totherwise.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bladesong<\/span>: The defining feature of the\n\t\tclass, it&#8217;s a powerful enhancement that tries to turn a wizard into a\n\t\thexblade. Adding intelligence to defensive things definitely helps keep you\n\t\talive and keep your concentration going, but it doesn&#8217;t help you actually do\n\t\tdamage. You also get additional move speed which helps you get yourself\n\t\tcloser to the things that can attack into your optimally probably 18 AC, no\n\t\tworse than a low-level fighter but also no better and without any of the big\n\t\thit dice or healing\/mitigation mechanics of other classes (for now).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Bladesong, combined with high Dexterity and buffs like Shield, allows the\n\t\t\tBladesinger to boost their AC to heights that most classes simply can&#8217;t\n\t\t\tmatch without without magic items. However, you&#8217;re still vulnerable to\n\t\t\tother sources of damage like spells and area of effect damage, so bring\n\t\t\tother defensive options like Absorb Elements and Counterspell. Also\n\t\t\tremember that a single critical hit could easily take you out of combat\n\t\t\tunless you can also use Song of Defense to reduce the damage enough to\n\t\t\tkeep yourself going.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since your uses of Bladesong per day are tied to your Proficiency Bonus,\n\t\t\tat low levels you need to think of this more as an occasional buff than\n\t\t\tyour go-to option in combat. Use this as-needed primarily as a defensive\n\t\t\tbuff and pretend that you&#8217;re any other type of wizard until you pick up\n\t\t\tExtra Attack and your Proficiency Bonus increases.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: One of your attacks can be a\n\t\tcantrip, so you can use Booming Blade\/Green-Flame Blade\/Swordburst and make\n\t\tan additional weapon attack using one Action. You get all the effectiveness\n\t\tof using an attack cantrip without giving up the multiple attacks made by\n\t\tusing Extra Attack so you get the best of both options. Short of the\n\t\tEldritch Knight&#8217;s War Magic feature (which notably uses a Bonus Action), no\n\t\tother &#8220;gish&#8221; subclass can match this capability.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This Attack change notably works even while you&#8217;re not using Bladesong.\n\t\t\tConsider carrying a decent ranged weapon like a crossbow so that on turns\n\t\t\twhen you plan to use a ranged attack cantrip you can make a ranged weapon\n\t\t\tattack in the same turn. Even if your Dexterity is still at a +3 bonus\n\t\t\tthat attack is still a chance at some extra damage for very little\n\t\t\teffort.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This is a totally unneeded improvement to the subclass, but since you&#8217;re\n\t\t\ttaking the Attack action to use this, it&#8217;s compatible with both two-weapon\n\t\t\tfighting and Crossbow Expert. Booming Blade plus two weapon attacks or\n\t\t\tFire Bolt and two crossbow shots at range is pretty great, especially once\n\t\t\tyou pick up Song of Victory and Tenser&#8217;s Transformation.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Song of Defense<\/span>: This is a great way to\n\t\tpad your d6 hit points, but it will eat through your spell slots very\n\t\tquickly. Consider Absorb Elements and Shield as your go-to options for\n\t\tmitigating damage, but if Shield won&#8217;t negate an attack you might use this\n\t\tinstead if you expect the damage to be more than you&#8217;re willing to take.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Song of Victory<\/span>: A bit late to the game,\n\t\tbut by now you should easily have 20 Intelligence, so 5 bonus damage per\n\t\tmelee weapon attack (yes, only melee) is pretty nice. Since Extra Attack can\n\t\tget you two attacks without giving up the benefits of a cantrip like Booming\n\t\tBlade, this can be a noteworthy boost to your damage output on turns where\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not throwing around leveled spells. Combine this with Tenser&#8217;s\n\t\tTransformation, and a mundane rapier could deal 1d8+10+2d12 damage per\n\t\tattack, which is pretty great. But, while the damage bonus is nice, at this\n\t\tlevel a +5 damage bonus on your weapon attacks is frequently less impactful\n\t\tthan upcasting Fireball, which any wizard can do.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\"><strong>Abilities<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>While we might pass for something else, we are still very much a wizard and\n\tneed to stack Int to the sky. Wisdom gets the bump here over anything else for\n\ta number of reasons, but mostly to pass Wisdom saves and prevent hindering\n\tPerception. Basically every Charm\/Fear effect targets Wisdom, and not being\n\table to get closer to your target as a melee combatant is a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Since you need to be attacking with\n\t\tfinesse weapons, this should be your second-highest stat. It will also help\n\t\tboost your AC and help keep you safe from the AoE attacks things will\n\t\tinevitably throw your way once they realize that trying to attack into your\n\t\tincredible AC is a waste of time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Third in importance. While you have\n\t\tsome defensive capabilities, you are a front line combatant and need the hit\n\t\tpoints to match, and the bonus to concentration saves will be very helpful\n\t\twhen you&#8217;re not running bladesong.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: The Wizard&#8217;s spells and class\n\t\tfeatures are powered by Intelligence.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Important saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Standard Array<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\"><strong>Races<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t using the optional rules from Tasha&#8217;s, make sure to look for Dexterity as the secondary stat harder than you would for normal wizards. Tortle is a tempting choice to get that high base AC that would then be modified by Bladesong, but since you also need Dex to make sure your weapon attacks land it doesn&#8217;t really help much. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the bonus from Song of Victory only applies to melee attacks, we&#8217;re also giving up power budget by choosing a flying race so I&#8217;d stick to something like (perhaps unsurprisingly) an elf of either high or wood flavor. Wood Elf gets you a nice pile of weapon proficiencies that use dex so you don&#8217;t have to feel bad about wanting options, and the additional move speed is helpful for melee positioning. In fact, if you&#8217;re customizing origins as per Tasha&#8217;s, you can turn the longsword proficiency into rapier proficiency and walk out stabbing people as hard as a fighter. Of course you still die much faster than a fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more help picking a race, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"10502\">Wizard Races Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\"><strong>Backgrounds<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve listened to our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-s2e12\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-s2e12\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">podcast episode on backstory<\/a> (it features a large section on backgrounds), you&#8217;ll know that backgrounds are fundamentally just a label to slap on a pile of proficiencies that can be whatever you like. Pick a unique feature you like from one and go to town customizing. For optimizing from the presets, you probably want to lean into your high intelligence and do something like Sage or Cloistered Scholar, although leaning into your dex can be fine too if you&#8217;re trying to fill in as the group&#8217;s Scout. Urchin would probably be my pick for that route.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\"><strong>Feats<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In general, this build wants too many ASIs to bother with many feats.\n\tAssuming point buy and an optimized race, the two stats you care most about\n\twill start at 17\/16. Level 4 will get you a hybrid feat, 8 gets you to 20, 12\n\tand 16 cap your second stat and that leaves you exactly one ASI that can be\n\tturned into a feat, but the earlier you do it the more you handicap yourself\n\tagainst the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math of the Game<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we get one Hybrid feat that must be Dex or Int and then maybe one feat at\n\t19th level. If you choose variant human you can shift the feat to first level\n\tand make it not required to be hybrid, while still maintaining correct\n\tfundamental math for both stats you care about. That opens up some\n\topportunities like walking out with Warcaster which is kinda neat for using\n\tBooming Blade on people who try to walk past you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the hybrid feats, you have a few strong contenders:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/89-elven-accuracy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elven Accuracy<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Are you an\n\t\tElf or Half-Elf?\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/oops-all-elves\/\">RPGBOT &#8211; Oops all elves<\/a><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/451349-fey-touched\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fey Touched<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Slightly\n\t\tless good as a wizard because you can learn these spells just by paying\n\t\tmoney, but it&#8217;s still 2 free spells per long rest.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/452845-piercer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TCoE<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This a\n\t\tpretty good feat if you use the stereotypical rapier or if you use short\n\t\tswords, but in order to keep the fundamental math working we can&#8217;t take it\n\t\tuntil level 12.

You mind way less than most wizards that it leaves you\n\t\tadjacent to someone when you&#8217;re done, and the damage is still very good, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s just frustrating that it&#8217;s not better for you than for most wizards,\n\t\tand Evokers can use it even better than you can thanks to Overchannel.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Invisibility<\/span> is a fantastic\n\t\tpersonal buff. It gives you advantage on attack rolls, it prevents people\n\t\tfrom taking opportunity attacks against you and targeting you with most\n\t\tspells and effects, and even if someone does guess where you are, attacking\n\t\tyou still has disadvantage which will be very hard to attack into your high\n\t\tAC.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Shroud<\/span> is poor man&#8217;s Tenser&#8217;s but\n\t\tdoes actually have some really nice benefits like making things move more\n\t\tslowly around you and allowing you access to Necrotic and Radiant damage if\n\t\tthose types will be helpful for a given fight like against Zombies. Truth be\n\t\ttold, it actually does the thing you care most about (damage dice on weapon\n\t\tattacks) while also not having the exhaustion drawback or preventing you\n\t\tfrom casting other spells.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\"><strong>Multiclassing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There are many and varied opinions. Starting with a level of Artificer gets\n\tyou access to armor immediately, proficiency in Con saves and the ability to\n\tcast Cure Wounds as an Intelligence spell. If you&#8217;re willing to put 3 levels\n\tinto it you can either go Armorer with a defender primary and be a wizard\u2026\n\ttank\u2026 or you can go Battle Smith. Either one of those gets you the ability to\n\tattack with Intelligence, but that&#8217;s at the cost of 3 levels. Paladin\/Bard\n\tinto Hexblade is so popular because it&#8217;s just a 1 level dip. So even though\n\tArtificer is the most popular choice, I fall pretty cleanly into the \u201cdon&#8217;t\u201d\n\tcamp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s hard to hype up and not very flashy, what makes wizards so strong\n\tis their immense versatility. A bladesinger is thematically very cool, but\n\tit&#8217;s fundamentally just a wizard holding a pointy stick. No doubt there is\n\tsome fun to be had there, but if you lean so hard into the pointy stick you&#8217;re\n\tholding that you forget about being a wizard you&#8217;re just shooting yourself in\n\tthe foot. So I say just be a wizard as hard as you can and have some flair\n\twhile you do it.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>So, in a break from tradition, I&#8217;m going to put in a conclusion here before I give you an example build because I ended up doing a decent amount of reading for this handbook. I&#8217;m trying to convince Tyler to downgrade Bladesinger from blue because, honestly, it&#8217;s at odds with what wizard tries to do. It tries to shoehorn you into picking up spells that tailor to a gish playstyle but <em>literally<\/em> every offensive buff on the wizard list requires concentration (except Foresight but that doesn&#8217;t really count), meaning you can only do one at a time. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone are the day of stacking Haste, Tenser&#8217;s Transformation, and Girallon&#8217;s Blessing and tearing someone several new orifices in 6 seconds like you could in 3.x. Even if you could do that, you&#8217;d functionally just be nerfing yourself down to doing a lot of damage as a wizard, and if you wanted to do that you could just be an evoker and do it safely from a distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a class&#8217;s biggest power source is enormous flexibility and you strap on a subclass that forces you to specialize into doing something other people do better, you know you&#8217;re in a bad place. When you realize that all your tools to try to catch up to them are mutually exclusive to each other, then the sadness really sets in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to say you shouldn&#8217;t play a Bladesinger. Please live your dream\n\tin this character and have enormous fun with it. Roleplay like a madperson,\n\tstab some things, cast some spells, and enjoy everything a Bladesinger can be.\n\tBut I would be remiss, in a character optimization website, not to say that\n\toptimizing a Bladesinger feels like trying to sharpen a stick when you&#8217;re\n\tsurrounded by perfectly good knives.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-goblin-bladesinging-wizard\"><strong>Example Build &#8211; Goblin Bladesinging Wizard<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>They think they&#8217;re so special just because they&#8217;re tall.

I would probably look into Web or Earthen Grasp depending on whether you&#8217;re running into more large targets or mobs. Shadow Blade would also be a good option here, particularly if you&#8217;re in an Underdark campaign or something where dim light is plentiful.<br><br>Sadly, astute readers will notice that all of those are concentration, making them mutually exclusive with each other and with Magic Weapon.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Spells Known: Fireball, See notes<\/td><td>Stabbing things is all well and good, but take Fireball.

I talked about it above, but it&#8217;s still a great option for you.

For the sake of discussion, let&#8217;s just give you infinite slots for Shield and Absorb Elements and say your AC is 25 and you have resistance to elemental damage. This means those attacks will miss you 75% of the time. That makes your effective HP against attacks 200, and 100 for elemental attacks thanks for Absorb elements. Let&#8217;s average that out to 150 for super quick napkin math.<br><br>Polymorphing into a T-Rex gives you 136 temp HP, added onto your base of 50 for a total 186, which is more than our theoretical infinite-spell-slot wizard above.

You maintain your \u201calignment and personality\u201d which hopefully means your capacity to differentiate and not eat friends. But the DPR for a bladesinger doesn&#8217;t catch up until level 14 when you get Song of Victory. So, you could be a Bladesinger and put all your resources into that, or you could just be a dinosaur. I&#8217;m giving the Bladesinger a little bit of short shrift here because I didn&#8217;t include the bonus for Piercer in that calculation, but I gave Booming Blade a 50% trigger chance so let&#8217;s call that even.<br><br>Anyway, let&#8217;s pick up some utility.

Almost nothing can break it, and with a 10-minute duration you can easily entrap the biggest thing in a fight while you go and deal with its friends or while you and your friends heal, buff, and set up prepared actions. Against especially large creatures you can raise the dome off the floor enough that you can still target the victim&#8217;s feet while the victim is unable to escape. (But it&#8217;s still concentration, so no Haste while you&#8217;re doing it).<br><br>Cast Telepathic Bond as a ritual. The ability to communicate silently across limitless distance is a massive tactical advantage in most situations where other creatures are a problem. This also neatly solves the challenge of language barriers (including while you&#8217;re polymorphed), so if you can get a target to sit around for 10 minutes you no longer need Tongues.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<br><\/td><td>New Cantrips Known: Any<br>Spells Known: Skill Empowerment,\n\t\t\t\t\tCreation<br>Song of Defense<\/td><td>For your new Cantrip, I&#8217;d probably take Green Flame Blade if you&#8217;re not fighting many things resistant to fire damage since the cleave is better guaranteed damage than Booming Blade, but really anything works.<br><br>We still have our go-to combat buff of Haste, so let&#8217;s keep picking up utility. Both of these spells have many, many uses outside of fighting and we&#8217;d like to keep being as wizardly as possible.<br><br>We mentioned Song of Defense before. It&#8217;s not bad, but it&#8217;s certainly not great. Use it when you eat a stray crit to help keep the incoming damage low. (Or just cast Silvery Barbs if it&#8217;s allowed at your table. It really shouldn&#8217;t be, which is why I haven&#8217;t told you to prepare it thus far. But if it is, it&#8217;s a much better defensive mechanism against said stray crits.)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spells Known: Tenser&#8217;s Transformation, Disintegrate<\/td><td>Remember that other short sword you&#8217;ve been carrying around since level 1?

So you&#8217;re just swinging twice with a short sword and then once with your offhand short sword. No Shield or Absorb Elements to keep you safe. With that said, it&#8217;s still the better of the two choices between that and Tasha&#8217;s Otherworldly Guise since that one provides no offensive help.<br><br>Tenser&#8217;s is now going to be your once-a-day buff. I say once-a-day because it forces you to make a save that, unaided, you only have a 40% chance to avoid getting a level of exhaustion when it ends (they make sure to specify that you make the save <em>after<\/em> it ends, meaning you don&#8217;t get to use the proficiency bonus to Con saves the spell grants). So if you fail the first save, you can&#8217;t risk casting it again. One level of exhaustion is annoying out of combat, but two is crippling. Being a T-rex is looking more and more tempting.<br><br>So, you get one big buffed fight, then it&#8217;s back to Haste. What else do we do with a new spell level? Disintegrate.

Early on in fifth edition, there were two (and a half, I&#8217;m not really counting arcane trickster) options for gish characters: Eldritch Knights and Bladesingers. The former were very much \u201cwhat if a fighter could cast spells\u201d while the latter made a stab at letting wizards not die in melee. For two whole years, Bladesinger reigned supreme as the most damaging spellsword\u2026 and then Hexblade happened and immediately blew both other options out of the water.
