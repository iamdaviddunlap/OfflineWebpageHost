I&#8217;ll wait here because this is a text document on the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you good and confused? That&#8217;s alright, so was I. Let&#8217;s break things down a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-do-you-get-when-you-polymorph\">What do you get when you polymorph?<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&#8220;+10 bonus on Disguise skill checks&#8221; (presumably only to appear as a member of whatever species you polymorph into. Polymorphing into a Fire Elemental won&#8217;t help you impersonate a dwarven prince.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;a number of bonuses to your ability scores and a bonus to your natural armor&#8221;. The Ability score modifiers are size modifiers, so they don&#8217;t stack with whatever you get from your race or from spells like Enlarge Person.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Movement Types: Flight, Climb, Swim, etc. Keep in mind that you only get these if specified in the spell&#8217;s entry. If the creature has a move speed greater or less than what is specified in the spell, you get the lesser of the two. For example: if the creature has a fly speed of 10 feet and the spell specifies a fly speed of 30, you get a fly speed of 10 feet. If the creature instead specifies a fly speed of 100 feet, you only get a fly speed of 30 feet. Maneuverability follows the same rule.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resistances: Resistances to energy, DR, etc., but not type immunities like elementals&#8217; immunity to sneak attacks (Unless they are mentioned in the spell&#8217;s description)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Senses: Darkvision, Low-Light Vision, Blindsense, etc. If the creature has greater\/lesser version of the ability (e.g. Darkvision greater than 60 ft.), you get the creature&#8217;s version. Keep in mind that you only get these if specified in the spell&#8217;s entry.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Your base speed changes to match that of the form you assume.&#8221;: This is only your base speed, not the fly, climb, or swim speeds that the creature might possess. Most spells will specify that you can get special movement speeds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;The DC for any of these abilities equals your DC for the polymorph spell used to change you into that form.&#8221;: This sentence should have been placed two sentences earlier in the paragraph. If the polymorph effect grants you access to one of the creature&#8217;s abilities, such as Poison, Trample, or a Breath Weapon, the DC to resist that ability is equal to the DC for the polymorph effect. This is fantastic because it makes poisons extremely difficult to resist, and make Spell Focus (Polymorph) worth taking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;any of the natural attacks of the base creature, including proficiency in those attacks&#8221;: Claws, bite, tail, gore, wing slam, etc. &#8220;These attacks are based on your base attack bonus, modified by your Strength or Dexterity as appropriate, and use your Strength modifier for determining damage bonuses.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;If a polymorph spell causes you to change size, apply the size modifiers appropriately, changing your armor class, attack bonus, Combat Maneuver Bonus, and Stealth skill modifiers. Your ability scores are not modified by this change unless noted by the spell.&#8221;: So halflings don&#8217;t get extra strength from polymorphing into something really big.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Space and Reach: You assume the form&#8217;s space and reach. If you&#8217;re human and polymorph into a reature with a 15&#215;15 ft. space and 10 ft. reach, you now take up a 15&#215;15 ft. square and have a reach of 10 ft.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-do-you-do-not-get-when-you-polymorph\">What do you do NOT get when you polymorph?<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Extraordinary Abilities (Unless they are mentioned in the spell&#8217;s description): &#8220;Your new body might look and feel like the genuine article, but it&#8217;s not the genuine article.&#8221; &#8211;Rules of the Game: Polymorphing (Part Two)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supernatural Abilities<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spell-Like Abilities<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Special Attacks (Unless they are mentioned in the spell&#8217;s description)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Racial skill bonuses, like the Owl&#8217;s bonuses to Perception and Stealth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Polymorph spells cannot be used to change into specific individuals&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Polymorph spells cannot be used to assume the form of a creature with a template or an advanced version of a creature.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-to-you-when-you-polymorph\">What happens to you when you polymorph?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you polymorph into a humanoid, not much. But unless you&#8217;re using Alter Self, you&#8217;re probably polymorphing into something cool. Namely &#8220;a creature of the animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin type.&#8221; If you polymorph into one of these, here&#8217;s what happens:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&#8220;all of your gear melds into your body. Items that provide constant bonuses and do not need to be activated continue to function while melded in this way (with the exception of armor and shield bonuses, which cease to function).&#8221;: This means that your ring of protection, your cloak of resistance, and your belt of physical perfection all continue to function. Your +1 Full Plate does not (unless you add the Wild property, and even then only if you&#8217;re using Wild Shape). Mage Armor provides an armor bonus, but it&#8217;s not part of your gear so it doesn&#8217;t meld into you. I would rule that the spells Mage Armor and Shield continue to function, but check with your GM to be sure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Items that require activation cannot be used while you maintain that form.&#8221;: So no wands, staves, potions, or many slotless magic items. As a GM I might allow you to activate items that don&#8217;t meld into your form (consider a Polymorphic Pouch) provided that you have correct anatomy to manipulate it. Again, check with your GM.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;you cannot cast any spells that require material components (unless you have the Eschew Materials or Natural Spell feat), and can only cast spells with somatic or verbal components if the form you choose has the capability to make such movements or speak, such as a dragon.&#8221;: Eschew Materials suddenly seems like a really good idea for Transmuters and Polymorph enthusiasts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;If your new form does not cause your equipment to meld into your form, the equipment resizes to match your new size.&#8221;: So if you polymorph into an Ogre, your greatsword will change size to Large. Depending on your DM, your over- or under-sized items may also change size with you. So your barbarian&#8217;s large Bastard Sword might stay large when you polymorph him into an Ogre, or it may stay one size larger than them. Check with your DM.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;While under the effects of a polymorph spell, you lose all extraordinary and supernatural abilities that depend on your original form (such as keen senses, scent, and darkvision), as well as any natural attacks and movement types possessed by your original form.&#8221;: &#8220;Depend on your original form&#8221; is important here. Very few of your class abilities will depend on your &#8220;original form&#8221;, so you&#8217;re probably only going to lose your racial senses.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;You also lose any class features that depend upon form, but those that allow you to add features (such as sorcerers that can grow claws) still function.&#8221;: So Sorcerers can polymorph into a snake and grow claws. WAR SKINK.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;You can only be affected by one polymorph spell at a time. If a new polymorph spell is cast on you (or you activate a polymorph effect, such as wild shape), you can decide whether or not to allow it to affect you, taking the place of the old spell. In addition, other spells that change your size have no effect on you while you are under the effects of a polymorph spell.&#8221;: If you are affected by Baleful Polymorph, someone can Polymorph you and you can choose to end the Baleful Polymorph effect and then wait for the Polymorph effect to wear off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While most of these should be obvious, the GM is the final arbiter of what abilities depend on form and are lost when a new form is assumed. Your new form might restore a number of these abilities if they are possessed by the new form.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-if-i-polymorph-something-which-is-smaller-than-small-or-bigger-than-medium\">What if I polymorph something which is smaller than Small or bigger than Medium?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The only difference is that you need to adjust the abilities for the creature&#8217;s size before you apply the modifiers for polymorph.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Creature&#8217;s Original Size<\/th><th>Str<\/th><th>Dex<\/th><th>Con<\/th><th>Adjusted Size<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Fine<\/td><td>+6<\/td><td>-6<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Small<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Diminutive<\/td><td>+6<\/td><td>-4<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Small<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tiny<\/td><td>+4<\/td><td>-2<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Small<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Small<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Small<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Medium<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Large<\/td><td>-4<\/td><td>+2<\/td><td>-2<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Huge<\/td><td>-8<\/td><td>+4<\/td><td>-4<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gargantuan<\/td><td>-12<\/td><td>+4<\/td><td>-6<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Colossal<\/td><td>-16<\/td><td>+4<\/td><td>-8<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-i-use-weapons-while-polymorphed\">Can I use weapons while polymorphed?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Yes! &#8220;If your new form does not cause your equipment to meld into your form, the equipment resizes to match your new size.&#8221; So if you&#8217;re an Eldritch Knight and you use Giant Form, you can continue using your awesome magic sword.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lets-look-at-some-examples\">Let&#8217;s look at some examples<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Marly is a level 10 dwarf wizard. His move speed is 20, and he has Darkvision. He has no other special movement speeds or vision types. He regularly casts Polymorph, so he needs to understand what happens to him when he changes shape. Polymorph allows you to duplicate the effects of Beast Shape II, Elemental Body I, and Alter Self, so let&#8217;s look at some examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marly wears bracers of armor +1, a ring of protection +1, a cloak of resistance +1, a Quick Runner&#8217;s shirt, and a belt of physical perfection +2.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"marly-polymorphs-into-a-human\">Marly polymorphs into a human<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>In this case, Polymorph behaves like Alter Self. Marly loses his darkvision and his 20 foot movement speed. He gains the human 30 foot move speed, and a +2 size bonus to strength, as specified in the Alter Self spell description. Because he is still a humanoid, his items all continue to function normally.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"marly-polymorphs-into-an-earth-elemental\">Marly polymorphs into an earth elemental<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Being a dwarf often involves a large quantity of being underground. At one point, Marly decides that he wants to earth glide through some walls and ceilings. When he polymorphs into an earth elemental, Marly looks at the entry for earth elementals in Elemental Body I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and a +4 natural armor bonus. You also gain darkvision 60 feet, and the ability to earth glide.&#8221; From the bestiary entry for Small Earth Elementals, Marly gains a 20 ft. move speed. He <em>does not<\/em> get the elemental&#8217;s burrow speed, as it is not specified in the spell. However, he does get the Earth Glide ability. Because you can&#8217;t Earth Glide without a burrow speed, it stands to reason that Marly should get the burrow speed as part of the Earth Glide ability, even though it is not specifically stated in the spell description, but that&#8217;s something that the player and the GM should discuss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the spell allows you to gain the elemental&#8217;s darkvision, but does not specify tremorsense. This means that Marly <em>does not<\/em> get tremorsense. Marly also gains the small earth elemental&#8217;s slam attack, dealing 1d6 damage plus his newly modified strength bonus. He does not get the elemental&#8217;s immunities to bleed, critical hits, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marly loses the effect of his bracers of armor (&#8220;with the exception of armor and shield bonuses, which cease to function)&#8221;) and can&#8217;t activate his Quick Runner&#8217;s shirt, but his ring of protection, cloak of resistance, and belt of physical perfection all continue to function as normal (&#8220;items that provide constant bonuses&#8230; continue to function&#8221;:).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementals are capable of speech, which means that they can perform Verbal Components. Marly will likely need Eschew Materials for many of his spells, or he will need to set his spell component pouch down before he polymorphs and pick it up later. At his DMs discretion, he may also be able to use Somatic Components, but the DM may rule that earth elementals rock-like appendages aren&#8217;t precise enough to mimic complex Somatic Components. This is entirely up to the DM, so Marly needs to make sure to check with the DM before his tries to cast any spells. At some point, Marly may choose to invest in Still Spell to remove this complication.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"marly-polymorphs-her-horse-into-a-horse\">Marly polymorphs her Horse&#8230; into a Horse<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Marly is clearly mad, and decides to cast polymorph on her trusty steed. A Horse is Large and has Str 16, Dex 14, and Con 17. Because it is large, we adjust the horse&#8217;s size down to medium (Str 12, Dex 16, Con 15), then apply the Beast Shape modifiers for Large animals (See Beast Shape II), giving it Str 16, Dex 14, Con 15, and a +4 bonus to natural armor. The horse is essentially identical, but traded 2 points of Constitution for +4 natural armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building-your-character\">Building your character<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Regardless of class, there are a few points in your character that you need to address in order to by an effective polymorpher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your race will matter less when you&#8217;re no longer human\/elf\/etc., but your ability score modifiers and size will influence your ability scores when polymorphed. Halflings and humans are a prime example. Halflings have higher dex, but lower strength. These modifiers don&#8217;t go away when the Halfling changes size, so a Halfling and human with otherwise identical stats will have slightly different ability scores. This makes Halflings more useful while in dexterity-based forms, and they may want to take Weapon Finesse and focus on forms which primarily depend on Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you are building your character entirely to focus on polymorphing, you can afford to not focus on your spellcasting abilities. Where normally a wizard would need to dump his ability points into intelligence, a Transmuter needs to give up some of his intelligence to put points into Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. Druids who plan to rely on wild shape must do the same, instead sacrificing some of their wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you give up armor and shield bonuses when you polymorph, your AC may not be good enough to protect you. Many polymorph options will give you a bous to natural armor, but this is very unlikely to keep up with a fighter in full plate. As such, you will need to have reasonable dexterity for AC and Constitution for hit points. Strength will most likely be your primary source of damage. Make sure to find a reasonable balance between the physical abilities, and enhance abilities which you find yourself depending on most heavily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class\">Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcanist<\/span>: On par with the Sorcerer, but\n\t\twithout the bloodline (unless you take the Blood Arcanist archetype). The\n\t\tBrown Fur Transmuter archetype grants some really fantastic abilities which\n\t\traise the Arcanist above the Sorcerer.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemist<\/span>: Alchemists get polymorph spells\n\t\tat the same level as Sorcerers and Wizards, but only go up to 6th-level\n\t\tspells. You won&#8217;t get new options as quickly as a Sorcerer or Wizard will,\n\t\tbut the Alchemist&#8217;s Mutagen provides an easy way to enhance your physical\n\t\tability scores. The natural armor bonuses won&#8217;t stack (they&#8217;re both &#8220;natural\n\t\tarmor bonuses&#8221;; neither are &#8220;enhancement bonuses to natural armor&#8221; like an\n\t\tamulet of natural armor), but an Alchemical bonus to Strength is a great\n\t\tidea on most polymorph forms. Even if you don&#8217;t want to do any polymorphing,\n\t\tthe Alchemist is still a great class option. The &#8220;Infusion&#8221; discovery allows\n\t\tyou to bottle polymorph effects and share them with your allies. Imagine\n\t\thanding your fighter a potion of Giant Shape I and letting him turn into a\n\t\tRock Troll for a few minutes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: The Animal domain includes a\n\t\thandful of polymorph options. With 2\/3 BAB and d8 hit points the cleric is a\n\t\tdecent option for polymorphing. However, because they get so few polymorph\n\t\toptions it can&#8217;t be a central part of your build.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Druid<\/span>: Druids get all of the Beast Shape,\n\t\tPlant Shape, and Elemental Body spells as part of Wild Shape, and they get\n\t\tthem a level before the wizard. Until Form of the Dragon II and III, this\n\t\tmeans that druids get the best polymorph options a level early. As they\n\t\tlevel, druids can use their highest level polymorph effects more times per\n\t\tday than anyone else, and with Natural Spell, they can cast spells while\n\t\twild shaped into something which might not be able to do so normally. On top\n\t\tof all of this, they get medium BAB progression, which means that their\n\t\tattacks will be more accurate than anyone else, and they get more benefit\n\t\tfrom Power Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Eldritch Knight<\/span>: The Eldritch Knight is a\n\t\tprestige class, but it deserves a mention. Once you get into polymorph\n\t\tspells full BAB and bonus combat feats can be extremely valuable.\n\t\tUnfortunately it will cost you two levels of spellcasting, which means\n\t\tyou&#8217;re a spell level behind on polymorph forms.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: You get spells one level later\n\t\tthan wizards, but you get more per day. The differences between Sorcerer and\n\t\tWizard here are the same differences between Sorcerers and wizards in any\n\t\tother case. Sorcerers also have a lot of bloodlines which can allow you to\n\t\tgrow claws if you don&#8217;t already have them. This allows you to add claw\n\t\tattacks to creatures which have no business with claw attacks, such as\n\t\tsnakes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Witch (Transformation Patron)<\/span>: You only\n\t\tget a limited selection of polymorph spells, but you get Beast Shape and\n\t\tForm of the Dragon, which are the best options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wizard<\/span>: The transmutation school and its\n\t\tsubschools offer some great options, and allow you to do some extra\n\t\ttransformation for a few rounds per day.

The best polymorph forms have multiple primary attacks, so you\n\t\twill likely never benefit from this feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power Attack<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to have a ton\n\t\tof strength to throw around. Your base attack bonus likely won&#8217;t keep up\n\t\twith the fighter, so your penalty and bonus won&#8217;t scale as quickly as\n\t\teveryone else, but you will still get some extra damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Focus (Transmutation)<\/span>: Very few\n\t\tTransmutation spells require a save from your enemies, so it&#8217;s not\n\t\timmediately obvious what this does for you. When polymorphed, any abilities\n\t\tprovided by the polymorph effect which allow a saving throw to resist use\n\t\tthe DC for the spell. This means that Spell Focus improves the DC of your\n\t\tPoison, Trample, Breath Weapon, etc..<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spell Focus (Transmutation)<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\tWhere +1 is good, +2 is great.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toughness<\/span>: Druids get d8 hit points, but\n\t\tSorcerers and Wizards only get d6.

Many creatures, such as\n\t\tFire Elementals, use weapon finesse naturally, but polymorphing into those\n\t\tcreatures without weapon finesse won&#8217;t necessarily hurt you. All natural\n\t\tweapons can be used with weapon finesse, so if you have high dexterity and\n\t\tlow strength, you can use weapon finesse with almost any form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Focus<\/span>: If you tend to use a small\n\t\tset of forms, especially those with common natural weapons like claws, you\n\t\tcan get some use out of Weapon Focus. While your strength\/dexterity should\n\t\tbe fantastic while polymorphed, your base attack bonus won&#8217;t keep up with\n\t\tfighters, so bonuses to attacks are nice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 id=\"polymorph-options-by-spell\">Polymorph options by spell<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"alter-self\"><a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/spells\/alterSelf#_alter-self\" class=\"rating-orange\">Alter Self<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>alchemist 2, bard 2, magus 2, shaman 2, sorcerer\/wizard 2, summoner\/unchained summoner 2, witch 2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polymorph into a small or medium humanoid.

You also gain one bite (1d8), two claws (1d6), and two wing attacks (1d4). All of the natural attacks are primary, and the breath weapon can only be used once each time you cast the spell. At 6d8 damage, the breath weapon isn&#8217;t your best combat option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that your ongoing magic effects remain in place, and you can cast spells as a dragon. Effects like the Copper Dragon&#8217;s Spider Climb are easily replaced with a spell, and elemental vulnerabilities can be easily overcome with Energy Resistance. With spells available to cover the dragons&#8217; weaknesses, they are essentially identical except for their breath weapons. Because the breath weapon will be strictly worse than a Fireball at this level, the breath weapon isn&#8217;t really worth considering, so each dragon is functionally identical. There is an argument to be made for dealing damage types which are less commonly resisted than fire damage, but Fireball is three levels lower and does more damage, so this clearly isn&#8217;t a replacement for blast spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this level you must compete with Beast Shape IV, which turns you into a chimera. Beast shape gives you +6 strength, -2 dexterity, +2 constitution, and +6 natural armor. The -2 to dexterity is mostly offset by the natural armor, so the base stat bonuses are better. The Chimera doesn&#8217;t get reach, but it&#8217;s large, gets the same number of natural attacks with better damage, and it has a breath weapon that also deals 6d8 damage and can be used every 1d4 rounds. The chimera gives up 10 feet of fly speed, but is otherwise better than a medium dragon as a combat monster. However, Dragons can cast spells, so I would assume that you can also cast spells whil polymorphed. If this is something you want to do, go for Form of the Dragon. Otherwise, go for Beast Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"form-of-the-dragon-ii\"><a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/spells\/formOfTheDragon#_form-of-the-dragon-ii\" class=\"rating-green\">Form of the Dragon II<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>sorcerer\/wizard 7<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This level adds more strength and constitution, more fly speed, DR 5\/magic, better natural attack damage, reach on your bite attacks, a new tail slap attack, 2d8 more damage on your breath weapon, and you can use the breath weapon a second time. 8d8 damage slightly beats the average damage of a 10d6 fireball, but at this level you have plenty of other blasting spells available (such as Cone of Cold) which will do more damage than the breath weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"form-of-the-dragon-iii\"><a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/spells\/formOfTheDragon#_form-of-the-dragon-iii\" class=\"rating-blue\">Form of the Dragon III<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>sorcerer\/wizard 8<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonuses to strength, constitution, and natural armor are truly stunning at this level. 120 foot fly speed is fantastic, and you get blindsense, 120 foot darkvision, and a frightful presence. Your reach goes up to 10 feet (15 feet with bite), and your natural weapon damage goes up with your size. You gain elemental immunity, and you can use your breath weapon at 12d8 damage every 1d4 rounds. 12d8 is roughly equivalent to 15d6, and you can use the breath weapon every 1d4 rounds for 1 minute per caster level. That&#8217;s a lot of breath weapon damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"giant-form-i\"><a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/spells\/giantForm#_giant-form-i\" class=\"rating-green\">Giant Form I<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>alchemist 6, sorcerer\/wizard 7<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At large size you get 10 foot reach, and you get low-light vision as part of the spell.

If you do use weapons (Eldritch Knights are great for Polymorph), giant form is great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you probably don&#8217;t have a big scary weapon to wave around, you probably want to use this to change into something with natural weapons that you can rely on. This means that Troll is essentially the only option worth considering, which is fine because Troll is pretty fantastic. The natural weapons still aren&#8217;t great, but you get Regeneration and Darkvision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this level you need to compete with Form of the Dragon II and Elemental Body III. Elemental Body III is terrible, but Form of the Dragon II will give you much better combat options for full casters. Weapon users like alchemists will do very well as a Rock Troll since they can continue using their armor and weapons, and gain Regeneration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary3\/giant#giant,-ash\" class=\"rating-red\">ash giant<\/a>: Rock throwing, rock catching.

Instead of getting all of the attacks and such from your chosen form, you get bite and 2 claws or slams. Three attacks is fine, but it also removes a lot of the diversity and versatility that makes polymorph spells so interesting. On top of that, the undead must be corporeal and have humanoid anatomy. The corporeal limitation doesn&#8217;t disappear until Undead Anatomy IV, but the humanoid anatomy requirement appears to be omnipresent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I specifically copied the rule disallowing templates above under &#8220;What you NOT get when you polymorph?&#8221;, but I want to call it out again here: Undead Anatomy I&#8217;s spell description specifically mentions skeletons and zombies, and the higher-level versions of the spell allow Blood Drain, which is largely exclusive to vampires. Undead Anatomy II allows DR 5\/bludgeoning, which I have to assume is for skeletons. However, all three of those creaures are templated creatures, and are therefore disallowed by the general Polymorph rules. This is a distinction which largely breaks Undead Anatomy, making it extremely limited in utility and very difficult to use in comparison with most other polymorph spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also get climb 30 feet, fly 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim 30 feet, low-light vision, and scent. Because the list of available options is so small, I will only list especially notable forms. Forms which are omitted don&#8217;t offer any of the listed abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most options at this stage are functionally identical, and really the only useful ability you can hope to get is movement. Grim Reaper is the fastest both in land speed and fly speed, the Leng Ghoul has the best burrow and climb speeds, and the Draugr is the only option with a swim speed. Unfortunately, the bulk of the time Monstrous Physique I is a much better option since gargoyles get more attacks than you can get from Undead Anatomy. Unless you need the positive\/negative energy switch from Undead Anatomy, stick to Monstrous Physique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Small Undead: you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +1 natural\n\t\tarmor bonus.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary5\/tiyanak\" class=\"rating-orange\">Tiyanak<\/a>: 5 ft. speed, fly 30 ft.

Writing this section took me longer than it should have because I felt physically repulsed by basically every creature Vermin Shape covers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vermin Shape I competes with Beast Shape II. Beast Shape allows considerably more abilities (including notable options like Grab and Pounce) which makes Vermin Shape I generally much worse than Beast Shape II. However, Vermin Shape has the advantage of including forms with Darkvision. In underground environments, that&#8217;s a crucial advantage. Still, Vermin Shape I should reasonably be a spell level lower to make it comparable to other polymorph options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For scouting, use giant mosquito.

I&#8217;m a GM and Polymorph is Breaking My Game!<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Polymorph is an extremely powerful mechanic, and the more creatures are published for Pathfinder the more powerful it gets. While not every new creature will provide a viable new option, even a handful of useful new forms totally rebalances polymorph. Having a massive list of potential options means that a polymorph user will have a form which fits every situation, generally at no cost beyond knowing the spell. So, a reasonably gamemaster might ask &#8220;How can I allow polymorph in my game without letting it totally unbalance the game?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider requiring familiarity with the creature. A druid who has never left the arctic tundra certainly shouldn&#8217;t be able to polymorph into a reptile or a tropical bird since they have never seen one, and likely have never heard one described unless they studied the appropriate skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll define &#8220;familiarity&#8221; similar to the way that knowledge skills allow players to identify a creature&#8217;s abilities and weaknesses, and we&#8217;ll grant modifiers similar to Scrying&#8217;s &#8220;knowledge&#8221; modifiers. However, instead of requiring a check, we&#8217;ll simply require that the spellcaster have a requisite skill modifier, modified based on their familiarity with the creature in question and possibly an object which establishes a connection to that creature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could instead require skill checks to adopt new forms. If you choose to do so, set the DC at 10 + the number of ranks required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table zebra-striped is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Spell<\/th><th>Required Skill Modifier<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Alter Self<\/td><td>Knowledge (Local)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Elemental Body<\/td><td>Knowledge (Planes)*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Form of the Dragon<\/td><td>Knowledge (Arcana)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monstrous Physique<\/td><td>Knowledge (Nature)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Form<\/td><td>Knowledge (Nature)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Plant Shape<\/td><td>Knowledge (Nature)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Polymorph<\/td><td>Varies &#8211; Use the appropriate skill for the replicated spell<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Shapechange<\/td><td>Varies &#8211; Use the appropriate skill for the replicated spell<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Undead Anatomy<\/td><td>Knowledge (Religion)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><tfoot><tr><td>* &#8211; Druids may substitute Knowledge (Nature) when using Wild Shape to replicate a polymorph spell.<\/td><\/tr><\/tfoot><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table zebra-striped is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Familiarity<\/th><th>Ranks Required<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Secondhand<\/td><td>10 + Spell Level + CR<\/td><td>You have read about the creature or had it described to you in detail.

However, Craig acquires a detailed sculpture of a Sasquatch from a traveler who lives in an area where sasquatches are common, giving Craig a +2 modifier, and allowing him to meet the required +9 modifier to polymorph into a sasquatch.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-discussions-on-polymorph\">Other Discussions on Polymorph<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>3.5 <ul><li><a href=\"\/\/www.wizards.com\/default.asp?x=dnd\/rg\/20040511a\">Rules of the Game: Polymorphing (Part One)<\/a>: Excellent glossary of terms.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/\/www.wizards.com\/default.asp?x=dnd\/rg\/20040518a\">Rules of the Game: Polymorphing (Part Two)<\/a>: Good explanation of 3.5 Alter Self, and hits some very good points on how polymorph works. <\/li><\/ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"\/\/www.wizards.com\/default.asp?x=dnd\/rg\/20040525a\">Rules of the Game: Polymorphing (Part Three)<\/a>: Explains what you get from changing into each creature type.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/\/www.wizards.com\/default.asp?x=dnd\/rg\/20040601a\">Rules of the Game: Polymorphing (Part Four)<\/a>: Addresses some additional creature types and some specific polymorph effects.  <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Note that <em>Rules of the Game: Polymorphing Revisited<\/em> has been intentionally omitted.
