Unfortunately, the short durations of the provided abilities make the Exemplar innefective and difficult to play in a busy day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Call to Arms<\/span> (Ex): This will very rarely\n\tdo anything meaningful unless your party is exceptionally dependent on\n\tDexterity\/Dodge bonuses to AC. Remember that this doesn&#8217;t actually let your\n\tparty act in the surprise round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspiring Prowess<\/span> (Ex): A limited version\n\tof Bardic Performance, and you get half as many rounds per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Field Instruction<\/span> (Ex): You don&#8217;t get a\n\tfree Teamwork Feat, but with Martial Flexibility you really don&#8217;t need one.\n\tthe duration is pitifully short, which greatly limits how useful this is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Unarmed Strike, Maneuver Training, AC Bonus, Brawler&#8217;s Strike<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mutagenic-mauler\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/brawler\/archetypes\/paizo-brawler-archetypes\/mutagenic-mauler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mutagenic Mauler<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mutagen is a great buff, but martial Flexibility is one of the Brawler&#8217;s best features, and giving up the the Brawler&#8217;s most flexible ability for static ability bonuses really hurts. However, Martial Flexibility is hard to use without a lot of practice and forethought, so the Mutagenic Mauler can be a fun and simple way to play a Brawler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mutagen<\/span> (Su): A nice buff to the Brawler&#8217;s\n\tdamage output, and you get to pick up some upgrades as you gain levels.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">feral mutagen<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">infuse mutagen<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">preserve organs<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">spontaneous healing<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Beastmorph<\/span> (Su): The extra move speed, the\n\tclimb speed, and the new vision types add some nice mobility to the\n\tBrawler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Martial Flexibility, AC Bonus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Shield Champion, Steel-Breaker, Strangler, Wild Child<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"shield-champion\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/brawler\/archetypes\/paizo-brawler-archetypes\/shield-champion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shield Champion<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Captain America is apparently a Shield Champion Brawler. Brawlers get all of the extra attacks from the Two-Weapon Fighting feat chain, and one of the most effective uses of Two-Weapon Fighting is to use two shields with the Shield Mastery feat. The Shield Champion plays to this strategy perfectly, and adds additional options by allowing the Brawler to throw their shield both to attack and to perform combat maneuvers. This is a hilarious and exciting concept, and given a decent build and good shields, it can make for an excellent Striker or Defender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the archetype is riddled with mechanical issues. You still need to take the Two-Weapon Fighting feat to qualify for Shield Mastery. Shield Champions don&#8217;t get proficiency with Shield Spikes. You can get Greater Shield Focus as a free bonus feat at 9th level, but you need to get regular Shield Focus on your own to qualify for it. You may also need to spend feats on ranged combat feats like Precise Shot when you throw your shield, but you can pick those up with Martial Flexibility if you need it. Generally you&#8217;ll need a permissive DM who is willing to make adjustments to the written rules for the archetype to be as playable as it&#8217;s intended to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Shields are a\n\tnice boost to the Brawler&#8217;s poor AC, and Close weapons are generally garbage\n\tanyway..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Throw Shield<\/span> (Ex): Throwing your shield is\n\ta great way to suddenly not have a shield bonus to AC, so don&#8217;t make this your\n\tgo-to option until you get Returning Shield. At 7th level you can use a thrown\n\tshield to perform combat maneuvers, which offers some absolutely fantastic\n\ttactical options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Champion Defense<\/span> (Ex): By this level\n\tdamage rolls will hugely exceed even the most absurd Fortitude save bonuses,\n\tso don&#8217;t expect this to work.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Returning Shield<\/span> (Ex): Returning your thrown\n\tshield makes Throw Shield a much better option, and the ricochet mechanic is a\n\tfantastic answer to the normal range issues common to many thrown weapons. You\n\tcan throw a shield as part of your Brawler&#8217;s Flurry, which means that you\n\tcould punch someone to death, then switch to your shield and throw it to use\n\tyour remaining attacks toward the end of a full attack. At 9th level Greater\n\tShield Focus gives you an extra +1 to AC. At 12th level you get a considerable\n\tdamage boost with shields, and at level 17 you can bounce your shield around\n\tcorners. This ability should really be broken up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: weapon and armor proficiencies, maneuver training (3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, 19th), Brawler&#8217;s Strike<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mutagenic Mauler, Strangler<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"snakebite-striker\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/brawler\/archetypes\/paizo-brawler-archetypes\/snakebite-striker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snakebite Striker<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Snakebiter Striker falls far short of what its description promises. The Brawler gives up Martial Flexibility and a lot of maneuver training for a splash of Sneak Attack and some abilities which help the Brawler flank a little bit. None of this is as useful as standing around and punching things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skills<\/span>: Brawlers are not\n\tparticularly suited to skills, but Bluff and Stealth could make for a good\n\tstealthy Brawler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sneak Attack<\/span> (Ex): This won&#8217;t add up to a\n\tton of damage, and it&#8217;s certainly not as good as Martial Flexibility. However,\n\tit makes for a good class dip for Rogues and Ninjas who don&#8217;t want to give up\n\tBAB for a class dip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snake Feint<\/span> (Ex): Even though the\n\tSnakebite Striker gets Sneak Attack, it&#8217;s hardly enough to justify learning to\n\tfeint. Feinting while moving is a cool idea, but not very helpful because it\n\tmeans that you&#8217;re not making a Full Attack. Using multiple squares for\n\tflanking is nice for getting Sneak Attack damage, but not super important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Opportunist<\/span> (Ex): Free attacks are always\n\tnice. This largely replicates the Rogue&#8217;s Opportunist Advanced Talent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Martial Flexibility, Maneuver Training (3rd, 7th, 11th, 19th)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Strangler, Wild Child<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"steel-breaker\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/brawler\/archetypes\/paizo-brawler-archetypes\/steel-breaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steel-Breaker<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Steel Breaker&#8217;s most important ability is Exploit Weakness. Despite a very solid concept, Exploit Weakness quickly becomes worthless. You can expect that the Brawler&#8217;s Wisdom bonus won&#8217;t ever exceed +4, and with no other bonus on the Wisdom check for Exploit Weakness, the ability will quickly become unreliable and eventually impossible to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Knowledge (Engineering) is\n\tconsiderably less useful than Knowledge (Dungeoneering).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Exploit Weakness<\/span> (Ex): You can choose\n\tbetween a bonus to attacks and the ability to bypass DR or a bonus to reflex\n\tsaves and AC. Both options are good. The problem with this ability is the\n\tWisdom check. Brawlers have very little need for Wisdom, and the DC scales\n\tconsiderably faster than even the best Wisdom scores can, so you will very\n\tquickly find that you can&#8217;t use this ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sunder Training<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Brawler&#8217;s Strike, Maneuver Training (altered)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mutagenic Mauler, Strangler<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"strangler\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/brawler\/archetypes\/paizo-brawler-archetypes\/stranger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Strangler<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Strangler is a fantastic option or Brawlers looking to specialize in grappling. The Strangler&#8217;s abilities add a little bit of damage and some high level save or suck\/save or die abilities. Stranglers will still need to invest in<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skills<\/span>: Stealth is helpful, but\n\tremember that Brawlers typically dump Intelligence and don&#8217;t have a ton of\n\tskill ranks to throw around.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Strangle<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s not a ton of damage,\n\tbut Sneak Attack damage every time you succeed on a Grapple check is a pretty\n\teasy way to get Sneak Attack. Keep in mind that this isn&#8217;t actually the Sneak\n\tAttack ability, so you can&#8217;t double this damage with the Strangler feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Practiced Strangler<\/span> (Ex): Very important\n\tfor a grappler. A grappler often has issues engaging multiple targets because\n\twhile the grappler fights one enemy other enemies can freely attack the\n\tgrappler. This greatly mitigates this issue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleeper Hold<\/span> (Ex): This is a good way to\n\tquickly knock a target unconscious, but I don&#8217;t know why there is a limited\n\tnumber of uses per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Neckbreaker<\/span> (Ex): A bit less reliable than a\n\tnormal save or die effect because you also have to make a Grapple check, but\n\tthere is no limit on the uses per day, so you can go around breaking necks\n\tuntil you run out of necks to break..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Unarmed Strike, Brawler&#8217;s Flurry, AC Bonus, Knockout (Altered), Awesome Blow, Improved Awesome Blow<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Mutagenic Mauler, Shield Champion, Snakebite Striker, Steel-Breaker, Wild Child<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wild-child\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/hybrid-classes\/brawler\/archetypes\/paizo-brawler-archetypes\/wild-child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wild Child<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wild Child introduces an Animal Companion to the Brawler, which is always a welcome addition. The Wild Child also gains access to the Skirmisher Ranger&#8217;s Hunter&#8217;s Tricks ability. These tricks are generally poor, but have a few interesting options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: The Brawler is not good at\n\tskills, and adding new ones won&#8217;t fix that.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Companion<\/span> (Ex): Animal Companions are\n\tgreat. For more information see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/animal_companions\">Practical Guide to Animal Companions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hunter&#8217;s Tricks<\/span>: Most Hunter&#8217;s Tricks are\n\tfairly bad, especially if you remove all of the great options for ranged\n\tattacks. Note that this uses a daily use of Martial Flexibility, and is in\n\tmany ways redundant with Wild Tricks, which the Wild Child gains at the same\n\tlevel.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maneuver Training<\/span> (Ex): Giving your animal\n\tcompanion the ability to use combat maneuvers like Dirty Trick is excellent.\n\tThey likely won&#8217;t be as good as you, but more attempts means more\n\topportunities for success.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Tricks<\/span> (Ex): Despite the name\n\t&#8220;Hunter&#8217;s Tricks&#8221;, Hunter&#8217;s Tricks are actually abilities provided by the\n\tSkirmisher Ranger archetype. Unfortunately, most of these tricks are bad, and\n\tlimiting the Wild Child to melee tricks limits these options even further.
