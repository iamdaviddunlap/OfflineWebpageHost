Extracts provide excellent utility options, the Investigator&#8217;s skill list allows the Investigator to serve as a Face, Trapfinding allows him to serve as a Scout, and Studied Combat and Studied Strike make the Investigator a passable Striker. However, Studied Combat and Studied Strike both require melee attacks, which forces the Investigator to fight in melee combat with light armor and d8 hit points, and you won&#8217;t be able to match the damage output of a single-class Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Investigator Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#extracts\">Extracts<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#extracts-1\">1st-Level Extracts<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#extracts-2\">2nd-Level Extracts<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#extracts-4\">4th-Level Extracts<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#extracts-5\">5th-Level Extracts<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#extracts-6\">6th-Level Extracts<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Fortunately, Investigators depend heavily on\n\tStudied Combat in combat, so you would never be able to use iterative attacks\n\tanyway, and the Studied Combat attack bonus will exceed the gap between 2\/3\n\tand full BAB at every level at which it;s available.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Good Reflex and Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Light armor and simple\n\tweapons, plus a short list of martial weapons similar to a Rogue. Your best\n\tbet is likely a Rapier.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: 6+ skill points is great, but the\n\treal appeal is the incredible breadth of the Investigator&#8217;s skill list.\n\tInvestigators get all of the skills available to Rogues, plus all knowledge\n\tskills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemy<\/span> (Su): Just like the Alchemist\n\tability of the same name. You get just as many extracts per day as an\n\talchemist, which provides you a lot of really great options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): Inspiration opens up a lot\n\tof really exciting options. Adding 1d6 to skill\/ability checks is pretty dull,\n\tbut can help when the stakes are high. You can use two Inspiration points to\n\tboost an attack or saving throw, but be careful not to burn through your\n\tInspiration too quickly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Trapfinding<\/span>: This allows the Investigator\n\tto completely replace the Rogue as the party&#8217;s Scout.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison Lore<\/span>: Ridiculously situational. If you\n\tneed to neutralize poison, there are several spells which do it, or you can\n\tjust dump it on the ground.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Poison Resistance<\/span>: Poison becomes very\n\tcommon at high levels. The scaling resistance is plenty at low levels, but\n\timmunity at high levels is even better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Investigator Talents<\/span> (Ex or Su):\n\tInvestigator Talents open up a lot of really great options, including some\n\tAlchemist Discoveries and Rogue Talents. For help with Investigator Talents,\n\tsee my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/investigator\/talents\">Investigator Talent Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Keen Recollection<\/span> (Ex): You have all\n\tKnowledge skills as class skills and 6+ skill ranks. Throw a rank in each\n\tknowledge skill for the +3 class skill bonus, and pretend no one ever wrote\n\tthis ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trap Sense<\/span> (Ex): Situational, and not very\n\tgood in the rare situations where it applies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Studied Combat<\/span> (Ex): The insight bonus to\n\tattacks will easily make up the difference between 2\/3 and full BAB, and the\n\tbonus to damage is nice. This will only last a few rounds, so be sure to\n\tmaintain your Intelligence to keep this up for as long as possible, or you\n\twill spend a lot of inspiration re-studying your enemies in combat. The bonus\n\tis good enough that you might consider sacrificing attack bonus for things\n\tlike Power Attack or Combat Expertise. Be sure to take the Quick Study talent\n\tto drop the action from a Move to a Swift so that you can make a full attack\n\tor use poison in the same round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Studied Strike<\/span> (Ex): Not quite as powerful\n\tas Sneak Attack, and it ends your Studied Combat, so use this sparingly,\n\tespecially at low levels when the dame will barely exceed the bonus from\n\tStudied Combat. Re-studying a target consumes Inspiration, so only use this if\n\tyou plan to change targets, or you think that you can kill the target, or if\n\tyou can spare the Inspiration points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swift Alchemy<\/span> (Ex): Crafting alchemical\n\titems faster is nice, but crafting typically happens off-screen in most\n\tcampaigns. Poisoning an item as a move action is nice so that you can apply\n\tpoison and attack in the same turn, but it will conflict with Studied Combat,\n\twhich is usually a better option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): Add 1d6 to all of\n\tyour ability and skill checks forever, and you can spend inspiration for\n\tanother d6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Investigator&#8217;s abilities look a lot like those of a melee Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Only gives you damage, but don&#8217;t dump\n\tit if you can avoid it. Without the Rogue&#8217;s big pile of Sneak Attack, you want\n\tevery bit of damage you can get. 13 opens up Power Attack, which may be\n\tworthwhile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: With light armor, you want to depend on\n\tDexterity for Weapon Finesse and AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential to compensate for the\n\tInvestigator&#8217;s poor hit points and bad Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Important for that awesome skill list\n\tand many of the Investigator&#8217;s abilities, including Alchemy and Inspiration.\n\tHowever, since Investigators are only 2\/3 spellcasters and are not dependent\n\ton DCs of any kind, you don&#8217;t strictly need more than 16 Intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: You need a bit for Will saves, but\n\tthat&#8217;s all that the Investigator gets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Only required if you plan to be a\n\tFace, and your skill ranks and Inspiration can offset a poor Charisma\n\tscore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Arrray<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 16<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 10<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 16<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 15<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 14<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Dexterity and Intelligence are nice, and other racial abilities can contribute to specific builds. Several excellent alternate racial bonuses exist, but there&#8217;s not shame in taking extra skill ranks to help fill out your massive skill list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarf<\/span>: Though certainly durable, the Dwarf\n\toffers nothing specifically useful to the Investigator.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: Bonuses to both Dexterity and\n\tIntelligence are fantastic for the Investigator, and the Elf favored class\n\tbonus grants a bit of extra Inspiration. Unfortunately, all of the Elf&#8217;s\n\tspellcasting abilities are wasted on the Investigator, so consider some\n\talternate class features.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: The Gnome doesn&#8217;t really get\n\tanything that&#8217;s specifically good for the Investigator. The Gnome favored\n\tclass bonus grants additional known formulas, but you can buy them the same\n\tway that a Wizard does.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: A flexible ability bonus and\n\tseveral great options for alternate racial traits. The Ancestral Arms\n\talternate racial freature opens up great options like the Elven Curve Blade.\n\tThe Half-Elf favored class bonus grants a bonus to Inspiration rolls, and\n\tafter a bit of investment in new options for Inspiration it can be a very\n\tpowerful and versatile bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: A flexible ability bonus and\n\tDarkvision are nice, but the other Half-Orc racial abilities aren&#8217;t very\n\thelpful. The Half-Orc favored class bonus is garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Slightly better than the Gnome,\n\tthe Halfling&#8217;s Dexterity bonus and other racial abilities contribute greatly\n\tto the Investigator&#8217;s abilities as a Scout. The Halfling favored class bonus\n\tis the same as the Gnome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always good at everything, Humans are\n\talso good as Investigators. Unfortunately, the Human favored class bonus is\n\tthe same as the Gnome&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s not worth taking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Accelerated Drinker<\/span> (Combat): It&#8217;s unclear wether or\n\t\tnot this works with extracts. My personal opinion is that it does not, but\n\t\tdiscuss it with your GM. It&#8217;s also important to note that the potion must be\n\t\tin your hand at the start of your turn, so you need to retrieve the potion\n\t\tahead of time. If you&#8217;re fine walking around with a potion in one hand in\n\t\tcase you get attacked, it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Once you get into combat,\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll need to\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/coreRulebook\/combat#manipulate-an-item\">retrieve a potion as move action<\/a>\n\t\ton one turn and use Accelerated Drinker on the following turn. This leaves\n\t\tyour standard action free to throw a bomb, drink an extract, etc. (the\n\t\tAlchemist&#8217;s Alchemy feature specifically says &#8220;An alchemist can draw and\n\t\tdrink an extract as a standard action.&#8221;). Non-alchemists need to use a move\n\t\taction to retrieve a potion and a second move action to drink it, making\n\t\tthis trait massively situational for them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): Going first is\n\t\talways nice, but Investigators aren&#8217;t dependent on surprise so they don&#8217;t\n\t\tbenefit nearly as much as a rogue would.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspired<\/span> (Faith): Fits the theme of the\n\t\tclass very well, and rerolling a skill once per day is fantastic for such a\n\t\tskill-heavy character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemical Adept<\/span> (Magic): This could\n\t\tsave you a lot of money if you plan to craft a lot of alchemical items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Alchemical Intuition<\/span> (Magic): Charisma is a\n\t\tdump stat for Alchemists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cross-Knowledge<\/span> (Magic): Many Formulae\n\t\tare also on the Wizard spell list, but 1 extra caster level won&#8217;t make a\n\t\thuge difference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pragmatic Activator<\/span> (Magic): UMD is a\n\t\tfantastic skill, and Investigators have the Intelligence to make Pragmatic\n\t\tActivator work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Situational, but\n\t\thelpful for getting out of bad situations in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Appraise<\/span> (Int): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any\n\t\tFace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disable Device<\/span> (Dex): Essential for any\n\t\tscout.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise<\/span> (Cha): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Escape Artist<\/span> (Dex): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): A nice supplement to magical\n\t\thealing, but the Investigator doesn&#8217;t have high Wisdom, and has access to\n\t\tfree healing potions every day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any\n\t\tFace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (all)<\/span> (Int): <\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Linguistics<\/span> (Int): Helpful for a Face,\n\t\tbut you can always have a friendly spellcaster cast Tongues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The most rolled skill in\n\t\tthe game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perform<\/span> (Cha): You are not a bard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Helpful for any\n\t\tFace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sleight of Hand<\/span> (Dex): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Helpful for identifying\n\t\tspells and magic items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Essential for any\n\t\tscout.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Use Magic Device<\/span> (Cha): Perhaps the most\n\t\tversatile and powerful skill in the game. However, I can&#8217;t think of many\n\t\toptions that you would need from wands or scrolls that you couldn&#8217;t get from\n\t\tthe Investigator&#8217;s spell list. UMD is a way for arcane casters to use divine\n\t\tspells, divine spellcasters to arcane spells, and non-spellcasters to cast\n\t\tspells. You get a mix of arcane spells and spells normally limited to divine\n\t\tspellcasters, so there&#8217;s little reason to invest in UMD.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Inspiration<\/span>: More inspiration means\n\t\tthat you can do more in a day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Investigator Talents<\/span>: Investigator\n\t\tTalents are great, and having more of them offers a lot of options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Focused Inspiration<\/span>: An average of +1 to\n\t\ttwo skills. Skill Focus or any of the feats which provide bonuses to two\n\t\tskills will give you much better results.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspired Alchemy<\/span>: Great if you are more\n\t\tdependent on Extracts than on Inspiration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspired Strike<\/span>: A nice reliable way to\n\t\tuse Inspiration, but it&#8217;s not a great payoff and it will eat through your\n\t\tdaily uses too quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Attack<\/span>: If you can manage 13\n\t\tStrength, Power Attack is a great trade. Studied Combat&#8217;s attack bonus will\n\t\toutpace will outpace full BAB, so you&#8217;re more accurate than comparably\n\t\tleveled characters, making it easy to trade a bit of attack for some extra\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranged Study<\/span>: Investigators are frail, so\n\t\tmoving to ranged weapons, even with a 30 ft. range limitation, is a big\n\t\tgain. However, this requires Weapon Focus and it&#8217;s specific to a single\n\t\tweapon, which is a strange and frustrating limitating for a class that does\n\t\tso little to emphasize weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: Essential.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slashing Grace<\/span>: Also requires Weapon\n\t\t\t\tFocus. While this is normally a fantastic damage boost more\n\t\t\t\tDexterity-based melee characters, it requires that you use a one-handed\n\t\t\t\tslashing weapon, and there are none in which the Investigator is\n\t\t\t\tproficient.

Your best weapon option is\n\t\ttypically a rapier, but if you want to use Vital Strike it may be worthwhile\n\t\tto upgrade to an Elven Curve Blade. However, at only 2\/3 BAB you&#8217;ll get the\n\t\tfeats much more slowly than a class with full BAB.

It also saves you th 50gp cost of actually\n\t\tbuying a tanglefoot bag.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crafter&#8217;s Fortune<\/span>: An exceptionally\n\t\tgenerous +5 luck bonus. Learn this early and use it to craft alchemical\n\t\titems better and faster than you could otherwise. The duration is\n\t\tdays\/level, so this is great to use on a day where you not adventuring, then\n\t\tif you need to craft something in a hurry you&#8217;ve got a hefty bonus to help\n\t\tspeed things along.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extracts-2\">2nd-Level Extracts<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ablative Barrier<\/span>: hours\/level duration\n\t\tmeans that this will last all day. The armor bonus won&#8217;t stack with real\n\t\tarmor, but it will still work while polymorphed. The real draw is the damage\n\t\tconversion effect. Nonlethal damage means that you&#8217;re more likely to be\n\t\tknocked unconcious and ignored than actually killed. In additon, healing\n\t\trestores an equal amount of regular and nonlethal damage so healing you\n\t\tbecomes twice as effective. This is an excellent option if you&#8217;re working in\n\t\tmelee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemical Allocation<\/span>: Despite the obvious\n\t\thygienic issues, this makes potions and elixers reusable, potentially making\n\t\t3rd-level potions worth their exorbitant cost. This means that by using\n\t\tthist extract you can spend 900gp to add any potion-compatible spell of\n\t\t3rd-level or lower to your spell list. The more potions you acquire, the\n\t\tmore useful this gets. Consider the huger list of options: fly, greater\n\t\tmagic fang, cure critical wounds, Beast Shape I, etc.. The only real\n\t\tlimitation is that you need to be the one to consume the potion or elixer,\n\t\tso you&#8217;re limited to effects which affect you. In the absolute worst usage\n\t\tscenario, this allows you to use Cure Critical Wounds as a 2nd-level extract\n\t\tinstead of a 3rd-level extract.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skinsend<\/span>: A poor man&#8217;s version of Twin\n\t\tForm. Compression can be occasionally useful, and construct traits are nice\n\t\tbecuase of the immunities you get, but this is really risky to use in\n\t\tcombat. At only half of your normal hit points, you&#8217;re much more likely to\n\t\tdie in your skin form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extracts-4\">4th-Level Extracts<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mutagenic Touch<\/span>: It&#8217;s hard to know when\n\t\tthis will work well. If you have another party member who&#8217;s a combat monster\n\t\t(fighter, etc.) they might really enjoy this. Of course, combat monsters\n\t\ttypically have poor mental ability scores, so the penalty from the mutagen\n\t\tmight incapacitate them if you have discoveries which improve your\n\t\tmutagen.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">False Life, Greater<\/span>: Temporary hit poitns\n\t\twith hours\/level duration. Always good on a class with relatively few hit\n\t\tpoints. It&#8217;s really weird that Alchemists don&#8217;t get regular False Life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extracts-5\">5th-Level Extracts<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Delayed Consumptiom<\/span>: Turn any extract into\n\t\tan immediate action.

Create a twin and send it to scout ahead, set\n\t\toff traps, or distract a monster. Send your twin into a dangerous combat,\n\t\tlet it die, then run into the fight after the twin dies at full health and\n\t\tready to win the day. The rounds\/level duration doesn&#8217;t let you do a lot,\n\t\tbut that&#8217;s probably for the best.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspired<\/span> (+1): If you didn&#8217;t take the\n\t\tCombat Inspiration talent, this replicates its effect.
