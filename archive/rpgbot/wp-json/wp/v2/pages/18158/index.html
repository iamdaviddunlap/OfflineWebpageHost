Your allies\n\t\tmight enjoy the extra speed from time to time, and Advantage on Strength\n\t\tchecks is great for allies who are grappling, but the 1-minute duration and\n\t\tConcentration requirement mean that you can usually find something better to\n\t\tdo. Still, you can use it as often as you like and there&#8217;s no save, which is\n\t\tgreat if your allies like to Shove or Grapple.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Gravity Well<\/span>: 5 ft. of positioning is\n\t\toccasionally very useful. Since this is forced movement, it doesn&#8217;t provoke\n\t\tOpportunity Attacks, so you can use this to cast a spell on yourself or an\n\t\tally to move the target out of melee without provoking an opportunity\n\t\tattacks, and potentially breaking grapples. Tragically, it only applies when\n\t\tyou cast the spell so you can&#8217;t repeatedly reposition targets to keep them\n\t\tinside areas of effect. This also doesn&#8217;t specify which directions you can\n\t\tmove the target, so theoretically you could move targets 5 feet into the air\n\t\tto force them into conveniently-positioned effects like Wall of Fire.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Violent Attraction<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t many\n\t\toptions which can force enemies to fall, so either you need to\n\t\t<em>really<\/em> like Reverse Gravity and Gravity Sinkhole, or your DM likes\n\t\tto put a lot of pits and cliffs on the map. Regardless, it&#8217;s at most 10d10\n\t\tdamage per day (assuming you can somehow cause falling damage on 5 separate\n\t\trounds) and you have to spend your Reaction to activate it each time,\n\t\tmeaning that you don&#8217;t have your Reaction for Shield or Absorb Elements.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Event Horizon<\/span>: A great area control\n\t\teffect hampered only by the fact that you need to be in the middle of it.\n\t\tWith a radius of just 30 feet, you&#8217;re easily within reach for attacks and\n\t\tabilities with any sort of range, and since you need to Concentrate on this,\n\t\tyou might lose your signature feature for the day if you take even a tiny\n\t\tamount of damage.\n\t\t<p>Fortunately, this doesn&#8217;t appear to care about cover, so you can do\n\t\t\tthings like casting Stone Shape or Wall of Ice to erect a dome over\n\t\t\tyourself for cover, then lie prone inside it to impose Disadvantage on\n\t\t\tranged attacks against you. If cover isn&#8217;t a option, try to keep moving\n\t\t\tenemies at bay by hitting them with things like Thunderclap to push them\n\t\t\taway or Ray of Frost to reduce their speed. Even Earth Thremor may be\n\t\t\tuseful, as knocking targets prone forces them to spend half their speed to\n\t\t\tstand.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"graviturgy-ability-scores\">Graviturgy Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No change from any other Wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: We are (probably) not a muscle Wizard.
