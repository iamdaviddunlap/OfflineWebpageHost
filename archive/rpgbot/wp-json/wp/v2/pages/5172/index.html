Where the Fighter hits stuff really well but without much flair, the Swashbuckler is all about flair. If you&#8217;re not doing things in the most exciting way that you can think to do them, you&#8217;re missing out on what makes the Swashbuckler special. The Panache mechanic encourages you to do things other than hitting things, and the subclasses really encourage diverse tactics between swashbucklers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, the Swashbuckler stands somewhere between the Fighter and the Rogue, having above-average skills and excellent stats for a front-line martial character, but they&#8217;re not quite as durable as the Fighter and they still can&#8217;t compete with the Rogue&#8217;s incomparably good skills. The Swashbuckler is primarily a Striker, but can be easily built as a Defender, a Face, and a Scout, allowing them to fill all of the most important roles of both the Fighter and the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#panache\">Panache<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fighting-styles\">Fighting Styles<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#finishers\">Finishers<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#why-cant-i-hold-all-these-reactions\">Reactions<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Swashbuckler Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Swashbuckler&#8217;s Style<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats\">Swashbuckler Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Swashbuckler-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"panache\">Panache<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Swashbuckler&#8217;s signature mechanic, Panache, is central to the class and requires the player to manage it very carefully. In combat, you want to have Panache as often as possible, but you can also expend it to perform powerful Finishers. This creates an important &#8220;gameplay loop&#8221; where the Swashbuckler gains Panache, does cool stuff, expends Panache, then works to get it back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you can use specified Actions like Tumble Through to gain Panache, and your subclass will offer another unique option to gain Panache which typically involves a skill check of some kind, so regaining Panache is often as simple as spending an Action to perform a skill check and you gain Panache if you&#8217;re successful.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fighting-styles\">Fighting Styles<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Similar to the Fighter, the Swashbuckler has &#8220;soft&#8221; decision points within their build regarding what fighting style they want to adopt. However, the Swashbuckler&#8217;s options are considerably limited compared to the Fighter&#8217;s. Without archetypes, the Swashbuckler&#8217;s fighting styles boil down to three options: buckler\/shield+weapon, one-handed weapon, and two-weapon fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buckler\/Shield+Weapon is frustrating. You don&#8217;t get Shield Block for free, so using a shield means investing in the Shield Block feat and probably some Skill Increases into Craft to repair your shields. You can take the Buckler Expertise feat at first level, but all it does it make buckler&#8217;s provide as much AC as shields so there is no reason to do except Bulk and that you can get Buckler Dance at 10th level, but that&#8217;s really just not enough to make bucklers worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Single Weapon is the best option by far. At low levels you might carry a Shield for a while until you need your hand free to qualify for feats or something, but even if you don&#8217;t want a shield you can take Dueling Parry and get as much AC as what you get from Buckler Expertise or from Twin Parry, and you don&#8217;t need to invest in a second weapon or in a buckler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-weapon fighting is a trap. You get feats 3 levels later than other fighting styles, and they&#8217;re not any better. You get the added utility of being able to choose which weapon to use with any given Attack, but you also need to pour precious gold into a second weapon in a game where gold is as precious as feats. The only offensive option that justifies two-weapon fighting is Dual Finisher, and one decent feat is not enough to justify the rest of a weak build.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"finishers\">Finishers<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Finishers&#8221; are the primary way in which you&#8217;ll consume Panache. The term &#8220;Finisher&#8221; is somewhat confusing, and you might assume that it means a &#8220;finishing blow&#8221;, or to &#8220;finish&#8221; the target. However, that&#8217;s generally not the intent since many Finishers will apply a status effect. Think of Finishers more like finishing a series of things you do, much like the final blow in a &#8220;combo&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you might start by Demoralizing your target, Feint, make a few Strikes over several turns, then finish with a Finisher for a burst of damage. Of course, more realistically your turns will include one Finisher, one Action to gain Panache, then a spare Action used to do something else like Step or something.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-cant-i-hold-all-these-reactions\">Reactions<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Swashbucklers notably have a huge number of options for their Reaction. Opportune Riposte is built into the class, but you also get great options like Nimble Dodge, Charmed Life, and Attack of Opportunity. These options are generally all very good, but you still only get one Reaction (until you can get Inexhaustible Countermoves at level 20), so be careful not to invest too many feats into options which use your Reaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Swashbuckler Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: 10+ hit points matches the\n\tFighter and other front-line martial classes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: Nothing remarkable\n\tgood or bad. You get everything that you need to succeed.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span>: Start at Expert, and you\n\t\tadvance to Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Bad Fortitude Saves,\n\t\taverage Will Saves, and the best Reflex Saves (matching the Rogue). You&#8217;ll\n\t\tdo really well against common Basic Reflex Saves, but you&#8217;ll need to beef up\n\t\tyour Constitution and Wisdom to compensate for your other saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 6+ skills, so the\n\t\tSwashbuckler matches the Ranger and has more base skills than any other\n\t\tclass except the Rogue, though the Ranger gets skill increases and skill\n\t\tfeats at the same speed as everyone else. Stylish Tricks offers 3 additional\n\t\tSkill Feats over the course of your career, but those additional feats are\n\t\trestricted.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attacks<\/span>: Trained in simple, martial, and\n\t\tunarmed. Not terribly exciting, but you&#8217;ve got a full range of options and\n\t\tyou may be able to access Uncommon weapons using racial feats. Swashbucklers\n\t\tadvance their weapon proficiencies at the same rate as most martial classes,\n\t\tfalling just behind the Fighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Trained in unarmored defense\n\t\tand light armor, which makes sense for a Dexterity-heavy class.\n\t\tUnfortunately, your proficiency improves slower than other front-line\n\t\tmartial class like the Fighter and the Ranger, so your AC will lag behind\n\t\tother front-line martial classes at several points in your career.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: The Swashbuckler&#8217;s biggest use for their Class\n\t\tDC is for Critical Specialization Effects, but since you get Critical\n\t\tSpecialization effects with any weapon that you&#8217;re likely to use, this will\n\t\tsee a lot of use. The Swashbuckler&#8217;s Class DC progression is roughly\n\t\taverage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Confident Finisher<\/span>: A great introduction to\n\tFinishers, Confident Finisher isn&#8217;t especially impressive but the Failure\n\teffect adds some reliability so low-level swashbucklers won&#8217;t feel robbed when\n\tthey spend their Panache and miss their attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache<\/span>: Panache is the central, defining\n\tmechanic of the Swashbuckler, and it&#8217;s what sets them apart from other\n\tclasses. While any class can brag, boast, tumble about, swing from\n\tchandeliers, and generally show off, the Swashbuckler uniquely gains the\n\tability to empower themselves by doing so, and unless you&#8217;re ready to play\n\tthat way you&#8217;re going to struggle as a swashbuckler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the Swashbuckler&#8217;s time in combat will be spent juggling their Actions to repeatedly gain and spend Panache as quickly as possible. A number of Swashbuckler Class Feats have the &#8220;Finisher&#8221; trait. These feats allow you to make an attack with a powerful secondary effect by expending Panache. You also gain bonus damage from Precise Strike when you do so (starting at 2d6 and scaling with level; see below), but not only do you lose Panache when you attempt a Finisher, you are unable to make additional attacks for the remainder of the turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing Panache is absolutely central to the class. You&#8217;ll get two guaranteed ways to gain Panache: the Tumble Through Action and one skill Action depending on your Swashbuckler Style. Tumble Through is unglamorous, but important. Many of the Swashbuckler Styles recharge Panache using an Action which is language-dependent, mind-affecting, or otherwise might not work against targets like mindless undead or constructs, so in some encounters you&#8217;ll have difficulty regaining Panache by other means. Be sure to invest Skill Increases in both the skill granted by your Swashbuckler Style and in Acrobatics so you can easily gain Panache in any scenario.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Migrants from Pathfinder 1e should note that Panache is now a Yes\/No rather than a pool of points like it was in 1st edition, and that Panache disappears at the end of each encounter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Strike<\/span>: The flat bonus is a small\n\tbut still impactful amount of bonus damage. This will easily make up the\n\tdifference between using Dexterity with a Finesse weapon compared to using\n\tStrength, assuming that you&#8217;re just making regular Strikes. The damage bonus\n\tapplies to all of your Strikes, so it&#8217;s easy to rely on this is as a constant\n\tincrease to damage so long as you have Panache.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus damage dice which you apply when using a Finisher will be a significant part of your damage output. You might use a Finisher as often as every turn. It&#8217;s easy to compare this damage bonus to Sneak Attack, and while Sneak Attack is a small die applied repeatedly across multiple Strikes, Price Strike&#8217;s Finisher damage is a big burst applied behind a single Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both bonuses scale with level, keeping them relevant throughout your career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Swashbuckler Feats<\/strong>: See Swashbuckler feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Swashbuckler&#8217;s Style<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Swashbuckler&#8217;s Style&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span>: Your only improvement to\n\tFortitude saves, and you get it at level 3.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Opportune Riposte<\/span>: It only applies on\n\tCritical Failures, so you&#8217;ll get the most use out of this when you have really\n\thigh AC, when your attacker&#8217;s attack bonus is poor (debuffs help), when your\n\topponent is making numerous attacks with a Multiple Attack Penalty, or some\n\tcombination of the three. Keep in mind that since this Reaction will typically\n\toccur outside your turn, you don&#8217;t need to worry about a Multiple Attack\n\tPenalty or having used a Finisher on your turn.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Stylish Tricks<\/span>: Acrobatics and the skill\n\tfrom your Swashbuckler Style are essential parts of your swashbuckler, so it\n\tmakes sense to invest Skill Increase and Skill Feats into those skills.\n\tHowever, that would normally create a &#8220;feat tax&#8221; which would lock you into\n\tspending your regular Skill Increases and Skill Feats. This alleviates that\n\tfeat tax somewhat, giving you a total of three additional Skill Feats. Don&#8217;t\n\tforget: Assurance is a skill feat, and putting Assurance into both Acrobatics\n\tthe skill associated with your Swashbuckler Style is a perfectly fine\n\toption.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Vivacious Speed<\/span>: In a game where most\n\tAncestries have a speed of 25 feet, a +10 bonus is significant, and the bonus\n\tscales as you gain more levels. The only problem is that in most cases your\n\tgo-to tactic is to gain Panache, then expend it almost immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Expertise<\/span>: Your proficiency with\n\tweapons advances at the same rate as other martial classes like the Barbarian\n\tand the Rogue. You also gain access to Critical Specialization effects with\n\tall weapons with which you have Expert proficiency, which means that any\n\tsimple or martial weapon is covered.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Reflex saves are the most common\n\ttype of &#8220;Basic Save&#8221;, and often Basic Saves are the ones where the difference\n\tbetween a Success and a Critical Success is the most significant. This will\n\tprotect from a lot of damage from area effects like fireballs and breath\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: Since your\n\tProficiency with weapons improves at the same rate as martial class like the\n\tBarbarian and the Champion, you&#8217;ll start at the +3 bonus in most cases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Exemplary Finisher<\/span>: The benefits vary\n\tdepending on your Swashbuckler Style.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swashbuckler Expertise<\/span>: Better class DC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Continuous Flair<\/span>: Vague, and the bonus is\n\tboth small and of a common type.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilant Senses<\/span>: The best Perception\n\tprogression in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Evasion<\/span>: Great for all the same\n\treasons that Evasion is great. Taking half damage on a failure means that a\n\tFailure and a Success on a Basic Save are functionally identical.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: More attack bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Keen Flair<\/span>: More critical hits is fantastic.\n\tAt this level you&#8217;re running a powerful Rune of Striking, plus your Finisher\n\tdamage is really high, so critical hits will deal a big pile of damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resolve<\/span>: Fantastic, but it comes online\n\tvery late the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eternal Confidence<\/span>: The wording here is\n\tsomewhat confusing, so allow me to clarify: You get to add the effects of\n\tConfident Finisher <em>in addition to<\/em> the effects of whatever Finisher\n\tyou&#8217;re using. If you use Opportune Riposte, you can effectively turn that\n\tStrike into a Confident Finisher, gaining the Finisher damage (half normally,\n\tfull if you have Precise Finisher) if you roll a failure on that Strike.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Armor Mastery<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Swashbuckler&#8217;s Style<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Every subclass will give you proficiency in one skill, and using that skill will become a central part of your tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-battledancer\">\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Styles.aspx?ID=1\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Battledancer<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Battledancer is a great go-to option. Perform works almost regardless of what you&#8217;re fighting, and the nature of the Battledancer&#8217;s Panache recovery mechanic makes it easy to gain Panache so long as there are enemies with sufficiently low Will save DC&#8217;s who can observe you. However, Performance has extremely limited utility beyond the Battledancer&#8217;s features, which can make it difficult to spend your bonus Skill Feats from Stylish Tricks. You can still put them into Acrobatics feats, Fortunately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skill<\/span>: Performance is a skill that\n\t\tusually only matters in social situations, so it&#8217;s odd to see it appear in\n\t\tcombat. Fascinating Performance adds the ability to Fascinate a target, and\n\t\ttake Focused Fascination to further limit whichever creature you Fascinate.\n\t\tAs your Proficiency in Perform improves, you gain the ability to Fascinate\n\t\tmore creatures. Unfortunately, the duration of the effect is only one round,\n\t\tand targets get immunity for an hour after the Fascinate effect wears off,\n\t\tso it&#8217;s a bad idea to fascinate more than one creature in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache Recovery<\/span>: Your skill check with\n\t\tthe Perform Action only needs to exceed the Will DC of <em>an<\/em> observing\n\t\tfoe, so as long as there&#8217;s an enemy in the fight a low Will DC you can\n\t\teasily recharge your Panache in any fight. Due to the almost total lack of\n\t\ttraits on the Perform Action, it&#8217;s easy to use it on foes who might be\n\t\tdifficult for other Swashbuckler Styles to target in order to recharge\n\t\tPanache. However, your GM might reasonably add traits like Auditory or\n\t\tLanguage depending on the nature of your performance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Exemplary Finisher<\/span>: A free Action is\n\t\treally great, but the utility of Step is greatly diminished for the\n\t\tSwashbuckler. Your reliance on Tumble Through to gain Panache makes it an\n\t\tappealing way to gain Panache while also repositioning yourself to flank a\n\t\ttarget. However, Step can still be useful in encounters with multiple\n\t\tenemies or if you need to move out of reach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-braggart\">\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Styles.aspx?ID=2\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Braggart<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Do you like to Demoralize things? Go for Braggart.<\/p>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skill<\/span>: Intimidation is a staple Face\n\t\tskill, and Demoralize is a fantastic combat option for high-Charisma\n\t\tcharacters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panache Recovery<\/span>: Demoralizing foes\n\t\tapplies Frightened. Frightened is a good debuff, and allowing you to\n\t\tcontinually refresh it thanks to the Exemplary Finisher effect means that\n\t\tyour target may remain in a perpetually debuffed state for as long as you&#8217;re\n\t\tfighting it. Frightened penalizes the victim&#8217;s checks and DCs, lowering\n\t\ttheir attacks, their AC, and their save DC&#8217;s in addition to the obvious\n\t\tstuff like skill checks and such. However, remember that languages can be a\n\t\tbarrier so you&#8217;ll need to invest resources in learning langugaes in which to\n\t\tDemoralize things. Even then, not all enemies will understand language so\n\t\tyou may take a penalty or your may be totally unable to Demoralize some foes\n\t\tif they&#8217;re mindless or otherwise immune to fear. Be sure that your\n\t\tAcrobatics bonus is good enough that you can Tumble Through whenever\n\t\tDemoralize isn&#8217;t doing the trick, or if you&#8217;re below level 9 when Exemplary\n\t\tFinisher removes the temporary immunity from Demoralize.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exemplary Finisher<\/span>: Demoralize normally\n\t\tonly works on each target once per encounter because they gain temporary\n\t\timmunity for 10 minutes. That means that without this feature, Demoralize\n\t\tonly works once per enemy per encounter, so this feature solves a huge\n\t\tlimitation on Demoralize.\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-fencer\">\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Styles.aspx?ID=3\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fencer<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most generic version of the Swashbuckler, the Fencer is reliable and straightforward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skill<\/span>: Deception is a staple Face skill,\n\t\tand Feint is a great option if you&#8217;re only making one attack (a Finisher,\n\t\tideally) per turn. Even if you just roll a Success, they&#8217;re still\n\t\tFlat-Footed against your next melee attack, and since you&#8217;re only making one\n\t\tattack that&#8217;s all that you need.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache Recovery<\/span>: Feint will be your go-to\n\t\toption. Create a Diversion is neat, but unless you&#8217;re planning to run away\n\t\tand re-emerge later it&#8217;s not particularly useful for a front-line martial\n\t\tclass that&#8217;s intended to fill in for a fighter or an equivalent Defender\n\t\tcharacter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Exemplary Finisher<\/span>: You&#8217;ll never benefit\n\t\tfrom this unless you manage to hit the target with a Reaction (which is\n\t\tabsolutely possible thanks to Opportune Riposte), but a -2 penalty to AC is\n\t\tsignificant, especially since many of your allies&#8217; class features might\n\t\tdepend on targets being Flat-Footed. This also significantly reduces the\n\t\tneed to Flank enemies, reducing the need to spend Actions shuffling around\n\t\tyour enemies to get into position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-gymnast\">\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Styles.aspx?ID=4\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gymnast<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to play a swashbuckler and not be a Face, this is the way to do it. Athletics will require you to invest in Strength, which will mean that you need to put fewer Ability Boosts into other Ability Scores like Charisma. The Gymnast&#8217;s Panache Recovery mechanic also requires using Skill Actions with the Attack trait, which imposes a Multiple Attack Penalty, a problem which other swashbucklers don&#8217;t face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skill<\/span>: Athletics is hard for a\n\t\tDexterity-based class, but you&#8217;ll want some Strength for the bonus damage so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll have enough to be at least passable with Athletics. You&#8217;ll likely\n\t\tneed to give up on Charisma-based capabilities, but if you want to play\n\t\tSwashbuckler without playing a Face, maybe that&#8217;s what you want.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panache Recovery<\/span>: Three potential Actions\n\t\tto gain Panache is more than any other Swashbuckler Style, and the effects\n\t\twork on nearly any target unlike things like Demoralize. Grapple targets the\n\t\ttarget&#8217;s Fortitude DC and Trip targets their Reflex DC, so you can select\n\t\twhich one you believe to be lower. Grapple should be your go-to because if\n\t\tyou can make the target Restrained you may be able to rob them of one or\n\t\tmore Actions while they try to Escape on their own turn.\n\t\t<p>However, keep in mind that Grapple, Shove, and Trip all have the Attack\n\t\t\ttrait so they&#8217;ll impose a Multiple Attack Penalty. Consider weapons with\n\t\t\tthe Agile trait to mitigate this penalty, and look for weapons with the\n\t\t\tGrapple, Shove, or Trip traits to gain an item bonus on the Athletics\n\t\t\tchecks. Also remember that using a Finisher means that you can&#8217;t use\n\t\t\tGrapple, Shove, or Trip later in your turn because they all have the\n\t\t\tAttack trait.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you take the Disarming Flair feat, you can add Disarm to the list of\n\t\t\tActions which you can take to gain Panache. However, Disarm suffers from\n\t\t\tthe same Attack trait limitations that your other options do.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Exemplary Finisher<\/span>: Not a ton of damage\n\t\tand no fancy effect, but it&#8217;s nearly-guaranteed damage since you&#8217;ll\n\t\tfrequently perform an Athletics check the apply on of these effects, then\n\t\tfollow it with a Finisher which will gain this bonus damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-wit\">\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Styles.aspx?ID=5\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wit<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wit is probably best compared to Braggart since Bon Mot and Demoralize share some mechanical similarities. The Braggart&#8217;s Exemplary Finisher seeks to remove the biggest limitation of Demoralize, while the Wit&#8217;s Exemplary Finisher seeks to bring the effects of Bon Mot closer to Demoralize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon Mot is easy to compare to Demoralize. Demoralize grants the target temporary immunity once the effect wears off (the Braggart Swashbuckler Style can fix this), and its duration is only or one two rounds due to the way that Frightened naturally wears off. By comparison, Bon Mot lasts a full minute and doesn&#8217;t grant immunity of any kind. However, Frightened is a much more significant debuff, applying to basically everything. Bon Mot penalizes Perception and Will Saves, which is only significant if you can capitalize on enemies&#8217; low Will saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skill<\/span>: Diplomacy is the most essential\n\t\tFace skill in the game. If you&#8217;re built for Charisma and you get one skill,\n\t\tmake it Diplomacy. You also get the Bon Mot feat for free, which is really\n\t\tnice because Bon Mot is a pretty good feat, especially if you have allies\n\t\twho can target enemy will Saves like many spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panache Recovery<\/span>: Bon Mot is a good\n\t\toption but it has some limitations. The effect lasts a full minute so it&#8217;s\n\t\teasy to spread it around rather than repeatedly targeting one creature,\n\t\tprovided that you have multiple enemies. But you can also repeatedly affect\n\t\tthe same target, effectively resetting the duration. However, because Bon\n\t\tMot has the Linguistic trait it only affects foes which understand the\n\t\tlanguage that you use. You can invest in learning more languages, but that\n\t\twon&#8217;t let you use Bon Mot on creatures that don&#8217;t speak languages like\n\t\tanimals, dinosaurs, and unintelligent undead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Exemplary Finisher<\/span>: -2 is a decent\n\t\tpenalty, even if it&#8217;s not very flashy. However, since it only applies to\n\t\tattacks against you your allies may find that enemies are attacking them\n\t\tinstead of you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity is your Key Ability Score, so swashbuckler&#8217;s ability scores look very similar to Dexterity-based fighters and rogues. However, the Swashbuckler&#8217;s skills used to gain Panache often require Charisma, so balancing your characters Ability Scores will require making some personal choices about where you want to be effective rather than simply following formulaic &#8220;A, then B, then C&#8221; instructions like you can with classes like the Wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: All you get is bonus damage, but a\n\tlittle bit of bonus damage will pay off consistently over the course of your\n\tcareer. The Gymnast Style also uses Athletics for its Panache mechanic, so you\n\tmay need to invest in Strength to keep refreshing Panache.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Your Key Ability, Dexterity will power\n\tyour attacks, your Class DC, and your AC, not to mention Reflex saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Crucial on any character.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Swashbucklers get a total of 6+ trained\n\tskills at first level, and if you&#8217;re filling in for a rogue in your party you\n\tmay still need more. However, if your party has plenty of skills to go around,\n\tthis may be your best option for a dump stat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Perception and Will Saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: The majority of Swashbuckler Styles\n\tuse a Charisma-based skill for their Panache mechanic. If you chose one of\n\tthose Styles, Charisma will be very important. You might also choose to play\n\tyour Party&#8217;s Face since you&#8217;ll likely get a Face skill from your Style,\n\tputting you on the path to success with little effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>So long as you get a Dexterity Boost (which is easy so long as your race doesn&#8217;t get a Dexterity Flaw), you&#8217;re probably fine. Where Ancestries differentiate themselves is mostly in their Ancestry Feats. Several Ancestries offer unique feat combinations which support various play styles and builds for the Swashbuckler which can produce some incredibly effective characters if you know what to look for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond feat interactions, keep an eye out for options which are useful to any front-line martial class. High racial hit points, improved senses like Darkvision, and access to Uncommon weapons can all be major improvements to your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Catfolk<\/span>: Catfolk are an easy and obvious\n\tchoice for the Swashbuckler. Their Ability Boosts are perfect, and a Wisdom\n\tFlaw is totally manageable. Catfolk Weapon Familiarity offers access to both\n\tthe Catfolk Claws and to the Kukri, which are great options for the\n\tSwashbuckler. There is some overlap between swashbuckler feats and catfolk\n\tfeats, like Charmed Life and the Cat&#8217;s Luck feat chain, but that allows you to\n\treplace some powerful Class Feat options with Ancestry Feats and use those\n\tClass Feat slots for other options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: The Ability Boosts\/Flaws are workable,\n\tthough you&#8217;ll want to avoid Charisma-based builds so the Gymnast may be your\n\tbest bet. Unfortunately, none of the Dwarf&#8217;s Ancestry Feats do anything to\n\tsupport the Swashbuckler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The Elf can work, but it has some\n\tlimitations. A Constitution Flaw and 6 base hit points makes you exceptionally\n\tfrail. Consider Flying Blade and plan to fight just out of your enemies&#8217;\n\treach, and use Elf Ancestry Feats like Nimble Elf and Elf Step to repeatedly\n\tmove out of reach and waste your Enemies&#8217; Actions by forcing them to chase\n\tyou.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: The Ability Boosts are great, but\n\tthe Strength Flaw will cut into your damage output slightly. Gnome Weapon\n\tFamiliarity gets you access to the Kukri, but with a Strength Flaw relying on\n\tTrip is hard to do. The most likely reason to consider the Gnome is if you\n\twant to introduce some magic to your character via Ancestry Feats. You can\n\teasily build yourself with decent Charisma, making options like Animal\n\tAccomplice and First World magic tempting options on top of your skills and\n\tcombat capabilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Goblin<\/span>: Perfect Ability Boosts, and a Wisdom\n\tFlaw is manageable. The Bouncy Goblin feat offers an easy +2 circumstance\n\tbonus to Tumble Through, which is fantastic considering how important Tumble\n\tThrough is. You do need to take the Unbreakable Goblin Heritage to get it, but\n\tbumping your racial hit points from 6 to 10 is a great choice at low levels.\n\tOther Goblin Ancestry Feats offer a lot of great options, too: Goblin Weapon\n\tFamiliarity grants access to the Dogslicer; Roll With It offers a great way to\n\tmitigate damage from big attacks while also forcing enemies to knock you out\n\tof their reach; Goblin Scuttle allows you to more easily keep enemies in\n\treach; and Very Sneaky allows you to easily employ stealth in combat to\n\trepeatedly hide and reemerge to attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Similar in some ways to the\n\tCatfolk, though not as perfect a match for the Swashbuckler. The Halfling&#8217;s\n\tAbility Boots and Flaws are slightly worse for most swashbucklers (though you\n\tcan use the Optional Flaw rules to bring them closer together), but there are\n\tstill a lot of great Ancestry Feat options to choose from. Halfling Luck is a\n\tgreat complement to Charmed Life, and the Step Lively feat chain allows you to\n\toccupy the spaces of larger foes (though I still haven&#8217;t found an explicit\n\tmechanical reason to justify doing that).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Human<\/span>: Two flexible Ability Boosts means\n\tthat you can build your Ability Scores however you like. The Human has several\n\tunique options beyond their Ability Boosts. Humans have unique access to feats\n\tlike Cooperative Nature, which when combined with the Swashbuckler&#8217;s All For\n\tOne make Aid a unique and powerful option both in and out of combat.\n\tUnconventional Weaponry makes Advanced Weapons viable in addition to granting\n\taccess to some Uncommon weapons, many of which are excellent options for the\n\tSwashbuckler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Kobold<\/span>: The Kobold shares some of the same\n\tchallenges as the Elf. Low racial hit points and a Constitution Flaw make\n\tmelee combat a challenging prospect. Flying Blade allows you to fight at\n\trange, and that is the most obvious solution to the Kobold&#8217;s hit point\n\tproblem, but their Ancestry Feats may be enough to overcome the gap. Cringe\n\tallows you to reduce an impressive amount of damage, and it may be effective\n\tenough to forgo options like Nimble Dodge. Grovel allows you to Feint at\n\trange, making a ranged Fencer viable. Between the Scales works great in\n\tconjunction with Feint, allowing you to add Backstabber to weapons like the\n\tStarknife. Dragon&#8217;s Presence works great for the Braggart, and the Kobold\n\tBreath feat chain offers a way to handle crowds of enemies, which is normally\n\tdifficult for the Swashbuckler due to their reliance on big single attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Orc<\/span>: Only two Ability Boosts, and one of them\n\tis in Strength. You could use the Optional Flaw rules to get an additional\n\tFree Ability Boost, but at that point you&#8217;re just a worse human. The Orc&#8217;s\n\tAncestry Feats don&#8217;t offer much to the Swashbuckler, though there are a few\n\tgems. Orc Ferocity can take the place of the much higher-level Cheat Death,\n\tand Undying Ferocity can improve upon it later, making it a great option for\n\tany front-line martial character. However, both of those options are available\n\tto the Half-Orc, and the Half-Orc&#8217;s Ability Boosts will be easier to work\n\twith, and you also get access to Human Ancestry Feats and the handful of\n\tHalf-Orc Ancestry Feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ratfolk<\/span>: Low racial hit points and a\n\tStrength Flaw are manageable, but that&#8217;s not a great start, and the Ratfolk&#8217;s\n\tAncestry Feats offer almost nothing useful to the Swashbuckler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tengu<\/span>: Only two Ability Boosts, but you can\n\tmake that work. Tengu Weapon Familiarity offers access to the Wakizashi, and\n\tSquawk! is great insurance for the Braggart, the Fender, and the Wit since\n\ttheir skills used to gain Panache are all covered by Squawk!. The rest of the\n\tTengu&#8217;s Ancestry Feats don&#8217;t offer much for the Swashbuckler, but you can\n\tstill find several interesting options which are just generally useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity Boosts are crucial, but since every Background includes a Free Boost that&#8217;s not hard to achieve. You&#8217;ll want the second Ability Boost to go into either Constitution or whatever Ability Score supports the skill granted by your Swashbuckler Style. The Skill Feat gained from your Background may also be important since the Swashbuckler can do a lot with Skill Actions both in and out of combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble deciding, here are some suggestions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Deck Hand (Any, especially Gymnast)<\/li><li>Emissary (Wit)<\/li><li>Sailor (Gymnast)<\/li><li>Ward (Battledancer)<\/li><li>Warrior (Braggart)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Increases at 3rd and 5th level to raise skills to Expert, increases at 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th level to raise skills to Master, and increases at 15th, 17th, and 19th level to raise skills to Legendary. That means that you can maximize at most three skills, and the rest of your skills might not advance beyond Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Feats at even-numbered levels, giving you a total of 10 Skill Feats (and maybe another from your Background) by 20th level. Generally, you want to invest these feats in the same skills which you are choosing to maximize, though in some cases you may want to grab feats from skills which don&#8217;t require that you be more than Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): You get Trained for\n\t\tfree, and using the Tumble Through Action is the single standard option to\n\t\tgain Panache, so investing in Acrobatics is wise for situations where your\n\t\tSwashbuckler Style&#8217;s Panache option doesn&#8217;t work or where your DM doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tgive you a chandelier to swing from.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Assurance<\/span>: It&#8217;s not much fun, but\n\t\t\t\tAcrobatics is your backup option whenever the fun option provided by\n\t\t\t\tyour Swashbuckler Style isn&#8217;t working. Assurance ensures that it works\n\t\t\t\treliably in the worst of cases.

You&#8217;re here because\n\t\t\t\tdropping into combat from a ridiculous height and being unharmed is\n\t\t\t\treally cool, and doing things are really cool is what the Swashbuckler\n\t\t\t\tis all about. As a GM, if a player went to great effort to drop from a\n\t\t\t\tridiculous height at the start of combat I would probably grant them\n\t\t\t\tPanache.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcana<\/span> (Int): Intelligence is the closest\n\t\tthing that the Swashbuckler has to a dump stat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Athletics<\/span> (Str): Primarily important for\n\t\tthe Gymnast, but Athletics is still a great tactical option for any\n\t\tcharacter with decent Strength to make it viable. If you&#8217;re a Gymnast, as a\n\t\tGM I might consider granting Panache for jumping in ways that are both cool\n\t\tand unnecessary to reach wherever you want to go, so consider feats like\n\t\tPowerful Leap and Wall Jump.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Assurance<\/span>: Great, but not always\n\t\t\t\teffective.

There is\n\t\tvery little to support pursuing Crafting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deception<\/span> (Cha): Essential for the Fencer\n\t\tor for any Face build.

However, this can cause enemies in melee with you\n\t\t\t\tto flee, and you don&#8217;t have Opportunity Attack or another Reaction which\n\t\t\t\tyou use when enemies move out of reach, which means that you could\n\t\t\t\taccidently scare your target so much that you need to chase them to keep\n\t\t\t\tfighting them.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lore<\/span> (Int): Versatile, but vaguely\n\t\tdefined and hard to rely upon.

You might even be your party&#8217;s Scout, in which case this is\n\t\tabsolutely essential.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Swift Sneak<\/span>: Extremely helpful if\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re sneaking in combat.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Only situationally\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thievery<\/span> (Dex): The Swashbuckler is built\n\t\taround Dexterity, so you have everything that you need to be good at\n\t\tTheivery. Used for both opening locks and disabling traps, no adventuring\n\t\tparty is likely to succeed without it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats\">Swashbuckler Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For the full list of Swashbuckler Class Feats, see the <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?Traits=321\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swashbuckler Feats<\/a> page on Archives of Nethys.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-1\">1st Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Buckler Expertise<\/span>: You&#8217;re spending a\n\t\tfeat to make the AC bonus from bucklers as good as the AC bonus from\n\t\tshields. Unless you&#8217;re absolutely struggling with Bulk, there&#8217;s very little\n\t\treason to use this. Why not just grab a shield? Why not use Nimble Dodge,\n\t\twhich provides the same AC bonus as a Reaction rather than spending an\n\t\tAction every turn to <em>maybe<\/em> have the AC bonus matter.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disarming Flair<\/span>: Disarm is only\n\t\tsituationally useful since not all enemies use weapons, and even in\n\t\tsituations where it applies you need to roll a Critical Success to do\n\t\tanything that affects the target on their own turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dueling Parry<\/span>: A +2 Circumstance bonus\n\t\tmatches the effects of a shield without the Bulk. But is 1 Bulk really worth\n\t\ta Class Feat? The real reason that you want this feat instead of using a\n\t\tshield is because your hand is free, which can enable you to do some other\n\t\tthings, including some other Swashbuckler feats. Even so, Nimble Dodge is\n\t\tcomparably effective and you can get Dueling Dance at 10th level, so it\n\t\tseems unfair that this feat is both less impactful and higher level.\n\t\t<p>Both the Fighter and the Swashbuckler get access to this Class Feat. The\n\t\t\ttext is identical.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flying Blade<\/span>: This enables ranged\n\t\tswashbuckler builds. However, since you&#8217;re limited to thrown weapons you&#8217;ll\n\t\tneed to get a Returning Rune so that you can afford to have a decent magic\n\t\tweapon and also avoid spending half of your Actions drawing daggers.\n\t\tUnfortunately, you won&#8217;t be able to afford that at first level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focused Fascination<\/span>: Tempting for the\n\t\tBattledancer, this turns Perform into a weird sort of taunt mechanic with\n\t\tvery limited and specific effects. However, it has some problematic\n\t\tlimitations. First, you can only use Focused Fascination when you use\n\t\tPerform+Fascinating Performance on a single target. Second, Fascinating\n\t\tPerformance grants the target immunity to itself for an hour after the\n\t\teffect&#8217;s 1-round duration wears off.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Goading Feint<\/span>: A more defensive\n\t\talternative to the normal Feint effects. The wording of the feat is\n\t\tintentionally worded so that you can&#8217;t look for weird, game-breaking\n\t\tcombinations with feats intended to work with the normal version of Feint,\n\t\twhich is disappointing but probably a smart game design choice. Notably this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t override the effects of an ongoing Feint, so you could technically\n\t\tuse both regular Feint and Goading Feint on the same target, though the\n\t\tshort durations of the effects make it difficult to justify the Action cost\n\t\tto do so in most cases.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nimble Dodge<\/span>: +2 circumstance bonus to AC\n\t\tas a Reaction. That&#8217;s the same bonus provided by Raise a Shield, Dueling\n\t\tParry, and many similar effects, though it does only apply to the triggering\n\t\tattack, so other options may be more effective if you&#8217;re drawing a lot of\n\t\tfire. The Swashbuckler&#8217;s Reaction is considerably less useful at this level\n\t\tthan an additional Action on your turn, especially since you won&#8217;t get\n\t\tOpportune Riposte for another 3 levels and you can&#8217;t get Attack of\n\t\tOpportunity until 2 levels after that. Even with Opportune Riposte and\n\t\tOpportunity Attack, this is still a more reliable and consistently effective\n\t\tuse for your Reaction.\n\t\t<p>However, the timing of when you use the Reaction can be frustrating. You\n\t\t\tchoose to use Nimble Dodge when you are targeted with the attack, rather\n\t\t\tthan after the attack is rolled, so you&#8217;re gambling with your Reaction.\n\t\t\tThere&#8217;s a roughly 1-in-5 chance that Nimble Dodge will have some effect on\n\t\t\tthe result of the attack by reducing the outcome of the roll by one stage,\n\t\t\twhich isn&#8217;t great, but at the cost of a low-level feat and your Reaction\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s still worthwhile.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re taking Swashbuckler Multiclass Archetype feats, this is\n\t\t\tprobably you go-to feat because it works equally well on literally any\n\t\t\tcharacter that&#8217;s not using a Shield or some other ability which grants a\n\t\t\tconsistent Circumstance bonus to AC. If you take Nimble Dodge, consider\n\t\t\tretraining it when you reach 10th level and get access to stances which\n\t\t\tprovide a constant Circumstance bonus to AC like Dueling Dance.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">One for All<\/span>: A great way to make Aid accessible\nwithout spending a lot of effort to attempt it, such as by moving adjacent to them to help\nuse a tool or attack an enemy. Aid isn&#8217;t fantastic on its own, but it interacts really well\n\t\twith some other options.\n\t\t<p>Humans gets a few feats which, when combined with this, present a really\n\t\t\tinteresting mechanical option. Cooperative Nature offers a +4 bonus on\n\t\t\tyour check to Aid, and this is a case where Cooperative Soul is useful.\n\t\t\tBetween the two, you&#8217;re considerably more likely to roll a Critical\n\t\t\tSuccess, and even if you don&#8217;t, you still get a Success. On its own that\n\t\t\tjust guarantees a +1 bonus to your ally&#8217;s check, but if you&#8217;re a Wit that\n\t\t\tmeans that you can recharge Panache while also helping an ally, which\n\t\t\tmight be more impactful than another Bon Mot, especially if you&#8217;ve already\n\t\t\thit several enemies with Bon Mot.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>However, the wording specifically requires that your check meets or\n\t\t\texceeds the numerical DC for a &#8220;Very Hard&#8221; check for your level, so you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\tneed to check page 503-504 of the Core Rulebook and look at table 10-5 for\n\t\t\tthe base DC and add +5 to it (see table 10-6). These DCs are written to\n\t\t\tscale at a rate that you&#8217;ll likely never be guaranteed to succeed. At any\n\t\t\tgiven point you&#8217;re likely to beat that DC about 25% of the time unless you\n\t\t\thave poured an unusually large number of Ability Boosts into Charisma, and\n\t\t\tsucceeding one out of four time is absolutely not good odds. Take this\n\t\t\tfeat because you want to make Aid a viable combat option, and consider the\n\t\t\tPanache a very occasional additional benefit.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">You&#8217;re Next<\/span>: A great feat for any\n\t\tIntimidation build, but especially useful for the Braggart because of their\n\t\treliance on Demoralize. Both the Rogue and the Swashbuckler get access to\n\t\tthis Class Feat. The text is identical.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">After You<\/span>: Starting with Panache is a big\n\t\tadvantage, but so is acting early in combat. Use this cautiously. If you\n\t\thave spellcasters in the party who are going to cast buffs, area control\n\t\tspells, or AOE damage like Fireball, it may be a good idea to use this just\n\t\tto give them space to work with less concerns about you being in the middle\n\t\tof your enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Antagonize<\/span>: Spectacular for an\n\t\tIntimidation build with enough durability to survive a lot of attacks. The\n\t\tFrightened condition is a good debuff, but it normally wears off after a\n\t\tround or two and Demoralize gives the target immunity to your Demoralize for\n\t\t10 minutes after you use it, so after a round or two of being debuffed the\n\t\ttarget goes back to normal and you&#8217;re reduced to stabbing them. The Braggart\n\t\tcan remove the temporary immunity, but that&#8217;s only against one target. This\n\t\tallows you to spread Demoralize around, and force enemies to either remain\n\t\tat Frightened 1, run and hide, or attack you instead of your less-durable\n\t\tallies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Charmed Life<\/span>: This only works once per\n\t\tround since it uses your Reaction, but honestly that&#8217;s enough. This will\n\t\tcompete with Nimble Dodge and Opportune Riposte for the use of your\n\t\tReaction, but a +2 bonus to a save is mathematically significant and you can\n\t\tuse it literally any save with no limitation except that it uses your\n\t\tReaction.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Finishing Follow-Through<\/span>: Not essential,\n\t\tbut this will happen frequently enough that it will feel satisfying and will\n\t\tsave you a few Actions that you would normally need to spend to gain Panache\n\t\tafter performing a Finisher.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tumble Behind<\/span>: Tumble Behind grants you\n\t\tPanache, making it an essential backup option for any Swashbuckler if your\n\t\tother options aren&#8217;t working for whatever reason. Making a creature\n\t\tFlat-Footed on top of the existing effects of Tumble Through means that you\n\t\tget the benefits of Feint on top of regaining Panache and hopefully putting\n\t\tyourself into a better tactical position. Of course, if you&#8217;re using Tumble\n\t\tThrough you may be able to get into positiong to Flank, which makes the\n\t\tFlat-Footed effect redundant. Both the Rogue and the Swashbuckler get access\n\t\tto this Class Feat. The text is identical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unbalancing Finisher<\/span>: Flat-Footed is a\n\t\tfine debuff, but there are so many ways to get it that it feels wasteful to\n\t\tgive up Panache for it. Tripping them, Grappling them, Feinting, Flanking,\n\t\tor any number of other options can make a target Flat-Footed. Unless your\n\t\tparty is heavily dependent on the Flat-Footed condition, this isn&#8217;t a good\n\t\tchoice. Even then, it probably won&#8217;t replace Confident Finisher as your\n\t\tgo-to Finisher option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flamboyant Athlete<\/span>: The Climb and Swim\n\t\tspeeds are already really good. Those alone would likely bring this feat to\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>, but that&#8217;s not all that you get.\n\t\tReducing your High Jump and Long Jump DCs effectively dramatically improves\n\t\thow high\/far you can jump at low levels, and at high levels makes those\n\t\tchecks nearly guaranteed. Since this effect reduces the DCs rather than\n\t\tgranting a bonus, it works with Assurance, potentially allowing you High\n\t\tJump and Long Jump great distances at little risk.\n\t\t<p>However, until your skill bonus with Athletics improves considerably,\n\t\t\tLeap will get you just as far as Long Jump and High Jump, and weirdly\n\t\t\tFlamboyant Athlete actually widens this gap. For example: At level 4 with\n\t\t\tAssurance in Athletics and Flamboyant Athlete, you could Long Jump 16 feet\n\t\t\tguaranteed if you spent 2 Actions to do so. At the same level with\n\t\t\tFlamboyant Athlete you can Leap 15 feet as an Action with no check. If you\n\t\t\thave Panache, Vivacious Speed raises your speed above the 30-foot speed\n\t\t\trequirement to add another 5 feet to Leap, allowing you jump 20 feet, and\n\t\t\tthen you can add Powerful Leap to add another 5 feet on top of that,\n\t\t\tbringing you to a total of 25 feet. You can&#8217;t jump farther than your Speed\n\t\t\twith Leap or Long Jump, so having Panache to benefit from Vivacious Speed\n\t\t\tis going to be crucial if you want to jump insane distances.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guardian&#8217;s Deflection<\/span>: Situational. If\n\t\tyou spend a lot of time adjacent to your allies in melee this can be really\n\t\timpactful, but bunching up in melee isn&#8217;t always a great option so you may\n\t\tspend a lot of time totally unable to use this feat. Both the Fighter and\n\t\tthe Swashbuckler get access to this Class Feat. The text is identical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Impaling Finisher<\/span>: Situational by design,\n\t\tthis allows you to capitalize on enemies positoning themselves adjacent to\n\t\teach other. If you ever see two enemies adjacent to each other, it&#8217;s easy to\n\t\tset this up by using Tumble Through both to position yourself and to get\n\t\tPanache. Two targets for one Finisher means that you&#8217;re potentially getting\n\t\ttwo very high-damage attacks out of a single Action, and you don&#8217;t even need\n\t\tto worry about Multiple Attack Penalties unless you made an Attack\n\t\tbeforehand. However, this only works in melee since you need to be adjacent\n\t\tto one of the targets, and obviously in single-enemy encounters this will be\n\t\ttotally useless.\n\t\t<p>This is good enough that you might consider using the Shove action to\n\t\t\tforce enemies into position, but be cautious because Shove has the attack\n\t\t\ttrait and the Multiple Attack Penalty may become a problem. Still, for a\n\t\t\tGymnast that&#8217;s an easy way to force enemies into position while also\n\t\t\tgaining Panache, and Shove allows you to remain adjacent to the target by\n\t\t\tStriding as part of the same Action.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>From a narrative perspective, there&#8217;s some silliness which you need to\n\t\t\tignore. Technically you can do this with a dagger regardless of the size\n\t\t\tof the targets, allowing you to impale giants on a blade that&#8217;s likely no\n\t\t\tmore than a foot long.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Leading Dance<\/span>: Amusing, and definitely\n\t\tworth considering for the Battledancer. This is an easy replacement for the\n\t\tShove Action both because it doesn&#8217;t use a Strength-based skill and because\n\t\tit doesn&#8217;t have the Attack trait so Multiple Attack Penalties and Finishers\n\t\twon&#8217;t make it difficult to use. You could use this to position foes to be\n\t\tFlanked or to set up Impaling Finisher. You may even be able to use this to\n\t\tdance enemies into pits, off cliffs, etc.. As a battledancer I would\n\t\tdefinitely take this, but I don&#8217;t think I could justify this for other\n\t\tswashbucklers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swaggering Initiative<\/span>: This is\n\t\tobjectively a good feat, but it&#8217;s the same bonus as Incredible Initiative\n\t\tand your Class Feats are more important than your General Feats. The\n\t\tadvantage of Swaggering Initiative over Incredible Initiative is that you\n\t\tget to Interact to draw a weapon as a Free Action. If you&#8217;re not walking\n\t\taround with your weapon in your hand (which you should be doing anywhere\n\t\tthat you expect to encounter violent opposition), that saves you an Action\n\t\tin the first turn of combat. But you can (and should) do a lot to avoid\n\t\tbeing surprised in most situations, and in those rare cases where you are\n\t\tambushed, just spend the one Action and spen your Class Feat on something\n\t\tmore impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Twin Parry<\/span>: The first indication that\n\t\tthe Swashbuckler supports two-weapon fighting. Two-weapon fighting is a hard\n\t\tchoice for the Swashbuckler because it conflicts with Finishers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-6\">6th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Agile Maneuvers<\/span>: The bonus is small, but\n\t\tthat&#8217;s not the biggest problem. The problem is juggling these Actions around\n\t\ta Finisher. Since all three have the Attack trait, you can&#8217;t use them after\n\t\ta Finisher in the same turn, which is the only time when they would have a\n\t\tMultiple Attack Penalty. This is objectively useful if you&#8217;re running around\n\t\twith Panache and not using it immediately to perform a Finisher, and it&#8217;s an\n\t\tinteresting option for characters taking Multiclass Archetype Feats, but\n\t\teven for the Gymnast Swashbuckler (the most likely user of this feat) this\n\t\tis a hard feat to benefit from.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Attack of Opportunity<\/span>: This is the first\n\t\toption that the Swashbuckler gets to compel enemies to remain in melee with\n\t\tthem, which is crucial for a front-line martial character who is likely\n\t\treplacing a fighter or an equivalent character in a party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combination Finisher<\/span>: A good way to\n\t\tjustify making a different Attack before performing a Finisher. Multiple\n\t\tAttack Penalties are huge, so do everything you can to minimize the penalty.\n\t\tUse an Agile weapon, and look for ways to reduce your target&#8217;s AC like Feint\n\t\tor Trip. For the Gymnast this is absolutely essential since options like\n\t\tTrip will be your go-to means of regaining Panache, but this is still a\n\t\tspectacular option for other swashbucklers. Even with this feat with this\n\t\tfeat, I don&#8217;t recommend wasting a Finisher on your third Attack in a turn,\n\t\tbut if you feel compelled to try it, be sure to use Confident Finisher so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re still guaranteed to get a little bit of damage even if you miss.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Precise Finisher<\/span>: Confident Finisher is\n\t\talready great insurance, and adding this makes it even better. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tmaking more than one Attack per turn and ending with a Finisher, or if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re facing enemies with high AC, Confident Finisher is a great way to\n\t\tguarantee a decent amount of damage even if it&#8217;s on a third Attack in one\n\t\tturn. Of course, it might make more sense to save that Panache for your next\n\t\tturn and use that Action for something more impactful than a few d6&#8217;s of\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vexing Tumble<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\tthe Tumble Behind feat, but you don&#8217;t move through enemies spaces and you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t trigger Reactions. When facing multiple foes in melee, this is a great\n\t\tway reposition yourself safely while also gaining Panache. In many cases\n\t\tthis can (and possibly should) replace Tumble Through as your backup option\n\t\tfor gaining Panache. However, unlike Tumble Behind you need a Critical\n\t\tSuccess to make other creatures Flat-Footed with Vexing Tumble.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bleeding Finisher<\/span>: This is a massive\n\t\tamount of persistent damage. 3d6 persistent bleed, and it goes up to 4 at\n\t\tlevel 9, eventually maxing out at 6d6. Bleed damage doesn&#8217;t work on every\n\t\tenemy, but it works on a lot of them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dual Finisher<\/span>: For a two-weapon fighting\n\t\tbuild this should be your go-to attack option. You get the Finisher bonus\n\t\tdamage on both attacks, so you can do quite a bit of damage using a single\n\t\tAction. However, two-weapon fighting is still a profoundly difficult option\n\t\tfor the Swashbuckler.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flamboyant Cruelty<\/span>: This would be\n\t\tinteresting if the Swashbuckler had an easy way to apply any of these except\n\t\tFrightened, but you don&#8217;t get one until Targeting Finisher 2 levels later,\n\t\tand even then you need to score a critical hit to make those effects last\n\t\tmore then one round in order to get more than +1 or +2 to damage from this\n\t\tfeat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nimble Roll<\/span>: Charmed Life covers all three\n\t\ttypes of saving throws and it was available 6 levels ago. The added movement\n\t\tis neat, but it&#8217;s a Stride with the Move trait so you provoke Reactions when\n\t\tyou use this, potentially exposing yourself to more damage all so you can\n\t\tmove 10 feet.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Finisher<\/span>: Stunned is a great\n\t\tcondition because it robs the target of Actions on their turn. This effect\n\t\thas the Incapacitation trait, so you don&#8217;t want to use it on creatures that\n\t\tare higher level than you, but the vast majority of enemies you face will be\n\t\tyour level or lower. The best use case for this is in fights against foes of\n\t\tyour own level (the maximum level before the Incapacitation trait kicks in)\n\t\tbecause removing one Action from them tilts the action economy in your favor\n\t\tmore than taking one action from a room full of 20 zombies or something like\n\t\tthat.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vivacious Bravado<\/span>: If you&#8217;re on the\n\t\tfront lines as your party&#8217;s Defender, you&#8217;re going to be attacked a lot. In\n\t\tsome cases you&#8217;re going to be hit, so temporary hit points do a lot to keep\n\t\tyou alive without eating precious resources like spell slots spent to heal\n\t\tyou. However, using an Action for temporary hit points that last one turn is\n\t\ta hard ask. That same Action could be spent to Raise a Shield or to use a\n\t\tParry weapon, and deflecting even one attack would likely save you from a\n\t\tsimilar amount of damage. This is a good option if you have a spare Action\n\t\tand nothing else to do with it, but in those cases you could Demoralize or\n\t\tdo any number of other things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Buckler Dance<\/span>: One Action to get a +1\n\t\tCircumstance bonus to AC for the rest of the fight (+2 if you also take\n\t\tBuckler Expertise). Unless you&#8217;re using Shield Block with your buckler, I\n\t\twould strongly consider taking Dueling Dance instead and giving up on\n\t\tbucklers entirely.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Derring-Do<\/span>: This is insanely good. Many of\n\t\tthe Action options to gain Panache have Critical Success effects, and\n\t\trolling twice on your skill check makes it considerably more likely that\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll get that benefit, and dramatically reduces the possibility of\n\t\tfailure. If you&#8217;re using Assurance you&#8217;ll need to choose between the two\n\t\tsince you can&#8217;t use more than one Fortune effect at a time. But remember\n\t\tthat this only works when you have Panache so it doesn&#8217;t work outside of\n\t\tcombat, and Assurance can still be a good fall-back if you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tPanache.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling Dance<\/span>: One Action to get a +2\n\t\tCircumstance bonus to AC for the rest of the fight. Both the Fighter and the\n\t\tSwashbuckler get access to this Class Feat. The text is identical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reflexive Riposte<\/span>: This means potentially\n\t\tan extra attack every round, so be sure that your AC is as high as you can\n\t\tget it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Targeting Finisher<\/span>: The effects are\n\t\tgood, but without a critical hit you&#8217;ll need to continually reapply them\n\t\tbecause the duration only lasts until the end of your next turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cheat Death<\/span>: Incredibly powerful. The fact\n\t\tthat the Doomed condition only takes 10 minutes to wear off (rather than\n\t\twearing off 1 point per day) means that you can use this repeatedly in the\n\t\tsame fight, and the effects will wear off while the rest of your party\n\t\tRefocuses, treats their wounds, and looks for loot between fights. If you\n\t\ttake this, strongly consider Diehard to raise your Dying threshold from 4 to\n\t\t5.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mobile Finisher<\/span>: In many cases you&#8217;ll\n\t\tspend one Action on your turn to gain Panache and one to perform a Finisher,\n\t\twhich leaves you with a spare Action which you could use to Stride. This is\n\t\ta fine option, but it&#8217;s really underwhelming at this level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flamboyant Leap<\/span>: If you invest enough\n\t\tfeats into jumping, this can sometimes substitute for flight. Unfortunately,\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t use it in conjunction with Wall Jump or Cloud Leap. Of course,\n\t\teven with a ton of investment in jumping, and enemies can typically fly out\n\t\tof your jump range and render this feat useless. You need a way to counter\n\t\tflight, and this probably isn&#8217;t it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impossible Riposte<\/span>: It&#8217;s like the Monk&#8217;s\n\t\tDeflect Arrows+Arrow Snatching feats, but it&#8217;s one feat and it also works\n\t\tagainst spells. The attack does need to critically fail, unfortunately, but\n\t\tover the course of a character&#8217;s career that&#8217;s going to happen frequently\n\t\tenough that this is worth the feat. The reflected attack uses your own\n\t\tdamage for whatever you would normally riposte with, so even if some level 1\n\t\twizard throws a Ray of Frost at you, you still deal damage from your +2\n\t\tStriking Rapier with a flaming rune and a racing stripe (that&#8217;s not a thing,\n\t\tI&#8217;m being absurd to reinforce the point).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfect Finisher<\/span>: It doesn&#8217;t sound\n\t\texciting, but the possibility of scoring a Critical Hit increases\n\t\tsignificantly and the possibility of missing decreases significantly. The\n\t\tadditional damage from a Critical Hit, especially if your weapon has the\n\t\tDeadly trait (take a look at Deadly Grace, below). If you need a reliable\n\t\tpile of damage or if you want to fish for Critical Hits, this is a great\n\t\toption and should likely replace Confident Finisher as a nearly-guaranteed\n\t\tsource of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Twinned Defense<\/span>: Single-weapon and\n\t\tweapon+buckler builds got their equivalent feat 4 levels ago. Both the\n\t\tFighter and the Swashbuckler get access to this Class Feat. The text is\n\t\tidentical.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadly Grace<\/span>: Not every swashbuckler will\n\t\tuse a rapier, but it is the go-to option, and other Deadly weapons like the\n\t\tFilcher&#8217;s Fork and the Starknife are great choices too. Doubling the effect\n\t\tof Deadly will add a huge amount of damage to your already incredible\n\t\tCritical Hits, and since Perfect Finisher came online 2 levels earlier\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going to roll a lot of those.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Felicitous Riposte<\/span>: This makes your\n\t\tripostes more reliable, which means more damage output. If you took\n\t\tImpossible Riposte, I would absolutely take this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Luck<\/span>: Charmed Life is arguably\n\t\tthe best thing that you can do with your Reaction, and adding a free reroll\n\t\tto it makes Charmed Life incomparably powerful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lethal Finisher<\/span>: This is a really\n\t\ttempting option, but it&#8217;s a huge gamble. The damage is objectively good;\n\t\t12d6 damage on top of your normal Strike damage is great (though it&#8217;s only\n\t\t6d6 more than you can expect from other Finishers). However, there are two\n\t\tfailure points. First, you need to hit with your Strike (normal for any\n\t\tFinisher), and then the target gets a Fortitude Save which determines how\n\t\tmuch damage they take.\n\t\t<p>Compare this to Perfect Finisher. For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s say\n\t\t\tthat scoring a Critical Hit with Perfect Finisher is just as likely as the\n\t\t\ttarget failing their save against Lethal Finisher. If you score a Critical\n\t\t\tHit with a +3 Greater Striking Rapier (the expectation at this level;\n\t\t\tMajor Striking is a level 19 item), you&#8217;ll deal a total of 3d8+3d6 damage\n\t\t\tbefore considering your Strength score, other runes, Deadly Grace,\n\t\t\tCritical Specialization effects, or any number of other things. That&#8217;s\n\t\t\tslightly more than the additional 6d6 damage gained between each degree of\n\t\t\tsuccess on the saving throw against Lethal Finisher, and the more damage\n\t\t\tyou add to your rapier the more things tilt toward Perfect Finisher. If\n\t\t\tyou add Deadly Grace and upgrade to Major Striking, the gap becomes\n\t\t\t8d8+4d6, which is greater than the gap between a Success and a Critical\n\t\t\tFailure against Lethal Finisher, at which point Lethal Finisher is\n\t\t\tunjustifiable.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There are some edge cases where Lethal Finisher is better than Perfect\n\t\t\tFinisher: First, Lethal Finisher doesn&#8217;t have the Fortune Trait. Fortune\n\t\t\teffects can be very powerful, so if you have those options available (Hero\n\t\t\tPoints, True Strike, etc.) they can make Lethal Finisher very effective.\n\t\t\tHowever, those effects nearly always require someone to spend a resource\n\t\t\t(a spell, an Action, a Hero Point, etc.) so you may not be able to rely on\n\t\t\tFortune effects being available to support Lethal Finisher. Second, Lethal\n\t\t\tFinisher has the Death trait, so when enemies are reduced to 0 hit points\n\t\t\tthey die outright. Against enemies with regeneration or while facing\n\t\t\tenemies with a healer among them, this can help keep enemies down.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>To summarize: On its own, Lethal Finisher is pretty good. But Perfect\n\t\t\tFinisher is considerably better without other Fortune effects, especially\n\t\t\tif you take other options that support it.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Parry and Riposte<\/span>: The limitations on\n\t\tthis are hard. This will work better if you&#8217;re facing few or single enemies,\n\t\tbut against crowds this is borderline useless.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Swashbuckler-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inexhaustible Countermoves<\/span>: Finally a good\n\t\tway to handle being outnumbered! If you take this, definitely make sure that\n\t\tyou also took Impossible Riposte and Felicitous Riposte so that you can\n\t\trespond to ranged attacks, reach attacks, and spell attacks. You might also\n\t\ttake Parry and Riposte because it&#8217;s so great against single foes, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tnot crucial.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panache Paragon<\/span>: An extra action is\n\t\talways welcome, and allowing you to use that Action to gain Panache is\n\t\tgreat. If you took Class Feats which offer additional options to gain\n\t\tPanache those won&#8217;t work, but many of the default options are going to be\n\t\tyour best option anyway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Diehard<\/span>: Swashbucklers are typically on\n\t\tthe front line of their parties, so you&#8217;re going to take a lot of damage,\n\t\tand as a result you may find yourself dropping to 0 hit points frequently.\n\t\tThis is especially crucial if you take Cheat Death.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fleet<\/span>: If you need more speed, get Panache\n\t\tand the bonus from Vivacious Speed will at least double this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Incredible Initiative<\/span>: Going first is\n\t\talways great. However, Swaggering Initiative provides the same bonus and\n\t\talso allows you to draw a weapon, so don&#8217;t make the mistake of taking\n\t\tboth.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toughness<\/span>: Swashbucklers already get a lot\n\t\tof hit points, but they also take a lot of damage so you want as many as you\n\t\tcan possibly get.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Block<\/span>: Bucklers can be used with\n\t\tShield Block, but their hardness and hit points are considerably lower than\n\t\tthose of a regular shield, so doing so will quickly result in broken and\n\t\tdestroyed bucklers. You&#8217;ll likely be better served by not using this or by\n\t\tsticking to class feats like Nimble Dodge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Swashbuckler is essentially locked into weapons with the Agile and\/or Finesse traits, and while the Rapier is the go-to option there is plenty of room to consider other options and still succeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile is tempting since Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s martial characters often depend on making numerous Strikes in a turn, which leads to a growing Multiple Attack Penalty. However, the Swashbuckler&#8217;s reliance on Finishers means that second or third attacks are a rarity so Agile is considerably less appealing than it usually is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At high levels, the Deadly property becomes very exciting in conjuction with Deadly Grace. Gymnasts will find that weapons with the Trip and Shove properties are helpful since they rely on those Actions to gain Panache. Avoid two-handed weapons like the plague; the Swashbuckler&#8217;s Feats do not support them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Claw Blade<\/span>: Similar to the Dagger and the\n\t\tStarknife, but you trade the ability to throw the weapon for a better Deadly\n\t\tdie and the Disarm trait. If you&#8217;re not throwing your Starknife they&#8217;re\n\t\troughly equivalent until you can pick up Deadly Grace at high level, so it&#8217;s\n\t\thard to justify investing feats to get access.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dagger \/ Starknife<\/span>: All the appeal of the\n\t\tShortsword, but you take a smaller hit die in exchange for the Thrown\n\t\tproperty and the Deadly property on the starknife. The Starknife is a better\n\t\tversion of the Dagger, but I&#8217;ve listed the Dagger because a lot of players\n\t\t(including me) frequently forget that the Starknife exists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dogslicer<\/span>: Roughly equivalent to the\n\t\tShortsword, but you trade Versatile for Backstabber.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elven Curve Blade<\/span>: Uncommon. The\n\t\tSwashbuckler&#8217;s only option with the Forceful trait. Personally I think\n\t\tForceful is a waste on the Swashbuckler since Finishers are such a crucial\n\t\ttactical option, and the Swashbuckler&#8217;s Class Feats don&#8217;t support a\n\t\ttwo-handed weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Filcher&#8217;s Fork<\/span>: Uncommon, but an\n\t\tabsolutely stellar weapon. Agile, Backstabber, Deadly, Finesse, and Thrown\n\t\tare a great combination of properties. The damage die is only d4, but if you\n\t\tcan get easy access to this I would consider it on par with the Rapier and\n\t\tthe Starknife.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gauntlet<\/span>: A great backup weapon, it does\n\t\tas much damage as the Dagger or the Main-Gauche and has Agile, so it&#8217;s great\n\t\tfor second or third attacks in a turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Light Mace<\/span>: With Agile and Finesse, the\n\t\tLight Mace is one of the Swashbuckler&#8217;s only options for bludgeoning damage,\n\t\tand it&#8217;s their only viable option with the Shove trait. That&#8217;s not worth\n\t\tmuch on its own, but for the Gymnast that&#8217;s a useful tactical option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Main-Gauche<\/span>: Trade the Dagger&#8217;s throwing\n\t\trange for Disarm and Parry. Probably not a great choice since two-weapon\n\t\tfighting isn&#8217;t a great option for the Swashbuckler. Get a shield\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapier<\/span>: If you&#8217;re only making one attack\n\t\tper turn (Finishers every turn!), the Rapier is a fine choice since the\n\t\tAgile property won&#8217;t matter. The Deadly trait is always tempting, and d6 is\n\t\tthe largest damage die you&#8217;ll find aside from the Elven Curve Blade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sickle \/ Kukri<\/span>: Trade the dagger&#8217;s Thrown\n\t\tand Versatile properties for the Trip property. Trip can be very effective\n\t\tif you have the Strength to make it work reliably. Probably the Gymnast&#8217;s\n\t\tgo-to weapon option since you can get an item bonus to your Athletics check\n\t\tto Trip. Upgrade to the Kukri (which is Uncommon) to improve the damage\n\t\tdie.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scorpion Whip<\/span>: Your only option for\n\t\tReach, the Whip also has both Disarm and Trip. It&#8217;s a great option for the\n\t\tGymnast, matching the damage die of the Sickle and adding Reach. However,\n\t\tit&#8217;s Uncommon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortsword<\/span>: Not fancy, but very\n\t\teffective. The biggest damage die you&#8217;ll get with the Agile property, and\n\t\tVersatile is great for a class with so much dependence on weapon damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spiked Chain<\/span>: The traits and damage die\n\t\tare tempting, but the Swashbuckler&#8217;s Class Feats do not support a two-handed\n\t\tweapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wakizashi<\/span>: Uncommon. Start with the\n\t\tRapier, and drop its damage die one step to get Agile. This gives up a\n\t\tlittle bit of damage to benefit from the best traits of both the Shortsword\n\t\tand the Rapier, which is an interesting option if you&#8217;re fishing for\n\t\tCritical Hits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Buckler<\/span>: Until you can pick up Buckler\n\t\tDance, a buckler is strictly worse than a regular shield unless you need the\n\t\tability to hold stuff in the same hand. You may need to do that with some\n\t\tregularity. Maneuvers and cool swashbuckler stuff like swinging from\n\t\tchandeliers often requires a free hand.\n\t\t<p>But if you need free hands, why use a Buckler at all? You could also take\n\t\t\ta weapon with the Parry trait to get the same AC bonus.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Avoid Shield Block; bucklers are very frail compared to shields.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield<\/span>: Swashbucklers have no viable way\n\t\tto use two-handed weapon options, and between an Action spent on a Finisher\n\t\tand an Action spent to gain Panache, many swashbucklers will frequently find\n\t\tthemselves with a spare Action to spend. Raise a Shield is a great option,\n\t\tand while using a full-sized shield may not feel very swashbuckler-y, it&#8217;s a\n\t\tstill a great option until 10th level when you can get Buckler Dance or\n\t\tDueling Dance. Shield Block is tempting up to that point, but it&#8217;s likely\n\t\tnot worth the feat and the time spent repairing shields.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explorer&#8217;s Clothing<\/span>: Once you get to 20\n\t\tDexterity at 10th level, consider trading in your Leather Armor for\n\t\tExplorer&#8217;s Clothing to gain the Comfortable property.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leather Armor<\/span>: Probably your armor of\n\t\tchoice until 10th level, at which point you might switch to Explorer&#8217;s\n\t\tClothing, but if you&#8217;re meeting the Strength Threshold of 10 (which you\n\t\tshould be) the Check Penalty should never be a problem. The only advantage\n\t\twhich Explorer&#8217;s Clothing provides at that point is the Comfortable\n\t\tproperty.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Acrobat<\/span>: The Acrobat Dedication feat will\n\t\tautomatically increase your Proficiency in Athletics at every level where\n\t\tyou could increase it, saving you 3 Skill Increases. Graceful Leaper is\n\t\ttempting for the Gymnast Swashbuckler, and Tumbling Opportunist allows you\n\t\tto use Tumble Through (which gives you Panache) and Trip a creature using a\n\t\tsingle Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: The Fighter has a lot to offer\n\t\tthe Swashbuckler, even with low-level Class Feats.
