Strangely, this feature incentivizes you to use your two free\n\t\tspells learned per level to learn literally anything except spells from your\n\t\tfavorite school.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Sculpt Spells<\/span>: Friendly fire happens\n\t\tinevitably when you have an evoker in the party. This goes a long way to cut\n\t\tdown on the problem, and you should abuse the fact that your allies are immune to your spells wherever possible.\n\t\t<p>There&#8217;s some weird nuance here that&#8217;s easy to overlook: While this is\n\t\t\tclearly intended to protect allies from Burning Hands, Fireball, and other\n\t\t\tsuch AOE damage options, the protection doesn&#8217;t end after the initial\n\t\t\teffect of the spell. Creatures are protected from the spell&#8217;s effects for\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s full duration. This means that your allies can comfortably\n\t\t\twalk around in the areas of spells like Sickening Radiance,\n\t\t\tpotentially dragging enemies about inside the area to force them to\n\t\t\ttake damage. You could even cast Otiluke&#8217;s Freezing Sphere, designate your\n\t\t\tallies as protected by Sculpt Spells, then send them off with pockets full\n\t\t\tof frozen spheres to smash at their feet in a room full of enemies.\n\t\t\tHonestly, I don&#8217;t think this was intended when WotC wrote School of\n\t\t\tEvocation. Much like Empowered Evocation, I think that they meant for\n\t\t\tSculpt Spells only to apply to the initial effects. But it&#8217;s been 5+ years\n\t\t\tand we haven&#8217;t gotten errata or tweets from Jeremy Crawford, so it appears\n\t\t\tthat Sculpt Spells works as I&#8217;ve described it until someone tells us\n\t\t\totherwise.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Potent Cantrip<\/span>: Acid Splash and Poison\n\t\tSpray are the only damaging Wizard cantrips in the PHB which require a\n\t\tsaving throw, but other supplements have dramatically increased your\n\t\toptions.\nAdditionally, this feature is not limited to Wizard cantrips, in case you happen to have something from another class, feat, or a racial feature.\n This is nice insurance, and it encourages you to use saving throw\n\t\tcantrips like Frostbite instead of attack cantrips like Fire Bolt because\n\t\tthe guaranteed half damage means that your DPR is calculated with the formula ([Dice Average]*([Chance to Fail Save]+0.5*(1-[Chance to Fail Save]))). This formula applies to any save for half effect, so it&#8217;s also relevant to a lot of leveled spells.\n<p>An example at the level we get this: with Toll the Dead (2d12, avg. 13) and a 60% Chance the target fails: (13*(0.6+0.5*(0.4)))=10.4 Expected DPR. If instead the target only failed the save 50% of the time: (13*(0.5+0.5*(0.5)))=9.75 Expected DPR. That\u2019s only a difference of 0.65 DPR.<\/p>\n<p>A firebolt at the same level, following the expected math for an attack roll with 2d10 damage on a hit, comes to 7.7 DPR and does nothing on a miss.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Empowered Evocation<\/span>: A bonus to damage\n\t\tlike this is a considerable boost, especially for your low-level spells like\n\t\tBurning Hands, which can still be decent damage sources at a low spell slot\n\t\tcost.\n\t\t<p>According to\n\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2015\/06\/28\/scorching-ray-dd-errata\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeremy Crawford<\/a>\n\t\t\tback in 2015, this bonus applies to each missile of magic missile and to\n\t\t\tall targets of an AOE, but only to one attack for multi-attack spells like\n\t\t\tScorching Ray. If Empowered Evocation applies to each missile, Magic\n\t\t\tMissile becomes very powerful. This conflicts with Crawford&#8217;s more recent\n\t\t\trulings, where he has ruled that each missile from Magic Missile is a\n\t\t\tseparate damage roll, so similar damage bonuses only get applied to one of\n\t\t\tthe missiles. Personally I think the more-recent ruling makes more sense,\n\t\t\tbut discuss it with your DM.\nFor the magic missile case, see our Practical Guide to \n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/magic-missile\/\">Magic Missile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Overchannel<\/span>: This is a great way to get\n\t\tmore mileage out of reliable lower-level spells like Magic Missile and\n\t\tFireball at a level where your higher-level spells would generally eclipse\n\t\tthem. Just be sure to have a Cleric handy when you start taking damage. RAW,\n\t\tthe damage is maximized every time that the spell deals damage, which makes\n\t\tspells like Wall of Fire especially powerful. However, according to\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2016\/12\/17\/if-i-overchannel-bigbys-hand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeremy Crawford<\/a>\n\t\tthe effect was intended to only apply to the first damage roll for the\n\t\tspell, so sticking to Fireball is likely your best choice. Check with your\n\t\tDM about how they want to handle things.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-evocation-ability-scores\">School of Evocation Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards need Intelligence for Save DCs, Constitution for HP and Concentration saves, and Dexterity, for AC.

Put another way, if the target succeeds on the save 60% of the time, the DPR is 70% of the dice average, but if we increase our Intelligence enough to increase the DC by 2 points, the same creature now has a 50-50 chance to succeed or fail, a change of 10%, but the DPR is 75% of the dice average, a change of only 5%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use this to compare targeting different saves. This means two things: First, that which saving throw we target matters less when we\u2019re only trying to do damage and second, that delaying our Intelligence increases to grab an important feat doesn\u2019t hurt our DPR significantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>What does matter however, is our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1X70jdBX0X0n_5V7stc1_kYERXLNGJIbdjhl3BUbKxQI\/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">damage types<\/a>. A few Thunder damage spells like Thunderwave and Shatter, which target Con, are a good way to mix it up and avoid common resistances, like Fire.

This means that having better Concentration checks is something we can afford to take the moment to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth and twelfth level, we take our ASIs for +2 Intelligence each, pushing to 20 to boost spell attacks and spell save DCs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth and nineteenth levels, we take more ASIs for +2 Dexterity each time, pushing to 20 to boost our AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Variant Human Feat: Resilient (Constitution)<br><br>Arcane Recovery<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-Cantrips<br>\u2013Mind Sliver<br>\u2013Thunderclap<br>\u2013Toll the Dead<br>-1st-level Spells<br>\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/magic-missile\/\">Magic Missile<\/a><br>\u2013Mage Armor<br>\u2013Shield<br>\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\">Silvery Barbs<\/a><br>\u2013Sleep<br>\u2013Thunderwave<\/td><td>Starting as a Variant Human, we gain a bonus feat and for that we choose Resilient (Constitution). Taking this gives us a boost to our Constitution score and proficiency in the save as well.<br><br>For cantrips, we\u2019re going to load up on three offensive options because these give us some good tactical options.<br><br>Are we trying to set up a strong debuff on the target? Mind Sliver will give an edge to the next saving throw the target has to make.<br>Are we next to a pair of foes we don\u2019t want to be? Well drop a Thunderclap (and hopefully Misty Step away).<br><br>Is it just a damage race? Bing-bong goes Toll the Dead.<br><br>As for first leveled spells, we\u2019re taking an array of Defensive options (Mage Armor and Shield), Damage spells (Magic Missile and Thunderwave), and Debuff Utility (Silvery Barbs and Sleep).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>School of Evocation<br>-Evocation Savant<br>-Sculpt Spells<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-1st-level Spells<br>\u2013Absorb Elements<br>\u2013Tasha\u2019s Caustic Brew<\/td><td>At second level we take our tradition, the School of Evocation.<br><br>With Sculpt Spells we can now do the thing that everyone else gets yelled at for: Drop deadly AoEs on the party without getting everyone killed.<br><br>Just be wary of how this works: it has to be an Evocation spell and we can protect a number of creatures up to 1+ the spell\u2019s level. So a Thunderwave spell could ignore two targets if cast at 1st-level, and if upcast to 2nd it could ignore three targets.<br><br>But a Stinking Cloud or a Web are both Conjuration spells so we can\u2019t make anyone immune to these effects. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t take spells like that (we should because those are great spells): it means we have to remember what spells can be safely tossed into a melee slugfest.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-2nd-level Spells<br>\u2013Shatter<br>\u2013Tasha\u2019s Mind Whip<\/td><td>We get 2nd-level spells, and we\u2019re continuing to be a blasty Evoker by choosing Shatter, but we\u2019re also picking up Tasha\u2019s Mind Whip.<br><br>Shatter should be self explanatory: it\u2019s like a smaller Fireball but with Thunder damage. Don\u2019t let the Con save scare you, that doesn\u2019t actually move the DPR meter much for save-for-half spells like this, and the damage type diversity will be more than welcome when you run up against a Fire resistant or immune foe.<br><br>Tasha\u2019s Mind Whip on the other hand targets Intelligence which is typically a lower stat and does some good single-target damage with a particularly debilitating rider on failed saves, but still at least does half damage if the target succeeds.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: War Caster<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-2nd-level Spells<br>\u2013Enhance Ability<br>\u2013Misty Step<br>\u2013Web<\/td><td>We can pick up some utility magic like Enhance Ability, Misty Step, or Web.<br><br>We also take the War Caster feat so that we have a better chance to hold our Concentration if we get smacked.

Only Fireball. Not really, but sometimes yeah you should use Fireball. For everything else, there\u2019s Lightning Bolt.<br><br>Minute Meteors are worth considering. It\u2019s easy to look at the damage and see that it\u2019s 12d6 damage split into discrete 2d6 chunks that can be handed out as bonus actions, up to 4d6 per use.<br><br>That is 50% more damage than Fireball, but spread over at least 3 rounds while also occupying our Concentration. Because it lasts 10 minutes, if we can get it spinning before a fight starts then nothing is stopping us from weaving meteors in between other spells.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Potent Cantrip<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-3rd-level Spells<br>\u2013Fly<br>\u2013Hypnotic Pattern<\/td><td>Potent Cantrip is particularly nice. It just means we always have a way to do some automatic damage. Yes, leveled spells will be stronger, but Cantrips are free and sometimes we need to do things like Misty Step.<br><br>Fly and Hypnotic Pattern may not be our usual kind of blow everything up spells, but we welcome them the same.<br><br>Fly is Fly. We all know how good it is to fly. Most big name evocation spells don\u2019t require Concentration, so it\u2019s easy to commit Concentration to Fly and then spend all of your time raining damage on things.<br><br>Hypnotic Pattern can really mess up a group of enemies by taking some of them out of the encounter. Put this up early and then when about half are dead, try to line up a Lightning Bolt across the rest.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-4th-level Spells<br>\u2013Sickening Radiance<br>\u2013Wall of Fire<\/td><td>We have to be extra careful with the way Wall of Fire works. Yes, it has a saving throw, but only when placing the wall for the first time.<br><br>We can protect our allies from that, but there\u2019s no save for being in the wall or on the hot side of the wall, so Sculpt Spell doesn\u2019t protect anyone from that damage.<br><br>Sickening Radiance on the other hand, is ripe for Sculpt Spell abuse. Make up to five creatures immune to the spell and do whatever you can to keep foes locked down inside the danger zone.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: Intelligence +2 (16=&gt;18)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-4th-level Spells<br>\u2013Greater Invisibility<br>\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">Polymorph<\/a><\/td><td>Intelligence for DCs and Spell Attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-5th-level Spells<br>\u2013Cone of Cold<br>\u2013Dawn<br>\u2013Synaptic Static<\/td><td>Cone of Cold and Dawn are good options.&nbsp;<br><br>While Dawn and Sickening Radiance do the same damage and Sickening Radiance has terrible rider effects that kill your foes, Dawn can be moved as a bonus action on your turn. This may be useful in niche scenarios, but 9 times out of 10, you\u2019ll just use Sickening Radiance.<br><br>Synaptic Static is a strong AoE spell but I also have to express caution. This spell is Enchantment, so it can\u2019t be Sculpted. We\u2019ll have to actually avoid the team with this spell. This is worth it though, between the psychic damage type, the Intelligence saving throw, and most importantly giving the targets a -1d6 to attack rolls for a minute.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Empowered Evocation<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-5th-level Spells<br>\u2013Wall of Force<br>\u2013Wall of Stone<\/td><td>Add Intelligence to damage for Evocation spells. It\u2019s nice, and it does apply to AoEs.<br><br>While it does not appear that noticeable on a spell like Fireball when only looking at the 8d6, it does apply to every target of an AoE, so the more targets, the more times that modifier gets added.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-6th-level Spells<br>\u2013Chain Lightning<br>\u2013Sunbeam<br>\u2013Frozen Sphere<\/td><td>Chain Lightning is particularly strong, doing 10d8+Int per target to up to 4 targets. Good if we need to get damage down right now and the enemies are in an unusual arrangement or if we need Lightning typed damage, but against 5 or more foes, an upcast Fireball would be doing 11d6+Int and we can just Sculpt around allies.<br><br>Sunbeam is a neat spell. Sure, it uses our Concentration and it targets Con, but we can fire line lasers for a minute and that\u2019s cool. Also, because it\u2019s half on a save, being Con doesn\u2019t matter as much.<br><br>Frozen Sphere has a fun interaction where ellies can pick up and later detonate the sphere, safely protected from the damage by Sculpt Spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>ASI: Intelligence +2 (18=&gt;20)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-6th-level Spells<br>\u2013Disintegrate<br>\u2013True Seeing<\/td><td>Maximum Intelligence means Maximum Spell DCs. Not that we care too much for all our half on a save spells, but we do have other spells that this helps with.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-7th-level Spells<br>\u2013Crown of Stars<br>\u2013Delayed Blast Fireball<br>\u2013Whirlwind<\/td><td>Crown of Stars is a decent way to get some consistent use out of bonus actions. The spell lasts an hour and doesn\u2019t use Concentration.<br><br>Delayed Blast Fireball has a very interesting interaction with Sculpt Spell. Because the creatures you choose automatically succeed on saves, a creature of your choice will automatically succeed on the save to pick up the fireball and can then deliver it even further (potentially multiple times), maybe down a winding corridor or something. 22d6 isn\u2019t quite Meteor Swarm, but it\u2019s a ton of damage.<br><br>Whirlwind is a small AoE and does less damage than one might assume for a 7th-level spell, but has some interesting effects that make it worth using. In particular, as an Evocation spell, this is pretty much the only crowd control effect that we can also designate targets to be immune.<br><br>This restrains targets and carries them along with the whirlwind, allowing your allies (who are excluded thanks to Sculpt Spells) to safely fight within the whirlwind while you collect every enemy in the encounter into a small area before dropping low-cost AOE spells on them. Remember that Restrained also imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Overchannel<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-7th-level Spells<br>\u2013Forcecage<br>\u2013Plane Shift<\/td><td>Overchannel for Maximum Damage. Good effect. Don\u2019t push it though.<br><br>Combine it with a continuous effect like Dawn or Sickening Radiance to get the most out of it (see the subclass features section above; there\u2019s some rules discussion here). Even if you just max out a 5th-level Fireball, that\u2019s 60 damage (10d6 maximized).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-8th-level Spells<br>\u2013Maddening Darkness<br>\u2013Sunburst<\/td><td>We\u2019re getting to the point where there\u2019s not very many Evocation spells left, but comically, we have our choice of light and dark.<br><br>Maddening Darkness is similar to regular Darkness in that it is a magical darkness that foils Darkvision, except that it also does Psychic damage. Our Sculpt Spell targets can ignore the damage, but not the darkness.<br><br>Sunburst on the other hand, is a single blast of radiant damage that can blind targets that fail the save. Kind of like a bigger angrier fireball.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>ASI: Dexterity +2 (16=&gt;18)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-8th-level Spells<br>\u2013Clone<br>\u2013Maze<\/td><td>Not much to say other than we want more AC.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-9th-level Spells<br>\u2013Wish<br>\u2013Meteor Swarm<\/td><td><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/wish\/\">Wish<\/a>. Because I don\u2019t get to publish this article without it.<br><br>Meteor Swarm is the only Evocation spell here, but we can pick a whole ten targets to protect from the spell.
