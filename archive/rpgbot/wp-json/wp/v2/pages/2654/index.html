For more on the Fighter&#8217;s class features, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/#class-features\">Fighter Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Style<\/span>: One of the Fighter&#8217;s iconic\n\tabilities, your choice of fighting style has a significant effect on which\n\tfirearms are appealing for you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The obvious choice for ranged builds. +2 to hit is a big deal in a game\n\t\twhere a 20th-level character can expect a maximum of +11 to hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defense<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You&#8217;re fighting at range, so AC isn&#8217;t quite as important as it is for\n\t\tmelee fighters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dueling<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: +2 damage while using a single pistol.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Great Weapon Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A possibility for muskets, but muskets aren&#8217;t good enough to justify\n\t\tit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You are not a tank.,<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Pistols can fire four shots before reloading, and with some simple\n\t\tmanagement and Quickdraw you can easily avoid reloading in combat. That\n\t\tmakes dual wielding pistols a possibility. However, two-weapon fighting\n\t\tstill isn&#8217;t a good proposition for fighters because the math simply doesn&#8217;t\n\t\twork out. You can still do two-weapon fighting without the fighting style,\n\t\tand Archery will probably net better damage output.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Gunslinger Fighter Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Firearm Proficiency<\/span>: Proficiency in\n\t\tfirearms is obviously important for a character built around firearms. Of\n\t\tcourse, waiting for your subclass to get proficiency means that you spent\n\t\ttwo levels using some other weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gunsmith<\/span>: Tinker&#8217;s Tools will prove to be\n\t\tan important part of your character. Tinker&#8217;s Tools are used to repair your\n\t\tfirearms, and the more you fight the more frequently you&#8217;ll be repairing a\n\t\tbroken firearm.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Adept Marksman<\/span>: Trick Shots are the most\n\t\tinteresting part of the Gunslinger. You get two options at 3rd level, and\n\t\tpick up 6 more over the rest of your career, so you&#8217;ll get most of the 8\n\t\tavailable Trick Shot options.\n\t\t<p>Adept Marksman also gives you a pool of Grit Points which you&#8217;ll use to\n\t\t\tfuel your abilities. You recharge grit points by shooting stuff rather\n\t\t\tthan by resting, which helps when you&#8217;re in a long series of fights. The\n\t\t\tmost recent update to the Gunslinger makes it harder to recharge your grit\n\t\t\tpoints by shooting a barrel full of rats (which was a huge problem in\n\t\t\tPathfinder), but given sufficient ammunition you could still shoot an\n\t\t\tinanimate target repeatedly until you roll enough natural 20&#8217;s to recharge\n\t\t\tyour grit pool between encounters.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quickdraw<\/span>: Real-world flint-lock weapons\n\t\ttake a lot time to load, but drawing them is quick, so when flint-lock\n\t\tweapons were the dominant form of weaponry it was common for people to carry\n\t\tseveral loaded pistols into battle and switch between loaded pistols rather\n\t\tthan reload them in the middle of a fight. If you can afford multiple\n\t\tfirearms (and by this level you can), it&#8217;s often smarter to draw a spare\n\t\tweapon than to spend an attack or an action to reload. In Pathfinder this\n\t\twas less feasible because players sunk tens of thousands of gold into a\n\t\tsingle weapon, and putting down your +3 pistol to draw another pistol was an\n\t\tabsurd prospect.\n\t\t<p>You also add your proficiency bonus to Initiative, which is really\n\t\t\tnice.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rapid Repair<\/span>: You already have\n\t\tQuickdraw. If your gun jams, draw another one. Fix them between fights when\n\t\tsomeone can cast Guidance on you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lightning Reload<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re doing\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting with pistols, you&#8217;re not using your bonus action on most\n\t\trounds. If you&#8217;re using a weapon that&#8217;s hard to carry multiples of (such as\n\t\ta magic weapon, an expensive weapon, or simply a weapon that&#8217;s very heavy),\n\t\treloading is a big problem. Moving the reload to a bonus action gives you\n\t\tback an attack every round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vicious Intent<\/span>: Doubling the critical\n\t\trange makes it much easier to regain grit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hemorrhaging Critical<\/span>: More damage is\n\t\talways nice, and since you&#8217;re scoring critical hits on a 19 or 20 you may\n\t\tget to enjoy this frequently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Trick Shots<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bullying Shot<\/span>: A fighter is not a\n\t\t\t\tface.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dazing Shot<\/span>: An excellent debuff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadeye Shot<\/span>: Easy access to Advantage\n\t\t\t\tis really helpful against foes with high AC, and it makes it more likely\n\t\t\t\tthat you will roll a critical hit and regain your spent Grit Point.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disarming Shot<\/span>: Most monsters you\n\t\t\t\tface won&#8217;t be using weapons.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Forceful Shot<\/span>: Situational. Pushing\n\t\t\t\tfoes is only rarely useful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Piercing Shot<\/span>: Even though the\n\t\t\t\tadditional attacks are made at Disadvantage, the possibility of hitting\n\t\t\t\tone or more additional targets could be a significant amount of extra\n\t\t\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Winging Shot<\/span>: Knocking a foe prone\n\t\t\t\tis really nice for melee characters, but it doesn&#8217;t help you at all.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Violent Shot<\/span>: I would only use this\n\t\t\t\twith a firearm with large damage dice like a musket, and even then only\n\t\t\t\tif I had Advantage. Raising the misfire chance becomes a problem\n\t\t\t\tquickly, so try to save this for when you have Advantage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Gunslinger Fighter Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Gunslinger runs on Dexterity, but you need some Wisdom for Grit Points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity is everything to the\n\tGunslinger.

A Wisdom increase is nice, but not strictly necessary. Since none of the firearms in the gunslinger PDF are &#8220;heavy&#8221;, small size isn&#8217;t an impediment.

Matt Mercer&#8217;s firearms no longer ignore armor and\n\t\tshields, but he chose to retain the misfire mechanic. This is essentially a\n\t\thandicap for firearms to prevent them from making other weapons obsolete.\n\t\tHowever, the Gunslinger&#8217;s subclass features make it easy to totally\n\t\tdisregard misfires by switching weapons or by quickly repairing your\n\t\tfirearms.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Reload<\/strong>: Reload is the most important weapon property for a\n\t\tfirearm. Skipping even one attack to reload means a significant loss of\n\t\tdamage output. You want a weapon that can fire numerous shots without\n\t\tneeding to stop to reload.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"choosing-a-firearm\">Choosing a Firearm<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of firearm is probably the most important character decision you&#8217;ll make, but fortunately it&#8217;s also the easiest to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Palm Pistol<\/span>: Apparently intended for\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting, the palm pistol&#8217;s single shot means that you can&#8217;t\n\t\treload it while performing two-weapon fighting. It had literally one job and\n\t\tit can&#8217;t even do that right.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pistol<\/span>: The go-to gunslinger weapon.\n\t\tReload 4 means that you can make several attacks without reloading or\n\t\tswapping pistols, and with a misfire chance of 1 it&#8217;s as safe as you can get\n\t\twith a firearm.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Musket<\/span>: Reload 1 means that you need to\n\t\treload after each shot. The musket&#8217;s d12 damage die can&#8217;t match the\n\t\tadditional damage you could get from making extra attacks with a pistol,\n\t\twhich makes it hard to justify a musket. However, the musket&#8217;s range is\n\t\texcellent, and with such a high damage due you may be able to deal big\n\t\tspikes of damage with Violent Shot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pepperbox<\/span>: A pistol with a larger number\n\t\tof shots, better range, and higher misfire chance. The price can be\n\t\tproblematically high, unfortunately, so switching between a set of\n\t\tpepperboxes can be prohibitively expensive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blunderbuss<\/span>: Previous incarnations of Matt\n\t\tMercer&#8217;s Gunslinger have had the Blunderbuss fire a cone effect (which is\n\t\thow the blunderbuss works in Pathfinder), but in the current incarnation\n\t\tit&#8217;s a musket with terrible range and very slightly more damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Bad News<\/span>: If I remember correctly, &#8220;Bad News&#8221; is a\n\t\tunique weapon made by a character in the Critical Roll podcast. I&#8217;m not sure\n\t\twhy it got an entry in the firearm table.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hand Mortar<\/span>: The possibility of AOE damage\n\t\tis interesting, the range is bad, the misfire chance is high, and there&#8217;s no\n\t\tlisted price.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Gunslinger Fighter Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Studded Leather<\/span>: You&#8217;re all about\n\t\tDexterity, which means light armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using a single pistol,\n\t\ta shield is a great idea.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Gunslinger Fighter Build &#8211; Variant Human Fighter (Gunslinger)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>BANG.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTE<\/strong>: I made an error in this build; Dual Weilder doesn&#8217;t apply to ranged weapons in the manner that I thought it did while I was writing (shame on my for not double-checking). Unfortunately, that invalidates much of the build. I&#8217;m working on corrections, but in the mean time talk to your DM and see if they might be willing to let you use Dual Weilder with tanged weapons. Offer to give up the +1 AC in exchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to shoot monsters? Do you want to shoot them <em>with a gun?<\/em> Here&#8217;s how you do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build is going to take advantage of every trick I can think of to deal as much damage as possible by shooting things with a gun. You&#8217;ll notice that almost none of it involves reloading; instead, we&#8217;ll assume that you have several loaded pistols at the beginning of each fight, and you&#8217;re switching them out whenever you run out of ammunition. At low levels, that means stowing a pistol (you wouldn&#8217;t want to drop it on the ground) at the end of a turn in which you run out of ammunition, but once you get Quickdraw you can switch pistols as one object interaction so you never finish a round without a gun in your hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The math between different fighting styles is fairly complicated here. Without running the numbers, I can&#8217;t definitively say which fighting style will net the most damage per round. So I&#8217;ll do the math comparing several build combinations of Fighting Style and our 1st-level feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>Fighting Style<\/th><th>Feat<\/th><th>Notes<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Two-Weapon Fighting<\/td><td>Dual Wielder<\/td><td>The obvious option for two-weapon fighting with guns, but until level three you&#8217;ll be running around with rapiers.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Archery<\/td><td>Dual Wielder<\/td><td>Accuracy may prove more important to your damage output than the bonus damage on the extra attack.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Archery<\/td><td>Sharpshooter<\/td><td>The best-equipped to use muskets, but we won&#8217;t because muskets are too heavy and require reloading too frequently for us to carry enough of them to avoid reloading in combat.

Ignoring levels 1 and 2 (before we get guns), builds 1 and 2 do the most damage until we get Extra Attack at 5th level. At this point, build 3 takes a small lead. When we take a feat at 8th level after maxing out Dexterity, builds 2 and 3 are identical, and they pull ahead of build 1. As we add more attacks, builds 2 and pull ahead of build 1 even further, illustrating just how ineffective Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting is for the fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build 4 notably stays behind the other builds in terms of damage output, but the additional AC from a shield may be worth the loss in DPR. Consider your role in the party; if you have a reliable tank in front of you, you might not need the extra AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We will assume the point buy abilities suggested above.
