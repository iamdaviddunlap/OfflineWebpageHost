And, while these options have always\n\tbeen both powerful and fun, they have also always been complicated. While 5th\n\tedition Dungeons and Dragons is the simplest edition to play, summoning spells\n\tin 5th edition remain a frustrating and confusing part of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore summoning spells not just from a character\n\toptimization perspective (how do I make this effective?), but also from a\n\tpractical perspective (how do I make this <em>fun<\/em>?) so that you can use\n\tsummoning spells at your table without constantly thumbing through the Monster\n\tManual for just the right creature to suit your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, this page may also serve as a quick reference document,\n\toffering suggestions for when and where you might summon any given type of\n\tcreature both to fit your surroundings (no underwater badgers, please) and to\n\tsuit your tactial needs.

I&#8217;m aware that &#8220;Conjure&#8221; and &#8220;Summon&#8221; are synonyms, but I\n\t\tdidn&#8217;t name the spells. Spells in this category always summon a single\n\t\tcreature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Other Summoning Spells<\/strong>: These summon options are typically\n\t\tmuch more involved and complex than the sort of spell which you&#8217;ll cast in\n\t\tcombat, and have many external considerations beyond conjuring up a creature\n\t\tto fight monsters for you. These spells include options like Find Steed and\n\t\tGate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjure-creature-spells\">Conjure Creature Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Published in the Player&#8217;s Handbook, the original Conjure Creature spells\n\tshared a lot of common design elements. Understanding one spell gives you a\n\tfull understanding of the rules of every other spell in this category. With an\n\thour-long duration, these spells are great ways to get a useful creature\n\teither in or out of combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Conjure Creature Spells can be upcast to improve their effects, but the\n\tbenefits are split into two camps: roughly half of the spells will allow you\n\tto summon higher-CR creatures, while the other half allow you to summon more\n\tcreatures from the same CR range which the default level of the spell allows.\n\tThese spells are usally paired, with one low-level spell to summon numerous\n\tsmall creatures and one higher-level spell to summon powerful single\n\tcreatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly every spell in this category has a 1-minute casting time (Conjure\n\tAnimals and Conjure Woodland Beings are exceptions), which makes them\n\timpossible to cast in combat. This casting time was an intentional design\n\tchoice to prevent players from breaking out the Monster Manual mid-combat,\n\tthereby causing combat to grind to a halt. This means that if you want to\n\tsummon a creature for combat purposes, you need to do it ahead of time. I\n\tdon&#8217;t know why Conjure Animals and Conjure Woodland Beings are exceptions\n\tsince they have the same issues with creature selection as every other spell\n\tin this category.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casting these spells at a higher spell level allows the spellcaster to summon\n\tcreatures of a higher Challenge Rating, allowing spellcasters access to a huge\n\tlist of potential summons. However, you don&#8217;t necessarily need to rush to cast\n\tthese spells at the highest level possible. Due to 5e&#8217;s relatively flat math,\n\teven low-CR creatures can be impactful across the full level range (though\n\ttheir hit points might not keep them around long).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the biggest problem with these spells is that the Dungeon Master is\n\tresponsible for selecting the specific creature which you summon. This is\n\toften time-consuming, and the DM needs to choose a creature that&#8217;s going to be\n\thelpful (but not too helpful), and likely wants to avoid upsetting their\n\tplayers by giving them something which they don&#8217;t want. The DM can let the\n\tplayer pick, but players will pick something that will cause problems\n\t(intentionally or otherwise), or they&#8217;ll spend the next hour of play time\n\tscrutinizing monster stats to figure out which thing they want to summon and\n\tfeed to the next monster they encounter, only to start fresh a few minutes\n\tlater.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing a fixed list of creatures to choose from would go a long way to\n\timprove these spells, but tragically only Conjure Animals includes such a\n\tlist, and even then the DM is left to decide which creatures appear with\n\tnearly no guidance on how to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"conjure-animals\" class=\"rating-green\">Conjure Animals (3rd level)<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beasts make surprisingly effective combatants, despite remaining primarily in\n\tlow single-digit CR ranges (dinosaurs being an exception). Many can serve as\n\tmounts, scouts, or trackers, but most often you&#8217;re going to summon animals to\n\ttake up space on the battle field. Some options (frog) are outright useless,\n\tbut even some CR 0 options like the Hyena and the Flying Snake can make decent\n\tcombatants. Higher-CR creatures will have more capabilities in combat and will\n\tbe more durable, but don&#8217;t make the mistake of ignoring low-CR options simply\n\tdue to their CR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upcasting Conjure Animals allows you to summon additional creatures. Conjure\n\tAnimals is one of the two spells in this category with a 1 Action casting\n\ttime. This is important because it allows you to summon creatures in the\n\tmiddle of combat. However, since Conjure Animals faces the same creature\n\tselection challenges that other spells in the category face, your DM needs to\n\tselect suitable creatures on the fly. I encourage you to use the table below\n\tfor quick reference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The table below is arranged to sort creatures roughly by habitat. I&#8217;m not a\n\tzoologist and my knowledge of animal habitats isn&#8217;t going to win me any\n\tprizes, so I won&#8217;t be offended if you disagree with me and\n\t<a href=\"mailt:RPGBOT@RPGBOT.net\">email me<\/a> with corrections. The added\n\tpresence of fictional creatures with scant or no ecological information (like\n\tthe giant weasel) doesn&#8217;t help, either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The table below has several gaps where there weren&#8217;t CR-appropriate creatures\n\tto for a given biome. In those cases, consider reskinning a creature from a\n\tdifferent biome. For example, if you&#8217;re in a coastal region and want to summon\n\tbirds, you could use stats for the Raven and call them seagulls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div

Each of these spells, rather than drawing upon a deep\n\tand growing pool of possible summoned creatures, provides a handful of generic\n\tstat blocks intended to represent a broad range of potential creatures. These\n\tstat blocks are diverse enough that Summon Creature Spells offer useful\n\ttactical options within the same spell, but any interaction with the Monster\n\tManual is totally removed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the spell level you use doesn&#8217;t determine the creatures available to you, it is still hugely impactful for Summon Creature Spells. Creatures add the spell level to their AC and damage, and the creature&#8217;s hit points are a multiple of the spell&#8217;s level (plus a flat number depending on the creature). Perhaps most impactful, the creatures make a number of attacks equal to half the spell&#8217;s level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that even-numbered spell slot levels are often the most efficient use of resources, and since creatures summoned by these spells attack with your Spell Attack Modifier, even low-level spell slots can produce a creature capable of hitting reliably. It also means that your summoned creature can often make a number of attacks matching the Fighter, possibly even exceeding their damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One problem which summoned creatures often face is that their attacks usually aren&#8217;t considered magic unless the Action specifies that they are or that the attack is specifically described as a Spell Attack (according <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2016\/07\/15\/does-a-magical-creature-attacks-count-as-magical\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeremy Crawford<\/a>). This means that creatures which rely on things like claws and teeth can run into issues with resistance or immunity to damage from non-magical attacks, which is a common resistance as you gain levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these cases, players will normally take up magic items or use spells to make their weapons magical, but spending spells to buff your summon is typically a bad use of resources and often runs into issues with Concentration. Instead, plan to replace your summoned creature if necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summoned creatures notably have no saving throw proficiencies. That makes\n\tthem highly susceptible to spells and special abilities, even if their AC and\n\thit points would normally make them very durable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Conjure Creature Spells, Summon Creature Spells have a 1-hour duration\n\tand require Concentration. Your summoned creature may not last the full\n\tduration, but a pet fighter for up to an hour is well worth the cost. Since\n\tthe summoned creature&#8217;s attacks will be reliable, it&#8217;s often a good idea to\n\tsummon a creature which attacks at range and keep them behind your party&#8217;s\n\tDefender (who is almost certianly more durable than your summoned creature)\n\tand think of them more like a portable source of damage output than a\n\ttemporary member of the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spells in this category also have an expensive material component, typically\n\tcosting several hundred gp. By the time you gain access to the spell you\n\tshould be able to comfortably afford the component, but if you rely heavily on\n\tsummoning the total cost of several of these components can be a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"summon-aberration\" class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Aberration (4th-level)<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Diverse, effective, and efficient combat options.

Of course, throwing a low-level aberration into melee\n\t\tto capitalize on its aura is likely going to result in your aberration dying\n\t\tquickly, but even then it&#8217;s drawing fire away from your allies and that&#8217;s\n\t\tone of the best things that you can get from a summoned creature.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"summon-beast\" class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Beast (2nd-level)<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The lowest-level Summon spell introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of everything,\n\tSummon Beast is an excellent spell.

However, it has several\n\tkey differences. You do not control the creature: you need to convince it to\n\tdo what you want with a Charisma check unless you can control it by other\n\tmeans like the spell Planar Binding. If you lose Concentration or choose to\n\tend the spell, the devil does not disappear: it gets 3d6 <em>minutes<\/em> to\n\tdo what it pleases. You can summon creatures one CR above the spell level that\n\tyou use, or possibly two if you have a specific devil&#8217;s talisman and summon\n\tthat devil (finding such a talisman is far beyond the scope of this\n\tarticle).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you do get to choose the type of devil which helps a great deal.\n\tThis allows you to select a devil with a low Insight bonus, increasing your\n\tchances of commanding it successfully. Your devil will still try to convine\n\tyou to make a pact with it, but you can basically ignore it. Let it pitch you\n\ttheir warlock power pyramid scheme or whatever, order them to kill stuff or\n\twhatever else you need, and hope that you come out on top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most limiting part of this spell is who can cast it. Warlock get\n\tit on their spell list, but can&#8217;t cast it past 5th level. Wizards also get it,\n\tbut won&#8217;t have the Charisma to make the Charisma checks to command the\n\tcreatures reliably. The spell itself is really good, but no one is good at\n\tcasting it. Your best bet is a bard who learned Infernal Caling using Magical\n\tSecrets.

This is a complicated, dangerous,\n\tunpredictable mechanical roulette wheel. If it works, you can get a powerful\n\tally for a duration long enough to complete an adventure or two. If it doesn&#8217;t\n\twork, you&#8217;ve wasted 1,000gp. Forewarned is forearmed. Learn the spell very\n\tcarefully before you cast it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planar Binding in appealing spelling on top of your other summoning spells\n\twhich allows you to extend the duration of your summoning spells from one hour\n\tto as much as a year and a day. On top of that, it gives you more control over\n\tthe summoned creature, allowing you better control over creatures like those\n\tsummoned with Infernal Calling and Summon Greater Demon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Planar Binding full of mechanical traps which are easy to overlook\n\tand which make the spells extremely difficult to rely upon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first challenge is picking a spell to use to summon your creature. This is more complex than you might think because you need to pick a spell where the creature remains even if you break Concentration. Once you start casting a spell with a casting time longer than 1 Action, you need to maintain Concentration on that spell, which forces you to break Concentration on anything else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a huge rules problem because not one of the published summoning spells (except Gate and Planar Ally) will keep the creature around long enough to finish casting Planar Binding. At this point, RAW, Planar Binding is unusable most summoning spells. Hopefully your DM will bend the rules a little to make this workable, otherwise the only options are Conjure Elemental or Conjure Fey, and I can&#8217;t imagine that WotC intended for a spell this complex to be so incredibly limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>might<\/em> be able to use Planar Ally here, but it&#8217;s not clear if the\n\tcreature will wait around while you cast Planar Binding so you may need to\n\tnegotiate and pay it to willingly be subject to Planar Binding, and that seems\n\tso laughably unlikely that I don&#8217;t think any creature intellectually capable\n\tof negotiating would say &#8220;sure, I&#8217;ll accept payment for one hour of standing\n\taround to then be your magical slave for up to a year.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you pick a spell, you need to find a place to perform the casting.\n\tYou&#8217;ll need to be somewhere safe for a long period of time (up to 2 hours most\n\tlikely) without interruptions that could break concentration like inclement\n\tweather or enemies attacking you. Wherever you cast the spell also sets the\n\tlocation to which the summoned creature will return when they&#8217;ve completed\n\ttheir current orders, so make it somewhere easy for you to get to. A permanent\n\tbase is an obvious choice, though not the only one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next you need to keep the target in place for the full 1-hour casting time of Planar Binding. Typical combat summon spells will have 1-hour durations, so you need to start casting Planar Binding immediately after you finish summoning the creature. That leaves no time for you to issue commands to the creature, and there&#8217;s room to argue that the duration of the summon spell ends on the turn before you finish casting Planar Binding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully your DM will be lenient enough to let you issue one command (&#8220;stand still&#8221;) and let the durations like up enough because if your DM doesn&#8217;t allow that to happen Planar Binding is unusable with any summoning spell short of Gate unless you can extend the duration by some other means.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic Circle is an important tool here. Creatures like demons and devils\n\taren&#8217;t obligated to follow your orders if they&#8217;re summoned with Infernal\n\tCalling or Summon Greater Demon, and using Magic Circle with its effects\n\treversed can keep the summoned creature inside for the duration. However, it\n\ttoo has a 1-hour duration and a one-minute casting time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you have help, you&#8217;ll need to cast Magic Circle at 4th level or higher\n\tto increase the duration. You&#8217;ll also need to avoid summoning a creature which\n\tcan teleport, and you&#8217;ll need a way to prevent the creature from attacking you\n\twhile you cast Planar Binding. They&#8217;ll be at Disadvantage, but a full hour is\n\t600 rounds and that&#8217;s plenty of time to shoot at you while you&#8217;re busy casting\n\tspells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to get some amount of cover without breaking line of sight, and stay at\n\tthe maximum range of 60 feet to stay out of range of things like breath\n\tweapons and other short-range abilities. Invisibility&#8217;s 1-hour duration will\n\tkeep you invisibile for most of the time you&#8217;ll be casting spells, though in\n\tyour best-case scenario it will expire one minute before you finish Planar\n\tBinding, at which point you&#8217;ll need to rely on whatever other countermeasures\n\tare in place (cover, mage armor, Magic Circle, etc.). Your best bet is to have\n\tanother ally handy who can refresh Invisibility for you, and to keep you and\n\tyour ally behind a sturdy wall with an arrow slit or a small observation\n\twindow through which you can maintain line of sight while benefiting from\n\tthree-quarters cover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have successfully set up countermeasures, summoned the creature, and\n\tcast Planar Binding, you need to get the creature to fail their saving throw.\n\tYour best bet is to summon a creature with poor Charisma saves (see my\n\taccompanying tables for summoning spells in this article, some of which\n\tspecify the creature&#8217;s Charisma saves when it&#8217;s relevant to that spell), but\n\tif you can you should also look for ways to hamper the creature&#8217;s save, though\n\tyou&#8217;ll need an ally to provide them unless you can do it yourself as a Bonus\n\tAction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mind Sliver will apply a -1d4 penalty, as will the spell Bane. Bestow Curse\n\tcan impose Disadvantage on the save, but since it&#8217;s permanent you may not want\n\tto go that route unless Planar Binding is going to make the summoning last\n\tlong enough that you can comfortably cast Remove Curse without it being a\n\tproblem. It&#8217;s hard to overstate how important it is to get this part of the\n\tspell right because if the creatures succeeds on their save you&#8217;ve spent a\n\tbunch of time and effort to set up and plan only to waste the 1,000gp material\n\tcomponent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did I mention the 1,000gp material component which the spell consumes? Yeah,\n\tthat&#8217;s a thing. It&#8217;s there to keep players from abusing this. Cast at 5th\n\tlevel, Planar Binding extends your summon&#8217;s duration to 24 hours (from the end\n\tof casting Planar Binding, not from the end of casting Summon Whatever), so\n\tyou&#8217;re spending 1,000gp to have an ornery pet for one day. That&#8217;s not worth\n\tthe price. If you go to the trouble to use Planar Binding, I recommend using\n\tat least a 7th-level spell slot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, you have your creature summoned and Planar Binding is in\n\teffect. Let&#8217;s discuss what happens and how things work at this stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, Concentration is gone. You broke Concentration when you started\n\tcasting Planar Binding, so you&#8217;re free to go back to concentrating on other\n\tstuff like summoning other creatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the method to control your summoned creature is determined entirely\n\tby Planar Binding. Creatures will follow verbal orders, but if they&#8217;re hostile\n\tto you (and many will be when you break Concentration on the spell which\n\tsummoned them), they&#8217;re going to be a pain about it. Think &#8220;malicious\n\tcompliance&#8221;. The best way to handle it is to give specific but concise orders,\n\tbut be concious of obvious loopholes. &#8220;Kill that creature as quickly as\n\tpossible&#8221; might lead your summoned creature to collapse your house on top of\n\tthe creature because it&#8217;s marginally faster than stabbing them repeatedly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve read all of that, compare the text it took me to clarify the\n\texact workings of Planar Ally to the length of the text of the spell. That is\n\thow much complexity it buried here. Again: forewarned is forearmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"spirit-of-death\" class=\"rating-green\">Spirit of Death (4th level)<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spirit of Death is a good summon spell, but lacks the diverse options of other summon spells.

The Chasme&#8217;s primary appeal is Drone,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut a DC 12 Constitution save is unlikely to work with any sort of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconsistency. Try to drop the Chasme into a crowd of enemies and hope\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou get lucky. The Chasme may also be useful against enemies with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRegeneration because reducing their hit point maximum prevents them\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom regaining those hit points.\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/vrock\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vrock<\/a>: Charisma save bonus: -1.
