They fight very much like a spellcaster, relying primarily on named features that scale very similarly to heightening spells. However, unlike a spellcaster, they have no limited resource like spell slots of Focus Points. The Kineticist&#8217;s powers are truly bottomless, making them fantastic at persisting through long adventuring days. Even better, their options are diverse enough that they can fill nearly any role within a party (short of some skill-based roles, which they can still fill with some sacrifices). The Kineticist&#8217;s most natural roles are as a Blaster and a Striker, but depending on options they can easily expand into Controller, Support, and can dabble as a Healer and a Scout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t get a subclass as a Kineticist. Instead, you choose one or more &#8220;kinetic elements&#8221;. Initially this comes from the Kinetic Gate feature, allowing you to choose between a single element or two elements, immediately allowing you to choose between specialization and diversification. Every 4 levels thereafter, Gate&#8217;s Threshold allows you to expand upon this choice, allowing you to again choose between specializing in your previously-selected element(s) or diversifying into a new element. This allows your Kineticist to exist on a sliding scale between specializing in a single element or diversifying into all 6 by level 17.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The class also exists in an interesting place in the real-world history of Pathfinder. Rage of Elements is the first major supplement published following the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/copy-left-ogl-2-meets-the-orc-rpgbot-masterclass-s3e5\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"16878\">2023 OGL Controversy<\/a>, and following the &#8220;Pathfinder Remaster&#8221; announcement which occurred in the wake of the controversy. The text of Rage of Elements was written to be fully compatible with the updated rules text in the remaster, which hasn&#8217;t yet been published, though Paizo has shared a <a href=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinder\/corepreview\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinder\/corepreview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">preview PDF<\/a> to fill that gap. As such, some of the rules terms in our support for the Kineticist may feel unfamiliar, but we&#8217;ll do our best to also note the pre-remaster terminology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to also read our other supporting articles for the Kineticist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/kineticist\/ancestries-and-heritages\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"19363\">Kineticist Ancestry and Heritages Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/kineticist\/class-feats\/\" data-type=\"page\">Kineticist Class Feats Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Kineticist Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#attributes\">Kineticist Attributes (Ability Scores)<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#typical-kineticist-attributes\">Typical Kineticist Attributes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armored-kineticist-attributes\">Armored Kineticist Attributes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Kineticist Ancestries and Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Kineticist Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Kineticist Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-skill-feats\">General Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Kineticist Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Kineticist Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Kineticist Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclass-archetype\">Kineticist Multiclass Archetype<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

This gives you decent hit points despite only 8+ hp per level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: Despite only 8+hp, you should have decent hit points thanks your Key Ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Kineticist&#8217;s most important proficiencies are good,\nbut you basically can&#8217;t use weapons and your Perception and Will saves leave defensive gaps.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Among the worst progressions in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Fantastic Fortitude saves, decent Reflex saves, absolute garbage Will saves. Don&#8217;t dump Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+Int is standard, but with no dependency on Intelligence you&#8217;re not likely to have a ton of skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: Only Simple weapons, and you never go past Expert. But it really doesn&#8217;t matter; if you&#8217;re attacking with a weapon, something has gone horrendously wrong.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Only light armor, but your proficiency progression is decent. If you&#8217;re worried about AC, look at one of the Impulses that give you armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: The Kineticist&#8217;s Class DC follows the same progression as full casters like the Wizard. You can also get a magic item to get an Item Bonus to your attacks, but that won&#8217;t impact your Class DC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Kinetic Gate<\/span>: Your first major decision point within the class, and you immediately get to choose between specialization and diversification. You&#8217;ll also get two Impulse Feats based on your decision here. Keep in mind that if you later use Gate&#8217;s Threshold to Expand the Gate, you can choose an Impulse Junction, so you&#8217;re not locked out of Impulse Junctions if you opt for Dual Gate at level 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Single Gate<\/span>: Specializing in a single gate means that you also get an Impulse Junction at 1st level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impulse Junctions activate when you use an Impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 Actions or more. This excludes the 1-Action version of Elemental Blast and any Stance Impulse, but the 2-Action version of Elemental Blast and many other Impulse options will trigger your Impulse Junction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You only get one Impulse Junction per round, so you don&#8217;t get to trigger two Impulse Junctions by using a Composite Impulse. In fact, Composite Impulses aren&#8217;t addressed at all, so it&#8217;s not perfectly clear how they work with Impulse Junctions. I think the intent is that you can choose either element, but watch for Errata in case I&#8217;m horribly wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air<\/span>: Free movement before or after you use the Impulse is fantastic, allowing you to move into position to better use your Impulse without spending another Action to Step or Stride. If you&#8217;re built to fight at range, the free Step is a great way to get out of melee in order to avoid provoking Reactions. Remember that most Ancestries have 25-foot speed, so getting a permanent +5 speed bonus (such as from the Fleet General Feat) will improve your half-Stride by a full square. Also consider a wand of Longstrider.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Earth<\/span>: More AC is always nice, but it doesn&#8217;t stack with a shield, cover, or many other common AC bonuses. Still, Earth doesn&#8217;t get an armor impulse <\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire<\/span>: Not super exciting, but consistently useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Metal<\/span>: Fantastic for melee builds. Looks for ways to pad your durability while still allowing yourself to be hit (Shield Block, temporary hit points, etc.) and go looking for trouble. For ranged builds, this is largely useless.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Water<\/span>: Fantastic if you have ongoing area effects and can force enemies into somewhere dangerous, but remember that you can also use this on allies to do things like pull them out of a grapple.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wood<\/span>: A big pad of temporary hit points, but since the duration is so short the incentive is clearly to refresh the temporary hp every turn. This is great for a melee build, but ranged builds likely won&#8217;t need the temporary hp often enough to make this feel meaningful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dual Gate<\/span>: Two elements at first level means that your Elemental Blast and your other Impulses are much less likely to be ground to a halt by creatures who resist your favorite element.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Kinetic Aura<\/span>: Managing your Kinetic Aura is a central, crucial part of playing a Kineticist because <em>&#8220;You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element&#8221;<\/em>. You essentially can&#8217;t function while your aura is down, so if you start combat with your aura down, your first order of business is almost always to get your aura running. Fortunately, the Channel Elements also allows you to use a Stance or a Elemental  Blast in the same Action, so it&#8217;s barely an inconvenience. Even so, if it makes sense to keep your aura going outside of combat there&#8217;s little reason not to do so beyond the need to hide by not having a sphere of magical nonsense running all the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its base form, the aura is essentially a chore with a fun cosmetic effect. But depending on your choices of Class Feats, you can add several exciting effects to your aura. Some of these are harmful (ongoing damage, etc.), while others are helpful, allowing you to build an aura that suits your play style. If you plan to go this route, be sure to take Safe Elements so that you can exclude targets from the aura&#8217;s effects in order to avoid harming allies and\/or buffing enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the feats which modify your Aura will be Stance feats. Accoridng to the Stance trait, &#8220;A stance lasts&#8230; until its requirements (if any) are violated.&#8221; Frustratingly, the Kineticist&#8217;s Stance feats all omit requirements for the feat. They do have the Impulse trait, which means that they can only be <em>activated<\/em> when your aura is running, but RAW it appears that your stance doesn&#8217;t end when your aura does. It&#8217;s possible that you can resume your aura, use the Action to make a Elemental Blast, and keep your prior stance running.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also modify your Kinetic Aura with Aura Junctions when you get the Gate&#8217;s Threshold feature at level 5 and every 4 levels thereafter. Aura Junctions include cool stuff like imposing weakness to fire damage from your fire impulses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While your Kinetic Aura will generally stay running throughout combat, Impulses with the Overflow trait will end the aura. These Impulses are frequently powerful burts like Hail of Splinters or Walk Through the Conflagration. Remember that you can&#8217;t use other impulses while your aura is down, so getting it back up as fast as possible is important. If you plan to use Overflow Impulses, it may be wise to avoid feats which add effects to your aura since the two groups of options will be perpetually opposed to one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impulses<\/span>: Impulses are your not-spells, and they&#8217;re the Kineticist&#8217;s central mechanic. They work a lot like spells, and things that resist spells also resist impulses, but they&#8217;re not spells. They automatically improve as you gain levels in the same way that cantrips do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you do get Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis for free, the majority of your Impulses come from class feats, so be sure to see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/kineticist\/class-feats\/\">Kineticist Class Feats Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if Impulses can be counterspelled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Blast<\/span>: Your go-to offensive options, Elemental Blast is versatile and remains useful for your whole career. However, other Impulse options will frequently deal considerably more damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elemental Blast&#8217;s damage does leave something to be desired; 1d6 or 1d8 damage with no modifier isn&#8217;t impressive even at low levels, but by using the 2-Action version you can add your Constitution modifier to the damage. You can also dive into melee to get Strength added to the damage, but be sure that you&#8217;re built to survive that tactic. You add damage dice every four levels, which is faster than martial characters will add Striking Runes, so at high levels your Elemental Blast may actually outpace a comparable weapon user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pick up the Versatile Blasts feat, you add a third damage type to each of your chosen elements. Two-Element Infusion allows you to combine the benefits of two elements, potentially allowing you to get a favorable damage type, the larger d8 damage die, and 60-foot range all on one blast. You can further modify your Elemental Blast with feats like Weapon Infusion and Chain Infusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Air<\/span>: Good range, and resistance to both damage types on the same creature is rare, but the damage die is small.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Earth<\/span>: Short range, and two physical damage types. Creatures with resistance to one physical damage type often resist all physical damage, which means that having these two damage types is rarely an improvement over having just one of them.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire<\/span>: Good range, but small damage die, and only one damage type option. Fire resistance\/immunity are common, so you may struggle unless you rely heavily on Extract Element.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Metal<\/span>: Short range, and two physical damage types. Creatures with resistance to one physical damage type often resist all physical damage, which means that having these two damage types is rarely an improvement over having just one of them.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Water<\/span>: Easiest to compare to Air. Water has shorter range and Cold resistance is more common than Electricity resistance, but Water gets a slightly larger damage die.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wood<\/span>: Vitality damage only affects undead, which makes this only situationally useful. The larger damage die is nice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Kinesis<\/span>: Ignore the laws of conservation of matter and will your element(s) in and out of existence. It&#8217;s hard to comprehensively describe everything you could do with this because it&#8217;s just so incredibly open-ended. At low levels you&#8217;ll do things like create small piles of sand or fill a waterskin with water, but as you gain levels and the Bulk limit increases you can do things like fill barrels of water while traveling through deserts or create pockets of breathable air while exploring the depths of the ocean. Unfortunately, because the specific effects and the nature of Bulk are intentionally vague, your GM may also limit the feature&#8217;s usefulness by interpreting its effects in a restrictive manner. Your GM might not like you creating 4-Bulk rocks directly above your enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extract Element<\/span>: Against small numbers of enemies, this makes element damage considerably more reliable. The resistance for creatures that are normally immune is good, but not so much that you can&#8217;t still damage them with your more powerful Impulse options, though switching elements is still a better idea if you can do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against crowds, you won&#8217;t have enough Actions to justify spreading this around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gate&#8217;s Threshold<\/span>: A major decision point in your build, plus you get a few extra Class Feats as you gain levels. Just as with Kinetic Gate at level 1, you choose between specialization (Expand the Portal) and Diversification (Fork the Path).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Expand the Portal<\/span>: Specializing in a previously-selected element gets you access to Gate Junctions (including Impulse Junctions), which add additional effects to your existing Impulses in addition to giving you another Impulse Feat. This allows you to focus more on specific tactics, such as using your Kinetic Aura for hit-and-run tactics with Air or to get even more damage out of fire impulses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gate Junctions<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><strong>Air<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Critical Blast<\/span>: Great for\n\t\t\t\trepositioning enemies, but that&#8217;s not always impactful. Ideally you can\n\t\t\t\tpush enemies into position so that you can hit more targets with an area\n\t\t\t\teffect, or you push an enemy away from you or another squishy ally.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Resistance (Air)<\/span>: Rare.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Resistance (Electricity)<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\tFairly common.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura Junction<\/span>: A 10-foot speed bonus\n\t\t\t\tcan be a big tactical advantage if you&#8217;re lining up area effects or if\n\t\t\t\tyou need to move to flank. Combined with Air&#8217;s Gate Junction, a 10-foot\n\t\t\t\tspeed bonus means that your half-Stride gets another square of movement.\n\t\t\t\tBut that one or two squares isn&#8217;t always impactful, and you can get the\n\t\t\t\tsame speed bonus from a Longstrider wand.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Junction<\/span>: Experienced Smuggler is\n\t\t\t\textremely situational.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Impulse Junction<\/span>: See Kinetic Gate,\n\t\t\t\tabove.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><strong>Earth<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Critical Blast<\/span>: Knocking foes Prone\n\t\t\t\tis always great, but forcing flying enemies to fall just 20 feet likely\n\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t be enough to get them on the ground.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Resistance (Earth)<\/span>: Rare.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Resistance (Poison)<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\tExtremely common.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura Junction<\/span>: Great if you want to\n\t\t\t\tforce enemies to remain melee with you.

Remember that it uses the normal rules for retraining, so you need to select an Impulse that&#8217;s of the same or lower level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also impotant: you cannot replace Composite Impulses via the Reflow Elements feature, so if you need to replace one you&#8217;ll need to use the normal rules for retraining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Double Reflow<\/span>: Changing Impulses likely won&#8217;t be something that you do every day, so doing it twice per day is rarely an improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Gate<\/span>: This takes a little examination to decipher exactly what it does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, and only if, your Kinetic Aura is down at the beginning of your turn, you can Channel Elements as a Free Action. Channel Elements allows you to make a 1-Acton Elemental Blast or activate a Stance Impulse. This means that for you can make an Elemental Blast or activate a Stance as a Free Action at the beginning of your turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maximize the benefits here, you want to have your aura turned off between turns, which means using Overflow Impulses frequently. If you depend on your aura&#8217;s benefits outside of your turn, you&#8217;ll likely only use this feature at the beginning of combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many classes get a 20th-level feat which gives you an extra Action which you can only use for specific things. Kineticists get Kinetic Pinnacle, which also allows you to use Channel Elements, Elemental Blast, or activate a Stance. If you take the feat, you can reasonably use 5 Actions in a turn every single turn without resorting to things like Haste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attributes\">Kineticist Attributes (Ability Scores)<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"typical-kineticist-attributes\">Typical Kineticist Attributes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Constitution and Constitution accessories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: If you plan to fight in melee, you want a bit of Strength to add to your Elemental Blast and potentially for combat maneuvers like Shove.
