Replicate Magic Item is the only one that can be selected more than once, so expect to skip some other infusion options to get Replicate Magic multiple times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Several of the infusions apply to existing weapons or armor. Because you must infuse a non-magical item, you can&#8217;t stack infusions on the same item, and the effects won&#8217;t stack with spells like Magic Weapon or Elemental Weapon because those spells all affect target &#8220;nonmagic weapon&#8221; and make it a magic weapon. Each infusion which applies to an existing item also specifies that it makes the item magical.

If you take this, consider delaying until you get Extra Attack\n\t\t(provided that your subclass grants it). If you dumped Strength I wouldn&#8217;t\n\t\tbother with this. Your Intelligence bonus will help, but it&#8217;s not enough to\n\t\tmake your 8 Strength not a problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhanced Arcane Focus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Bonuses to spell attacks are very hard to find, and when you can get them\n\t\tthey are absolutely fantastic. If you have a full caster in the party who\n\t\tcan use rods, staffs, or wands as focuses (sorcerer, etc.), it&#8217;s probably a\n\t\tgood idea to hand this to them, but I certainly don&#8217;t blame you for keeping\n\t\tit for yourself, especially if you&#8217;re an alchemist or artillerist.\n\t\t<p>The Battle Smith can benefit from this via their Steel Defender. Your\n\t\t\tdefender uses your spell attack modifier, so an Enhanced Arcane Focus will\n\t\t\timprove your defender&#8217;s attacks.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhanced Defense<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: +1 or +2 AC doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but in 5e&#8217;s bounded math it&#8217;s a\n\t\tsignificant buff at any level in 5e. This Infusion is one of the ways that\n\t\tthe Artificer achieves the insanely high AC for which they&#8217;re often\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhanced Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: +X weapons are excellent in a game where the maximum normal attack bonus\n\t\tis only +11, but you may get more use out of other options. If you just want\n\t\ta +1 weapon, you can always cast Magic Weapon for the same effect, though\n\t\twhen the bonus increases to +2 you may not want to spend the spell slots to\n\t\tkeep a +2 weapon running for an hour per casting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Homunculus Servant<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Homunculus Servant has seen a lot of changes, first from the Unearthed\n\t\tArcana version to the Eberron version, and then to the Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of\n\t\tEverything version. After all of those design changes, I think WotC got it\n\t\tright this time.\n\t\t<p>The Homunculus Servant is, in many ways, similar to a familiar. It&#8217;s tiny\n\t\t\tand extremely frail, but can make an excellent assistant and can serve as\n\t\t\ta Scout. While it is intelligent and understands languages that you speak,\n\t\t\tit can&#8217;t communicate verbally and you can&#8217;t share its senses, so your\n\t\t\tfamiliar must resort to other means of communication like pantomime or\n\t\t\tpossibly writing, thought it only explicitly <em>understands<\/em> languages. Like a familiar, your homunculus can deliver spells with\n\t\t\ta range of touch, allowing you to to more easily target allies with buffs\n\t\t\tand healing. I recommend avoiding using your homunculus to deliver\n\t\t\toffensive spells since its AC and hp are so poor.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The humunculus distinguishes itself from familiars in a few very\n\t\t\tmeaningful ways. First, where a familiar has just 1 hit point, your\n\t\t\thomunculus will have up to 26 hp depending on your level. Second, your\n\t\t\tfamiliar has a built-in ranged attack, allowing it to deal force damage.\n\t\t\tSince you command your homunculus as a Bonus Action (another difference\n\t\t\tfrom familiars), you&#8217;re effectively converting your Bonus Action into\n\t\t\tdamage. Your homunculus also doesn&#8217;t share a familiar&#8217;s action\n\t\t\tlimitations. They&#8217;re capable of performing any action which a normal\n\t\t\tcreature could take, allowing them to be more flexible and useful. They\n\t\t\tmay even be able to use items, including magic ones.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Also note that the 100gp initial cost may be too much to pay at low\n\t\t\tlevels, so you may need to return to Homunculus Servant later when you&#8217;ve\n\t\t\tcollected some more treasure.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mind Sharpener<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Many artificers will scoff at this, and lean toward Enhanced Armor\n\t\tinstead, but this is absolutely worth consideration. Artificers have a lot\n\t\tof really good buffs which require Concentration, and while they do get\n\t\tProficiency in Constitution saves that&#8217;s still a gamble. For artificers who\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need a ton of AC (maybe you&#8217;re relying on your more durable allies\n\t\tinstead), this can be good insurance. You could also share this with other\n\t\tspellcasters in your party who likely also have excellent Concentration\n\t\tspells and likely do not have proficiency with Constitution saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Repeating Shot<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: This makes crossbows and firearms viable options for ranged builds that\n\t\tdon&#8217;t include Crossbow Expert. Once you get Extra Attack, crossbows and\n\t\tfirearms typically become undesireable due to the Loading property. Battle\n\t\tSmiths can use either a heavy crossbow or a rifle and still make two attacks\n\t\tonce they get Extra Attack at 5th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Replicate Magic Item<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: This is probably the best Infusion option at any level, but it&#8217;s not so\n\t\tgood that I recommend spending all of your Infusion slots on it. Because the\n\t\tlist of item options is so long I moved them to their own section. See\n\t\t&#8220;Replicate Magic Item&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Returning Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Until you hit level 10 this is strictly better than Enhanced Weapon, but\n\t\teven once you hit level 10 it&#8217;s still really good. It only works on weapons\n\t\twith the thrown property like spears, unfortunately, so it&#8217;s best used on an\n\t\tally&#8217;s weapon or on your own dagger so you never need to switch between a\n\t\tcrossbow and melee weapon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infusions-6\">6th-Level Artificer Infusions<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Boots of the Winding Path<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Teleportation is great, but you can only use these to return to a space\n\t\twhich you previously occupied in the same turn. That&#8217;s fine for hit-and-run\n\t\ttactics, but that&#8217;s the only common case where you would use this. Melee\n\t\tartificers can combine this with Booming Blade to help keep enemies locked\n\t\tin place, which is tempting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Radiant Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: A nice defensive mechanism and a small buff to a weapon. If whoever\n\t\tcarries this is using weapons constantly, they may prefer Advanced Weapon\n\t\tonce the bonus increases to +2, but from levels 6 through 11 this is\n\t\tstrictly better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Repulsion Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Interesting, but unreliable. 5e&#8217;s movement rules are really gentle, so\n\t\tyou may find yourself pushing an enemy away after their first attack only to\n\t\twatch them walk right back up to you and finish attacking. However, if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re already using Enhance Defense on your armor and you still want more\n\t\tAC you may enjoy Repulsion Shield. The Repulsion Shield can also break\n\t\tgrapples, which is nice since few artificers good at acrobatics or athletics.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resistant Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: This allows you to get resistance to psychic, necrotic, and radiant\n\t\tdamage. Resistances to these damage types are almost nonexistent. Throw this\n\t\ton a bear totem barbarian and they&#8217;re nearly unstoppable. However, since you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t put more than one Infusion on the same item, you&#8217;re likely choosing\n\t\tbetween this and Enhanced Defense for your own suit of armor. If you still\n\t\twant the AC bonus from Enhanced Defense, stick it on a shield. Remember that\n\t\tAbsorb Elements is on your spell list, so you can use it to reliably provide\n\t\tresistance to common damage types, though you&#8217;ll still need Resistant Armor\n\t\tfor less common ones like Psychic and Necrotic damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell-Refueling Ring<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: More spell slots are always welcome. At a glance, this looks just like\n\t\tthe effects of a Pearl of Power, but the wording is different in a very\n\t\timportant way. You can&#8217;t use Spell-Refueling Ring to regain a spell slot\n\t\tabove 3rd level, and if you don&#8217;t have spells slots of 3rd level or lower,\n\t\tthis doesn&#8217;t do anything. This means that this item very specifically does\n\t\tnot allow warlocks to regain a spell slot if they&#8217;re above level 6.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infusions-10\">10th-Level Artificer Infusions<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Helm of Awareness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Bonuses to Initiative are hard to find. Advantage on Intitiative is even\n\t\tharder (unless you&#8217;re running Enhance Ability (Dexterity) all the time). Put\n\t\tthis on the whichever character in your party is best at area control spells\n\t\tso that they can get control of the battlefield before the fight gets going.\n\t\tAlternatively, if you have an assassin in the party they&#8217;ll be very happy to\n\t\thave this so that they can reliably use Assassinate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infusions-14\">14th-Level Artificer Infusions<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Propulsion Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Basically Arcane Propulsion Arm (see below) but as full-body suit of\n\t\tarmor. The biggest added benefits are +5 ft. speed and that the armor can&#8217;t\n\t\tbe removed by force. You do get two gauntlets, but you can&#8217;t use the\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting rules with them because you&#8217;re not &#8220;holding&#8221; the\n\t\tgauntlets.\n\t\t<p>I&#8217;m not sure who this is for. The Armorer already gets similar benefits\n\t\t\tfrom Arcane Armor, and without the ability to use this with two-weapon\n\t\t\tfighting there&#8217;s basically no benefit ove ra propulsion arm unless the\n\t\t\twearer is missing several limbs.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"replicate-magic-item\">Replicate Magic Item<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The list of items which you can replicate via artificer infusions is versatile and grows as you gain levels, but keep in mind that when you take this Infusion your are <em>permanently<\/em> locked into whichever magic item you choose unless you retrain your Infuse Item choice. You&#8217;re free to select Replicate Magic Item again and change the item, but you can only retrain one Infusion each time you gain a level, so that&#8217;s a very limited option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"replicate-magic-item-common\">Common Magic Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The vast majority of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/common-magic-items\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Common Magic Items<\/a> are amusing novelties. I&#8217;ve chosen to list a handful of options below if they offer some real, meaningful reason why you might choose to use Replicate Magic Item to create one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Cast-Off Armor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: The wealth by level curve in 5e makes it difficult to afford full plate armor before level 5 or 6. Infusing cast-off armor via Replicate Magic Item allows you to create a suit of full plate at no further cost. Of course, Enhance Armor on Slint armor will get the same AC, but you can only do that once. If you need more armor, this will get you a second suit of AC 18 armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Clockwork Amulet<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Guaranteeing a 10 on an attack roll is frequently enough to hit. I don&#8217;t\n\t\tknow if once per day is enough to justify the item, though.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Hat of Vermin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Grab the animal and toss it into room which you suspect might contain\n\t\ttraps.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Moon-Touched Sword<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Before you have easy access to permanent (or infused) magic weapons, this\n\t\toffers a way to handle enemies with resistance to damage from non-magical\n\t\tweapons. Unfortunately, it can only be a sword.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Mystery Key<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Oh no, my magic key disappeared when it opened this lock. Oh well, I\n\t\tguess I&#8217;ll make a new one tomorrow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Perfume of Bewitching<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Enhance Ability (Charisma) will do the same thing and more, but you get\n\t\taccess to this a level earlier and it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Pot of Awakening<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s hard for a busy adventurer to commit one of their limited infusions\n\t\tto an item which does nothing until 30 days pass. But if you have long\n\t\tperiods of downtime between adventures, you might amass a small collection\n\t\tof friendly shrubs. Keep in mind that they take no actions unless you\n\t\tcommand them, so be sure to command them to replant themselves after they\n\t\tbreak out of the pot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Ruby of the War Mage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: A good item all around for other martial spellcasters, though\n\t\tgenerally unnecessary for the Artificer. For most martial spellcasters, this\n\t\treduces the need to juggle weapons and material components when casting\n\t\tspells. Unfortunately typical spellcasters still need a free hand to cast\n\t\tspells which have Somatic components but don&#8217;t require Material components,\n\t\tso they still need a free hand for Absorb Elements and Shield. The\n\t\tArtificer&#8217;s Tools Required feature adds a Material component to all of their\n\t\tspells, so having any Infused item (or qualifying tool) in hand allows you\n\t\tto perform Somatic components for all of your spells with that hand, even if\n\t\tthey don&#8217;t normally require a Material component.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spellwrought Tattoo<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Cantrips and 1st-level spell tattoos are Common items. The tattoo only\n\t\tworks once, similar to a potion or a spell scroll, but you can&#8217;t create\n\t\teither of those with Infusions.\n\t\t<p>This is great if you have non-spellcasters in the party. Give them things\n\t\t\tlike Healing Word in case your party&#8217;s other healers are all down, or\n\t\t\tbuffs which require Concentration since they weren&#8217;t concentrating on\n\t\t\tanything before. You can even cast spells like Find Familiar with the\n\t\t\ttattoo, allowing your party to collect an entire parliament of owls\n\t\t\t(that&#8217;s what a group of owls it called, I checked). You don&#8217;t even need to\n\t\t\tspend the 10gp material component cost!<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Avoid most offensive spells since the attacks and save DC are fixed and\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t scale as you gain levels and face tougher opponents, but you can\n\t\t\tmake spells like Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade work because they\n\t\t\trely on a weapon attack by the caster instead of a spell attack.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The rules are silent on what spells can go into the tattoo. Your DM might\n\t\t\timpose a requirement that you can only create spellwrought tattoos for\n\t\t\tspells which you know how to cast, which seems like a perfectly reasonable\n\t\t\trestriction on what is otherwise a serious abuse case.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Unbreakable Arrow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Allows you to bypass resistance to weapon damage from nonmagical weapons.\n\t\tTragically, infusing this only gets you one arrow, but at least you can\n\t\trecover it and use it again in the next encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Walloping Ammunition<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Allows you to bypass resistance to weapon damage from nonmagical weapons,\n\t\tand has the added benefit of possibly knocking the target prone.

Between the beer, honey,\n\t\tmayonnaise, fresh water, and wine you may be able to sustain a creature or\n\t\ttwo without food for extended periods (though I can&#8217;t imagine enjoying the\n\t\texperience). The daily acid is enough to fully fill two vials, getting you\n\t\ttwo 25 gp items daily if you can provide the 1 gp vial (How does 4 ounces of\n\t\tliquid in a glass container result in a 1-pound vial of acid? I have no\n\t\tidea!). Even silly things like producing 5 total gallons of alcohol and\n\t\tusing them to get NPCs drunk can let you get away with all sorts of stuff.\n\t\tNeed to clean a crime scene? Vinegar. Need to drass a salad? Oil\n\t\t<em>and<\/em> vinegar. Tragically, you do need 8 days worth of poison to fill\n\t\ta vial, so don&#8217;t expect that to be a reliable contributor to your daily\n\t\toptions. Also, expect to invest in a huge number of containers and somewhere\n\t\tto put them (like a Bag of Holding) so that you can stockpile the daily\n\t\toutput of the Alchemy Jug for later emergencies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Armblade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW<\/a><\/sup>: This was removed by errata. It&#8217;s fine, it was a bad choice anyway.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bag of Holding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: If you can&#8217;t find a clever way to make use of a Bag of Holding, you&#8217;re\n\t\tnot trying hard enough. The fact that you get to recreate this every day\n\t\tmakes it even better because the threat of the bag breaking is greatly\n\t\tdiminished, and if you intentionally turn your bag into a bomb it&#8217;s not a\n\t\tproblem because you&#8217;ll make a new one tomorrow.\n\t\t<p>Replicate Magic Item is the only Infusion which you can learn more than\n\t\t\tonce, and there&#8217;s no restriction on creating the sime item more than once.\n\t\t\tThis means that you can create multiple bags of holding and turn them into\n\t\t\tsingle-use bombs. It&#8217;s not totally clear if WotC intended for artificers\n\t\t\tto be able to replicate the same item multiple times, but it appears to\n\t\t\twork RAW.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cap of Water Breathing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design, and Water Breathing is on your spell list so once\n\t\tyou get 3rd-level spells at level 9 this becomes obsolete. It&#8217;s also made\n\t\tobsolete by better items like the Cloak of the Manta Ray and Necklace of\n\t\tAdaptation. My point is: don&#8217;t get attached to the idea of wearing a magical\n\t\tfish bowl on your head, Mysterio.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Goggles of Night<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Useful, but hardly essential. Darkvision is on the Artificer&#8217;s spell\n\t\tlist, and has an 8-hour duration, easily allowing you to cover a long day of\n\t\tadventuring on one or two spell slots per target. Unfortunately you don&#8217;t\n\t\tget 2nd-level spells until 5th level, so there will be a brief period where\n\t\tthis is your only way to provide Darkvision beyond your own racial\n\t\ttraits.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Prosthetic Limb<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: This was removed by from the 2nd-level items list by errata because\n\t\tProsthetic Limbs are now Common magic items and can therefore be created as\n\t\tInfusions using Replicate Magic Item.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rope of Climbing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A fine low-level option for addressing problems commonly solved by\n\t\tflight. If you take this, expect to replace it as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sending Stones<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Long-range communication like this can be extremely helpful if you have\n\t\tsomeone worth talking to like a benefactor or a well-informed friendly\n\t\tNPC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wand of Magic Detection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Detect Magic is on your spell list and you can cast it as a Ritual.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wand of Secrets<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, and your party can replace it by having proficiencies in\n\t\tInvestigation and Perception which any adventuring party needs anyway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"replicate-magic-item-6\">6th-Level Replicatable Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Boots of Elvenkind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Given the choice between this and the Cloak of Elvenkind, the cloak is\n\t\tbetter. These are still good, but the cloak is still better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Elvenkind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Not only do other creatures suffer Disadvantage to see you, but you gain\n\t\tAdvantage on checks to hide. Just the raw math on that puts the wearer at a\n\t\thuge advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloak of the Manta Ray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design, and unless you&#8217;re doing enough exploring\n\t\tunderwater to need this frequently it&#8217;s going to become obsolete as soon as\n\t\tyou hit level 9 and you can cast Water Breathing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Eyes of Charming<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: The DC is just 13, which is in no way reliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gloves of Thievery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: +5 is a significant bonus, and picking locks is common in many campaigns.\n\t\tYou get proficiency with Thieve&#8217;s Tools, so you&#8217;re likely to use these\n\t\tyourself rather than handing them off to a rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lantern of Revealing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: You can cast See Invisibility, but that only affects yourself and oncey\n\t\tyou detect invisible creatures you may still need your party&#8217;s help dealing\n\t\twith them. The Lantern of Revealing provides a reliable way to do this with\n\t\tan impressively long duration. Just be sure to keep plenty of oil on hand.\n\t\tEven an Alchemy Jug can only produce enough to keep the lantern lit for 12\n\t\thours a day, so either stockpile out when you&#8217;re not adventuring or spend\n\t\tthe gold to buy some.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pipes of Haunting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A decent crowd control option, but you need proficiency in wind\n\t\tinstruments so expect to pass this off to a bard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ring of Water Walking<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational, and you&#8217;ll be able to cast Water Walk at level 9.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Wand Sheath<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: This was removed by from the 2nd-level items list by errata because Wand\n\t\tSheaths are now Common magic items and can therefore be created as Infusions\n\t\tusing Replicate Magic Item.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"replicate-magic-item-10\">10th-Level Replicatable Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Boots of Striding and Springing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Useful for too few characters, especially when Winged Boots are available\n\t\tat the same time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Boots of the Winterlands<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Resistance to cold damage is the primary draw.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bracers of Archery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: If you have an archer in the party they&#8217;ll appreciate the extra damage,\n\t\tbut you can do much better with your limited Infusion slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brooch of Shielding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Resistance to force damage is almost nonexistent, but force damage is\n\t\talso incredibly rare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: +1 to AC <em>and<\/em> saving throws. This is so unversally useful that\n\t\tpeople in your party may actually argue over who gets to wear it. In a\n\t\tcampaign where it&#8217;s possible, it&#8217;s absolutely worth the effort to buy or\n\t\tcraft one of these for everyone in the party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eyes of the Eagle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Advantage on sight-based Perception checks covers most Perception\n\t\tchecks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gauntlets of Ogre Power<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: You&#8217;ve been hobbling along with 8 Strength since first level and done\n\t\tjust fine. Raising it to 19 is only helpful if you need to be able to carry\n\t\tmore things that don&#8217;t fit into your bag of holding. By this level\n\t\tStrength-based melee characters will have 18 or 20 Strength, so even they\n\t\twon&#8217;t benefit from this.\n\t\t<p>Beast Master Rangers might eye this item for their companion, but most\n\t\t\tanimals don&#8217;t have the correct anatomy to wear gauntlets and your DM may\n\t\t\tbe unwilling to let you put these on a gorilla.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gloves of Missile Snaring<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational. A +1 to AC will be more meaningful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gloves of Swimming and Climbing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Cloak of the Manta Ray grants you a swim speed, and Winged Boots make\n\t\tclimbing obsolete.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hat of Disguise<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Disguise Self is a 1st-level spell. If you want to be able to disguise\n\t\tyourself constantly, play a Changeling or a Warock. If you&#8217;re still set on\n\t\thaving an Infusion to disguise yourself or an ally with, the Masequerade\n\t\tTattoo is a Common Magic Item.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Headband of Intellect<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: All the same issues as Gauntlets of Ogre Power, but now it&#8217;s\n\t\tIntelligence. You probably hit 20 at 8th level, so this is worthless to you,\n\t\tbut if you have an arcane trickster or eldritch knight in the party, this\n\t\tcould help them a great deal. They need to increase their Strength\/Dexterity\n\t\tbefore they can start raising their Intelligence, and a better Intelligence\n\t\tscore can dramatically improve their spellcasting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Helm of Telepathy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Constantly read creatures&#8217; surface thoughts and communicate telepathically without a language barrier. It may be helpful to pass this to your party&#8217;s Face so that they can do the telepathic talking. Ignore anything behind the save DC on this thing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Medallion of Thoughts<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Helm of Telepathy can cast Detect Thoughts at the same DC with no\n\t\tlimitation on charges.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Necklace of Adaptation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but it&#8217;s an upgrade from Cap of Water breathing. If you&#8217;re\n\t\texpecting to go underwater, Cloak of the Manta Ray&#8217;s swim speed makes it a\n\t\tbetter item. I would only take this over Cloak of the Manta Ray if you&#8217;re\n\t\ttaking this as a &#8220;just in case&#8221; sort of item, but at that point just cast\n\t\tWater Breathing. This does admittedly help with saves against gas effects,\n\t\tbut those are very rare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Periapt of Wound Closure<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Put this on the person in your party with the biggest hit dice.\n\t\tBarbarians, fighters, etc. are all on the front lines taking most of the\n\t\tdamage, which means that they&#8217;re the most likely to fall unconscious and the\n\t\tmost likely to bleed out in the middle of a fight. This will both save them\n\t\tfrom an untimely fate and stretch the effects of their natural healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pipes of the Sewers<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Summon up to 3 CR 1\/2 swarms that you can&#8217;t directly control, and be less\n\t\tscared of creatures that are below CR 1 when you&#8217;re already 10th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quiver of Ehlonna<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: 5e&#8217;s item management rules are too generous to make this useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ring of Jumping<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Winged Boots make jumping obsolete.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ring of Mind Shielding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational. Add resistance to Psychic Damage and I would be excited,\n\t\tbut the effects listed are simply too rare to spend an Infusion on.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slippers of Spider Climbing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Not necessarily bad, but Winged Boots make them obsolete.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ventilating Lungs<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational. WotC removed most of the items like this one in errata\n\t\tfor the Artificer. I&#8217;m not sure why this one was left in.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Winged Boots<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Four hours of flight is plenty when it&#8217;s broken up in 1-minute\n\t\tincrements. In previous editions you got something like 10 minutes per da\n\t\tyand that was typically enough. These boots are so good that they make\n\t\tseveral other infusion obtions at this level and at 14th level obsolete.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"replicate-magic-item-14\">14th-Level Replicatable Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Amulet of Health<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Even if you raised your Constitution at level 12, you probably only have\n\t\t16 or 17, so this is still great. If you don&#8217;t need it for yourself, someone\n\t\telse in your party almost certainly does.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Propulsion Arm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW<\/a><\/sup>: The arm does as much damage as a longsword, and making it force damage is\n\t\tvery appealing. The Thrown property also makes it an easy ranged weapon,\n\t\tallowing a Strength-based character to fight effectiveley both in melee and\n\t\tat range. You can probably even use it with Booming Blade and Green-Flame\n\t\tBlade for the same reasons that the Armorer Artificer can use those spells\n\t\twith Thunder Gauntlets.\n\t\t<p>While the damage type and the Thrown property are major advantages, the\n\t\t\tarm is going to deal less damage and hit less frequently than a weapon\n\t\t\twith Enhanced Weapon due the simple mathematical effectiveness of a +1 or\n\t\t\t+2 bonus to attacks and damage. Given the trades between the two options,\n\t\t\tI think they&#8217;re roughly equivalent.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Belt of Hill Giant Strength<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: All the same problems as Gauntlets of Ogre Power, but with a slightly\n\t\thigher Strength score.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Boots of Levitation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Winged Boots have been around for four levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boots of Speed<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A good replacement for Boots of the Winding Path if you like hit-and-run\n\t\ttactics, and since you can turn the effect off it&#8217;s easy to stretch the\n\t\t10-minute duration over a long adventuring day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bracers of Defense<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: If you have a monk or barbarian in the party these are great, otherwise\n\t\tskip them. A spellcaster relying on Mage Armor might want them, but their AC\n\t\tis already so bad that they should really be looking for other defensive\n\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of the Bat<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Possibly better for Stealth than the Cloak of Elvenkind (definitely less\n\t\tconfusing), and the ability to fly and turn into a bat in dim light or\n\t\tdarkness is great for scouting and for getting around at night.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Shackles<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design. Don&#8217;t rush to learn this, and if you do learn it\n\t\tdon&#8217;t expect to use it every day. Instead, keep it around and use it on a\n\t\tday where you intent to capture a creature.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gem of Seeing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: True Seeing is a 6th-level spell that&#8217;s not on your spell list, and this\n\t\teffectively lets you cast it three times per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Horn of Blasting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: 20% chance to deal 10d6 damage to yourself with no save.

Technically situational, but being paralyzed or restrained is often a\n\t\tdeath sentence so immunity to magic which imposes those conditions is very\n\t\thelpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ring of Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: This appears to stack with a Cloak of Protection, and if that&#8217;s the case\n\t\tI don&#8217;t know how you could pass up an opportunity to have an AC that\n\t\tabsurdly high and saves that absurdly good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ring of the Ram<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: The damage isn&#8217;t especially exciting at this level (though force damage\n\t\tis always nice), and the attack bonus is worse than your
