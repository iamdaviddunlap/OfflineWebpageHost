There is exactly one decision point and it\u2019s hard to go wrong with it (the additional Fighting Style), and otherwise you just keep powercreeping your way until level 18 where you suddenly also become intensely hard to kill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of complexity that still produces a good amount of power if handled well makes the Champion a natural choice for new players, but there\u2019s still a good amount of optimization to be had. The subclass is definitely tailored to be a Striker, so picking the right items and feats to lean into that role is where the optimization separates a pretty good Champion build from a great Champion build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the 2024 Champion Fighter.

We can also spend a Bonus Action to get 6 temp HP, 25ish real HP, or resistance to all damage, a total number of times per day that means we can easily do one of them every round.

There is exactly one decision point and it\u2019s hard to go wrong with it (the additional Fighting Style), and otherwise you just keep powercreeping your way until level 18 where you suddenly also become intensely hard to kill. The lack of complexity that still produces a good amount of power if handled well makes the Champion a natural choice for new players, but there\u2019s still a good amount of optimization to be had.
