I would interpret the spell as follows:\n\t\tNormal creatures take listed damage (4d6) and are permanently blinded.\n\t\tUndead take the bigger damage instead of the regular damage, and are blinded\n\t\tas normal. Oozes, and plant creatures which could be defined as &#8220;fungi,\n\t\tmold, or slime&#8221; (such as shambling mounds or mushroom creatures) are\n\t\taffected like undead.

This is a clear improvement on the Water domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Power(s): cold resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Body of Ice<\/span> (Su): This is a really cool\n\tability. Cold damage is fairly uncommon, which means you can turn this on to\n\tresist ice damage, and you won&#8217;t miss the cold resistance when you&#8217;re facing\n\tanything else. The DR is also fantastic, and exceeds the DR of Barbarians\n\tuntil very high level.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">freezing sphere<\/span>: Basically fireball with\n\t\ta higher dice cap and cold damage.

The wording doesn&#8217;t mention the effects of feats,\n\tbut your GM may allow you to apply feats like Greater Boll Rush to grant your\n\tallies attacks of opportunity.

The spell list has some great area control effects, but the damage spells are among the worst options available. Overall the domain tries to find a nice space between area control and damage output, and manages to fail at both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Storm Burst<\/span> (Sp): Similar to the generic\n\tenergy bolt attacks, but Storm Burst deals nonlethal damage. Instead of real\n\tdamage, the target takes a penalty to its attacks for round. Potentially\n\tuseful at low levels, despite the damage limitations.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Lord<\/span> (Sp): Replicates the effect\n\tof a decent damage spell, but the ability to hit more than one target at a\n\ttime makes this miles better than Call Lightning. However, the damage is\n\tfairly small, even at 8th level, and doesn&#8217;t scale with level.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">obscuring mist<\/span>: Occasionally useful as\n\t\tan escape mechanic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">fog cloud<\/span>: A better, ranged version of\n\t\tObscuring Mist. Not on the Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">call lightning<\/span>: Because the bolts are\n\t\tverticle, this will likely get used as a single-target damage spell. Instead\n\t\tof spending your standard action doing something helpfol, you can deal 3d6\n\t\tdamage. That&#8217;s an average of 10.5. Even at level 5, that barely exceeds your\n\t\tweapon damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">sleet storm<\/span>: Excellent area control,\n\t\tespecially against clumsy foes.

It&#8217;s hard to time, it&#8217;s hard to use, and it&#8217;s hard to not do just as\n\t\tmuch damage to your party.

Cast it repeatedly on off days, and the berries\n\t\twill remain potent when its time to adventure. Use them to heal those last\n\t\tfew hit points without spending a prepared spell or potion. They also reduce\n\t\tthe need to purchase food. However, it&#8217;s already on the Druid spell list,\n\t\tand preparing it daily is a waste because you can only carry a set number of\n\t\tcharged berries.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">blight<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-none\">sunburst<\/span>: Though it suffers many of the\n\t\troles interpetation issues of sunbeam, sunburst is slightly easier to\n\t\tinterpret. Because the duration is instantaneous, the blindness effect is\n\t\tpermanent. The damage dealt to undead is still unclear (do they take damage\n\t\ttwice?), and the additional list of things affected like undead is still\n\t\tconfusing.

The\n\t\tskill bonuses won&#8217;t help in the rounds\/level duration, and +2 to attack and\n\t\tdamage is nice, but a saving throw to negate makes this unlikely to be\n\t\teffective. Not on the Druid spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">bloodhound<\/span>: Scent with an hours\/level\n\t\tduration.
