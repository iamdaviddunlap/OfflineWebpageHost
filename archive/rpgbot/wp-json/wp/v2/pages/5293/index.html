Oracles are Charisma-based spontaneous spellcasters that share a spell list (and several other aspects) with the Cleric. Because their abilities are so similar, the Oracle can fill any role that the Cleric can, and because they are Charisma-based, the Oracle makes for a much better Face than a Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Oracle Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points can be hard if\n\tyou&#8217;re on the front lines, especially with only medium armor and no real need\n\tfor Dexterity. If you prefer to stay in the back you&#8217;re probably fine, but if\n\tyou&#8217;re in the front be sure to boost your AC and Constitution.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB and you can buff\n\tyourself to make up the difference.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Saves<\/span>: The Oracle&#8217;s only good save is Will,\n\tand with no other need for Wisdom even the Oracle&#8217;s best save likely won&#8217;t be\n\tspectacular.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple weapons are plenty,\n\tand medium armor and shield provide good AC. If you need more AC, take Heavy\n\tArmor Proficiency or cast some buff spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill ranks is great for a\n\tstraight caster, and your choice of mystery allows for some interesting class\n\tskills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: The Oracle uses the Cleric spell\n\tlist, which is excellent. You have a limited number of spells known which\n\tgreatly limits your versatility, but you still have access to all of the\n\tCleric&#8217;s best spells. Don&#8217;t forget that you get to select all Cure or all\n\tInflict spells as spells known for free. The text is buried in the &#8220;Spells&#8221;\n\tsection for Oracles, and it&#8217;s easy to miss.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mystery<\/span>: Your choice of mystery is much like\n\tthe Cleric&#8217;s choice of domain, but more like a Sorcerer&#8217;s Bloodline. It\n\tgreatly determines the feel and flavor of your character, and greatly\n\tinfluences your play style. See my\n\t<a href=\"mysteries\">Oracle Mystery Breakdown<\/a> for help selecting a\n\tmystery.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oracle&#8217;s Curse<\/span>: The Oracle&#8217;s Curse is a\n\thandicap. Each option provides some other benefit which grows as you level,\n\tbut for the most part the curses are a burden. If you plan to multiclass,\n\tremember that half of your other class levels count toward your level for the\n\teffects of Oracle&#8217;s Curse, which can make for some very clever multiclassing\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clouded Vision<\/span>: If you have ever wanted\n\t\tto play a blind character (and I know that people want to do that), this is\n\t\tthe best way to do it. You aren&#8217;t truly blind, but you&#8217;re handicapped enough\n\t\tfor it to be a huge hindrance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deaf<\/span>: Hearing is much less important in\n\t\tPathfinder than sight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haunted<\/span>: Pulling items out of your bag\n\t\tshouldn&#8217;t happen in combat most of the time, and dropping things ten feet\n\t\tfrom you isn&#8217;t a huge problem. The free spells known are great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lame<\/span>: The only reason you would want this\n\t\tis for a class dip from Barbarian so that you could rage cycle. An 8th level\n\t\tBarbarian can take one level of Oracle, and immediately start Rage cycling 8\n\t\tlevels early.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tongues<\/span>: Hilarious. Be sure to coordinate\n\t\twith your party to make sure that someone speaks your language.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wasting<\/span>: The least invasive curse. If you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t plan to be the party&#8217;s face, this is a good default option. Of course,\n\t\tOracles are Charisma-based and get two of the four face skills and you can\n\t\tget the other two with traits or mysteries, so if your party needs a face\n\t\tyou&#8217;re a fantastic candidate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelation<\/span>: The Oracle&#8217;s pseudo-feat,\n\tRevelations are a great way to customize your Oracle, and provide a lot of\n\tfantastic abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Varies by mystery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Oracle, like the Cleric, can be either a strict spellcaster or a front-line combat spellcaster. Your choice of abilities depends on what role you plan to fill in your party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: If you plan to be a combat caster, you\n\tneed Strength for attack and damage. If you&#8217;re a straight caster, dump\n\tStrength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Boosts AC and Reflex saves. If AC is\n\ta problem or if you plan to be a combat caster, pick up Heavy Armor\n\tProficiency so that a 12 is an acceptable score. For straight casters, pick up\n\ta little more dexterity to improve your AC and your ranged attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Everyone needs hit points and\n\tFortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: With 4+ skill ranks and not a lot of\n\timportant skills, you can afford to dump Intelligence if you really need to.\n\tHowever, many Oracle Mysteries grant access to all knowledge skills, which can\n\tmake you an excellent Librarian with a little bit of Intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Only required for Will saves, and\n\tWill is the Oracle&#8217;s good save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Your spellcasting ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 17<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 16<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 11<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Combat Caster<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 18<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 13<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 18<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 17<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Straight Caster<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Charisma are key, but bonuses to other abilities are nice for combat caster builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: The penalty to Charisma is too much of\n\ta problem to overcome for a primary spellcaster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: Bonuses to two of the Oracle&#8217;s least\n\timportant abilities, and a penalty to constitution.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome<\/span>: A bonus to Constitution and Charisma\n\tis a great combination for a straight caster build. If you want to play a\n\tsmall straight caster Oracle, the Gnome is your best bet. The favored class\n\tbonus lets you get the higher level abilities of your Oracle&#8217;s curse sooner,\n\tbut remember that the abilities have an upper limit, and once you get all of\n\tthe abilities your investment will be wasted.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The Flexible bonus goes into\n\tCharisma, but that&#8217;s all that we really get from the Half-Elf unless you take\n\tsome alternate racial traits. The favored class bonus grants extra spells\n\tknown, which will really help improve the Oracle&#8217;s versatility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The Flexible bonus goes into\n\tCharisma, and Darkvision is nice, but that&#8217;s really all that we get. The\n\tfavored class bonus grants extra spells known, which will really help improve\n\tthe Oracle&#8217;s versatility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: Similar to the Gnome, Halflings\n\tget a bonus to the Charisma, and make a great straight caster option. Their\n\tfavored class bonus is the same as the Gnome&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: The ability bonus goes into Charisma,\n\tthe skill ranks can help offset dumping Intelligence if you choose to do so,\n\tand a bonus feat is always fantastic. The favored class bonus grants extra\n\tspells known, which will really help improve the Oracle&#8217;s versatility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of traits depends largely on your character concept. Because Mysteries and spell lists make Oracles so diverse, it&#8217;s largely impossible to determine what traits would be good for all Oracles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): One of the most important\n\t\tskills in the game, especially if you plan to be the party&#8217;s Face. Oracles\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get Bluff and Intimidate as class skills by default, but you can get\n\t\tthem from traits or from several Mysteries.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): Excellent way to supplement\n\t\tyour magical healing abilities, but you won&#8217;t be as good as a Cleric because\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t rely on Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (history)<\/span> (Int): Situational,\n\t\tbut it can tell you a lot about the world in some campaigns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge (planes)<\/span> (Int): <\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (religion)<\/span> (Int): One of the\n\t\tbest and most important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Excellent if you plan\n\t\tto be the party&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Crucial for identifying\n\t\tspells and creating magic items, even with poor Intelligence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of feats depends largely on your character concept, but some feats work well for any Oracle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abundant Revelations<\/span>: One extra use of a\n\t\trevelation is really hard to justify unless the revelation is exceptionally\n\t\tgood. I might consider this on the Dual-Cursed Oracle&#8217;s Fortune revelation,\n\t\tbut I would never take this on anything less powerful than that.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Casting<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going into\n\t\tmelee, you should be able to handle weapons well enough to not need\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Interference<\/span>: Sacrifice a 1st-level\n\t\tspell slot to make an enemy reroll an attack roll. The reroll is much more\n\t\timportant than the penalty, especially if the attack is a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Divine Protection<\/span>: When this feat was\n\t\twritten it was a constant benefit, which made it an absolutely stellar\n\t\toption for Oracles. However, it was updated to only apply once per day as an\n\t\timmediate action. Unfortunately, once per day just isn&#8217;t enough to justify\n\t\tthe feat no matter how absurd your Charisma bonus is.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Eldritch Heritage<\/span>: Sorcerer bloodlines\n\t\thave a lot to offer. Most of the 1st-level powers aren&#8217;t worth a feat, but a\n\t\thandful of them are very good. If you want a bloodline with a poor 1st-level\n\t\tpower but better powers at higher levels, consider delaying this feat to 9th\n\t\tlevel. You need Skill Focus to qualify, so try to capitalize on Skill Focus\n\t\tas much as you can by building yourself to use the requisite skill\n\t\teffectively. For help selecting a bloodline, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/bloodlines\">Sorcerer Bloodlines Breakdown<\/a>.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Eldritch Heritage<\/span>: You get one\n\t\t\t\tof the two mid-level abilities from a sorcerer bloodline. Most\n\t\t\t\tbloodlines will have one option which is clearly better than the other,\n\t\t\t\tbut for those few bloodlines that have two good options you can take\n\t\t\t\tthis twice.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Eldritch Heritage<\/span>: Many\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbloodlines have very exciting high-level abilities.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Expanded Arcana<\/span>: If you want to know more\n\t\tspells, take the Human or Half-elf racial favored class bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Revelation<\/span>: Many revelations are\n\t\tbetter than most feats. If your mystery has enough good revelations that you\n\t\twon&#8217;t normally be able to take them all, this is a good choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heavy Armor Proficiency<\/span>: The Oracle\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t need mobility in most cases, and additional armor can really reduce\n\t\tyour dependence on Dexterity and spells for AC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span>: Excellent on almost\n\t\tany spellcaster.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Prophetic Visionary<\/span>: Just learn Augury. The\n\t\t25gp material component isn&#8217;t that bad.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Penetration<\/span>: At high levels Spell\n\t\tResistance will become increasingly problematic. You may be able to get by\n\t\ton options which don&#8217;t allow spell resistance, but if you can&#8217;t this is a\n\t\tgreat idea.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Spell Penetration<\/span>: Another\n\t\t\t\t+2.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Warrior Priest<\/span>: Improved Initiative is\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gauntlet<\/span>: Your weapon&#8217;s damage die matters\n\t\tvery little beyond low levels, so once you have enough spell slots to get\n\t\tyou through the day without constantly grabbing a weapon a gauntlet (spiked\n\t\tor otherwise) is a great weapon option because you can still use a heavy\n\t\tshield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavy Mace<\/span>: The Cleric&#8217;s iconic weapon, the\n\t\tHeavy Mace is strictly worse than a Morningstar and there is literally no\n\t\treason to select it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longspear<\/span>: Your only option with\n\t\treach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Morningstar<\/span>: The best one-handed simple\n\t\tweapon, the Morningstar does just as much damage as a Heavy Mace, and can\n\t\tovercome two types of DR.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortspear<\/span>: A tiny bit less damage than\n\t\tthe Morningstar, but you can throw it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hide<\/span>: Probably your starting armor at 1st\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heavy Shield<\/span>: Never goes out of style.

It&#8217;s a bit more expensive than your typical +2 shield, so it may\n\t\tnot be worth the cost compared to a mithral buckler. However, it allows you\n\t\tto perform somatic components with the hand holding the shield, which means\n\t\tthat you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue, and because it\n\t\thas no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone can use it without\n\t\tissue. The ability to automatically damage enemies while in a grapple is a\n\t\thelpful deterrent for small or physical weak characters, but ion&#8217;t go\n\t\tlooking for excuses to use it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enhancement Bonus<\/span> (+X): Magic Vestment\n\t\tcomes online at 5th level, and will generally outpace or match the amount\n\t\tyou could reasonably invest in your armor. As you gain more levels, Magic\n\t\tVestment will get better and the cost to enhance your armor will gradually\n\t\tbecome less appealing. A 3rd-level Pearl of Power costs 9000gp, which is as\n\t\tmuch as a suit of +3 armor and slightly more than two +2 armor items, but\n\t\twith this pearl and one spell slot you can enhance both your armor and your\n\t\tshield, and get the advantages of Magic Vestment&#8217;s scaling without spending\n\t\tanother coin.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Soothsayer&#8217;s Raiment<\/span> (10,300): Unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re staying out of melee, it&#8217;s hard to justify giving up better AC just\n\t\tto get an extra revelation when you can take the Extra Revalation feat\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Counterspells<\/span>: Orances spend a lot of\n\t\ttime casting buff spells, often on themselves. If you put on a ring of\n\t\tcounterspells and fill it with Dispel Magic and Improved Dispel Magic,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re protected from losing all of your buffs when you run into enemy\n\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Curing<\/span>: Healbots are dumb, and this is\n\t\tnowhere near worth 10,000 gold. I might consider it at 2,000, but even then\n\t\tI would consider it vendor trash if I found it on the floor of a\n\t\tdungeon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection<\/span>: A lot of cleric\/oracle\n\t\tspells grant Deflection bonuses to AC, and they obviously won&#8217;t stack with\n\t\tyour ring.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rods\">Rods<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic Extend, Lesser<\/span>: Many crucial\n\t\tcleric\/oracle buffs are 3rd-level or less, including several communal\n\t\tspells. If you can&#8217;t spare a feat for Extend Spell, a rod can be a nice\n\t\tsubstitute. Once the durations are long enough, you can cast extended spells\n\t\tat night before you go to sleep and the durations will last well into the\n\t\tnext day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Metamagic Reach, Lesser<\/span>: Cure spells have\n\t\ta range of touch, which can be a problem if one of your allies falls below 0\n\t\thit points and you&#8217;re not right next to them. A low-level cure spell will at\n\t\tleast stabilize them until you can get in range for something bigger. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re worried that you&#8217;ll need Breath of Life frequently, consider the\n\t\tregular rod.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"staffs\">Staffs<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to recommend specific staffs without knowing your individual character, so instead I want to make a general endorsement of the concept of magic staffs in Pathfinder. If you are a 3.5 native, go read Pathfinder&#8217;s rules for staffs because they have improved dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staffs are a reliable, rechargeable source of extra spellcasting that can give spellcasters easy and reliable access to spells from their spell list which they might not want to learn, or which they might like to use so frequently that they can&#8217;t prepare the spell enough times in a given day. On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cure Light Wounds<\/span>: You have more spell\n\t\tslots to burn than a cleric, but a wand of Cure Light Wounds is still a\n\t\tgreat investment. You can&#8217;t always rest to restore your spell slots, so it\n\t\toften makes sense to save the spell slots for solving other problems and use\n\t\ta wand for healing between fights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\tforgo.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Page of Spell Knowledge<\/span>: A great way to\n\t\tget extra spells known. I think Ring of Spell Knowledge is better for\n\t\tanything that you can find in a Wizard&#8217;s or Magus&#8217;s spellbook, but for\n\t\tdivine spells that you might need on a regular basis Page of Spell Knowledge\n\t\tmakes more sense because you don&#8217;t need to pay NPC&#8217;s to cast the spell for\n\t\tyou and you don&#8217;t need to consume scrolls.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Oracles are full casters, so generally multiclassing isn&#8217;t a good option.
