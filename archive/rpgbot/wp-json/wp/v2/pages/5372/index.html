Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: d6 hit points leaves you pretty\n\tsquishy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Fortunately, you&#8217;ll almost\n\tnever need to make an actual attack. Touch AC scales very little from level 1\n\tto level 20, going from an\n\t<a href=\"\/\/tylerkamstra.com\/rpgbot\/d20srd_monster_analyzer\/output.html\">\n\t\taverage of 11.6 on CR 1 monsters to 12.7 on CR 20 monsters<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Well, at least you have decent\n\twill. Mind controlling a wizard is your job, and we don&#8217;t want anyone else\n\tdoing your job.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Wizards get very little in the\n\tway of proficiencies, but beyond very early levels you won&#8217;t need them. If\n\tyou&#8217;re not an Elf, a light crossbow is an excellent backup weapon for an\n\tEnchanter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Wizards only get 2+ skills, but you\n\tget <em>every<\/em> knowledge skill as a class skill, and your absurd\n\tintelligence will give you plenty of skill points to throw around. Remember\n\tthat permanently increasing your intelligence will give you additional skill\n\tpoints retroactively, which will be nice when you hit levels 8 and 16.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Bond<\/span> (Ex or Sp): You have the option\n\tof a familiar or a bonded item, and both options have their merits.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Familiar<\/span>: Always a solid choice, the\n\t\tfamiliar is an ever-present and ever-useful companion. Familiars can serve\n\t\tas scouts, assassins, couriers, assistants, and even meat shields in a\n\t\tpinch. Their passive bonuses to the wizard are roughly equal to a feat, and\n\t\tthe provide the benefits of Alertness when they are adjacent. Effectively, a\n\t\tfamiliar gives you two feats and a cool pet.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">amulet<\/span>: Jewelry is nice an safe. It\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t take up a hand, it&#8217;s hard to take from you in combat, and it&#8217;s a\n\t\tgood option for enchanting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">ring<\/span>: The ring is really the gold standard\n\t\tof bonded items. It&#8217;s incredibly small, it&#8217;s easy to hide under a glove or\n\t\ton your person, it&#8217;s a very difficult target for sundering, and you can\n\t\tenchant is as per Enchant Ring without the feat. Magic rings have a lot of\n\t\tgreat options, but Enchant Ring is rarely worth the feat, so this gives you\n\t\tsome options to save some money.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">staff<\/span>: If you like to use magic Staves,\n\t\tstaff might be a good option. If you only want one magic staff, this will\n\t\tsave you a feat. If you don&#8217;t enjoy magic staves, you have a big, obvious\n\t\tstick which people can either take from you or destroy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">wand<\/span>: Wands are generally only good for low\n\t\tlevel spells which you plan to cast frequently, like Cure Light Wounds.\n\t\tWizards have very few options which can justify being on a wand, and a wand\n\t\tis very easy to disarm\/steal\/sunder.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">weapon<\/span>: A wizard should know better. An\n\t\tenchanter should never be using a weapon enough to justify actually carrying\n\t\tit around.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane School<\/span>: You picked Enchantment. For\n\tinformation on other schools, see the\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/schools\">Wizard School Breakdown<\/a>. For information on the Enchantment school specifically, see below.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cantrips<\/span>: Cantrips are amazing at every\n\tlevel. Prestidigitation is often called &#8220;minor wish&#8221;, and Detect Magic will\n\tnever stop being helpful. At low levels, Acid Splash provides easy, realiable\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Scribe Scroll<\/span>: Scrolls are great for\n\twizards, and giving you the feat for free is nice. Use it to prepare scrolls\n\tof spells that you need infrequently so that you can cover all of your\n\tbases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: 4 extra feats over the course\n\tof 20 levels isn&#8217;t game-breaking, but the Wizard would still be king if he\n\tdidn&#8217;t get any of these. The addition of\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/wizard.html#_arcane-discoveries\">Arcane Discoveries<\/a>\n\tgives wizards a handful of unique and incredibly powerful options in place of\n\tmetamagic and item crafting feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: You have the best spell list in the\n\tgame, and every new book makes it better. Spells are why you play a wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment-school\">Enchantment School<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Enchanting Smile<\/span> (Su): A bonus to social\n\tskills is weird for a wizard. If you expend resources to be a face, this might\n\tactually be useful. But most likely, you won&#8217;t be doing a lot of Bluffing. The\n\tlevel 20 ability is fantastic, but won&#8217;t see a lot of use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dazing Touch<\/span> (Sp): Dazed is a great status\n\tcondition and this power has no saving throws, but this is a\n\t<em>melee<\/em> touch attack, which you will be terrible at, and it only\n\taffects things with your hit dice of fewer, which is generally only going to\n\tNPCs or things with a CR lower than your level. Your familiar can&#8217;t deliver\n\tthe attack since it&#8217;s not a spell. It can be situationally useful if you get\n\tgrappled or if you ambush someone, but it&#8217;s not going to be your go-to\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Despair<\/span> (Su): The 30 foot range is\n\tproblematic, and the duration is fairly limited, but a -2 to saves against\n\teverything affected is brutal, The debuff matches the Shaken condition and\n\tstacks with it. If you can make a target Shaken, they&#8217;re looking at a total -4\n\tpenalty on saves against your absurd spell DCs. Sickened adds another -2.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"rating-blue\">Controller<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Force of Will<\/span> (Su): You give up charming\n\tsmile for the ability to communicate with your charmed\/dominated targets\n\ttelepathically. This is great for communicating with subjects which don&#8217;t\n\tspeak common, and lets you boss things around without revealing that they&#8217;re\n\tcharmed\/dominated. You could even use Charm Person on your party members to\n\tset up a cheap telepathic communication system.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Irresistible Demand<\/span> (Sp): This is strictly\n\tworse than Dominate Monster, the duration is extremely limited, the save is\n\taverage, and you have to concentrate as a standard action to maintain the\n\teffect. However, it&#8217;s Dominate Monster at 8th level. With careful application,\n\tthis is a really fantastic way to mimic a 9th level spell for a few rounds.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"rating-red\">Manipulator<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Beguiling Touch<\/span> (Sp): You trade in the\n\tmediocre Dazing Touch for the considerably worse Beguiling Touch. Beguiling\n\ttouch allows a save, has a very short duration, and doesn&#8217;t work in combat or\n\ton hostile creatures. If you really need to charm something, cast Charm Person\n\tor Charm Monster. You&#8217;re an enchanter, so you&#8217;re really good at those.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Shape Emotions<\/span> (Sp): You can now use your\n\taura to give your party a +4 bonus on saves against fear, or your can give\n\tenemies a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. The\n\tbonus against feat can be replaced with Remove Fear, the -2 penalty is worse\n\tthan the save penalty from Aura of Despair, <em>and<\/em> Aura of Despair\n\tapplies penalties to attacks, ability checks, and skill checks.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"opposing-schools\">Opposing Schools<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abjuration<\/span>: Anjuration includes most\n\t\tprotective spells. If you don&#8217;t plan to enchant protective items and your\n\t\tparty has another support caster, you can work without Abjuration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Conjuration<\/span>: Conjuration is one of the best\n\t\tschools. In addition to summoning effects, it includes teleportation\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divination<\/span>: Divination includes a huge\n\t\tnumber of utility spells like Detect Magic and Scry.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evocation<\/span>: When you need damage, mind\n\t\tcontrol something that does damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusion<\/span>: Illusions are fun and can do a\n\t\tlot of creative things, but they don&#8217;t really provide a lot of utility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Necromancy<\/span>: Necromancy has very little\n\t\tthat we need. You don&#8217;t need corpses to make minions, and Enchantment has\n\t\tplenty of save-or-suck spells to give up the instant death spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transmutation<\/span>: Transmutation contains\n\t\tmany of the offensive buff spells. If you plan to enchant items,\n\t\tTransmutation is very important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump to 7. Make the fighter do the\n\tlifting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Important for saves, and for the\n\toccasional touch attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Your hit points are garbage, and\n\tfortitude saves will be a problem for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: You get magic, skills, and a bonus to\n\tknowledge skills (which you will have a ton of). Max at start, boost early,\n\tboost often.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: You get high will saves, but with no\n\tother real ability dependencies, bumping wisdom to at least 12 for additional\n\tsaves is wise.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: If you&#8217;re trying to be a face (which\n\tyou totally can), don&#8217;t dump charisma too hard. Otherwise, dump to 7 and keep\n\tyour mouth shut until its time to throw some spells around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to normal ability considerations, Wizards can also make excellent use of the aging rules. Being middle-aged gives you a -1 penalty to your physical abilities, but gets you a pleasant +1 to your mental ability scores. However, this can be a problem for your already low reflex and fortitude saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Conversational<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Mute<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Arrray<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:7 (6)<\/li>\n<li>Dex:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Con:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Int:18 (19)<\/li>\n<li>Wis:13 (14)<\/li>\n<li>Cha:13 (14)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:7 (6)<\/li>\n<li>Dex:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Con:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Int:18 (19)<\/li>\n<li>Wis:11 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Cha:10 (11)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:8 (7)<\/li>\n<li>Dex:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Con:14 (13)<\/li>\n<li>Int:15 (16)<\/li>\n<li>Wis:12 (13)<\/li>\n<li>Cha:10 (11)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:7 (6)<\/li>\n<li>Dex:14 (13)<\/li>\n<li>Con:15 (14)<\/li>\n<li>Int:18 (19)<\/li>\n<li>Wis:13 (14)<\/li>\n<li>Cha:7 (8)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:7 (6)<\/li>\n<li>Dex:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Con:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Int:18 (19)<\/li>\n<li>Wis:13 (14)<\/li>\n<li>Cha:8 (9)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:8 (7)<\/li>\n<li>Dex:13 (12)<\/li>\n<li>Con:14 (13)<\/li>\n<li>Int:15 (16)<\/li>\n<li>Wis:12 (13)<\/li>\n<li>Cha:10 (11)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Intelligence are key, and other bonuses to spellcasting are nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Dwarves are an interesting choice\n\tfor wizards. Bonus Constitution and Wisdom make them very durable, a +2 on\n\tsaves against spells is fantastic, and Darkvision is always helpful until you\n\tcast the spell. However, they don&#8217;t bring anything useful to Enchanters\n\toffensively, so they&#8217;re not a great option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Bonus intelligence is great, and the\n\tbonus to dexterity and penalty to constitution are roughly equal for our\n\tpurposes. The +2 bonus to penetrate spell resistance is equivalent to (and\n\tstacks with) Spell Penetration. The other benefits are highly situational, but\n\tcertainly welcome. Since you&#8217;re dumping strength, don&#8217;t make the mistake of\n\ttrying to use a bow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: Bonus Constitution and Charisma are\n\tnice, but that&#8217;s really all gnomes have to offer the Enchanter. Save gnomes\n\tfor Illusionists.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus goes\n\tright into Intelligence, but that&#8217;s really all you get. You won&#8217;t be\n\tmulticlassing, and skill focus won&#8217;t really matter to you. Some of the\n\tHalf-Elf&#8217;s alternate racial traits help a bit, but they don&#8217;t offer anything\n\tparticularly helpful for a Wizard. Humans are strictly better. The Half-Elf\n\tfavored class bonus extends the duration of Enchantment spells, but it scales\n\tvery slowly and most Enchantment spells will have plenty of duration.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Ability bonus to intelligence. If\n\tyou want to be a face, that +2 to intimidate might be nice, and darkvision is\n\tstill fantastic, but half-orcs don&#8217;t bring anything else of interest.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: Bonus to dexterity helps with a\n\tbad save, and the +1 racial bonus to all saves is nice, but that&#8217;s really all\n\twe get from halflings.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: What&#8217;s that you say? A bonus to\n\tintelligence? Madness. The bonus feat is great on literally any character, and\n\tthe bonus skill points don&#8217;t hurt our already impressive pool of skill\n\tpoints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dedicated Defender<\/span> (Combat): +1 to overcome\n\t\tspell resistance is nice, but one of your team mates needs to be knocked out\n\t\tnext to you first.

With your school bonus to diplomacy and\n\t\tpassable charisma, Diplomacy isn&#8217;t an awful choice for Enchanters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focused Disciple<\/span> (Faith): +2 on saves\n\t\tagainst your favorite tricks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">History of Heresy<\/span> (Faith): +1 against\n\t\tdivine spells. Cute, but situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indomitable Faith<\/span> (Faith): +1 to your\n\t\tbest save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspired<\/span> (Faith): Reroll one of your\n\t\talready fantastic skills, like Intelligence.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oathbound<\/span> (Faith): Similar to Focused\n\t\tDisciple.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"bluy\">Omen<\/span> (Faith): +1 to Intimidate, and it becomes a\n\t\tclass skill. Good for a conversational Enchanter, and it allows you to\n\t\tdemoralize once per day as a swift action.
