A Wizard with a comprehensive spellbook can do essentially\n\tanything in the game, often as well as or better than a non-magical character\n\twho is built to do that thing. A Wizard with Invisibility is as stealthy as a\n\tRogue. A Wizard with a summoned pet can replace a fighter (at least\n\ttemporarily). A clever Wizard could even find a way to heal their allies and\n\treplace a Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Wizards can do so much so well, their roles are numerous and varied.\n\tHowever, in a typical party the Wizard&#8217;s primary functions are as a Blaster,\n\tController, Librarian, Support caster, Striker, and Utility Caster. Depending\n\ton your spells and potentially your skills, you can also serve as a Defender,\n\tFace, Healer (though it&#8217;s difficult), and Scout. You may think, &#8220;but wait,\n\tisn&#8217;t that every role?&#8221;. Yes. Yes, it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, with that incredible breadth of capability comes both complexity and risk. Most of this complexity is buried in the Wizard&#8217;s spellcasting. Wizards get very few actual class\/subclass features, but spellcasting fills in the gaps. Managing a spellbook is complex, and unlike Clerics and Druids who can select from a vast spell list after every long rest, you need to hoard newly-learned spells to expand your capabilities, sometimes at great expense, so learning new spells may be a gamble, costing precious gold for a spell which you may never use. If you are prone to analysis paralysis or don&#8217;t enjoy carefully tracking resources, the Wizard is a waking nightmare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards are among the least durable characters in the game, having no armor proficiencies, poor saving throws, and the lowest hit dice available. Staying alive as a wizard can be very difficult, and in most cases requires a party of sturdy allies willing to protect you from harm. There are exceptions to this rule (bladesingers can achieve some of the highest AC in the game without the aid of magic items), but they are few in number.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell anyone who asks that the Wizard is my favorite class, and that has\n\tbeen the case since early in my career with Dungeons and Dragons. The Wizard\n\tis a class that rewards system mastery, and while you don&#8217;t need to be an\n\texperienced player to succeed as a wizard, improving your familiarity with the\n\tgame will pay dividends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our other supporting\n\tarticles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"10502\">Wizard Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/spells\">Wizard Spells Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\">Wizard Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wizards-levels-1-7-with-treantmonk-rpgbot-podcast-s4e79\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28219\">WIZARDS Levels 1 \u2013 7 with Treantmonk! \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E79<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wizards-levels-8-20-with-treantmonk-rpgbot-podcast-s4e80\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28245\">WIZARDS Levels 8 \u2013 20 with Treantmonk \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E80<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

While Arcane\n\tRecovery can&#8217;t restore slots above 6th level, it&#8217;s still a crucial resource, allowing you to\n\trecover low-level spell slots which will remain a perpetual source of crucial\n\tdefensive and utility spells like Shield and Darkvision.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arcane Tradition<\/strong>: Wizard subclasses are briefly summarized\n\tbelow.

The new spells\n\tfill in gaps in the wizards capabilities which made it either mechanically or\n\tthematically unsatisfying to play certain wizard subclasses like School of\n\tConjuration and School of Necromancy because spell options for those\n\tsubclasses were so limited and often involved significantly disrupting the\n\tgame for everyone at the table.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrip Formulas<\/span> (Addition): The fact that\n\twizards have no way to replace their known cantrips has confused me since the\n\tearliest days of DnD 5e&#8217;s lifespan. They&#8217;re the one type of spell that the\n\twizard can&#8217;t expand or replace, and I&#8217;m still not sure why. My one complaint\n\twith this feature is that the Wizard doesn&#8217;t need to write the cantrips into\n\ttheir spellbook, which thematically feels very odd.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Cantrip Versatility on all wizards. You can&#8217;t get\n\tanything which you couldn&#8217;t already have, so it doesn&#8217;t make your character\n\tmore powerful. If you need a way to balance that, make the wizard write\n\tcantrips into their spellbook at half the cost of a 1st-level spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Wizard Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wizards are a single-ability class.

Acid Splash requires a saving throw, while\n\t\t\t\t\tChill Touch and Ray of Frost require attack rolls. Use Acid Splash on\n\t\t\t\t\tclustered enemies, on enemies within 5 ft. (you don&#8217;t care about\n\t\t\t\t\tDisadvantage on ranged attacks while adjacent to an enemy if you don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tmake an attack roll), or enemies with problematically high AC, but Ray\n\t\t\t\t\tof Frost is your go-to offensive cantrip. A 10 ft. speed reduction can\n\t\t\t\t\tbe a significant tactical advantage, especially if you position\n\t\t\t\t\tyourself so that enemies would need to Dash to reach you in a single\n\t\t\t\t\tturn.<br><br>I&#8217;ve notably skipped over Fire Bolt. Fire Bolt is the\n\t\t\t\t\tmost damage (1d10) which you can get from a cantrip while remaining\n\t\t\t\t\twithin the SRD. But at this level if all you want is damage you should\n\t\t\t\t\tgrab a longbow. With 16 Dexterity, Fire Bolt would attack at +5 and\n\t\t\t\t\tdeal 1d10 (avg. 5.5) damage, while a longbow will attack at +5 and\n\t\t\t\t\tdeal 1d8+3 (avg. 7.5) damage and has <em>considerably<\/em> better\n\t\t\t\t\trange.<br><br>Because your spell slots are so limited at 1st\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel, we&#8217;ll lean hard on ritual spells, spending half of our free\n\t\t\t\t\tspellbook entries on ritual spells. Get a familiar as soon as\n\t\t\t\t\tpossible, and use Detect Magic as a ritual whenever it could be\n\t\t\t\t\tuseful. That leaves use three useful combat options: burning hands,\n\t\t\t\t\tmage armor, and magic missile. Mage Armor is a significant AC boost,\n\t\t\t\t\tbringing you to 16 AC which matches the AC of a fighter without a\n\t\t\t\t\tshield, but you&#8217;re still frail so standing behind someone durable is\n\t\t\t\t\tstill better protection. Burning Hands is your go-to crowd control\n\t\t\t\t\toption, while Magic Missile is a reliable pile of damage at range.<br><br>Don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tforget Arcane Recovery. You only get to use it once per day, but it\n\t\t\t\t\tallows you to recover a few spell slots, which can be the difference\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween life and death in a full day of adventuring.

Sculpt Spells largely removes\n\t\t\t\t\tthat difficulty, and scaling the number of safe spaces based on the\n\t\t\t\t\tspell&#8217;s level means that as the area of effect of your spells\n\t\t\t\t\tgradually increases, you&#8217;ll be able to adequately protect your allies.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it notably doesn&#8217;t work on yourself, so you can&#8217;t drop\n\t\t\t\t\tfireballs on yourself without taking damage.<br><br>At this level\n\t\t\t\t\twe pick up yet another ritual spell, but don&#8217;t expect to use Identify\n\t\t\t\t\tuntil you start finding magic items.

Scorching Ray is a good single-target option,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut expect to do partial damage because you&#8217;ll inevitably miss with\n\t\t\t\t\tsome of the rays, so Magic Missile may actually be a better\n\t\t\t\t\toption.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement ( 16 -&gt; 18)<br>New Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211;\n\t\t\t\t\tFire Bolt<br>Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Flaming Sphere<br>&#8211; Misty\n\t\t\t\t\tStep<\/td><td>4th level is typically boring, but there&#8217;s a lot going on here.\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst, and most importantly, your Intelligence increases, raising your\n\t\t\t\t\tspell attacks and your spell DCs.

However, your longbow\n\t\t\t\t\twill still deal more damage, so against foes with low AC I would lean\n\t\t\t\t\ton your longbow first, and use Acid Splash or a leveled spell on\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets with high AC.

If you look beyond those confines\n\t\t\t\t\t(and you should) you&#8217;ll find numerous excellent options like Frostbite\n\t\t\t\t\tand Mind Sliver.<br><br>Our leveled spells at this level are\n\t\t\t\t\tboring, but extremely important. Counterspell allows you to shut down\n\t\t\t\t\tenemy spellcasters, while Dispel Magic removes numerous problematic\n\t\t\t\t\tmagical effects.

The damage boost also\n\t\t\t\t\tnotably applies to all of our AOE spells like Acid Splash and\n\t\t\t\t\tFireball, dramatically boosting your output when you can apply the\n\t\t\t\t\tbonus to multiple foes.<br><br>Cone of Cold is a decent spell, but\n\t\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s rarely better than fireball. The difference between 8d6 and 8d8\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage is only an average of 8 damage, and the ability to cast\n\t\t\t\t\tfireball from a distance will often make it the superior option.

Even the second\n\t\t\t\t\tuse can easily kill you (10d12 averages to 65 damage, and at this\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel you have something like 100 hit points), and your lower-level\n\t\t\t\t\tspells likely aren&#8217;t powerful enough that they&#8217;re a better option than\n\t\t\t\t\ta cantrip, even while overchanneled.<br><br>7th-level spells\n\t\t\t\t\tintroduce real long-distance travel options.
