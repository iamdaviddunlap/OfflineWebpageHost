You&#8217;re making as many attacks as a Fighter, and Lucky still applies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"default-wizard\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\">Wizard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No Intelligence increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dragonmarks\">Halfling Dragonmarks<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dragonmarks are detailed in Eberron: Rising from the Last War. Halflings\n\ttreat Dragonmarks like a subrace.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mark-of-healing\">Mark of Healing<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Mark of Healing&#8217;s spell list adds several crucial healing spells to your\n\tspell list. Unfortunately, with Dexterity and Wisdom increases the most likely\n\tclasses to pair with Mark of Healing are the Cleric and the Druid, and they\n\talready get access to the most important spells on the dragonmarks spell\n\tlist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the custom origin rules, Mark of Healing becomes a spectacular option\n\tfor every full caster except the Cleric and the Druid (they already get most\n\tof these spells), offering crucial healing options to classes like the\n\tSorcerer and the Wizard without dedicating other major decision points like\n\tyour subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mark-of-hospitality\">Mark of Hospitality<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Mark of Hospitaly is a challenge. Dexterity and Charisma increases work\n\tappeal primarily to bards, rogues, sorcerers, and warlocks, and while the\n\tdragonmark spell list has some interesting options, most of them are only\n\tsituationally useful. Aid is really good on a warlock since your spell slots\n\tscale in level and you can take a short rest to recharge right after casting\n\tAid, but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything else here that&#8217;s going to be good\n\tenough to justify one of your limited number of spells known. The\n\tnon-spellcasting benefits definitely aren&#8217;t enough to entice rogues compared\n\tto ghostwise or lightfoot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the custom origin rules, non-Charisma-based spellcasters are an option.\n\tArtificers, clerics, druids, and wizards will all find that parts of the\n\tdragonmark spell list overlap with their normal spell list, but there are a\n\tfew gems for each of those classes. Artificers will find Leomund&#8217;s Tiny Hut a\n\tuseful ritual. Clerics will enjoy Goodberry and Sleep at low levels, though\n\tthe higher-level options mostly overlap with their own spell list. Druids will\n\tenjoy Sleep and Aid, especially melee builds like Circle of Spores which\n\tsuffer from the Druid&#8217;s lack of durability. Circle of the Moon might also eye\n\tAid, but it&#8217;s unlikely that the spell&#8217;s effect applies to both your natural\n\tform and to each Wild Shape form which you might take throughout the spell&#8217;s\n\tduration.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Halfling Feats<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bountiful-luck\"><a class=\"bountiful-luck\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/bountiful-luck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bountiful Luck<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The more rolls your party is making, the better this gets. If you have a\n\tparty that makes a lot of attack rolls (fighters, summoned pets, etc.) or if\n\tyou just have a big party, you&#8217;ll get a lot of use out of this. It doesn&#8217;t\n\tbenefit you directly in any way, but sometimes being a hero to the rest of the\n\tparty is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"second-chance\"><a class=\"second-change\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/second-chance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Second Chance<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A fantastic option for nearly everyone except the Rogue. The Rogue already\n\tgets Uncanny Dodge to mitigate damage from attacks directed at the Rogue, so\n\tspending a feat on Second Chance is a poor investment. If you&#8217;re at 19 in an\n\tability score that you want to increase, this is a great option if you don&#8217;t\n\twant to split your points between two abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"squat-nimbleness\"><a class=\"squat-nimbleness\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/squat-nimbleness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Squat Nimbleness<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Interesting, but I don&#8217;t know what sort of build I would include this in. It\n\tfeels like a good, thematically-appropriate feat, I just don&#8217;t know what to do\n\twith it. It could be good if you&#8217;re at 19 Dexterity, but at that point Second\n\tChance will typically be a better option. Rogues could take it since Second\n\tChance isn&#8217;t very useful for the Rogue, but at that point Expertise in\n\tAcrobatics works fine if you&#8217;re worried about being grappled.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide to DnD 5e&#8217;s Halfling race<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":2700,"menu_order":19,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"post-templates\/article-page.php","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[24,17],"tags":[12,36,5,52],"class_list":["post-2737","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","category-dnd","category-dnd5","tag-characters","tag-dnd","tag-dnd5","tag-races"],"rankMath":{"parentDomain":"rpgbot.net","noFollowDomains":[],"noFollowExcludeDomains":[],"noFollowExternalLinks":false,"featuredImageNotice":"The featured image should be at least 200 by 200 pixels to be picked up by Facebook and other social media sites.","pluginReviewed":false,"postSettings":{"linkSuggestions":true,"useFocusKeyword":false},"frontEndScore":false,"postName":"halfling","permalinkFormat":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/%pagename%\/","showLockModifiedDate":true,"assessor":{"focusKeywordLink":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-admin\/edit.php?focus_keyword=%focus_keyword%&post_type=%post_type%","hasTOCPlugin":{"simpletoc\/plugin.php":"SimpleTOC"},"primaryTaxonomy":false,"serpData":{"title":"","description":"Staples of DnD for years, halflings are small, often sneaky humanoids.
