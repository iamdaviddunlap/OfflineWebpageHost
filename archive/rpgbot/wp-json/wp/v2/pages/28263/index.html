You use your beast form&#8217;s Constitution, but\n\t\t\t\tbetween this and potentially Resilient (Con) and War Caster, you can\n\t\t\t\tmake Concentration very reliable.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Moonlight Step<\/span>: Basically Misty Step, but\n\t\tslightly shorter range. It&#8217;s notably not a spell, so it doesn&#8217;t conflict\n\t\twith casting a spell with a spell slot on the same turn. You can use it both\n\t\tin and out of Wild Shape, too! This is easily worth a level 2 spell slot to\n\t\trecharge if you run out of uses.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><strong>Lunar Form<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Lunar Radiance<\/span>: The extra\n\t\t\t\tdamage amounts to roughly 7 DPR which, while not irrelevant, doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tfeel hugely impactful at this level. It does say once per turn instead\n\t\t\t\tof once on each of your turns, so look for places you might be able to\n\t\t\t\tmake Opportunity Attacks.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shared Moonlight<\/span>: Interesting, but it\n\t\t\t\teither means you&#8217;re removing yourself (probably a Defender to some\n\t\t\t\tdegree) from a fight to protect someone or putting someone close to a\n\t\t\t\tfight that presumably already has their own means of getting there if\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;re playing an optimized character. At least you can still use the\n\t\t\t\tAdvantage for Starry Wisp if you&#8217;re teleporting defensively.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul><\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sea\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Circle of the Sea<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Despite a slow start, Circle of the Sea&#8217;s features come online at level 6 and\n\tgive you a powerful short-range damage effect. Getting in close and pushing\n\tenemies into dangerous positions can be very effective alongside the Druid&#8217;s\n\tcore capabilities. Wrath of the Sea monopolizes your Bonus Action, but leaves\n\tyour Action free for normal Druid things like casting spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-druid\/druid-subclasses\/circle-of-the-sea\/\">Circle of the Sea Druid Subclass Guide<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Circle of the Sea Spells<\/span>: Very few\n\t\treliably good options.

Speed debuffs are abundantly available, so stacking\n\t\t\t\tspeed debuffs on high-priority enemies is often a winning strategy.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 1 Spells<\/span>: Both spells are only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 2 Spells<\/span>: Gust of Wind is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful. Shatter isn&#8217;t consistently effective since it\n\t\t\t\ttargets Constitution saves, but it&#8217;s passable AOE damage until you can\n\t\t\t\tget better options.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 3 Spells<\/span>: Lightning Bolt is\n\t\t\t\tfine damage, but line AOE&#8217;s make it difficult to hit more than two\n\t\t\t\ttargets. You may be able to force enemies into position to hit more of\n\t\t\t\tthem by using Wrath of the Sea&#8217;s push effect. Water Breathing is useful\n\t\t\t\tin aquatic campaigns, but otherwise useless.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 4 Spells<\/span>: Control Water is\n\t\t\t\textremely situational, and Ice Storm just isn&#8217;t very good.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5 Spells<\/span>: A good summon and a\n\t\t\t\tgood save-or-suck. Unfortunately, summon spells that monopolize your\n\t\t\t\tBonus Action may see little use thanks to Wrath of the Sea.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wrath of the Sea<\/span>: Circle of the Sea&#8217;s\n\t\tsignature feature. The damage is good, especially for a Bonus Action that\n\t\tyou can use so frequently, and the push effect is significant. The text says\n\t\t&#8220;away&#8221; rather than &#8220;directly away&#8221;, which means that you can use this to\n\t\tlaunch enemies into the air for easy fall damage. The 10-minute duration\n\t\tmeans that you can easily use it before jumping into combat, but it&#8217;s also a\n\t\tBonus Action to activate, so you don&#8217;t really need to do so until you get\n\t\tStormborn and get flight and damage resistance while Wrath of the Sea is\n\t\tactive.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, this does have some challenges. The radius of the emanation is\n\t\t\tproblematically small at this level, forcing you to move into melee to use\n\t\t\tit until you get Aquatic Affinity at level 6. The Constitution save also\n\t\t\tmeans that this won&#8217;t work reliably, as Constitution saves are\n\t\t\tconsistently high throughout the CR range. You can&#8217;t dive into melee and\n\t\t\texpect this to always keep you out of trouble.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aquatic Affinity<\/span>: Increasing the area of\n\t\tWrath of the Sea means that you no longer need to get into melee to use it unless your target has reach,\n\t\twhich makes it a bit more powerful. The swim speed is nice, but in most\n\t\tgames it won&#8217;t have an impact.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stormborn<\/span>: Flight and resistance to three\n\t\tdamage types. None of them are particularly common, but three damage types\n\t\tis still a lot of protection.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Oceanic Gift<\/span>: Throwing this on your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s front-line martial characters can give them a huge boost, providing\n\t\tflight, damage resistances, and the Bonus Action damage and push effect. At\n\t\tthis level you get 3 Wild Shape uses per Short or Long Rest, so you can\n\t\tfrequently afford to put Wrath of the Sea on yourself and on an ally at the\n\t\tsame time. It gets even easier when you hit level 7 and get 4 uses per\n\t\trest.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stars\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circle of the Stars<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Stars is very powerful, adding a lot of both damage output and healing, as well as a support mechanic from Cosmic Omen. Starry Form is the class&#8217;s signature mechanic, serving as a sort of combat overdrive mode similar to the Barbarian&#8217;s Rage. Outside of this form you&#8217;re mostly reduced to core druid features, but you&#8217;re still sitting on a full spellcasting arsenal, so you&#8217;re not struggling by any means.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Stars is the only Druid subclass in the Player&#8217;s Handbook that\n\tdoes not get a list of additional prepared spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Star Map<\/span>: There are a total of four\n\t\tbenefits buried in this feature, and they&#8217;re all fantastic.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-none\">Star Map Focus<\/span>: While it&#8217;s not\n\t\t\t\tmechanically impactful, this is a great bit of flavor. I love the idea\n\t\t\t\tof a druid running around with a big heavy stone slab or a delicate\n\t\t\t\tcollection of glass disks, especially since even a tiny amount of damage\n\t\t\t\tto either would jeopardize years of delicate work.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guidance<\/span>: The best support cantrip,\n\t\t\t\tand you get it for free so you can enjoy other cantrips without feeling\n\t\t\t\tlike Guidance is a cantrip tax because it&#8217;s too good to skip.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guiding Bolt<\/span>: Very solid at low levels\n\t\t\t\tboth as a support option and for damage output.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Free Guiding Bolts<\/span>: Not only can you\n\t\t\t\tcast Guiding Bolt using your spell slots, you get to cast it for free a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of times per day equal to your Wisdom Modifier. This is done as a\n\t\t\t\tlevel 1 spell, but 4d6 damage and Advantage on the next attack against\n\t\t\t\tthat creature is better than most damage cantrips, even at 17th level.\n\t\t\t\t(Eldritch Blast+Invocations don&#8217;t count.) You won&#8217;t get enough free uses\n\t\t\t\tof Guiding Bolt to totally replace attack cantrips, unfortunately.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Because the free castings don&#8217;t use a spell slot, you can still cast\n\t\t\t\t\tspells with a spell slot using your Bonus Action (Healing Word, etc.)\n\t\t\t\t\ton the same turn. This makes it a great option even in situations\n\t\t\t\t\twhere normally spellcasters would resort to cantrips.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Starry Form<\/span>: Instead of locking you into a\n\t\tsingular combat mode, Starry Form has an attack mode, a healing mode, and a\n\t\tutility\/casting mode. Expect to use Starry Form in any noteworthy combat,\n\t\tbut remember that you only get a few uses per short rest, so may need to\n\t\tsurvive without it sometimes until your Wild Shape uses per rest scale.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Choosing which constellation to use is one of the most important tactical\n\t\t\tdecisions that you can make in an encounter. If you&#8217;re in close quarters\n\t\t\tand need to keep your spells going, go for Dragon. If your party is short\n\t\t\ton hit points going into the encounter, or if there&#8217;s some kind of hit\n\t\t\tpoint attrition issue (enemy has big AOE damage, or you&#8217;re fighting in a\n\t\t\tburning building), go for Chalice.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Otherwise, go for Archer and pump out damage as fast as you can. This\n\t\t\ttactical decision goes away at level 10 when you get Twinkling\n\t\t\tConstellations (In a way. Keep reading.), but, until then, this will be\n\t\t\tamong the hardest and most impactful choices that you make in a fight.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archer<\/span>: 1d8+Wis radiant damage as a\n\t\t\t\tBonus Action. It&#8217;s a spell attack, so the attack uses your Wisdom\n\t\t\t\tmodifier and doesn&#8217;t benefit from things like the Sharpshooter feat.\n\t\t\t\tThis is a great offensive option, and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t stop you\n\t\t\t\tfrom casting a level 1+ spell on the same turn is just spectacular. This\n\t\t\t\tis likely your go-to option in combat because it&#8217;s going to be useful in\n\t\t\t\tevery combat on every turn at any level. The damage improves at level\n\t\t\t\t10, but this would still be great even if it didn&#8217;t.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Chalice<\/span>: Roughly doubles the total\n\t\t\t\tamount healed by Healing Word, and you can target a creature not\n\t\t\t\ttargeted by your spell so that you can heal two creatures at once.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, this also encourages healing in combat, which you should try\n\t\t\t\tvery hard to avoid doing. The healing improves at level 10.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon<\/span>: Druids have a lot of\n\t\t\t\tConcentration spells, so guaranteeing a minimum roll of 10 on those\n\t\t\t\tchecks is really helpful. Concentration saves have a DC of 10 or half of\n\t\t\t\tthe damage taken, so you&#8217;re protected from any single source dealing up\n\t\t\t\tto 20 damage before considering your Constitution modifier.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Guaranteeing a minimum roll of 10 on Intelligence and Wisdom checks\n\t\t\t\t\tallows you to use this outside of combat, which is a great utility\n\t\t\t\t\toption if you have knowledge skills like Arcana or Nature. At level\n\t\t\t\t\t10, this adds a 20-foot fly speed, allowing you to fly while keeping\n\t\t\t\t\tyour Concentration on a spell.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cosmic Omen<\/span>: Tactically similar to the\n\t\tBard&#8217;s Bardic Inspiration and Cuttings Words features. You won&#8217;t be able to\n\t\tuse this as often as a Bard can use Bardic Inspiration, but up to 5 times\n\t\tper day is still extremely impactful, especially since you can use this as a\n\t\tReaction. The Weal\/Woe options are roughly equivalent, so when you roll to\n\t\tsee which one you get you&#8217;re essentially deciding if you get to use this\n\t\toffensively (weal) or defensively (woe) that day.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Twinkling Constellations<\/span>: More damage from\n\t\tArcher, more healing from Chalice, and flight from Dragon (even at just 20\n\t\tft. speed) are all big improvements. The ability to change your\n\t\tconstellation each turn <em>without spending an action<\/em> means that the\n\t\tdifficult tactical decision which you normally make when you activate Starry\n\t\tForm goes away, making your life much easier. Now you get to make that\n\t\tdecision every turn instead. Do you suffer from Analysis Paralysis? This\n\t\twill either make it way better or way worse.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Do you have an ally down at 0 hit points? Switch to chalice and heal\n\t\t\tthem. Need to maintain a Concentration spell? Turn on dragon, fly out of\n\t\t\treach and do your thing. The rest of the time? Archer.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Full of Stars<\/span>: A bit late, and strange on\n\t\ta subclass that&#8217;s so clearly intended to fill a back-line role, but consider\n\t\tthat the Druid has notoriously poor AC and just d8 hit points this is a\n\t\tfantastic improvement to your durability.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction While the core of the Druid\u2019s capabilities remains functional regardless of your Druid Circle, your choice of circle adds a set of unique capabilities to complement the Druid\u2019s core class features.
