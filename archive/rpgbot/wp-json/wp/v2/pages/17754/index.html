Generally when you think of a conjurer you think of summoning creatures, but conjuration is more than that: it also includes teleportation and spells which summon or create objects. School of Conjuration offers you a bit of everything that the Conjuration school of magic has to offer, but if you&#8217;re just here to play a summoner you won&#8217;t get anything to support that concept until 14th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, summoning creatures to aid you in combat becomes a central part of School of Conjuration&#8217;s tactics.

Previously, summon spells were complicated, difficult to use, and unpredictable since the DM was tasked with selecting what you actually get to summon. The new spells are consistently useful, easy to manage for both the player and the DM, and generally effective in a broad variety of situations. These additions make School of Conjuration considerably more appealing at level 10 and above than it was previously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">School of Conjuration Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-conjuration-ability-scores\">School of Conjuration Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-conjuration-races\">School of Conjuration Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-conjuration-feats\">School of Conjuration Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-conjuration-armor-and-weapons\">School of Conjuration Armor and Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-generic-conjurer\">Example Build &#8211; Generic Conjurer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

At the very least you can summon cylindrical\n\t\tobjects and roll them around in dungeons to set off traps, or create a\n\t\tsturdy object to use as cover.\n\t\t<p>If your DM allows it, creating a weapon with Conjuration Creation may be\n\t\t\tenough to overcome resistance to damage from non-magical attacks since the\n\t\t\tobject is &#8220;visibly magical&#8221;. You may even be able to create weapons made\n\t\t\tof special materials like adamantine or cold iron. Unfortunately, the size\n\t\t\tconstraints may limit your weapon options, so stick to stubby weapons like\n\t\t\taxes rather than long weapons like spears and longswords. Also note that\n\t\t\tthe weapon will disappear if it deals damage once, so it&#8217;s a single-use\n\t\t\tweapon. Maybe useful for rogues or if you just need one hit, but this\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t totally replace real weapons. It&#8217;s not clear if you can create expensive\n\t\t\titems like Alchemist&#8217;s Fire, but I don&#8217;t think doing so would cause problems\n\t\t\tbeyond very low levels where your available gold is limited.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Benign Transposition<\/span>: A great way to get\n\t\taround when there are enemies present, especially if you switch places with\n\t\tyour party&#8217;s Defender and drop them in the middle of a bunch of surprised\n\t\tenemies. Of course, the biggest benefit of Benign Transposition (getting you\n\t\tout of somewhere dangerous) can be entirely replaced by Misty Step, which\n\t\tcan be used as a Bonus Action at the cost of a 2nd-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Focused Conjuration<\/span>: This is great for\n\t\tkeeping your summoned creature around even if you take damage, but at this\n\t\tlevel you have plenty of ways to keep yourself out of trouble. Spells like\n\t\tShield, Absorb Elements, and Mirror Image are staple defensive options which\n\t\tdon&#8217;t require Concentration, and if you have a summoned creature there&#8217;s one\n\t\tmore ally on the field drawing attention away from you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Durable Summons<\/span>: 30 temporary hit points\n\t\tprovides as many additional hit points as casting a &#8220;Summon Creature&#8221; spell\n\t\ttwo or three spell levels higher (it varies by spell). That&#8217;s a huge\n\t\tincrease in durability, which means that you&#8217;re getting more mileage out of\n\t\tyour summon spells.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-conjuration-ability-scores\">School of Conjuration Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">any other wizard<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-conjuration-races\">School of Conjuration Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#races\" data-type=\"page\">any other wizard<\/a>.

Shepherd can support and buff their summons more effectively, but the Wizard has better and more diverse summon options, and is also a wizard when summoning stuff isn&#8217;t working. Shepherd is a better support summoner, but School of Conjuration Wizard is a better summoner offensively by virtue of being a wizard and having the Wizard&#8217;s powerful offensive options on top of their summons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll adjust things to take advantage of three +1 increases.

The breath weapon is nice, too, and it grants you damage resistance.<br><br>5th-level Summon Shadowspawn (Despair) DPR: 19.50<br><br>We&#8217;re still in Target DPR range, but the increased spell level isn&#8217;t the worth the cost for DPR alone. But remember that increasing the spell level also adds more AC and hit points, which can make your summoned creature stick around longer.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Focused Conjuration<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Creation<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>No more worrying about Concentration for our favorite spells. You still don&#8217;t want to draw attacks, but they are less scary.<br><br>Creation is an illusion spell, which feels odd, but it&#8217;s basically a bigger version of our Minor Creation feature. The 5-foot square limitation is considerably larger than &#8220;3 feet to a side&#8221;, though the limitation on materials may be more restrictive.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Scatter<br>&#8211; Any 1<\/td><td>Scatter allows us to grab all of our enemies and put them into a nice, neat space. Then we can have our allies drop area damage on them. If you summoned a creature with an aura, such as Summon Undead&#8217;s Putrid option, you might drop your enemies into the aura.<br><br>6th-level Summon Shadowspawn (Despair) DPR: 31.20<br><br>A third attack boosts our DPR quite a bit, but we&#8217;re still not up to High DPR based solely on our summoned creature&#8217;s attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Metamagic Adept<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>Grab Extended Spell and Subtle Spell. We usually want to extend our spells twice per day, but the ability to cast a summon without anyone knowing who did it can be very useful, or you may need it to cast Misty Step while gagged or magically silenced<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Plane Shift<br>&#8211; Teleport<\/td><td>Plane Shift is touch range, which means that you can deliver it through your familiar. Have your owl fly sneakily into position, then Plane Shift your enemy to somewhere that they&#8217;ll hate.<br><br>7th-level Summon Shadowspawn (Despair) DPR: 33.15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Durable Summons<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>Durable Summons adds a bunch of durability to our summoned creatures. While it&#8217;s certainly great with our go-to spells like Summon Aberration or Summon Draconic Spirit, you can also use it with Summon Woodland beings and get a ton of small creatures with a weirdly huge pool of hit points, then use them to swarm your enemies and prevent them from moving.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Maze<br>&#8211; Any 1<\/td><td>There aren&#8217;t any 8th-level summon spells, but 8th-level slots give our Tasha&#8217;s-era summons yet another attack.<br><br>8th-level Summon Shadowspawn (Despair) DPR: 46.80<br><br>A fourth and final attack boosts our DPR again, bringing us as close to High DPR as our summoned creature can get. We never get to High based on our summons alone, but sitting comfortably inside the Target DPR range without using our own turn for most of our career is still impressive.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Inspiring Leader<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>Inspiring Leader lets us put a bunch of temporary hit points on up to 6 creatures. That&#8217;s enough to cover our familiar, a summoned creature, and likely our entire party. Alternatively, if you&#8217;re using Conjure Woodland Beings, you could put temporary hp on 6 of them and get some more mileage out of your small army of damage sponges.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Gate<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/wish\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2788\">Wish<\/a><\/td><td>Gate is a really interesting way to summon a creature from another plane. You need to know their name, and you don&#8217;t control them, but they don&#8217;t get a save. If you know a friendly high-CR creature, you can call them up and say &#8220;Hey, I need a favor&#8221; in the middle of a fight. If things go well, they can probably go home before the spell ends. If not, you may owe them an apology and a promise that you&#8217;ll get them a Gate home in the morning.<br><br>9th-level Summon Shadowspawn (Despair) DPR: 49.40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Spell Mastery<br>&#8211; Any<br>&#8211; Misty Step or Web<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>Because summon spells don&#8217;t come online until 3rd-level spells, Spell Mastery can be a frustrating option for us. Our 1st-level option can be an easy go-to like Silvery Barbs or Shield.<br><br>Misty Step means that we can use Misty Step and Benign Transposition to teleport twice per turn and literally never need to walk again, which feels very thematically appropriate. But also consider Web so that you can restrain enemies while your party kills them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Feat: Lucky<br>Spells Known<br>&#8211; Any 2<\/td><td>We have everything we need, and the Wizard&#8217;s last two levels are underwhelming.

That sounds nice, but remember that your summoned creature spells get better stats and more attacks with higher-level spell slots.

Generally when you think of a conjurer you think of summoning creatures, but conjuration is more than that: it also includes teleportation and spells which summon or create objects. School of Conjuration offers you a bit of everything that the Conjuration school of magic has to offer, but if you&#8217;re just here to play a summoner you won&#8217;t get anything to support that concept until 14th level. Even so, summoning creatures to aid you in combat becomes a central part of School of Conjuration&#8217;s tactics.
