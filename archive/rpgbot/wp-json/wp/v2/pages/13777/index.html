The basic concept is that as a weapon increases in size, the weapon dice are added again for every step above Medium, as per the rules on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dmg\/dungeon-masters-workshop#Step11Damage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">page 278 of the DMG<\/a>. As an example, a large flail would do 2d8 bludgeoning damage, while a large maul would do 4d6 bludgeoning damage. The only thing keeping most PCs from using these weapons is that a creature has Disadvantage with any weapon sized too large for them. This penalty is enough to make the weapons a poor choice in most situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The way the math works, if we can get the Advantage required to defeat the Disadvantage, your DPR is usually better just having Advantage with a medium-sized weapon than having a straight roll with the large weapon. There are, of course, exceptions where the math swings so far in the other direction that even swinging the bigger weapon with Disadvantage beats the smaller weapon with Advantage. It\u2019s even possible to get that much of a swing with as little as the Archery fighting style and an oversized ranged weapon, or using the Bless spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If we could be Large somehow, this would also work, but instead of canceling out the Disadvantage it wouldn\u2019t occur to begin with. This would in turn allow the Large weapon user to gain Advantage if it were available. There are two reasonable ways to become Large. The spell Enlarge\/Reduce can do the trick, but the wording of the spell can become problematic. Since all of the target\u2019s equipment also enlarges, a Large weapon is suddenly Huge and thus remains too large for the user without doing a dumb manuver of dropping it and picking it up to get the effect off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The other method is to use the Rune Knight\u2019s Giant\u2019s Might feature. The advantage to this is that the Rune Knight doesn\u2019t increase in size relative to their previous size, instead becoming Large. Thus an already Large weapon does not grow to Huge. But there\u2019s another way to negate the Disadvantage that would not also give you Advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t see the target, and the target can\u2019t see you, then both Advantage and Disadvantage have been applied and negated, preventing any further modifications to the roll. The 1st-level spell Fog Cloud is the most accessible method of doing this. So we need a good large weapon and a reliable way to cast Fog Cloud or reliable access to Large size. In this build guide, we will put both of these methods onto a single character, but the most efficient way to do this is to split these requirements across multiple PCs, having a caster and a martial working in tandem.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#oversized-weapons-handbook-introduction\">Oversized Weapons Handbook Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-build-heavy-weapons-goliath\">The Build &#8211; Heavy Weapons Goliath<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race-goliath\">Race &#8211; Goliath<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background-and-skills\">Background and Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#but-is-it-any-good\">But is it any good?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#but-is-this-worth-it\">But is this worth it?<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

But we\u2019ll have the use of Giant\u2019s Might a number of times per day equal to PB, so we\u2019ll be gaining DPR by using a Large weapon as a Large creature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will start out being only useful in a few fights per day, but over time more of our fights will include fighting at Large or Huge size and firing tree-trunks at the enemy team. Depending on the pace of your game, you might even be able to get Large in every fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"but-is-this-worth-it\">But is this worth it?<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Well that\u2019s a bit of a tough call. First off, we\u2019re using one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/weaponized-bonus-actions\/#dpr-comparisons\">strongest DPR<\/a> options for weapons. Put side-by-side with the other options, the Hand Crossbow with Sharpshooter did more DPR thanks to the fact that the Archery fighting style is a multiplicative boost to DPR. So choice of weapon checks out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the whole being Large and having to lug around a Large weapon? What\u2019s the cost there? Well, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/rune-knight\/\">Rune Knight<\/a> is one of the stronger Fighter subclasses and we take enough levels in Fighter to get all the better Runes as well as Giant\u2019s Might. If this were any other weapon, it might be an issue to lug around, since a Large weapon weighs 8 times as much as a Medium one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>A Large Heavy Crossbow would weigh 144 lbs. but as a Medium Hand Crossbow is only 3 lbs, a Large is 24 lbs. Looking at it that way, it\u2019s only 6 lbs. more than the Medium Heavy Crossbow. So it seems being Large and lugging around a slightly more cumbersome crossbow isn\u2019t much of a cost either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then we took 8 levels in Warlock for what? Could we not have done all of this as a 20th-level Fighter? Yes, but now we have additional fun options. Fog Cloud is, in fact, very effective against anything that lacks either Blindsight or Tremorsense. If we can\u2019t be Large for some reason, we can instead cast Fog Cloud to break (Dis)Advantage, while also providing one of the stronger defensive buffs to the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because when we\u2019re in an area that is Heavily Obscured, we can\u2019t see the target and have Disadvantage, but because we\u2019re in an area that is Heavily Obscured, we are an unseen attacker, granting Advantage on the roll. These cancel each other out and no more Disadvantage in the form of an Oversized Weapon can be applied to the roll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This really works because enemies can\u2019t move during our turn and on our turn we can use movement to exit the cloud, determine which square to shoot, and then go back into the cloud to get all our benefits. And then we\u2019re also protected on every other creatures\u2019 turn by being Heavily Obscured.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oversized Weapons Handbook Introduction Oversized weapons are an interesting and hotly debated topic in 5e Dungeons and Dragons. The basic concept is that as a weapon increases in size, the weapon dice are added again for every step above Medium, as per the rules on page 278 of the DMG. As an example, a large flail would do 2d8 bludgeoning damage, while a large maul would do 4d6 bludgeoning damage. The only thing keeping most PCs from using these weapons is that a creature has Disadvantage with any weapon sized too large for them. This penalty is enough to make
