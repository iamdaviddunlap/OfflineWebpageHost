They can solve any problem, defeat any foe, and answer any question with a single spell. The chief philosophy of this document is to solve every problem with a single spell. A spellcaster carrying a few selections from this list should be prepared to handle nearly any problem which the world might present. This document catalogs some of the best spells available to Sorcerers and Wizards. It is in no way comprehensive, and generally does not exclude spells which can be added to the Sorcerer\/Wizard spell list by abnormal means like classes or class features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which tend to be more consistent than 3.5 handbooks. Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-so-many\">Why do you list so many spells when some are clearly better?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>First: Because they exist. I want you to understand that I considered other spells instead of stopping at the first spell I saw. I want you to understand that Mass Hold Person is bad, I want you understand <em>why<\/em> it&#8217;s bad, and I want you to understand what other options are available that make it bad. Second: Specialists wizards. If you&#8217;re a specialist wizard, not every spell on this list is available to you. Presenting as many options as possible means that you have options which should work no matter what school you chose to specialize in. Some schools are still better than other (evocation is still weak, conjuration is still amazing), but don&#8217;t let that stop you from specializing in your favorite school.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Daze<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Often overlooked, Daze has a small but useful niche at low levels. 4 hit\n\t\tdice covers most low-CR creatures, including things like Ogres (CR 3; 4 hit\n\t\tdice). Dazing a creature robs it of its turn, so in single-monster\n\t\tencounters this buys your entire party a free round. It does only work\n\t\tagainst humanoids, but humanoids are abundantly common enemies at low\n\t\tlevels. Goblins, orcs, anything in the Players Handbook. I can&#8217;t count how\n\t\tmany adventures I&#8217;ve played that have had frequent humanoid enemies for the\n\t\tfirst several character levels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1\">1st-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Color Spray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This will become gradually less effective as you gain levels, but the\n\t\t60-foot cone and the effects are amazing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dawn Burst<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: A weaker version of Glitterdust. If you just need to blind stuff, this\n\t\tworks fine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grease<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This spell was a mistake. A 1st-level spell which requires a Balance\n\t\tcheck to move. Balance. How many times have you put ranks into Balance?\n\t\tAnything that isn&#8217;t flying is susceptible to this. Most animals? Check.\n\t\tGolems? Check. Giants? Check. Throw it under the tarrasque and watch if fall\n\t\tover.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleep<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Only affects 4 HD of creatures, but with long range minutes\/level\n\t\tduration you can bring down whole encounters before they know you&#8217;re there.\n\t\tWalk up and coup de grace the victims.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2\">2nd-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness\/Deafness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Glitterdust is generally my go-to blinding effectm but Blindness\/Deafness\n\t\tis permanent and works on a Fortitude save. This makes it an excellent\n\t\tcounter to enemy spellcasters who will have trouble targeting ranged spells\n\t\twhen they can&#8217;t see.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Electric Loop<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Mediocre damage and the targets need to fail two saves to be stunned.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Entice Gift<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD\/Dr<\/a><\/sup>: Entice an enemy to give you their weapon. You&#8217;ll be standing advacent to\n\t\tthem, but at least they won&#8217;t have a weapon in hand.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ethereal Prison<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Essentially force cage for ethereal foes. Very effective, but very\n\t\tsituational. A scroll should be sufficient.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ghoul Touch<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Touch range is hard for most Sorcerers and Wizards, but if you have a\n\t\tfamiliar which can deliver touch spells you&#8217;re golden. Cast this before\n\t\tgoing into a fight, and have your familiar smack something. The duration is\n\t\tshort, so be sure to send an ally to finish off the target.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glitterdust<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A spell that should remain your arsenal well into high levels,\n\t\tGlitterdust grants the ability to reveal invisibile foes <em>and<\/em> blind\n\t\tthings in an area on one spell. Notably, this is one of the only things in\n\t\tthe game that requires a will save but isn&#8217;t mind-affecting. That means that\n\t\tit works on undead, which generally have poor will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hold Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Only affects one humanoid, and they get saves ever round. Go for Ghoul\n\t\tTouch instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lahm&#8217;s Finger Darts<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD<\/a><\/sup>: No save, and strikes unerringly. Hold off on using this until you can\n\t\tshoot 4 or 5 darts, at which point you do enough Dexterity damage to\n\t\treliably incapacitate most of the monster manual. The Strength damage can be\n\t\ta problem for especially weak wizards, and the loss of a useful hand is\n\t\tannoying, so make sure you have a Cleric handy to cast Lesser Restoration to\n\t\tget a few fingers back.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rebuke<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Daze a creature for a round. Great in single-enemy encounters. The extra\n\t\teffect on enemy spellcasters is neat, buf if you can get past their Will\n\t\tsaves you should be doing something more than forcing them to make\n\t\tConcentration checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stay the Hand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to keep enemies from killing you between turns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3\">3rd-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alter Fortune<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Force enemies to reroll when they save against your spells, or let your\n\t\tallies reroll when they failes saves against something lethal. The XP cost\n\t\tcan become a problem, so be sure not to rely on this except in\n\t\temergencies.<\/li>\n\t<!--\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Anticipate Teleportation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: 24 hour duration. Knowing when an enemy is going to teleport nearby and mess up your day is a huge advantage if there's any possibility of facing enemy spellcasters, and you get a free round to set up before they arrive. Throw done something unpleasant like Blade Barrier or Wall of Blades.<\/li>\n-->\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bands of Steel<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Immobilize the targety on a failed save or entangle them on a\n\t\tsuccess.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deep Slumber<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A bigger version of Sleep. Still very effective, but this will become\n\t\tuseless as you level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halt Undead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Essentially paralysis for three undead, and unintelligent undead don&#8217;t\n\t\tget a save. Attacking the targets unparalyzes them, so use the time to\n\t\tdestroy other creatures in the encounter or to prepare to quickly dispatch\n\t\tthe affected undead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Hesitate is generally better..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hesitate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Similarly effective to Hold Monster, but two levels lower and you can\n\t\tcast it as an immediate action. The target still gets to move and they get\n\t\textra saves, but the saves eat their swift action and without a Standard\n\t\taction they can&#8217;t do anything else interesting on their turns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shivering Touch<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">FB<\/a><\/sup>: 3d6 Dexterity damage can incapacitate many enemies. No save, but requires\n\t\ta touch attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: In theory a fantastic debuff. It works on Will saves, and most strongly\n\t\taffects creatures which tend to have poor Will saves. However, if you can\n\t\treliably defear those same creatures with a single Will save, why would you\n\t\tbother debuffing them? I&#8217;ve brought this into a few games and I never seem\n\t\tto find time to use it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stinking Cloud<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Difficult to use in confined spaces, but the ongoing saves make this\n\t\textremely reliable. Nauseated limits creatures to a single move action, so\n\t\tthey can try to walk away but likely won&#8217;t outrun your party. If your\n\t\ttargets escape the cloud, the 1d4+1 lingeing duration should be enough to\n\t\tclean up the encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unluck<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: If you can get past the target&#8217;s will save you should have already\n\t\tincapacitated them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wrack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD\/CD\/SC<\/a><\/sup>: Single target, but the target is helpless and blind for rounds per\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4\">4th-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bestow Curse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Robbing a creature of 50% of its turns is pretty great, but you should be\n\t\table to totally eliminate a creature with the same save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Black Tentacles<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Among the best area control spells in the game. Many creatures,\n\t\tespecially small ones and ones that rely on magic in combat, are extremely\n\t\tsusceptible to grappling. Black tentacles allows no save and no spell\n\t\tresistance, so the <em>only<\/em> way to resist it is to escape the grapple\n\t\tby some means.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celerity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: If you can end a fight with one more spell, use Celerity and hope you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t mess up.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Confusion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: More comical than effective, I don&#8217;t like Confusion because it&#8217;s\n\t\tunreliable. If you can affect a single creature with a Will save at the same\n\t\tDC it should be functionally dead, not running around like a babbling fool\n\t\twho might kill you in a few rounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Corporeal Insability<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PH<\/a><\/sup>: For the same save I would opt for Finger of Agony instead. Allowing the\n\t\tcreature to save again each round means that you can only count on a 1 round\n\t\tduration, while Finger of Agony&#8217;s 3 round duration should be enough to kill\n\t\tthe target.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Finger of Agony<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Nauseated prevents the target from doing anything potentially harmful,\n\t\tand the three round duration is great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Horrid Sickness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Nauseated is a great debuff, but the targets get to repeat the save as a\n\t\tmove action, potentially allowing them to take a standard action the turn\n\t\timmediately after you cast this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mirror Image<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Cast as an immediate action, and it gives you up to a 8\/9 miss chance\n\t\tonce you get enough images.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Polymorph<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: One the best and most confusing spells in the game. Polymorph&#8217;s arbitrary\n\t\tHit-Dice limitation allows you to adopt all sorts of insane forms. Hydra is\n\t\tone of my favorites, and I&#8217;ve had party members turn an impending TPK into a\n\t\tresounding victory based solely on this spell. With minutes\/level duration,\n\t\tyou may be able to walk through several encounters on a single casting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Phantasmal Killer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: One of the earliest true save-or-die spells, but it allows 2 saves and\n\t\tsince it&#8217;s both a Fear effect and Mind-Affecting lots of things will get\n\t\tbonuses on the saves or will be immune to it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resilient Sphere<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A poor man&#8217;s force cage. The target can still &#8220;breath normally&#8221;, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll need to come up with some other shenanigans to kill the target.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Solid Fog<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Perhaps an abnormal recommendation, Solid Fog is a fantastic component of\n\t\tany area control combination. Need to pin down fast-moving enemies? Solid\n\t\tFog. Need to wear down a tough enemy who you&#8217;re having trouble affecting?\n\t\tSolid Fog and Blade Barrier or Wall of Fire. If you have blindsense or\n\t\tsomething similar you can still get a lot done despite the visibility\n\t\tlimitations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Thief<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: A weaker version of Reaving Dispel. See Reaving Dispel under 9th-level\n\t\tspells, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Shape<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A lot of adventuring takes place in places with stone, so this will\n\t\talmost always work. There are obvious uses like making cover or obstacles,\n\t\tbut there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from encasing your enemies in a nice thick\n\t\twooden box with no breathing holes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5\">5th-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Baleful Polymorph<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Enemy is now a small harmless animal. They have a ridiculous number of\n\t\thit points, but they&#8217;re no longer a problem. Turn them into a clam if you&#8217;re\n\t\tunderwater, a flying squirrel if you&#8217;re in the air, or a turtle if you&#8217;re on\n\t\tthe ground. Basically anything that&#8217;s vulnerable, but technically not\n\t\t&#8220;lethal&#8221; so they don&#8217;t get the +4 bonus on the save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dismissal<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Outsiders become increasingly common at high levels, even if you&#8217;re not\n\t\ton their home plane. Send them home. Keep in mind that many high-CR\n\t\toutsiders have Plane Shift and can return to the plane you&#8217;re on, but Plane\n\t\tShift doesn&#8217;t provide precise enough transport that they can return to face\n\t\tyou again immediately.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloudkill<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: AOE Constitution damage. Combine this with Solid Fog or other effects\n\t\twhich prevent enemies from moving out of the way.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dominate Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Only works on humanoids, but when it works it works\n\t\t<em>really<\/em> well.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feedblemind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Cripples other sorcerers and wizards, and they get -4 on the save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flesh to Ice<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">FB<\/a><\/sup>: Essentially Flesh to Stone on spell level early, but it&#8217;s a little harder\n\t\tto thaw the subject again later if you choose to do so. Don&#8217;t use this on\n\t\tanyone holding loot, but on everything else this works fine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flesh to Salt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SS<\/a><\/sup>: Essentially the same as Flesh to Ice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Monster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The target gets another save every round, but even if they only lose one\n\t\tround that could be enough to win the fight for you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Power Word Disable<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RotD<\/a><\/sup>: If the target is already below 50 hit points you can probably kill\n\t\tthem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Touch of Vecna<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Permanent paralysis is like death, but you can take the creature home for\n\t\tquestioning and such.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Transmute Rock to Mud<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Combined with Transmute Mud to Rock you can turn an entire room into a\n\t\tReflex save or die. Trap your enemies in chest-deep stone and leave them\n\t\tthere.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stop Heart<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD<\/a><\/sup>: Save or die, essentially. The drug component costs 10gp and you need to\n\t\tconsume it, so be sure to check the drug rules to prevent it from becoming a\n\t\tproblem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch of Chaos<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">EoE<\/a><\/sup>: Disgusting and crazy, but you can kill people with the same save.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6\">6th-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Acid Fog<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Fantastic if you can keep enemies within the area long enough to kill\n\t\tthem, but at only 2d6 damage per round that&#8217;s unlikely without another\n\t\tspell. If you&#8217;re going to combine two spells, there are better\n\t\tcombinations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circle of Death<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s hard to argue with outright killing everything in the room. The\n\t\t500gp material component can become a problem if you rely on this too\n\t\theavily, so try to rely on other options where possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flesh to Stone<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save-or-suck. Unfortunately, if you use it on a creature\n\t\twith gear you&#8217;ll need to use Stone to Flesh to unpetrify it. Nothing a bit\n\t\tof chiselling or some manacles won&#8217;t fix. Fantastic, but Flesh to Ice\/Salt\n\t\tare a level lower and just as effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fleshshiver<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">: As your caster level improves, so does this spell. At high levels many\n\t\t\tenemies stop scaling based on hit dice, so you may still be guaranteed the\n\t\t\tfree 1 round of stun. After that, this is still a great save-or-suck\n\t\t\tspell. Nauseated for 1d4+2 rounds means that the target loses all of the\n\t\t\timportant parts of their turn for at least 3 turns, and on top of that\n\t\t\tthey take a nice pile of damage.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"> <\/a>\n\t<li><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Freezing Glance<\/span><sup><\/sup><\/a><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">FB<\/a>: Freeze on target in place per\n\t\tround. Basically hold monster every round for rounds per level.<\/li>\n\t<!--\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Greater Anticipate Teleportation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: If one round of free setup isn't enough to win a fight, three probably won't be either. You should use spell slots that are this high level for something better, like a spell that will turn the one round from Anticipate Teleportation into a win condition.<\/li>\n-->\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mass Suggestion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: For hours per level you can convince enemies to do something that isn&#8217;t\n\t\tcausing you trouble, like going and taking a nap.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mummify<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SS<\/a><\/sup>: Save-or-die on one creature as a touch attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ooze Puppet<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Effectively dominate monster for oozes. Oozes have terrible saving\n\t\tthrows, so the DC shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. It&#8217;s hard to justify a spell which\n\t\tonly works on such an uncommon creature type, but a scroll wouldn&#8217;t hurt.\n\t\tWith day\/slevel duration, you can get a lot of mileage out of your pet ooze\n\t\tbefore you eventually need to kill it or renew the spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Overwhelm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Flesh to Stone is a much simpler way to incapacitate a foe\n\t\tsemi-lethaly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Word Nauseate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RotD<\/a><\/sup>: No save, and Nauseated limits targets to a (largely useless) move\n\t\taction.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Smoky Confinement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Carry your party around in bottles, then release them like pokeballs. The\n\t\t100gp material cost is annoying, but the ability to non-lethally capture\n\t\tenemies can be very useful. There are other ways to do this, but generally\n\t\tthey require you to carry around a body of some sort.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Undeath to Death<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Circle of Death for the undead. See Circle of Death, above.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wages of Sin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>: Turn whole encounters against their allies. Even if some enemies pass the\n\t\tsave, the few who fail will do enough damage to tip the fight in your favor.\n\t\tNo somatic components, so you can use this safely in a grapple.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7\">7th-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Antimagic Ray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Dr\/SC<\/a><\/sup>: I really want this spell to be amazing, but it just isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a will\n\t\tsave that essentially disables spellcasters, but you can just use Finger of\n\t\tDeath instead with the same save. Kiss of Draconic Defiance is arguably\n\t\tbetter at preventing enemy spellcasting since it affects multiple\n\t\ttargets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Banishment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: AOE Dismissal, and you can boost your caster level to overcome spell\n\t\tresistance and the DC by presenting some objects. Facing demons? Open up\n\t\tyour trench-coat full of holy water and holy symbols of good deities. Facing\n\t\tcelestials? Show off some unholy water (yes it&#8217;s a thing) and symbols of\n\t\tevil deities. Fire elementals? Pour out your waterskin. Air elementals?\n\t\tUm&#8230; rocks, I guess?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Constricting Chains<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>: No save and no spell resistance. At medium range you can cast this from\n\t\tover 200 feet away and spend over a minute doing whatever you like while the\n\t\ttarget struggles pointlessly to escape. The nonlethal damage really just\n\t\tadds insult to injury. You take 1d2 points of Strength drain to cast this,\n\t\tbut who cares? You&#8217;re a sorcerer\/wizard! What are you going to do with\n\t\tStrength? Carry loot? That&#8217;s the fighter&#8217;s job.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Control Undead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Similar to Undeath to Death, and affects a similar number of hit dice.\n\t\tWith minutes per level duration you can probably drag one encounter into the\n\t\tnext encounter and make the two kill each other. Absent that option, command\n\t\tthe undead to destroy themselves. The spell doesn&#8217;t allow additional saves,\n\t\tso you can make them do whatever you want totally unimpeded.<\/li>\n\t<!--\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Body<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Choose air. Oh man, choose air. Hours per level flight with perfect maneuverability. Immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, critical hits, and flanking.<\/li>\n-->\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evil Glare<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: For rounds per level you can stare at one creature and save-or-suck\n\t\tparalyze it for 1d8 rounds. The fact that Clerics get this too and can use\n\t\tDivine Metamagic \/ Persist Spell to use this all day is just cruel. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;ve got that combination running you can basically take the day off from\n\t\tspellcasting and just glare at people while your party kills them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Rebuke<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save or die. If they manage to not die, they&#8217;re still dazed\n\t\tso they still ost an entire turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Finger of Death<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Straight to the point. Kills stuff dead on a Fortitude save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Force Cage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An astounding 2 hours per level duration gives you lots of options. If\n\t\tyou need to kill the target, use the barred version and fill the cube with\n\t\tCloudkill or Blade Barrier or something else unpleasant. The 1500gp\n\t\tcomponent is going to get expensive, so don&#8217;t make this your go-to for every\n\t\tfight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghost Trap<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM\/SC<\/a><\/sup>: Incorporeal creatures, especially undead like shadows and wraiths, are a\n\t\thuge pain. They like to do things like hide inside of walls and reach out to\n\t\tattack you. Turning them corporeal while they&#8217;re inside walls should be\n\t\tsufficiently lethal that they&#8217;re no longer a problem. Since this is an area\n\t\tand you&#8217;re not targeting anything, you don&#8217;t need line of effect like you do\n\t\twith other options like Control Undead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Glass Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: If you want to turn an enemy into something breakable, use flesh to ice.\n\t\tIf you want to melt a hole in a wall, use Disintegrate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hide from Dragons<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Dr\/SC<\/a><\/sup>: Not nearly as useful as Hide from Undead, but at this high level dragons\n\t\tare a serious threat. A scroll of this can save your party&#8217;s life, but I\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t bother learning this unless you&#8217;re in a dragon-heavy campaign.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hiss of Sleep<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Multi-target save-or-suck with no spell resistance. This is better than\n\t\tMass Hold Monster, which is a 9th-level spell in all ways but one: Hiss of\n\t\tsleep&#8217;s area of effect is measure from you instead of from a point at range.\n\t\tOf course, even short range is pretty impressive by this level. At minimum,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re looking at a 60-foot radius from where you&#8217;re standing, which is\n\t\teasily enough to encompass most encounters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Kiss of Draconic Defiance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Dr<\/a><\/sup>: Make every spellcaster in the area have a ton of problems casting spells.\n\t\tYour save DC probably scales a lot faster than most spellcaster&#8217;s Fortitude\n\t\tsaves, so this will probably stop several spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plane Shift<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Useful both as an escape mechanism and as an offensive option. Send\n\t\tenemies to a plane where they&#8217;ll die, like your demiplane full of highly\n\t\tlethal traps and golems and stuff. Or take your buddies on a cool vacation,\n\t\tlike to your demiplane full of highly lethal traps and golems and stuff.\n\t\tMake sure to carry a bunch of tuning forks for various planes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mass Hold Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Hiss of Sleep is objectively better; it affects more things, it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tallow additional saves, it doesn&#8217;t allow spell resistance, and it affects a\n\t\tlarger AOE. Even if you specifcally need to paralyze humanoids, Transix is\n\t\tconsiderably better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mass Flesh to Salt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SS<\/a><\/sup>: Save or suck in an AOE.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Insanity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: I dislike this for the same reason I dislike Confusion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Word Blind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 1d4+1 isn&#8217;t long enough to justify for healthy opponents, and if the\n\t\ttarget is weak enough for the other categories you can just disintegrate\n\t\tthem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Radiant Assault<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Long range AOE that dazes creatures on a failed save and does a bit of\n\t\tdamage. 1d6 rounds of Daze is pretty good, but if you want to disable\n\t\tenemies on a will save you can do better with Hiss of Sleep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reverse Gravity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Trap land-bound foes in mid-air and let your allies throw rocks at them\n\t\tuntil they die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Solipsism<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save or suck with rounds\/level duration. Hiss of Sleep is\n\t\tbetter, but this is great for illusionists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stun Ray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Guaranteed stun, even if the the target passes the save. Arguably better\n\t\tthan Power Word Stun.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transfix<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Hours per level duration and the targets only get extra saves if they&#8217;re\n\t\tattacked. Mass Hold Person doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to this, and they&#8217;re the\n\t\tsame spell level and affect the same targets. Weirdly, this doesn&#8217;t affect\n\t\thumanoids larger than medium, so creatures can get around this with Enlarge\n\t\tPerson. I don&#8217;t know why.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8\">8th-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blackfire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Nauseates the target, and does Constitution damage. This won&#8217;t win the\n\t\tfight immediately, but it has the ability to spread to other creatures. So\n\t\tlong as your allies aren&#8217;t affected accidently (or on purpose; you could\n\t\tturn a summoned monster into a blackfire vehicle), this could end an entire\n\t\tencounter with one spell. Still, I generally prefer spells which work a bit\n\t\tfaster than this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Chain Dispel<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Technically not a win condition, but if you&#8217;re facing groups of buffed\n\t\tenemies this can make a big different. Targeted dispel magic on multiple\n\t\ttargets with a +25 caster level bonus cap.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Bestow Curse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD\/CD<\/a><\/sup>: More effective than Bestow Curse, but has the same issue. Just kill\n\t\tthem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Shout<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Guaranteed deafness for a few rounds, which provides a small handicap to\n\t\tspellcasters. The damage is poor, but an AOE stun can be fairly useful.\n\t\tUnfortunately, Greater Shout has somatic and focus components, and depending\n\t\tsolely on a verbal component is one of Shout&#8217;s only redeeming qualities.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gutwrench<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD<\/a><\/sup>: Finger of death is a bit more direct, but this works on a different save.\n\t\tIf it works, you also get some temporary hit points. If it doesn&#8217;t work,\n\t\t10d6 damage is a nice consolation prize.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Irresistible Dance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 1d4+1 rounds of lowered AC, considerably lowered reflex saves, and free\n\t\tattacks of opportunity for all of your melee allies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Last Judgement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>: This only affects humanoids, monstrous humanoids, and giants so it&#8217;s\n\t\treally situational at such a high level. However, if you can find someone to\n\t\tuse it on it&#8217;s very effective. Targets that pass the save still take 3d6\n\t\tWisdom damage, which is enough to incapacitate many enemies and cripple\n\t\tClerics and other Wisdom-based spellcasters. No somatic component, so you\n\t\tcan use it in a grapple.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maze<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: No save! Remove a creature from a fight for up to 10 minutes. If it has\n\t\tless than 10 Intelligence you&#8217;re guaranteed the full 10 minutes. If you use\n\t\tthis on a single foe, use the time it&#8217;s gone to fill the area with\n\t\tunpleasant things like caltrops and bonfires and blade barriers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Word Stun<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The only redeeming quality of Power Word Stun is that it doesn&#8217;t allow a\n\t\tsave. You can affect creatures with up to 50 more hit points than Power Word\n\t\tPetrify, but the 1d4 round duration means that you can only gurantee a\n\t\tsingle round of stun. You can probably do just as well with Fleshshiver,\n\t\twhich is two levels lower.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power Word Petrify<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RotD<\/a><\/sup>: Better than Power Word Kill since it&#8217;s a spell level lower but\n\t\tincapacitates enemies just as well. Be careful about smashing petrified foes\n\t\twho are carrying loot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sunburst<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Permanent blindness. Undead take a ton of bonus damage, and if they&#8217;re\n\t\tvulnerable to bright light (natural sunlight, etc.) they&#8217;re instantly\n\t\tdestroyed. At this level there are many undead which fall into this category\n\t\t(vampires, etc.) so this is a fantastic option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wrathful Castigation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save or die. If they pass, they save again and are dazed\n\t\tfor one round on a failure, then take a penalty to will saves for rounds per\n\t\tlevel so you can try again the next round with a better chance of\n\t\tsucceeding. Reliable, effective, and awesome.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9\">9th-level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Black Blade of Disaster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Very cool, but straight damage (even at 2d6 per caster level) is rarely\n\t\tthe way a supremacy caster gets things done. Potentially useful in\n\t\tencounters with a huge number of enemies, but even then you have plenty of\n\t\tAOE save-or-suck options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blinding Glory<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>: In a 100 foot per caster level radius, all evil creatures are blinded. No\n\t\tsave. No spell resistance. Hours per level duration. Considering how\n\t\timportant sight is, this shuts down many encounters. Good luck hiding, but\n\t\twhen everything that wants to kill you is blind I suppose hiding doesn&#8217;t\n\t\treally matter. There appears to be an error that never got errata; the spell\n\t\tlists the area as &#8220;centered on you&#8221;, but the spell has a listed range. I\n\t\twould assume that the range is a typo, but an extremely permissive DM might\n\t\tlet you throw this on another creature or an item.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detonate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re going for a save-or-die spell, Wail of the Banshee is better.\n\t\tThe secondary explosion is neat, but not very effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dominate Monster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The king of Enchantment spells. Days per level duration, and near-total\n\t\tcontrol over the target. They still get a save if you give them orders\n\t\tcontrary to their nature (such as attacking their allies), but a clever\n\t\tplayer can get away with a lot without allowing extra saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Frostfell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">: AOE Flesh to Ice, and 1d6 per caster level cold damage if targets\n\t\t\tsurvive the save.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"> <\/a>\n\t<li><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Imprisonment<\/span><sup><\/sup><\/a><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>: A fantastic spell to use on your\n\t\tcampaign&#8217;s BBEG. If you don&#8217;t know their name and a little bit about them by\n\t\tthis level, you probably missed a lot of clues that the DM worked very hard\n\t\tto create.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mass Hold Monster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Hiss of Sleep is better, affects a larger area, and is 2 spell levels\n\t\tlower.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mindrape<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD<\/a><\/sup>: Depends heavily on how permissive your DM is if you want to do anything\n\t\tother than single-target permanent insanity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Word Kill<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Power Word Petrify is just as effective, and one level lower.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reality Maelstrom<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: A nice size AOE, especially thanks to the secondary area. Sending enemies\n\t\tto another plane generally means that they&#8217;re no longer a problem. At least,\n\t\tuntil they find a way to catch up to you later. Don&#8217;t use this around loot,\n\t\tor you&#8217;ll end up sending treasure to a random plane.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reaving Dispel<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Technically not a win condition, but deserves an honorable mention. Walk\n\t\tinto a fight with an enemy spellcaster and steal all of their buffs. Note\n\t\tthat the caster level cap is only +20, so Chaining Dispel can be a better\n\t\toption if you&#8217;ve invested in caster level boosts. Chaining Dispel also\n\t\taffects multiple enemies, which can be a huge advantage in many fights.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shapechange<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Good for a whole mountain of reasons. You can turn yourself into all\n\t\tsorts of crazy things, and at this high level many enemies stop scaling with\n\t\thit dice. Some extremely powerful creatures have no more than 20 hit dice.\n\t\tEven some monsters from the epic level handbook are options for\n\t\tShapechange&#8217;s 25 HD cap. You get to change forms every round for free, and\n\t\tsince the spell is based on Polymorph you heal every time you do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sphere of Destruction<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Black Blade of Disaster is better for killing stuff. This is mostly a\n\t\tutility spell for burrowing through walls.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Time Stop<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 1d4+1 rounds of doing whatever you want. Cast buffs, set up area control,\n\t\tsummon stuff, enclose enemies in stone\/force\/ice\/whatever. Generally go nuts\n\t\tas long as you don&#8217;t directly target an enemy with something, but that&#8217;s\n\t\thardly a limitation with 10 levels of spells to draw from.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Utterdark<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD\/LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Not nearly as effective as Blinding Glory thanks to the Ebon Eyes\n\t\tspell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wail of the Banshee<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: AOE save or die. No hit dice limit, it doesn&#8217;t affect you, and it only\n\t\thas a verbal component so you can use it while grappled.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weird<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Weird is a strange spell. It&#8217;s primary goal is to kill stuff in an AOE.\n\t\tHowever, since the spell is an illusion, a Fear effect, and it&#8217;s\n\t\tMind-affecting, many creatures will be immune or resistant to it. For those\n\t\tcreatures which aren&#8217;t immune, two saves means that this spell is likely to\n\t\tbe resisted. But if a target manages to succeed on both saves, they&#8217;re still\n\t\tstunned for a round. They take a little bit of damage and some Strength\n\t\tdamage, but the stun is the real winner here. One round of guaranteed stun\n\t\tin an AOE is fantastic, and gives you plenty of time to set up all sorts of\n\t\tother shenanigans.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wish<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The most powerful spell in the game. The xp cost is brutal, bot for a\n\t\tvery good reason. If you don&#8217;t know what to bring into a fight, bring Wish.\n\t\tIf you go beyond the items in the bulleted list of effects, be very\n\t\tcautious. DMs frequently interpret wishes &#8220;monkey&#8217;s paw&#8221; style, so they\n\t\toften have dire consequences. Keep the wording of your wishes literal,\n\t\tprecise, and brief so that there is as little room for interpretation as\n\t\tpossible. &#8220;I wish that (the enemy&#8217;s name) was in the place in the multiverse\n\t\tmost likely to result in his or her immediate and irrevocable destruction\n\t\texcluding any location within one mile of my present
