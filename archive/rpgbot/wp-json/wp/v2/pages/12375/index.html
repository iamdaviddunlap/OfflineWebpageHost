Bear is for Defenders, Eagle is for Strikers, and Wolf is\n\t\tfor Barbarians with other Strikers in the party.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bear<\/span>: You are basically an unstoppable\n\t\t\t\tpile of damage resistance and hit points. This is the go-to option at\n\t\t\t\tthis level.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eagle<\/span>: Running around between\n\t\t\t\tenemies isn&#8217;t something the Barbarian does on a regular basis,\n\t\t\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re the party&#8217;s only Defender.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: Barbarians already get Fast Movement, so your speed should be fine.\n\t\t\t\tIf you really feel like you need this, talk to your DM about using the\n\t\t\t\tOptional Class Feature Instinctive Pounce.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tiger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: Jumping almost never matters in a game where you can gain magical\n\t\t\t\tflight. This is especially frustrating because it only applies when\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re raging.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wolf<\/span>: This is extremely helpful for\n\t\t\t\tcharacters in your party who are heavily-dependent on attacks like\n\t\t\t\trangers and rogues. Rogues can get Sneak Attack for attacking enemies\n\t\t\t\tthreatened by an ally, so Advantage isn&#8217;t strictly required, but giving\n\t\t\t\tthem Advantage makes them considerably more reliable and results in a\n\t\t\t\thuge increase in average damage output. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t do\n\t\t\t\tanything directly helpful for you, but acting as a force multiplier for\n\t\t\t\tyour party may be more impactful, especially in a large party.\n\t\t\t\t<p>The text of the feature specifies that it applies to your &#8220;friends&#8221;\n\t\t\t\t\trather than your &#8220;allies&#8221;, which is a weird inconsistency. As far as I\n\t\t\t\t\tcan tell this was an error and you don&#8217;t actually need to be friends\n\t\t\t\t\twith your allies for them to benefit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Aspect of the Beast<\/span>: Remember that you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need to select the same animal which you selected for Totem Spirit.\n\t\tThe PHB options are mostly for flavor, but the options introduced in the\n\t\tSword Coast Adventurer&#8217;s Guide are considerably better.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bear<\/span>: Carrying capacity is usually\n\t\t\t\tignored, and you can always buy a mule to carry your heavy stuff or you\n\t\t\t\tcan play a race like the Goliath which gets the same benefit to carrying\n\t\t\t\tcapacity. The advantage on Strength checks only affects objects, and\n\t\t\t\tbreaking objects isn&#8217;t a frequent activity in most campaigns.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Eagle<\/span>: Dim light imposes Disadvantage\n\t\t\t\ton Perception checks, so even if you have Darkvision you&#8217;re susceptible\n\t\t\t\tto ambushes if it&#8217;s dark. This solves that issue, so if you&#8217;re going to\n\t\t\t\tspend a lot of time fighting underground or at night (you know, like\n\t\t\t\teagles do) this can be a significant advantage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: Overland travel generally happens in plot time, so in most campaigns\n\t\t\t\tthis will have no perceivable effect. But if your table does track travel time,\nthis is very good.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tiger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: Barbarians have very limited capabilities outside of combat, so\n\t\t\t\tadding two additional skills can do a lot to make you more useful to the\n\t\t\t\tparty. However, if you&#8217;re desperate for more skills you should first\n\t\t\t\ttalk to your DM about the Optional Class Feature Primal Knowledge. You\n\t\t\t\tmight even combine the two if you really want lots of skills.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wolf<\/span>: Only applies to you, and even then the benefits are both extremely situational and can be better handled by Elk. Doubling your travel pace with Elk, then halving it to move stealthily is the same thing as not halving your speed to move stealthily.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Walker<\/span>: Commune With Nature isn&#8217;t\n\t\tvery powerful as far as divinations go, but it can be very useful when\n\t\texploring new terrain.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Totemic Attunement<\/span>: Totemic attunement is\n\t\tan improvement to your combat tactics established by Totem Spirit.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bear<\/span>: Force nearby enemies to attack\n\t\t\t\tyou instead of your allies. They can still move away from you, but that\n\t\t\t\tdraws an Opportunity Attack from a huge horrifying Barbarian.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eagle<\/span>: Fly over enemies. Fly into the\n\t\t\t\tair to hit a flying wizard, then land on something until your next turn.\n\t\t\t\tThis might even look like Wushu fighting if you do it right.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: This is a cool trip mechanic which allows you to knock an enemy prone\n\t\t\t\twithout cutting into your attacks. You need to use it on large or\n\t\t\t\tsmaller enemies, which covers most enemies, but at high level you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tfrequently encounter very large foes which won&#8217;t be affected by this\n\t\t\t\tability and it really sucks to face big dangerous foes and not be able\n\t\t\t\tto use your most unique tactic.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tiger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: Basically the Charger feat but better. Not only can you still use\n\t\t\t\tExtra Attack, but you gain an additional attack as a Bonus Action.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wolf<\/span>: Knocking an enemy prone gives\n\t\t\t\tyou Advantage on attacks against them, including your second attack with\n\t\t\t\tthe Extra Attack feature. Allies threatening that enemy can already get\n\t\t\t\tAdvantage from you if you selected Wolf for your Totem Spirit, and you\n\t\t\t\tcan already get Advantage from Reckless Attack, so this may not be very\n\t\t\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"path-of-the-totem-warrior-ability-scores\">Path of the Totem Warrior Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re Barbarians.

You can\u2019t cast spells and you can\u2019t concentrate and you can\u2019t wear Heavy Armor. Oh except you can totally wear Heavy Armor and only lose anything that specifically says it stops working when you\u2019re wearing Heavy Armor. Because Heavy Armor doesn\u2019t prevent Rage, it only prevents certain benefits of Rage. Admittedly, all of the basic benefits of Rage such as Rage Damage, resistance, and Advantage on Strength are part of the prevented list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I\u2019m bringing this up here is that if we were to start as a class with Heavy Armor Proficiency, that does give us the option to play a little weird with a Full Plate Barbarian.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things that still work while Raging in Full Plate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Bear Totem<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wolf Totem<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tiger Totem<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Every Totemic Attunement<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Things that are not Spells even if they cost a spell slot<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">War Wizard<\/span>: So, the only cost to using the Arcane Deflection Reaction for +2 AC or +4 on a save, is not casting a spell the next turn.

In particular, Hexblade can curse a target for crits on 19 and bonus damage, synergizing with Brutal Critical. Genie patrons on the other hand get the same bonus damage as a Hexblade, but only once per turn on every turn instead of all attacks on one target for a minute. Also if you take Genie to 6 you can non-concentration Fly for 10 minutes PB times per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Paladin<\/span>: You can Smite while raging.
