Implements grant an item buff (&#8220;Resonant Power&#8221;), a base focus power, access to a unique list of focus powers, and a spell of every level which the occultist can cast. Occult Adventures presents 8 implement schools, and since Occultists get just 7 choices you will need to omit at least one, and you&#8217;ll omit more if you choose to re-select the same implement school to get another set of spells from that school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>When selecting implement schools remember that the only focus powers you are forced to take are the &#8220;base&#8221; focus powers. It&#8217;s perfectly fine to pick up a school for the resonant power, base focus power, and spells but never pick up any of the focus powers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The specific implements for each implement school are intentionally not addressed below. The specific form of the implement generally doesn&#8217;t matter. Each school allows enough options that you shouldn&#8217;t have any conflicts. If your GM is a stickler, you can select the items that aren&#8217;t normal equipment and just hang them all from your character&#8217;s body on strings and walk around like a set of magical wind chimes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>. If you would like help with Pathfinder options not covered here, please <a href=\"mailto:RPGBOT@RPGBOT.net\">email me<\/a> and I may be able to provide additional assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks. Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"implement-schools\">Implement Schools<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"abjuration\" class=\"rating-green\">Abjuration Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you might expect, Abjuration centers on defensive options. All of the powers presented by the Abjuration Implements School can generally be handled with other means, many of which are already easily accessible to the Occultist. However, some of the better options also trigger on an Immediate action, allowing you to call up defenses quickly without cutting into your turn significantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resonant Power: Warding Talisman<\/span> (Su): A\n\tresistance bonus is an absolute essential in Pathfinder. You want it to be as\n\tbig as possible as quickly as possible. That said, it&#8217;s also one of the\n\tcheaper bonuses to put on a magic item.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Focus Power: Mind Barrier<\/span> (Sp): The\n\tswift action option is essentially useless unless you&#8217;re taking ongoing damage\n\tor intend to walk into a damaging effect, but the immediate action option can\n\tprevent quite a bit of damage. The damage prevented scales with level, but the\n\tfocus cost never increases so this ability remains useful as you gain levels.\n\tThis really helps compensate for the Occultist&#8217;s d8 hit dice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Focus Powers<\/span>: A few decent defensive\n\toptions, but nothing that you absolutely need.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aegis<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s pretty rare that you\n\t\tneed to switch out armor abilities, and armor\/shield bonuses are among the\n\t\tleast useful AC bonuses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Energy Shield<\/span> (Sp): Activating this as a\n\t\tswift action means that you activate and re-activate it without\n\t\tmeainingfully cutting into your turn. The ability to activate it as an\n\t\timmediate action means that you can protect yourself from unexpected energy\n\t\tattacks and traps.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Globe of Negation<\/span> (Sp): This is a\n\t\tfantastic defensive option, but it&#8217;s also situational. If you fight a lot of\n\t\tspellcasters you&#8217;re a fool not to consider this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Loci Sentry<\/span> (Sp): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Planar Ward<\/span> (Sp): Situational. The\n\t\tOccultist&#8217;s Magic Circles ability will generally be more effective,\n\t\tespecially once you can create circles as a full round action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Unraveling<\/span> (Sp): If no one else in your\n\t\tparty can cast Dispel Magic, this is absolutely essential. The range is a\n\t\tbit of an issue, and you can&#8217;t dispel multiple effects, but generally when\n\t\tyou need dispel magic the most it&#8217;s to remove one specific, pesky effect.\n\t\tFor just 1 focus point it&#8217;s a good trade.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"conjuration\" class=\"rating-red\">Conjuration Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Extremely few useful options. For some reason the conjuration school tries to turn the Occultist into a healer, but it doesn&#8217;t do a particularly good job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Resonant Power: Casting Focus<\/span> (Su):\n\tOccultists don&#8217;t get many interesting Conjuration spells which can\n\tmeaningfully benefit from this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Focus Power: <\/span> (Sp): Most of the time\n\twhen people cast Summon Monster it&#8217;s to get one creature, and the one-minute\n\tduration is great at levels 1 through 10. Unfortunately, the level of\n\tcreatures you can summon doesn&#8217;t scale at full speed. When you can pick up the\n\tShadow Beasts power it will be immediately more useful and versatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focus Powers<\/span>: Very few worthwile\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Conjure Implement<\/span> (Sp): Very situational.\n\t\tIf you&#8217;re in a situation where you lost your implements you probably lost\n\t\tthe one you need to use this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flesh Mend<\/span> (Sp): A great way to burn your\n\t\tremaining focus points at the end of the day, but during the day you&#8217;re\n\t\tbetter off with a wand of cure light wounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mind Steed<\/span> (Sp): Mount is on the occultist\n\t\tspell list, and reducing the effects duration to minutes per level when you\n\t\tadd flight makes this extremely frustrating.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Psychic Fog<\/span> (Sp): Fog Cloud is a great\n\t\tway to get out of a bad situation, but it&#8217;s a 1st-level spell which you\n\t\tcould easily produce with a scroll. The solid fog option is much better,\n\t\tespecially since you can move through it freely since Occultists cast\n\t\tpsychich spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Purge Corruption<\/span> (Sp): Situational. Use\n\t\tthe Heal skill and antitoxins for poisons, and for diseases you generally\n\t\thave time to go find a cleric.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Side Step<\/span> (Sp): Similar to dimension door\n\t\tas a move action, this is a fantastic way to get around in combat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"divination\" class=\"rating-blue\">Divination Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Divination Implements School is insanely useful. It provides scouting, information gathering, a flexible check bonus from Sudden Insight, and access to special senses which normally require high-level spells to access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resonant Power: Third Eye<\/span> (Su): The\n\tPerception bonus is a nice distraction, but the real value is the improved\n\tsenses which you gain. The cost to get them is frustratingly high, but access\n\tto constant See Invisibility is a huge benefit, and Blindsense and Blindsight\n\tare extremely powerful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Focus Power: Sudden Insight<\/span> (Sp): An\n\teasily accessible scaling insight bonus on a wide variety of checks for just 1\n\tfocus. At low levels the bonus won&#8217;t be significant, but as you increase in\n\tlevel the cost will become relatively cheap and the bonus will scale\n\tconsiderably.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"greeb\">Focus Powers<\/span>: A couple of really fantastic gems,\n\tbut most of the options are redundant or too situational to justify.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Danger Sight<\/span> (Sp): If you also have the\n\t\tAbjuration Implements school, this will conflict somewhat with Mind Barrier.\n\t\tHowever, as you gain levels this may become a better option. Improving your\n\t\tAC may entirely negate a source of damage, while Mind Barrier may only\n\t\treduce it. Danger Sight also provides a fantastic saving throw bonus which\n\t\twill be especially crucial at high levels when you&#8217;re facing save-or-die\n\t\teffects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Future Gaze<\/span> (Sp): Augury is a great spell,\n\t\tand I strongly encourage you to learn it as one of the spells you gain from\n\t\tselecting Divinaton Implements instead of taking this ability. Future Gaze\n\t\tallows you to spend your focus points instead of spell slots, and ignores\n\t\tthe focus and material components, so it saves you a bit of gold. Of course,\n\t\t25gp becomes negligible very early in the game, and your focus points are\n\t\tfar too valuable to waste on this ability. The effects never scale or\n\t\timprove, so this power will quickly become irrelevant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mind Eye<\/span> (Sp): At fine size, the eye is\n\t\tsmall enough to fly under doors, through keyholes, and possibly through\n\t\tsmall cracks in walls and other barriers. Use the eye to safely scout\n\t\tpotentially dangerous areas like dungeons. Be sure to invest enough focus in\n\t\tThird Eye to pick up at least Darkvision so that you can send the eye into\n\t\tdark places. This may not seem particularly exciting, but for a single point\n\t\tof focus and a few minutes of concentration you can scout huge areas\n\t\tcompletely undetected. This is the equivalent of the Arcane Eye spell (if\n\t\tnot a little better), a 4th-level spell and easily one of my favorite\n\t\tdivination spells for how much information you can gather with a single\n\t\tcasting. At just 1 point of focus per use it&#8217;s a fantastic deal at any\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Object Seer<\/span> (Sp): Situational, and\n\t\toverlaps quite a bit with the Object Reading ability which Occultists get\n\t\tfor free.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Powerful Connection<\/span> (Su): Situational.\n\t\tNot many divinations require a saving throw from a potential target, and the\n\t\tones which do don&#8217;t get used a lot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Watchful Eye<\/span> (Sp): Situational.\n\t\tAdventurers typically don&#8217;t spend a lot of time staking out a location.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"enchantment\" class=\"rating-green\">Enchantment Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enchantment provides some of the only save-or-suck options available to the Occultist, but many of the abilities have level requirements, so you may want to wait to pick up Enchantment until at least level 6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resonant Power: Glorious Presence<\/span> (Su):\n\tThe Occultist really isn&#8217;t much of a Face. They get Diplomacy as a class\n\tskill, but not Bluff or Intimidate. You can pick up Bluff and Intimidate from\n\ttraits, but there are better options for a class which depends so heavily on\n\tIntelligence. UMD is a tempting option with this bonus, but the Pragmatic\n\tActivator trait will likely produce better results. If you really need to get\n\tsome diplomacy done, charge this up at the beginning of the day and pass it\n\toff to your party&#8217;s Face.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Base Focus Power: Cloud Mind<\/span> (Su): Most\n\tfoes of your CR will have more hit dice than you have Occultist levels, so you\n\twon&#8217;t get to stun foes often unless they&#8217;re in an encounter featuring multiple\n\tenemies. Staggering a foe is nice, but only matters if they depend on\n\tfull-round actions like full attack. The fact that targets become immune after\n\tbeing affected once is disappointing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Focus Powers<\/span>: <\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blinding Pattern<\/span> (Sp): Like Hold Monster,\n\t\tbut the DC scales with your Occultist level. Hold Monster is one of the best\n\t\tsingle-target save or suck effects in the game, and even if you can only\n\t\tparalyze the creature for a round or two that&#8217;s typically enough to win a\n\t\tfight outright. Absolutely worth the focus point cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Forced Alliance<\/span> (Sp): If you call the\n\t\tcreature to aid you directly, this is a lot like Dominate Monster but they\n\t\tget an additional save every round. If you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s Charm Monster with a\n\t\treally short duration. The phrase &#8220;aid you directly&#8221; is somewhat vague, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s unclear if you can use this to force enemies to fight for you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspired Assault<\/span> (Sp): The bonus isn&#8217;t\n\t\tgreat, and morale bonuses are easy to come by.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mental Discord<\/span> (Sp): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mind Slumber<\/span> (Sp): This conflicts a bit\n\t\twith Blinding Pattern. Blinding Pattern is a better way to kill something,\n\t\tbut since it allows saves every round the duration can expire very quickly.\n\t\tMind Slumber will remove a creature from a fight much longer, which is great\n\t\tif you need to disable a foe which you can&#8217;t immediately reach to coup de\n\t\tgrace.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Obey<\/span> (Sp): Command is a 1st-level spell.\n\t\tYou can do much better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"evocation\" class=\"rating-orange\">Evocation Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Occultists are not blasters by any means. Their offensive spell options are pitifully slim, and with only 2\/3 spellcasting they don&#8217;t get the high level spells that evokers need to remain viable in a game where dealing damage is already one of the least effective ways to play a spellcaster. Energy Ray looks tempting, but its damage is too poor to justify spending precious mental focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resonant Power: Intense Focus<\/span> (Su): The\n\tpayoff isn&#8217;t great, and Occultists have very few spells and focus powers which\n\tdeal direct damage. Energy Ray will probably benefit most from investing in\n\tthis ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Base Focus Power: Energy Ray<\/span> (Sp): The\n\tdamage isn&#8217;t amazing and the range is dangerously short, but you can do this\n\tas often as you like which makes it pretty useful. This is the blunt hammer of\n\tOccultist powers, but when so many of your problems are nails it&#8217;s nice to\n\thave a hammer handy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focus Powers<\/span>: There really isn&#8217;t anything\n\there that you need to get by.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Energy Blast<\/span> (Sp): Aside from the\n\t\tability to change the energy type, this may actually be worse than fireball,\n\t\twhich is on the Occultist spell list. The DC will scale (fireball won&#8217;t),\n\t\tand the damage cap is 2d6 higher, but considering this costs 2 focus to\n\t\tcast, I really don&#8217;t think that this is a good option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Energy Ward<\/span> (Sp): Situational by design.\n\t\tResistance to energy damage is a great option to have on hand, but with a\n\t\trounds per level duration you&#8217;re better off learning to cast Resist Energy.\n\t\tTotally redundant with Energy Shield and not nearly as good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Light Matrix<\/span> (Sp): Magic light is really\n\t\teasy to get, and the blinding component&#8217;s duration is pointlessly short. The\n\t\tmost useful part of Light Matrix is that you can create the light hours\n\t\tahead of time and direct it to attack using only your move action. Since\n\t\tmove actions are generally only used for silly things like walking about\n\t\taimlessly during a fight, this leaves your other actions open for things\n\t\tlike killing the thing you just blinded.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Radiance<\/span> (Sp): The scaling spell level of\n\t\tthe effect means that you will almost always be able to counteract magical\n\t\tdarkness. The on-hit effect also creates a really convenient way to handle\n\t\tinvisible creatures, and the +2 Circumstance bonus to hit the illuminated\n\t\tcreature is nice. Unfortunately, with only a 1d4 round duration you&#8217;ll need\n\t\tto capitalize on the effects very quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shape Mastery<\/span> (Su): Occultists are 2\/3\n\t\tcasters, and with only a handful of AOE evocation spells you just don&#8217;t have\n\t\tthe spell options to make this worthwhile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Power<\/span> (Sp): The damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tgreat, and it&#8217;s not going to stop big high-level creatures, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tfantastic against multiple opponents.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"illusion\" class=\"rating-green\">Illusion Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the illusion implement school is worthless, but there are a few particularly exiting gems. Distortion is great at any level, and once you hit 9th level Shadow Beast is absolutely amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resonant Power: Distortion<\/span> (Sp): Plenty of\n\tspellcasters go their entire lives without making a single attack, so you\n\tcould in theory be permanently distorted\/invisible. You can even use this\n\twhile sleeping!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Base Focus Power: Minor Figment<\/span> (Sp):\n\tGhost Sound and Minor Image are both already on the Occultist spell list, and\n\tGhost Sound is the only illusion cantrip available, so half of Minor Figment\n\tis already worthless. The 7th-level improvement doesn&#8217;t help much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focus Powers<\/span>: Aside from Shadow Beast,\n\teverything on the Illusion Implements&#8217; list of powers can be replaced with a\n\tspell already available to the Occultist.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloak Image<\/span> (Sp): Situational, and\n\t\tDisguise Self is on the Occultist spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Color Beam<\/span> (Sp): With a 1 round duration\n\t\tthis isn&#8217;t worth the cost even in those rare cases when you&#8217;re fighting an\n\t\tenemy with less hit dice than you have class levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Masquerade<\/span> (Sp): Very situational, and\n\t\tDisguise Self covers most of the reasons why you would want this\n\t\tability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mirage<\/span> (Sp): Situational, and Major\n\t\tImage is on the Occultist spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Beast<\/span> (Sp): Wow, this one came out\n\t\tof nowhere. For 1 focus point you can replicate up to a 9th-level summon\n\t\tspell. The disbelief component is a bit of an issue, but even at 50% damage\n\t\tthis is still an amazing ability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unseen<\/span> (Sp): Distortion is much more useful\n\t\tfor you, and if you need to make allies invisible Invisibility is on the\n\t\tOccultist&#8217;s spell list.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"necromancy\" class=\"rating-green\">Necromancy Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Necromany Implement School is good, but not amazing. Very few parts of the school are absolutely fantastic, but several of the options are certainly worth considering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resonant Power: Necromantic Focus<\/span> (Su):\n\tPeople who like undead pets are inhibited by the limited number of hit dice\n\tworth of creatures they can control. Expanding this limit is fantastic. The\n\tability to create additional undead is a nice added bonus. However, the\n\tOccultist is still only a 2\/3 caster and Animate Dead is the only spell on\n\tyour spell list which benefits from these bonuses. Either pass this off to a\n\treal necromancer, or get real comfortable dragging zombies around.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Base Focus Power: Mind Fear<\/span> (Sp): Most\n\tenemies will have more hit dice than you have levels. Shaken is a fine\n\tcondition since it debuffs creatures in so many ways, but the duration is\n\tpitiful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Focus Powers<\/span>: Several of the necromancy\n\tpowers are worthwhile, and Necromantic Servant is easily one of my favorite\n\tundead pet mechanics.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flesh Rot<\/span> (Sp): A melee touch attack is\n\t\tprobably not something you want to do often, and the damage isn&#8217;t especially\n\t\tgood considering you need to spend a focus point to use this. However, the\n\t\tability does typeless damage which is either amazing or an error.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Necromantic Servant<\/span> (Sp): This ability is\n\t\ta bit complicated, but it&#8217;s also really good. The undead you raise &#8220;from the\n\t\tground&#8221; seems to come out of nowhere, so no messing around with wagons full\n\t\tof corpses. It&#8217;s unclear if the creatures use the equipment listed in the\n\t\tbestiary (namely the skeleton&#8217;s broken scimitar and rust chain shirt), but I\n\t\twould assume that they use an unmodified version of the original stat block,\n\t\tand that they likely don&#8217;t have any meaningful proficiencies for you to\n\t\tabuse. Check with your GM to be sure, because handing your skeleton a real\n\t\tscimitar and suit of cheap armor may be a good idea since you&#8217;ve got enough\n\t\ttime to do so. The 10 minutes\/level duration is enough to get through a lot\n\t\tof stuff, especially if you spend the extra focus to recharge your servant\n\t\twhen it dies. Adding templates adds quite a bit of extra power to your\n\t\tservant, and the ability to split your servant and use teamwork feats at\n\t\thigh levels allows you to do some really silly things. It seems that you can\n\t\tpick a new teamwork feat every time you create a new servant, so be sure to\n\t\tcheck out my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/teamwork_feats\">Practical Guide to Teamwork Feats<\/a>.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skeleton<\/span>: The choice between a human\n\t\t\t\tskeleton and human zombie is largely personal preference. The zombie is\n\t\t\t\ttechnically a higher CR, especially if you remove the skeleton&#8217;s armor,\n\t\t\t\tbut if you throw items onto your servant, the skeleton may be\n\t\t\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Zombie<\/span>: If your GM makes the skeleton\n\t\t\t\tspawn with none of the gear mentioned in the Bestiary and doesn&#8217;t give\n\t\t\t\teither any weapon\/armor proficiencies, the zombie is almost certainly a\n\t\t\t\tbetter option. However, the zombie&#8217;s Staggered quality can be an\n\t\t\t\tannoying limiting factor when you need a pet that can chase foes around\n\t\t\t\tin an encounter.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloody Skeleton<\/span>: Your servant\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t change its effective number of hit dice, so it only gets one\n\t\t\t\tpoint of fast healing, and the +4 channel resistance won&#8217;t be enough to\n\t\t\t\tfix the fact that your servant still only has 1 hit die. The bloody\n\t\t\t\tskeleton also doesn&#8217;t add any offensive options, so it&#8217;s not\n\t\t\t\tmeaningfully better than the basic skeleton most of the time.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Burning Skeleton<\/span>: Easily the best\n\t\t\t\toption, if only for the guaranteed damage from Fiery Aura. When you get\n\t\t\t\tthe ability to split your servants, each split generates another source\n\t\t\t\tof guaranteed ongoing damage. Bury encounters in piles of burning\n\t\t\t\tskeletons and laugh gleefully from the other side of the room as you\n\t\t\t\tburn through everything in your path.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Zombie<\/span>: Though not as lethal as\n\t\t\t\tthe burning skeleton&#8217;s guaranteed fire damage, the fast zombie is a good\n\t\t\t\tfallback against foes which are immune to fire or which deal cold\n\t\t\t\tdamage. The fast zombie double&#8217;s the base damage of the normal zombie,\n\t\t\t\tand removes the Staggered issue, allowing the zombie to move and attack\n\t\t\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pain Wave<\/span> (Sp): Sickened is a really good\n\t\tdebuff, on par with Shaken. Use this ability to weaken enemies&#8217; saves before\n\t\tyou hit them with something more lethal the following round. Even if the\n\t\teffect only lasts one round, you still get to take advantage of their -2\n\t\tpenalty to saving throws.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Psychic Curse<\/span> (Sp): Too situational and\n\t\tunpredictable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Soulbound Puppet<\/span> (Su): Familiars can be\n\t\tvery powerful if you choose a good familiar, and the ability to switch\n\t\tfamiliars easily certainly offers some options. Be sure to read my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>\n\t\tfor help selecting a few favorite options.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Shroud<\/span> (Su): Temporary hit points\n\t\tare always nice, but you may get more effect out of Warding Talisman and\n\t\tMind Barrier.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"transmutation\" class=\"rating-blue\">Transmutation Implements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Several great options, especially if you have avid weapon users in the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resonant Power: Physical Enhancement<\/span> (Su):\n\tIf you don&#8217;t plan to go into melee, put this on one of your party members.\n\tIt&#8217;s especially useful at low and middle levels before your allies can afford\n\tbelts which improve two or three ability scores. Or if you don&#8217;t need to do so\n\tyou can always boost your Dexterity or Constitution to better defend\n\tyourself.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Focus Power: Legacy Weapon<\/span> (Su): The\n\tfact that the enhancement bonus stacks with existing enhancement bonuses is\n\tamazing, and you get to swap some of the granted enhancement bonus for special\n\tabilities. Use this to add enhancements which aren&#8217;t always applicable like\n\tenergy damage, aligned abilities like Holy, and situational options like Bane.\n\tMany other classes get similar options (Paladins, Magi, etc.), but generally\n\tabilities like Holy cost disproportionaly more to use than less situational\n\tabilities, and Bane is generally just not an option. This is an important\n\tlimiting factor on those abilities, and the fact that Occultists don&#8217;t have\n\tthat same limitation is surprising. Note that this ability isn&#8217;t limited to a\n\tweapon you are holding or which is carrying your focus, so you can grant this\n\tto one or more of your allies if you so choose.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Focus Powers<\/span>: Half of the options are too\n\tredundant or situational to justify, but the good options are certainly worth\n\tconsidering.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mind Over Gravity<\/span> (Sp): A standard action\n\t\tto gain flight for one minute isn&#8217;t great, but flight is still amazingly\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Philosopher&#8217;s Touch<\/span> (Su): Using this on a\n\t\tsingle weapon becomes redundant with Legacy Weapon as you gain the ability\n\t\tto grant better enhancement bonuses (remember that having a sufficiently\n\t\thigh enhancement bonus can overcome material-based DR), but the ability to\n\t\tapply it to multiple weapons may be useful in a party with lots of\n\t\tweapon-wielders.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quickness<\/span> (Sp): Haste is an amzing buff,\n\t\tbut it&#8217;s already on the Occultist spell list, and Quickness only affects one\n\t\tcreature, while Haste affects multiple.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Size Alteration<\/span> (Sp): Changing a creature&#8217;s\n\t\tsize can be a minor buff\/debuff but the duration is too short to be\n\t\tmeaningful on allies and if you&#8217;re going in for a melee touch attack you\n\t\tshould be doing something more impressive than this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sudden Speed<\/span> (Sp): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Mastery<\/span> (Sp): Telekinesis is\n\t\tfantastic and extremely versatile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction An occultist&#8217;s choice of implements is the most important class decision that they make. Implements grant an item buff (&#8220;Resonant Power&#8221;), a base focus power, access to a unique list of focus powers, and a spell of every level which the occultist can cast. Occult Adventures presents 8 implement schools, and since Occultists get just 7 choices you will need to omit at least one, and you&#8217;ll omit more if you choose to re-select the same implement school to get another set of spells from that school.
