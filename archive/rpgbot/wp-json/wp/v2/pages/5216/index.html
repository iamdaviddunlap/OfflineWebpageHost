That&#8217;s normally a poor trade because the attack penalties are high and the extra damage is small, but the Titan Mauler improves the trade-off gradually, but the penalties don&#8217;t fully disappear until 18th level, and in that time a normal Barbarian has been much more effective in most cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s also consider Vital Strike. Vital Strike functions best when you use the biggest weapon you can swing. Conveniently, that&#8217;s exactly what the Titan Mauler is built to do. This is truly a match made in Paizo heaven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This build is easy. It&#8217;s <em>very<\/em> easy. It requires a stunningly small number of feats, one magic item (your weapon), and access to Enlarge Person by one or more methods. This leaves a ton of flexibility in your build for feats, rage powers, and other considerations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unchained-or-vanilla\">Unchained or Vanilla Barbarian?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In this case, either option works. The difference between the vanilla Barbarian&#8217;s Strength bonus and the Unchained Barbarian&#8217;s flat attack\/damage bonus amounts to roughly 1 damage per attack (maybe 2 depending on your original Strength score). This biggest difference is which version of rage powers you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Barbarian Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hit Points<\/span>: The biggest and the best\n\tavailable. You&#8217;re going to want to pile on constitution, too, because your AC\n\tis going to be a bit of a problem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Fast progression, same as\n\tany primarily combat character. Between this and Rage, Barbarians routinely\n\thave higher attack bonuses than Fighters, even accounting for Weapon Focus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: You get good Fortitude saves, so\n\tyou will need to put some points into Dexterity and Wisdom to make sure your\n\tother saves don&#8217;t make you too vulnerable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: No heavy armor, but you\n\twon&#8217;t really want it slowing you down anyway.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Barbarians get 4+ skill points,\n\twhich is odd because they&#8217;re not smart enough to know how to read. Take\n\tPerception, Survival, Intimidate if you plan to use it, and Acrobatics.\n\tAcrobatics may seem like an odd choices, but it&#8217;s a good way to avoid attacks\n\tof opportunity, and it includes the ability to Jump now, which may become\n\timportant for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rage<\/span> (Ex): Most barbarians see the number of\n\trage rounds as a problematic limitation. The Titan Mauler can rage for a\n\tsingle round, obliterate the biggest enemy in the room, then spend the rest of\n\tthe encounter lazily eliminating whatever is left while fatigued with little\n\tissue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rage Powers<\/span> (Ex): Rage powers don&#8217;t play a\n\tcrucial role in the build, but they can provide helpful bonuses to make you\n\tmore reliable. Surprise Accuracy or Accurate Stance provide a scaling bonus to\n\tyour attacks which will help keep you well ahead of the AC progression curve.\n\tDepending on whether you went Unchained or vanilla, different rage powers will\n\tbe appealing. Because Vital Strike allows you to so easily kill enemies in a\n\tsingle blow (especially with Furious Finish), powers which only function once\n\tper rage become extremely viable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Damage Reduction<\/span> (Ex): Always welcome. A lot\n\tof your gold will be sunk into your weapon, which may make it difficult to\n\tkeep your defensive stats high.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Rage<\/span> (Ex): More stats!.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tireless Rage<\/span> (Ex): Now you can rage cycle\n\twithout shenanigans. Every round should start with rage, and end with Furious\n\tFinish and a dead enemy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mighty Rage<\/span> (Ex): Even more stats!.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"titan-mauler\">Titan Mauler<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Big Game Hunter<\/span> (Ex): Situational,\n\tespecially if you plan to use Enlarge Person. And you should really plan to\n\tuse Enlarge Person. At high levels when enemies are more consistently large,\n\tthis becomes easier to use, but a +1 bonus really isn&#8217;t going to matter much\n\tat the levels where you face the biggest foes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Jotungrip<\/span> (Ex): Jotungrip allows you to wield\n\tan <em>appropriately sized<\/em> two-handed weapon in one hand, which means you\n\tcan wield a Greatsword or a two-handed polearm in one hand at a -2 penalty.\n\tThis does not allow you to wield oversized weapons (such as a Large Bastard\n\tSword) any better. You could always dual-wield greatswords, which would look\n\tsuper cool at the expense of actually hitting things. It&#8217;s useful for a\n\tbarbarian class dip if you want to do something like using a reach weapon and\n\ta shield at the same time, but that&#8217;s a very niche case.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Massive Weapons<\/span> (Ex): The wording on this\n\tability is awful, so I&#8217;ll clarify: You can use a two-handed weapon for a\n\tcreature one size larger than you (such as a human wielding a large\n\tgreatsword), but at an additional -4 penalty on top of the -2 for using a\n\tweapon one size category off. That&#8217;s a total -6 penalty to attacks. However,\n\tthe penalty is reduced by 1 at 3rd level and at every 3rd level until the\n\tpenalty reaches 0 at 18th level. That&#8217;s a lot of penalty and you don&#8217;t get a\n\tlot of extra damage, so don&#8217;t try to use this unless you&#8217;re high level or\n\tusing Vital Strike. If you use a weapon that&#8217;s oversized but not a two-handed\n\tweapon for a creature one size larger then you (such as a human wielding a\n\tlarge bastard sword), you start from the normal -2 penalty and reduce it to -1\n\tat 3rd level, then to 0 at 6th level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Evade Reach<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s a very good day when\n\tyou have reach, but the giant\/dragon\/dinosaur you&#8217;re fighting doesn&#8217;t. Of\n\tcourse, you&#8217;re going to charge into melee where this will only matter for the\n\tfirst round or two. Unless you&#8217;re built to make a lot of attacks of\n\topportunity (which this archetype doesn&#8217;t help with), this won&#8217;t be very\n\timportant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Titanic Rage<\/span> (Su): Burning through your\n\trage rounds at double speed sucks. At this level you should have enough gold\n\tthat you can afford to chug potions of Enlarge Person whenever you get\n\tthirsty. If you have a wizard handy, they can use a wand on you, or you can\n\tuse Permanency and be permanently large for a measly 2,500 gp, which any\n\tdecent Barbarian should be doing anyway unless they spend a lot of time in\n\tcramped dungeons.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Compatible Archetypes<\/h3>\n<p>Totem Barbarian technically counts, but you get that for free. There are no<br>\n\tother compatible archetypes, and you don&#8217;t need them.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n<p>The Titan Mauler&#8217;s abilities are no different from a conventional Barbarian.<br>\n\tEmphasize Strength as much as possible, but keep your Dexterity and<br>\n\tConstitution passable to keep yourself alive.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your race matters fairly little. A Strength bonus is nice, but not crucial. The only crucial point is that you should be medium size. Slow speed should be avoided most of the time since the Titan Mauler doesn&#8217;t get Fast Movement, but that still doesn&#8217;t makes dwarf a bad choice. Without the need for extra rage rounds, you have more flexibility to look for favored class bonuses that provide other benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of traits doesn&#8217;t matter much for the core of the build, so pick up traits which complement secondary concerns.

The Titan Mauler needs\n\t\ta tiny number of feats, leaving you lots of room to play with Rage\n\t\tPowers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fleet<\/span>: 5 feet isn&#8217;t much, but without\n\t\tFast Movement and without the ability to rely on charging, 5 feet may make a\n\t\tdifference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Critical<\/span>: Critical hits don&#8217;t\n\t\tdo much to improve Vital Strike, but you definitely have the feats to spare\n\t\tfor this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vital Strike<\/span>: Double weapon damage.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Furious Finish<\/span>: The first feat you\n\t\t\t\twant after Vital Strike. RAW it appears that this applies to\n\t\t\t\t<em>all<\/em> of your damage dice (flaming, vicious, sneak attack, extra\n\t\t\t\tcritical hit damage, etc.) rather than just the weapon&#8217;s damage dice. I\n\t\t\t\tthink RAI it&#8217;s intended to just be the weapon damage dice, but consult\n\t\t\t\tyour DM. Either way, it&#8217;s a massive boost in damage because you go from\n\t\t\t\tdealing roughly average damage to roughly double average damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Vital Strike<\/span>: Triple weapon\n\t\t\t\tdamage.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Vital Strike<\/span>: Quadruple\n\t\t\t\t\t\tweapon damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Devastating Strike<\/span>: This feat is\n\t\t\t\tseverely limited by the +6 damage bonus cap.

Massive Weapons is where we get to feel like a Titan Mauler for the first time. Switch from your greatsword to a large bast sword. You&#8217;ll net -1 to attacks for +2 damage.

This should serve as a helpful reference since there is no official table for the progression. Attack: Large Bastard Sword +6 2d8+9 (Avg. 18)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 &#8211; Barbarian 4<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase: Strength Rage Power: Any<\/td><td>Another rage power, and Power Attack increments at this level. Attack: Large Bastard Sword +7 2d8+12 (Avg. 21)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 &#8211; Barbarian 5<\/td><td>Feat: Reckless Rage Evade Reach (5 ft.)<\/td><td>Evade Reach is really helpful if you&#8217;re not enlarged because you can more easily get inside your target&#8217;s reach without drawing an attack of opportunity. But if you&#8217;re enlarged, your reach may be equal to theirs, in which case Evade Reach allows you to reach them while they can&#8217;t reach you. Reckless Rage is free damage, but feel free to replace the feat with something else. At this level it may be affordable to be permanently enlarged. Paying an NPC will cost 2,950gp, slightly more than a +1 weapon. Unless you spend a lot of time in cramped dungeons, it&#8217;s worth the cost. If permanent size will be a problem, spend that money on a pile of Enlarge Person potions. Either way, from this point on we&#8217;ll assume that you are enlarged. Attack: Huge Bastard Sword +8 3d8+16 (Avg. 29.5)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 &#8211; Barbarian 6<\/td><td>Rage Power: Any Massive Weapons (0, -4)<\/td><td>Another open rage power. If you haven&#8217;t pick up Surprise Accuracy or Accurate Stance, I would get it now. You want it handy for use with Vital Strike to ensure that you hit every time. Massive Weapons increments again at this level. Using large one-handed weapons is now free, but with the exception of the large bastard sword there is basically no reason to do so. The -4 penalty for using large two-handed weapons is really scary, so avoid it as long as possible. This level is a weird middle ground for the Titan Mauler. It&#8217;s the only level at which making a Full Attack is a meaningful option, and even though you qualify for Vital Strike you don&#8217;t have it yet because you don&#8217;t get a feat at this level. Attack: Huge Bastard Sword +10\/+5 3d8+16 (Avg. 29.5)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 &#8211; Barbarian 7<\/td><td>Feat: Vital Strike Damage reduction 1\/-<\/td><td>Finally! This is where the Titan Mauler comes into its own. Drop your bastard sword, and go buy a huge +1 greatsword (remember that you&#8217;re large now; if you&#8217;re not permanently enlarged get a large one so it will grow to huge when you drink a potion). The -4 penalty for using such a big weapon still hurts, so use Surprise Accuracy or Accurate Stance to help offset the penalties. Start saving gold to get Impact added to your sword as soon as possible. The sooner you get it, the better. You get DR at this level, but try not to need it. Attack: Huge +1 Greatsword +8 8d6+17 (Avg. 53)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 &#8211; Barbarian 8<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase: Strength Rage Power: Any<\/td><td>8th level is great for us numerically. The second ability score increase raises your Strength to 20 (22 while enlarged), and Power Attack increments, so we get an extra +1 to attacks and a bunch of additional damage. At this level you <em>might<\/em> get enough gold to upgrade your sword to +1 Impact, but it&#8217;s not likely so we&#8217;ll ignore it until 9th level. Attack: Huge +1 Greatsword +10 8d6+22 (Avg. 58)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 &#8211; Barbarian 9<\/td><td>Feat: Furious Finish Massive Weapons (0, -3)<\/td><td>Another great level for our numbers. Massive Weapons increments again, making us gradually more reliable with our attacks. Furious Finish is a bit of a gamble, but it&#8217;s an easy gamble with a huge payoff. You end your rage and get automatic maximum damage. From now on, I&#8217;ll now list maximum damage in addition to average damage for our attack line. At this level you can probably afford to upgrade your sword to +1 Impact. Due to the way weapon damage scales with size, this adds 2d6 to your weapon&#8217;s base damage, making this a significant boost in your damage output. Because additional weapon enhancements don&#8217;t matter much after this point, I&#8217;ll assume (probably incorrectly) that your weapon doesn&#8217;t change from here on. I&#8217;ve listed two attack lines for this level to call out exactly how this works out. But just to be super explicit: with Impact your average damage is higher than your maximum damage without Impact. It&#8217;s that big a difference. Attack: Huge +1 Greatsword +12 8d6+22 (Avg. 58, Max 70) Attack: Huge +1 Impact Greatsword +12 12d6+22 (Avg. 72, Max 94)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; Barbarian 10<\/td><td>Damage Reduction 2\/- Rage Power: Any<\/td><td>After three levels which added big piles of damage and attack bonus, 10th level is pretty boring. But at this level you qualify for some really cool rage powers, so pick something exciting. Attack: Huge +1 Impact Greatsword +13 12d6+22 (Avg. 72, Max 94)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11 &#8211; Barbarian 11<\/td><td>Feat: Improved Vital Strike Greater Rage<\/td><td>After enduring the dull period that was 10th level, 11th level brings Improve Vital Strike, and a 50% increase in our damage from weapon damage dice. Compare the attack lines between this level and the previous two levels. Greater rage improves the numeric benefits of raging. Those benefits are excellent, but I&#8217;ll continue to ignore their specific because they are different for the vanilla Barbarian and the Unchained Barbarian, and I don&#8217;t want you to think either one is significantly better here. It&#8217;s fun to note that at this level wizards can cast Disintegrate, giving us what may be the best spells vs. weapons damage comparison. At this level that&#8217;s 22d6 damage from disintegrate, averaging just 77 damage at the cost of a 6th-level spell slot. You can do more than that every round without raging. The wizard will gradually catch up to your average damage, but they probably can&#8217;t match your maximum damage without an expensive rod of a 9th-level spell slot. Attack: Huge +1 Impact Greatsword +14 18d6+22 (Avg. 85, Max 130)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12 &#8211; Barbarian 12<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase: Strength Rage Power: Any Massive Weapons (0, -2)<\/td><td>Another rage power, and your Strength goes to 21 (23 enlarged) before your magic belt. Massive Weapons increments again, giving us back another point of attack bonus. Power Attack increments at this level, but you&#8217;re already doing so much damage that you might not notice the difference. Attack: Huge +1 Impact Greatsword +16 18d6+25 (Avg. 88, Max 133)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13 &#8211; Barbarian 13<\/td><td>Feat: Devastating Strike Damage Reduction 3\/-<\/td><td>Devastating Strike adds two damage per additional damage die added by Vital Strike up to a cap of 6. We already have 12 such dice, so we get +6 damage. Attack: Huge +1 Impact Greatsword +17 18d6+31 (Avg. 94, Max 139)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14 &#8211; Barbarian 14<\/td><td>Rage Power: Any Titanic Rage<\/td><td>Titanic Rage would have been great 10 levels ago when we spent a pile of our meager pile of gold to become permanently enlarged. If you&#8217;ve been surviving on potions or actual spells until now, this is a welcome addition to the build. Attack: Huge +1 Impact Greatsword +18 18d6+31 (Avg. 94, Max 139)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; Barbarian 15<\/td><td>Feat: Greater Vital Strike Massive Weapons (0, -1)<\/td><td>Greater Vital Strike is the end of the line. From here we&#8217;re out of important feats. But oh man, look at that attack line. Truly a thing of beauty. Attack: Huge +1 Impact Greatsword +19 24d6+31 (Avg. 115, Max 175)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond this point the build is totally open.

That&#8217;s normally a poor trade because the attack penalties are high and the extra damage is small, but the Titan Mauler improves the trade-off gradually, but the penalties don&#8217;t fully disappear until 18th level, and in that time a normal Barbarian has been much more effective in most cases. But let&#8217;s also consider Vital Strike. Vital Strike functions best when you use the biggest weapon you can swing. Conveniently, that&#8217;s exactly what the Titan Mauler is built to do.
