They can serve as a delivery mechanism for touch spells, and because of their small size and good Dexterity they are often excellent at Stealth, allowing them to move into position to attack before the party kicks in the door. They can also act as couriers for Exploding Runes and Sepia Snake Sigil, or for delivering messages non-magically to nearby recipients.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"apprentice-familiars\">Apprentice Familiars<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If your GM allows it, your Familiar may be able to use magic items, especially if you have Use Magic Device. This can make your familiar extremely useful if you hand them wands of Cure Light Wounds, or scrolls\/wands offensive spells which don&#8217;t allow saving throws, like Grease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that Spell Trigger items like wands and Command Word items both require that the user be able to speak, which limits your options to familiars which can speak like the Raven or the Thrush unless you take Improved Familiar or get items like a <a href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/magic-items\/rings\/ring-of-eloquence\/\">Ring of Eloquence<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skill-familiars\">Skill Familiars<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Especially useful if they have opposable digits, familiars can serve as Scouts nearly as well a Rogue. They lack Trapfinding, and can&#8217;t get the ability from their master, so be wary of traps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact mechanics of other skills are somewhat suspect. A wizard&#8217;s familiar gets the same modifier to Knowledge skills, but I don&#8217;t think any reasonable GM would allow a familiar to make a Knowledge check. Similarly, if your familiar can speak you might be able to use your familiar as the party&#8217;s Face if your GM allows it. You might also let your familiar make spot\/listen\/search checks by itself, but the ability to provide the Alertness feat seems to be intended to reflect your familiar aiding you.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"combat-familiars\">Combat Familiars<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The biggest reason to pick up Improved Familiar (or any of the other special familiar feats) is because you want to turn your familiar into a fighting animal. There is a fantastically long list of wonderful options (see &#8220;Improved Familiar Options&#8221;, below), many of which can be very capable combatants. Because familiars use their master&#8217;s BAB and calculate their HP based on their masters, combat familiars generally work best for combat classes like Duskblade and Hexblade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic -

It has Scent and low-light vision, allowing\n\tit to help notice enemies. While it&#8217;s certainly not exciting, the Rat is a\n\tgreat baseline from which to measure other familiar options. The bonus to\n\tFortitude saves is also great for arcane spellcasters who typically have poor\n\tFortitude saves.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"raven\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/monsters\/familiar.html#raven\">Raven<\/a>\n<\/h4>\n<p>If you want to be talkative, the Thrush&#8217;s bonus to Diplomacy will be more\n\thelpful.

It also\n\thas high Acrobatics, allowing it to more easily enter enemy&#8217;s squares, and\n\tit&#8217;s an excellent climber.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"sloth\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary4\/familiars.html#sloth\">Sloth<\/a>\n<\/h4>\n<p>Iconic for being slow, the sloth&#8217;s stats are true to its species. It is slow,\n\tits attacks are garbage, and its only redeeming quality is Scent, which you\n\tcan find on plenty of other familiars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"snapping-turtle\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/additionalMonsters\/turtle.html#turtle,-snapping\">Snapping Turtle<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>The snapping turtle is slow, and doesn&#8217;t really have anything special but\n\tScent.

The ability for your Thrush to speak is\n\tsituational, but if you&#8217;re playing a Face the +3 bonus to Diplomacy can be\n\treally nice. The Thrush is one of only two basic familiars which can speak,\n\twhich may allow it to use wands.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"toad\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/monsters\/familiar.html#toad\">Toad<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>Dismally slow, no useful abilities, and 3 hit points is garbage. It can&#8217;t\n\teven swim. Somehow the toad gets a +21 to Stealth, but the ability to sit\n\tstill and not be noticed is not enough to redeem the toad.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"tuatara\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary4\/familiars.html#tuatara\">Tuatara<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>Basically a lizard (but technically a dinosaur!), the Tuatara has both\n\tlow-light vision and Darkvision, but is otherwise just a scaly weasel.

The natural armor bonus to AC\n\tmight be appealing for melee casters and polymorph builds, but I&#8217;m not certain\n\tif it stacks with other natural armor bonuses.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"viper\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/monsters\/familiar.html#viper\">Viper<\/a>\n<\/h4>\n<p>The viper&#8217;s big appeal is its poison. The poison&#8217;s DC scales with your\n\tfamiliar&#8217;s effective hit dice, but with only 10 constitution you&#8217;re going to\n\thave a lot of trouble getting enemies to fail their saving throws. You may be\n\table to harvest poison from your familiar if someone in the party can use it.\n\tAlso note that in Pathfinder, multiple doses increase the save DC of poison\n\taffecting the target by 2 instead of forcing separate saves, so you may be\n\table to improve the poison&#8217;s usefulness by applying it multiple times.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"weasel\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/monsters\/familiar.html#weasel\">Weasel<\/a>\n<\/h4>\n<p>A climb speed and scent are the weasel&#8217;s biggest advantages, but the Rat has\n\tthose plus a swim speed, and Reflex saves aren&#8217;t as important as Fortitude\n\tsaves.

The\n\tsilvanshee&#8217;s spell-like abilities are all utilities, so they will remain\n\tuseful long after other familiars spell-like abilities stop working due to\n\ttheir low DCs.
