Particularly, if your party wants to make use of undead minions, this is a great way to support that as Hellish Knight with Skeletal Squires. Just take note that Oathbreakers are required to be Evil, which <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/alignment\/\">isn\u2019t really a hindrance<\/a>, but some people will believe it to be. So if you\u2019re not opposed to using Evil powers and a Skeleton army to save the world, try the Oathbreaker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Being Evil is a sticking point for many players and DMs, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Evil in terms of Alignment can be expressed as a Surplus of Greed and Deficit of Empathy, as explained by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MRgTu6FTHgI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this video from RPG Philosophy<\/a>. To paraphrase the explanation presented by Seth Skorkowsky in that video, the Evil hero is invested in what is theirs and pays no heed to what is not theirs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, \u201cThese are <em>my<\/em> friends. This is <em>my <\/em>city<em>.<\/em> Nobody hurts <em>my<\/em> friends. Nobody attacks <em>my<\/em> city.\u201d is a pretty normal line of thinking that works for motivating both Good and Evil heroes. When played that way, Evil PCs are fine, and Oathbreakers are a fine way to be Evil. For more thoughts on alignment in roleplaying, listen to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-s2e9-part-1\/\">this episode<\/a> with Dr. Terry MacMullin, department chair of philosophy at Eastern Washington University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the key to being the best Oathbreaker is to already have fellow PCs utilizing undead minions.

Inflict Wounds will almost never see use because your\n\t\t\t\tweapon plus Divine Smite with the same spell slot will do as much or\n\t\t\t\tmore damage (compare 1d8+3+2d8 to 3d10).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-red\">5th-Level<\/span>: Crown of Madness is\n\t\t\t\tdifficult to use because it consumes your Action and only does anything\n\t\t\t\tif your target is adjacent to something which you want the target to\n\t\t\t\tattack at the beginning of their turn, and Darkness isn&#8217;t very helpful\n\t\t\t\tsince you can&#8217;t see inside the area.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th-Level<\/span>: Animate Dead is always\n\t\t\t\tnice to have, and Bestow Curse has several excellent options. Consider\n\t\t\t\tcombining the two by cursing your foe to give them disadvantage on\n\t\t\t\tStrength checks and saves, then have your undead pets grapple them and\n\t\t\t\tshove them to the ground.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: Blight is decent\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target damage, especially against plants, but your spell save DC\n\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t match a full spellcaster, and by this level the damage may feel\n\t\t\t\tunderwhelming. Divine Smite does 5d8 damage for the same spell slot\n\t\t\t\tcompared to Blight&#8217;s 8d8, and Divine Smite can be doubled on a critical\n\t\t\t\thit and doesn&#8217;t allow a save for half. I have never liked Confusion\n\t\t\t\tbecause it&#8217;s so unpredictable, even though it is an AoE.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">17th-Level<\/span>: Contagion is great, but\n\t\t\t\tcomplicated, and relies on your hitting with a spell attack first Slimy\n\t\t\t\tDoom will essentially end an encounter, especially if you can apply a\n\t\t\t\tdamage over time effect to keep them perpetually stunned. Dominate\n\t\t\t\tPerson is a powerful way to temporarily gain an extra party member, but\n\t\t\t\tyour save DC may not be high enough to make it reliable.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Channel Divinity<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Control Undead<\/span>: Save-or-suck an\n\t\t\t\tundead creature for up to 24 hours. Turn powerful undead into slaves.\n\t\t\t\tThey must obey your commands, they don&#8217;t get additional saves, and they\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t break the effect by any means specified in the feature. Undead\n\t\t\t\taren&#8217;t every creature, so this is technically situational, but they&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tstill a very common creature type in many games.\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re worried about the creature&#8217;s behavior at the end of the\n\t\t\t\t\tduration and you think it might pass a save to renew the effect, you\n\t\t\t\t\tcan command the creature to destroy itself right before the duration\n\t\t\t\t\texpires. But given enough time, you can restrain the creature while\n\t\t\t\t\tyou rest, then you and your allies could hit the creature with effects\n\t\t\t\t\twhich penalize saving throws (Bane, Mind Spike, Cutting Words, etc.),\n\t\t\t\t\tthen you can re-use Control Undead to reset the duration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dreadful Aspect<\/span>: Considerably better\n\t\t\t\tthan the Turn Whatever abilities other oaths get since it affects\n\t\t\t\teverything. This is similar in many ways to the spell Fear, but Dreadful\n\t\t\t\tAspect is a sphere rather than a cone, and creatures only get more saves\n\t\t\t\tif they move away from you. Conveniently, the feature doesn&#8217;t make foes\n\t\t\t\trun away, so they might be content to stay within 30 feet of you and\n\t\t\t\tstruggle along in hopes that the fear with wear off.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Hate<\/span>: Not terribly helpful in an\n\t\tadventuring party unless you&#8217;ve got plenty of Undead minions,\nbut even if it only applies to you, you can get a bunch\n\t\tof extra damage on your melee weapon attacks. Between Strength and Charisma, you\n\t\tcan easily add +7 damage at this level, and with the right Ability Score\n\t\tIncreases you can raise that to +10 total.\n<p>If you\u2019re using this with a bunch of Animate Dead minions, the best option is Skeletons. Unlike Zombies, Skeletons are proficient with weapons, including Shortswords, which allows for Dual Wielding to get double the bonus out of the Aura. You\u2019ll likely have to supply your Skele Squires with their weapons though. Skeletons can also wear armor, so if you can really spare the money, Scale Mail would boost them all up to 16 AC.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Supernatural Resistance<\/span>: Permanent\n\t\tStoneskin. This makes you very difficult to kill, especially in games with\n\t\tno magic items. However, in games where magic items are common or where the\n\t\tworld is dominated by spellcasters this might be completely useless.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"20\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dread Lord<\/span>: Lots of damage, a good use for\n\t\tyour Bonus Action, and it makes it hard for enemies to see. Be sure that you\n\t\thave Darkvision so that you&#8217;re not a victim of your own effect, and strongly\n\t\tconsider using Channel Divinity: Dreadful Aspect for the ongoing damage.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oathbreaker-ability-scores\">Oathbreaker Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If we\u2019re stacking up minions, then leaning more towards Charisma is good, otherwise we can build like most other Paladins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: We need this for attack rolls.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: While finesse build is an option, it would cut off multiclassing options because of the Strength requirement.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Keeps us alive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Doesn\u2019t really do anything for us.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Wisdom saves are dangerous so this can be useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: This boosts all our Save DCs and our Saving throws and gives us additional Melee damage.

We have the option of a skill or Sorcerer Cantrip as well. Booming Blade is a good cantrip before we get Aura of Hate, but then the damage of two swings with the aura can edge it out, and once Improved Divine Smite comes online, you\u2019ll easily outpace Booming Blade by making two attacks. Taking the Arcana skill would allow us the option of making scrolls during downtime, a good way to expand our limited slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadar-Kai<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MMoM<\/a><\/sup>: Thematically appropriate for an edgy undead-corralling Paladin of Darkness.

If we want to be at sea.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For skills we\u2019ll end up with Arcana, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, and Performance. For tools we\u2019ll have Horn and Vehicles (Water). With Deception and Performance we can blend in among the Skeleton Crew. We chose Vehicles (Water) for fun but you could easily swap that out for a Disguise kit to further blend in with the Spooky Boys.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we\u2019ll be taking War Caster. This will allow us to cast with our hands full, and that\u2019s important. It also gives us Advantage on our Concentration saves, which is good now, and even better when we start adding Charisma to every save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we\u2019ll be taking an ASI. Which we take here depends on our party. If other people are bringing in Skeletons and Summon Undead we can push Charisma here and do Strength at twelfth. If nobody else has brought compatible minions, then Strength now and Charisma next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, take an ASI for Strength or Charisma, whichever you didn\u2019t take at Eighth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we take an ASI for +2 Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At nineteenth level, we take an ASI for +2 Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-party-isnt-made-of-necromancers\">My Party Isn&#8217;t Made of <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/necromancy\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15568\">Necromancers<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Well that\u2019s okay, but then we have to make some changes. Kobold was chosen to grant Advantage to the Skelebros, but instead something medium like Shadar-Kai or maybe VHumans or Custom Lineage could take advantage of heavy weapons and Polearm Master. That\u2019s right we\u2019d be dropping War Caster to pick up PAM, paired with a Halberd or Glaive. We\u2019d then push Strength before touching Charisma to focus on our own attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Divine Sense<br>Lay on Hands<br><br>Skills<br>-Arcana<br>-Athletics<br>-Deception<br>-Intimidation<br>-Performance<br><br>Tools<br>-Horn<br>-Vehicles (Water)<\/td><td>We\u2019re starting like any other Paladin, except we\u2019re <em>Evil<\/em>.
