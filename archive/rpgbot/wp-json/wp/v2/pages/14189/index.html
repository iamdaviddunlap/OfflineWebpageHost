As DnD attempts to represent all fantasy tropes with as much fidelity as possible, poisoners are a classic character type within the game as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the conversion from prior systems to 5th edition, the focus of poison use was diminished greatly. The unfortunate outcome was that few players actively choose to use poison. Prior to Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything, everything we knew about poisons was confined to about two pages in the DMG. Tasha\u2019s attempted to rectify that with the Poisoner feat with some mixed success and a few unforeseen results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Poisoner feat offers players easy access to poison as a tactical option, allowing players to craft their own poisons using clearly defined rules that don\u2019t require hauling a box of creatures around or similar shenanigans.

Instead, crack open Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything (page 80) and we\u2019ll proceed through each bullet point individually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bullet Point 1:<\/strong> While the ability to ignore poison damage seems good at first glance, it does very little to solve the primary problem that poison damage users face. In the Monster Manual, only five monsters have any form of resistance to poison, while a whopping 95 of them have immunity to it. This aspect of the feat does not negate immunity, and therefore leaves a poison damage user utterly incapable of harming a great deal of foes, and only increases your effectiveness against a handful of monsters. NPCs such as dwarves will be affected, but those will make up a small portion of the creatures you\u2019ll face in a typical campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bullet Point 2.<\/strong> Being able to apply poison to an attack per turn is an incredible boost in your combat effectiveness. As consumable items, you should expect that using this every turn will cost you monetarily. At the very least, the ability to apply a poison that loses its effectiveness in a minute to a weapon as a bonus action will reduce the burden on you in fights that were not ambushes you prepared.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although you gain knowledge of a craftable poison with this feat, we suggest reading the Sample Poisons and (Possibly) Harvestable Poisons section of this guide to best understand all the other poisons you can apply with this bonus action.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bullet Point 3, Line 1.<\/strong> Being able to use a poisoner\u2019s kit is a nice boon, which is especially nice if you don\u2019t have proficiency in nature checks in addition to the poisoner\u2019s kit. While there aren\u2019t a lot of rules governing the crafting of poisons beyond DM fiat, there are hard rules for harvesting poison, which is a DC 20 nature or poisoner\u2019s kit check (DMG 258.) This would be nicer if it gave you expertise in the poisoner\u2019s kit if you already had proficiency, but alas, no such luck.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bullet Point 3, Line 2-4.<\/strong> You gain the ability to craft a fairly effective poison. Athough it acts like an injury poison, it\u2019s not a true injury poison as by RAW it can be applied to any weapon, including bludgeoning weapons. The DC is high enough that you can expect that even high level creatures will fail sometimes, though it won\u2019t be consistent since Constitution saves tend to be disproportionately high. The poisoned condition imposes disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks, which your party front-liners are going to love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price compared to other poisons is better than anything listed in the DMG, aside from perhaps harvesting poison from a captured creature. There are a few injury poisons, such as the serpent\u2019s venom, wyvern poison, and purple worm poison that deal half damage on a save, which, unfortunately, the poisoner feat poison does not do. If they save against the DC, that\u2019s a dose of poison expended for nothing, but you can try again next round (or until you run out of poison).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"selling-your-poisonnbsp\">Selling Your Poison <\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most \u201cbreakable\u201d ability in the Poisoner feat is its crafted poison\u2019s ability to be traded. A basic poison vial\u2019s listed market price is 100gp, and the poison you are creating with this feat is simply better than a basic poison vial on every level, aside from the basic poison\u2019s ability to be applied to 3 pieces of ammunition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running very conservative math, let&#8217;s assume the Poisoner feat poison\u2019s market value is 100gp, like the basic poison. Even if you have to sell the poison at half price so the reseller can mark it up to market value, you\u2019re selling a single dose of the poisoner feat poison for 50gp. As you can craft a number of doses equal to your proficiency bonus for 50 gold, a first level character with this feat can double their money provided they find a place to unload their inventory of poison. As your proficiency bonus increases, so does your profit margin as you craft more poison per batch. If you\u2019re able to place the Poisoner feat poison\u2019s market value higher than the basic poison, then you\u2019re turning an even greater profit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Unloading your inventory may be tricky, and it\u2019s certainly morally dubious to flood a market with poison. Obviously, you\u2019re going to have to unload your stock in civilized areas, so, in games where you\u2019re often traveling in the wilderness, this strategy may not be as effective. Additionally, within the DMG, poisons are stated to be broadly illegal in most societies, so likely you\u2019re going to be dealing primarily with unscrupulous criminals and merchants. It may be worth starting with the criminal background for a contact that you could reliably deal with. As a player, I\u2019d attempt to set up a situation in which the party Face could work out a deal to sell directly to a military.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a DM, I\u2019d make sure this has consequences, such as having enemy NPCs start their opening salvos with weapons coated with the poison that you have created with your own hands. I personally think having players running an underground poison ring is interesting enough to let it play out, but exploiting one of the largest weak spots in D&amp;D\u2019s design (its economy) isn\u2019t going to fly with every DM. DMs are well within their rights to make it so nobody will purchase your poison, scale up the cost of the raw materials to make poison, or throw player characters in jail, so be warned.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-problems-with-poison\">The Problems With Poison<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Poisons generally suffer from \u201cthe consumable item problem.\u201d Using poison consumes the dose of poison, and a dose of poison often has hefty price tag attached. Compounded with this, the poison may still be negated with a single successful saving throw. This makes it challenging for players to know when is the best time to deploy them effectively. Because of these factors, it\u2019s possible that a dose of poison will sit in a player\u2019s inventory for an entire campaign. This can be negated having a lot of poison on your person, as it&#8217;s easier to expend a resource if it doesn&#8217;t feel scarce. Either by harvesting or crafting poison with the Poisoner feat, players will have enough poison to feel free to use them every combat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Applying poisons to a weapon is an action, performed with the Use an Object action. This generally means that, to make effective use of your time, you should output a worse debuff or higher damage than two of your turns combined. In most cases, the best way to do this is to apply poison before you enter combat, giving you one use of poison per fight.&nbsp;The action use to apply poison can be turned into a bonus action use, making poison vastly more efficient. You can do this if you have the Poisoner feat or if you are a rogue with the Thief archetype (Fast Hands).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, the single largest strike against poison use is that a high proportion of creatures are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition outright. While it\u2019s not always clear to a player which creatures will be immune, a good rule of thumb is that constructs, elementals, fiends and undead will not be affected by poison. There is nothing that can be done to circumvent this issue. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"poison-types\">Poison Types<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>There are four categories of poison, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Understanding what type of poison and when to apply and how to apply them will make you much more efficient in their use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Contact<\/span>: Carefully slather it on a weapon, throw a glass vial of it, or grab a brush and paint it on a door handle. Unlike injury poisons, contact poisons can be applied to bludgeoning weapons. As long as a creature touches contact poison with their skin, they have to make the save. Unfortunately, there are very few sample contact poisons, and the sample poisons have low DCs. You trade ease of use for reduced reliability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ingested<\/span>: The most difficult method of delivering poison to a victim. This requires you to have access to your foe\u2019s food or drink, which happens rarely without good planning. Many ingested poisons have effects that are strong enough to partially offset that drawback, but enemies may still save out of the effects which makes it a big gamble.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Inhaled<\/span>: Inhaled poisons are great because they generally don\u2019t require an attack roll, though a DM may ask for one if you throw a bottle or other container to release the poison. Inhaled poisons not requiring an attack roll is also something of a double-edged sword, as inhaled poisons can\u2019t be applied to weapons and take an action to use. However, the Thief Rogue can use an object as a bonus action, which improves its effectiveness in combat greatly. Note that a target holding their breath doesn\u2019t stave off the poison, and the 5-foot cloud of poison disperses immediately after use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Injury<\/span>: For an injury poison to take effect, you have to hit with and deal damage with a piercing or slashing weapon. It\u2019s worse than contact as a delivery method, but it\u2019s reliable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sample-poisonsnbsp\">Sample Poisons <\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a ranking of each of the sample poisons listed in the DMG, as well as the basic poison in the PHB, and the Poisoner Feat\u2019s Poison from TCE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contact:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Carrion Crawler Mucus<\/span>: Think of this as the Hold Person spell delivered through a poison. Even though the DC is middling, and the affected creature gets multiple chances to save out of it, you\u2019re giving all your front line fighters automatic critical hits and denying the target their next turn if they fail once. Just make sure to prepare an action triggered by the end of the creature&#8217;s turn so that all your allies can make attacks against it. It&#8217;s harvestable, so, if you can find a way to capture a carrion crawler alive, this is incredible, especially applying it as a bonus action with the Poisoner feat.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Oil of Taggit<\/span>: The save DC is mediocre, but this causes a foe to become poisoned and unconscious for 24 hours, the creature\u2019s allies have to actually damage the affected creature to wake them up (which is useful if enemies are roleplayed like normal people who care about their allies, or less-than-sentient foes.) Because it\u2019s a contact poison, you never actually need to fight the creature. Excellent for kidnapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ingested:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Assassin\u2019s Blood<\/span>: The DC is abysmally low, and the damage probably won&#8217;t kill anything but a commoner. Afflicting a creature with the poisoned condition for 24 hours is nice, but probably not worth sneaking poison into someone\u2019s food for a listed price of 150gp.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Midnight Tears<\/span>: The DC is quite high for a poison. Because you know the exact time that the creature is going to take the poison damage, and that they will take at least half of it (provided they\u2019re not immune) this is an excellent set up for a future ambush. If multiple doses can be added to ingested poison, it\u2019s possible that you could dose an enemy with enough poison to kill them outright, a feat which is challenging to do with nearly any other type of poison.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pale Tincture<\/span>: The DC is solid, and the effects are very unique. An afflicted creature can\u2019t heal by any means for seven days. If you are going up against an enemy much stronger than you and you can spend the time taking pot shots at them over the course of a week, this is a very fun way to do that. Unfortunately, a poisoned creature can always use Lesser Restoration to make it all go away.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Torpor<\/span>: The DC is good enough, and, if a creature fails against this you can kill them with ease because of the incapacitated condition. Incapacitating a creature is a great way to interrogate someone, since they can still talk.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Truth Serum<\/span>: The DC is very low, and the effect isn\u2019t great. Because the poison replicates the effects of the Zone of Truth spell, the creature is aware of the fact that they cannot tell lies, and it\u2019s a simple deduction from there that they\u2019ve been poisoned. Unlike Zone of Truth, you don\u2019t get to know if they\u2019ve succeeded or failed on their saving throw because you\u2019re not casting the spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inhaled:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Burnt Othur Fumes<\/span>: While it\u2019s interesting that this poison continues until the affected creature succeeds three times, an initial success avoids the entire process, and the DC and damage dealt are not worth the listed price of 500gp.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Essence of Ether<\/span>: With a DC of 15, Essence of Ether has the highest save of any of the sample poisons that knock a creature unconscious.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Malice<\/span>: The save DC is fairly high and everyone benefits from not being targeted by sight-based abilities, but rogues can make the most use of this. They can hide in what would otherwise be plain view as a bonus action, obscuring the sound they make.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Injury:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Basic Poison<\/span>: The DC is terrible, the damage is worse, and after being applied for a minute, it\u2019s unusable. Why its listed price is 100gp is beyond me.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Drow Poison<\/span>: At a 200gp listed price, drow poison is the cheapest way to knock a foe unconscious with poison. However the DC to knock a creature unconscious is 8, so I\u2019d pay the extra 100 gold and spring for Essence of Ether instead.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poisoner Feat Poison<\/span>: The Poisoner feat poison is a strange case. It\u2019s not a true injury poison as it can be applied to bludgeoning weapons. The save DC is mediocre, but the damage output is decent. It\u2019s also the cheapest poison available, though you\u2019ll have to take a feat and craft it yourself. Like basic poison, after being applied for a minute it&#8217;s unusable.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Purple Worm Poison<\/span>: The highest DC and damage dealt of any sample poison listed. It deals damage even if the creature saves. In theory, it\u2019s harvestable, but almost certainly only from a dead purple worm because incapacitating and imprisoning one of them would require more ingenuity than we can offer you.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Serpent Venom<\/span>: Even though the DC is quite low, you\u2019ll deal half damage if the creature saves. Of the listed poisons that are harvestable, a giant poisonous snake is probably the easiest creature to capture, incapacitate, and potentially travel with. Giant poisonous snakes are even a valid beastmaster companion option.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wyvern Poison<\/span>: A good save DC and solid damage even if the creature saves. It\u2019s harvestable, so capturing a wyvern alive could be a consistent source of a great deal of damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"harvesting-poison\">Harvesting Poison<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The DMG has rules for harvesting a poison, allowing you to extract poison from a dead or incapacitated poisonous creature. There are four creatures which the DMG gives as examples of their poison, but the DMG states that many poisonous creatures can be harvested this way. By RAW, the creature must be dead or incapacitated, but it stands to reason that a willing creature could allow their poison to be harvested as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Harvesting a poison takes 1d6 minutes. This requires a DC 20 nature check or a poisoner\u2019s tools check. If you fail the check by more than 5, you expose yourself to the poison. With either the nature or poisoner\u2019s tools check, you\u2019re likely going to be using intelligence as the governing modifier, though there\u2019s a potential argument for wisdom or dexterity with the poisoner tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means prioritizing your intelligence if you foresee doing this regularly, and adding twice your proficiency to either check makes this a great deal more reliable. The Artificer makes for an excellent poison harvester, as well as rogues with a decent intelligence score, or any character with the skill expert feat. Guidance, bardic inspiration, and the Help action make this a lot more reliable at lower levels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"making-sense-of-poison-harvesting\">Making Sense of Poison Harvesting<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the DMG is infuriatingly vague on what \u201ca poisonous creature\u201d precisely is, and doesn\u2019t distinguish between \u201cpoisonous\u201d (the one where eating it is bad) and \u201cvenomous\u201d (the one where it eating you is bad). The exact wording from the text is \u201ca character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern or carrion crawler.\u201d We know from the sample poisons in the DMG that this also includes purple worms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By looking at the sample poisons and the provided examples of harvistable creatures, we can infer a few things. At a minimum, it can be inferred that the intent is to define this as a creature that deals poison damage or causes the poisoned condition with a feature of their anatomy. Of our four clear examples given in the rules for harvesting poisons. All of the sample poisons that can be harvested from a creature are a contact or injury poison.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>5th edition doesn\u2019t have a difference in classification between natural and weapon attacks, so we have to define exactly what can be harvested ourselves. My chosen interpretation is that any creature that deals poison damage or causes the poisoned condition with a beard (yes, really), bite, claw, fist, slam, spit poison, sting, tail, tentacle, or touch attack, or the poisonous skin feature can be harvested. Your DM\u2019s mileage may vary.&nbsp;Whether or not an inhaled poison can be extracted from a creature is neither explicitly allowed or forbidden, as there are no examples either way. See \u201cIs This a Harvestable Poison?\u201d, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a great deal of creatures who deal poison damage do not actually require a constitution saving throw for the poison to take effect. An example of this is the Flying Snake, and we know from the provided examples that snakes are harvestable for poison. This presents a dilemma to DMs if they have players extracting poison, as allowing a player to use a poison with no save DC may be deemed overpowered.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>As a house rule to address this gap, you might require all extracted poisons to have a Constitution saving throw. Doing a bit of reverse engineering of the mechanics, the DC should be equal to 8 + the harvested creature\u2019s proficiency bonus + their Constitution modifier. If the extracted poison deals damage, have the poison deal half damage on a successful save. This is consistent with the DCs provided by nearly all creatures that deal poison damage or cause the Poisoned condition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DM\u2019s Note:<\/strong> A soft nerf you can do to make it more challenging to harvest poison is to make the corpses of outsiders (celestials, fiends) turn to dust, fade away or bubble into liquid. This doesn\u2019t prevent your players from harvesting poison, but now they have to get clever about it. If that\u2019s still not enough, a hard nerf you can do is to have all poisons extracted replicate the effects of one of the sample poisons. You might also have poisons not listed in the DMG expire after a brief period (24 hours seems reasonable) so that players can\u2019t stockpile them. This allows the poisons to be used briefly while also explaining why only shelf-stable poisons are available for purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"possibly-harvestable-poisons\">(Possibly) Harvestable Poisons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Doing our best to interpret the vague rules on harvesting poison, the following poisons are from the creatures that are likely harvestable by both RAI and centrist\u2019s reading of RAW, but your DM\u2019s mileage may vary. The rules regarding which poisons can and cannot be harvested will ultimately always be their choice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All poisons that deal flat damage or half damage on a save are rated green or above. They can be applied to your weapon before combat or during combat (with the Poisoner feat) and increase your damage output with almost no drawback.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Basilisk\u2019s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison. Deals 2d6 damage without a save. Always useful.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bearded Devil\u2019s Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 12. Poisons the target and makes them unable to heal while poisoned. The effect ends after 1 minute, or until the creature makes a successful saving throw, which they can do at the end of each of their turns.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bone Devil&#8217;s Sting<\/span>: Injury poison. Deals 5d6 damage without a save, which is insane, and then forces the target to make a DC 14 save against the poisoned condition, which is okay. They can save out of the condition at the end of their turn, but we\u2019re here for the damage.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bone Naga Venom<\/span>: Injury Poison. Deals 3d6 damage without a save. Better than basilisk poison, and that was already good.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chuul Poison<\/span>: Contact poison. DC 13. Poisoning a creature for 1 minute or until they save out of it is bad, and the DC is low. Don\u2019t use this unless you have no other poisons.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Couatl\u2019s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison. DC 13. As a poison that knocks a creature unconscious this could be compared to drow poison, except it has a higher DC, a longer duration and damage doesn\u2019t awaken the creature (yet somehow shaking them awake does?) This is a free kill on any isolated creature, provided they fail the save. Couatls are lawful good, and can be summoned with the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#conjure-celestial\">Conjure Celestial<\/a> spell, so you could potentially just ask to harvest some of its poison if you give it a reason why that would be in its interest.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Corpse Flower Poison<\/span>: Contact poison. Deals 3d6 damage without a save. Always useful.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dire Troll&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison. The target takes 1d10 damage without a save, which is good. It would be challenging in normal circumstances to capture a huge creature and keep it in a cage, but trolls have regeneration. Cut off its head, and carry it with you, and maybe it will keep generating more poison. It also might grow back its body, so it\u2019s a risky play.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Drider Venom<\/span>: Injury poison. Deals 2d8 damage without a save.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drow Arachnomancer\u2019s Bite<\/span>: Injury Poison, DC 15. A good DC, 7d8 damage which is great even if the target saves for half. If the poison damage reduces a target to 0, the target is stable and paralyzed for an hour, making it one of the only ways to deal \u201cnonlethal\u201d damage at range, and making weapons that deal 1 point of damage like the dart or blowgun useful.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drow Arachnomancer\u2019s Touch<\/span>: Contact Poison. 10d6 damage without a save, and it\u2019s a contact poison. If you needed an example of why you should be using the house rule in the previous section, this is it.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ettercap&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury, DC 11. 1d8 damage is fairly low, and the DC is low enough that they\u2019ll save out of the poisoned condition in a round unless you are very lucky, but it\u2019s still additional damage which doesn\u2019t require a save, so it\u2019s worth using.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Female Steeder&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison. This deals 2d8 damage without requiring a save. It\u2019s also one of the few harvestable creatures designed as a mount, giving you an additional reason to bring it with you on adventures.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flying Snake Venom<\/span>: Injury poison. This requires no saving throw and simply adds an average 3d4 damage to an attack, making it an extremely consistent poison. As a tiny creature, the snake is pretty easy to cart around in a cage on adventures for harvesting. The flying snake is also an option for beastmaster ranger companions, making it easy to gather plenty of its venom if you are a beastmaster or have one in your party.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Geryon&#8217;s Sting<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 21. The DC is very high, but that\u2019s to be expected from an archdevil, and it\u2019s nice considering nothing happens on a successful save. This deals a little chunk of damage (2d12), poisons a creature until it finishes a rest and reduces its maximum hit points. Reducing your enemy\u2019s max hit points is a mechanic that\u2019s more deadly to be on the receiving end of as a player than it is for NPCs because, in general, if the PCs choose to fight something, the fight won\u2019t end until one side is dead, and that\u2019s not expected to be the PCs. Like most of the archdevils and demon lord poisons, it\u2019s underwhelming as an option for players.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Centipede Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 11.&nbsp; Alright damage (3d6) and it\u2019s a save for half, so it\u2019s always useful, even with its low DC. This is the first poison in a series of insect and arachnid poisons that paralyze the target if it is reduced to 0 hit points by the poison damage for an hour even after regaining hit points, making it one of the few ways to deal \u201cnonlethal\u201d damage at range, and giving an actual use to weapons that deal 1 point of damage like darts and the blowgun. Additionally, The giant centipede is an option for beastmaster ranger companions, making it easy to gather plenty of its venom if you are a beastmaster or have one in your party.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Scorpion Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 12. This does 4d10 damage, or half on a successful save, making it a reliable poison even with its low DC. Like all save-for-halfs, it remains useful in every combat that poison could be used in.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Spider Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 11. Nearly identical to the giant centipede poison, except it does slightly less damage (2d8). Also a poison that stabilizes the target at 0, so useful for nonlethal ranged attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Toad Poison<\/span>: Injury poison. Deals 1d10 damage without a save. Always good.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Wasp Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 11. Identical wording to the giant centipede poison. Good for nonlethal ranged attacks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Wolf Spider Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 11. Similar to the giant centipede, spider and wasp, but deals the least damage of the bunch (2d6). Good for nonlethal ranged attacks.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu\u2019s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 12. Not a save for half, mediocre damage (2d6), no interesting additional debuffs, and the save is pretty bad.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green Abishai\u2019s Claw<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 16. Not a save for half, but the DC is solid and the damage is good (3d10), and the target is poisoned for a minute. They can attempt to save out of the poisoned condition at the end of their turns.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Grell Poison<\/span>: Contact poison, DC 11. The DC is abysmal, but paralyzing a target, even for one round is worth the attempt. It\u2019s a contact poison, so just slap it on something the enemy will probably touch.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Grung Poison<\/span>: Contact poison, DC 12. No damage, just the poisoned condition for a minute and the target can remake the save at the end of their turn. However, each grung color has a variant poison with more interesting effects.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blue Grung<\/span>: This forces the target to make a loud noise at the beginning and end of their turn. It could be useful if you are fighting an enemy good at hiding, but the DC is so low that it\u2019s not going to last very long.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gold Grung<\/span>: This makes the target charmed by the grung the poison came from, who is probably long gone, so it being charmed doesn\u2019t help you at all.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Green Grung<\/span>: This makes the only movement a creature can take be jumps or climbing, and a flying creature can\u2019t take actions unless it lands. Silly, but still good against flying creatures.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange Grung<\/span>: The target becomes frightened of its allies. This makes it unable to gang up on any creature its allies are already attacking.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Purple Grung<\/span>: This could be fun if there\u2019s a vat of acid or huge pit with water at the bottom. It\u2019s nice to shut down actions and movement either way.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Red Grung<\/span>: The target must eat food if it&#8217;s within arms reach. This could be a useful way to get a creature to consume an ingested poison out of your hands.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guardian Naga\u2019s Poison<\/span>: Contact poison, DC 15. 10d8 is a lot of damage, even halved, and the save is good. Plus, a guardian naga is lawful good, so if you can explain how you\u2019ll use its poison responsibly, it might let you harvest from it.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Homunculus\u2019 Bite<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 10. This is a bad poison. The save is as low as possible, which means failing it by 5 basically necessitates a natural 1. You can make a homunculus with the Create Homunculus spell, which makes it fairly easy to come by, but it\u2019s hardly worth the time invested.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hutijin\u2019s Bite<\/span>: Injury Poison, DC 22. This doesn\u2019t deal a lot of damage, but the damage is not the point. This denies targets the ability to heal from damage. In a fight against a creature with regeneration or access to healing, this is great.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Imp&#8217;s Sting<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 11. 3d6 damage to the target, or half if they save. Extra damage is always nice, and this poison is very easy to come by because it\u2019s a familiar option for the chain pact warlocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Male Steeder&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison. This is virtually the same as the female steeder poison, except the target takes 1d8 instead of 2d8 poison damage.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Myconid Poison<\/span>: Contact poison, variable DC and damage based on age category. 1d4 poison damage for sprout, 2d4 poison damage for the adult, 3d4 poison damage for the sovereign.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Neogi&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison, variable DC and damage based on the age category of the neogi. DC 10 and 1d6 poison damage for hatchling, and DC 12 and 4d6 poison damage for adult.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Orcus&#8217; Poison<\/span>: Contact poison. 2d8 poison damage. If you\u2019ve already beat orcus, this poison is so weak it\u2019s probably not even worth harvesting.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phase Spider Poison<\/span>: Injury Poison DC 11. This is very similar to the giant centipede or spider poison, but it deals more damage (4d8.) Useful for dealing \u201cnonlethal\u201d damage through ranged attacks.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pit Fiend&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury Poison, DC 21. Another poison that makes it so the target can\u2019t heal, except this one also deals ongoing 6d6 damage with no listed end time. Targets can save out of it, but the DC is pretty high.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Poisonous Snake Venom<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 10. A measly 2d4 damage with a bad save DC, but it\u2019s a save for half and every little bit of damage counts. As a size tiny, unintelligent creature, this is probably one of the easiest animals to take with you on an adventure and use for poison harvesting purposes. Additionally, it seems like an easy enough animal to find in the wild or purchase from a vendor in most campaigns. It\u2019s also certainly intended as a poison harvesting target by both RAW and RAI.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pseudodragon&#8217;s Sting<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 11. The target becomes poisoned, but if they fail the save by 5 or more they are knocked unconscious. The Pseudodragon is a familiar option for the chain pact warlocks, making it easy to gather plenty of its venom if you are a chain pact warlock, or have one in the party.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quasit&#8217;s Claw<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 10. A poor save, poor damage (2d4), and not a save for half. The quasit is a familiar option for the chain pact warlocks, but you should be harvesting from an imp if you are a chain warlock or have one in your party.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scorpion Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 9. The target is probably never going to fail this save, and the damage is only 1d8, but it\u2019s a save for half, and an effective 1d4 additional damage is still a good thing. Plus, scorpions are tiny, so it\u2019s easy to keep a container of them for poison harvesting when you are on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sea Spawn&#8217;s Poison Quills<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 12. The target is poisoned for 1 minute, and can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shoosiva&#8217;s Sting<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 14. The save DC is alright for a paralyze effect, and most parties can output a lot of damage with automatic critical hits. This is worth it, even if the target can save out of it in a turn or two.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spider Poison<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 9. Not a save for half, only deals 1d4 damage if the target fails, and the saving throw is as bad as it gets. Don\u2019t waste your time harvesting this.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Star Spawn Larva Mage&#8217;s Poison<\/span>: Contact poison. DC 19. The save DC is great, but all you\u2019re doing is dropping the poisoned condition for one round. You have better poisons at this point.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Thri-kreen&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison. DC 11. Imposes the poisoned condition unless the target fails the save by 5 or more, which would instead cause them to be paralyzed. The paralyzed condition is great, but the DC is so low this probably isn\u2019t worth your time unless you have an NPC Thri-kreen friend willing to let you harvest poison from them. Unfortunately PC Thri-kreen can not generate this poison.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tlincalli&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury Poison. DC 14. Identical to the thri-kreen\u2019s bite, except the DC is high enough you might want to actually use it.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Yochlol&#8217;s Poison<\/span>: Contact poison plus 21 (6d6) poison damage. No save.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Yuan-ti Abomination&#8217;s Poison<\/span>: Injury poison. 3d6 poison without a save.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Yuan-ti Anathema\u2019s Poison<\/span>: Injury poison. 4d6 poison damage without a save. Tied with Malison for the highest damage a Yuan-ti\u2019s poison can deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Yuan-ti Malison&#8217;s Poison<\/span>: Injury poison. 4d6 poison damage without a save. Tied with anathema for the highest damage a Yuan-ti\u2019s poison can deal.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Yuan-ti Mind Whisperer&#8217;s Poison<\/span>: Injury poison. 2d6 poison damage without a save.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Yuan-ti Pit Master&#8217;s Poison<\/span>: Injury poison. 2d6 poison damage without a save.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Zuggtmoy\u2019s Poison<\/span>: Contact poison. This does 2d8 poison damage without a save.

They\u2019re included here so that you and your group can make that decision together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Harvesting Inhaled Poisons<\/strong><br>There\u2019s no reason to assume inhaled poisons can\u2019t be harvested, but neither is there a reason to assume they can be. We are not given enough examples in the DMG for creatures that are able to be harvested for poison, so this is a question that should be considered by each DM individually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creatures that could be harvested for inhaled poisons would have a spores or breath attack, or the stench property (which is covered later in this article.) There aren\u2019t a lot of inhaled poisons that could be harvested, but a few of those that can are some of the strongest monster attacks in the game, which may reasonably put any DM off on letting players use them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dretch\u2019s Fetid Cloud<\/span>: Inhaled poison, DC 11. Causes the poisoned condition, and doesn\u2019t allow the target to use both an action and a bonus action on the same turn. Also the target can\u2019t take reactions. The latter part is probably the most useful, since not a lot of monsters have bonus actions.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Green Dragon Breath<\/span>: Inhaled poison. DC and damage based on the age category of the dragon. This ranges from a DC 11 and 6d6 damage with wyrmling, all the way to DC 17 and 22d6 damage with an ancient dragon. All of them allow a creature to save for half damage.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Golem Breath<\/span>: Inhaled poison. DC 19. This deals 10d8 poison damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. It\u2019s great. Plus the Manual of Golems allows the creation of an iron golem who will follow your commands, though the price to build one is a whopping 100,000gp and 120 days of work. On the off chance you can do this, you have access to a near infinite supply of what is essentially nerve gas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Myconid&#8217;s Euphoria Spores<\/span>: Inhaled poison, DC 11 (Adult) or 12 (Sovereign). This makes the target poisoned, which is fine, but after the poisoned condition, it gains a level of exhaustion. Exhaustion debuffs are really hard to come by, but they do stack and the effects get very bad for the target. Hit someone with this, and then drop Sickening Radiance on them.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vegepygmy Chief&#8217;s Spores<\/span>: Inhaled Poison. DC 12. Imposes the poisoned condition on the target, and then an ongoing 2d8 poison damage.

Stench does cause the Poisoned condition, but not every DM will see it as a poison. With no examples in the DMG stating one way or the other, it\u2019s up to each DM to decide for themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stench basically all operates the same way, aside from the creatures affected and the range of the stench (always 5 or 10 feet.) We can ignore the range of the stench if we\u2019re harvesting it, since we\u2019ll be delivering it as an inhaled poison, which always only occupies a 5-foot space. All of these are fairly lackluster as an object to use as an action, as they only last until the start of the creature\u2019s turn, and the creature is immune to the effects of the stench for 24 hours on a successful saving throw.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Catoblepas Stench<\/span>: Inhaled poison, DC 16. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature other than a catoblepas.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Corpse Flower Stench<\/span>: inhaled poison, DC 14. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature that isn\u2019t a construct or undead.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ghast Stench<\/span>: Inhaled, DC 10. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hezrou Stench<\/span>: Inhaled poison, DC 14. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Jubilex&#8217;s Foul<\/span>: Inhaled poison, DC 21. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature. Unlike other stench, creatures are not immune to it after succeeding on a save.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Leucrotta Stench<\/span>: Inhaled poison. DC 12. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature other than a leucrotta or gnoll.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stench Kow Stench<\/span>: Inhaled poison. DC 12. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature other than stench kows.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Troglodyte Stench<\/span>: Inhaled poison, DC 12. Inflicts the poisoned condition on any creature other than troglodytes.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disease-poisons\">Disease \u201cPoisons\u201d<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>In a similar vein to stench poisons, It\u2019s unclear if diseases that cause the target to take poison damage or suffer from the poisoned condition count as poisons exactly. Certainly, we have real life examples of people weaponizing diseases (anthrax is a good example of this), but we\u2019re definitely leaning into a more liberal interpretation of what a poison is at this point.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bulezau&#8217;s Barbs<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 13. This lowers the target\u2019s maximum hit points by 1d8 every 24 hours. The target is covered in flies, sheds it&#8217;s rotting skin and coughs up flies, which is a pretty horrible thing to subject someone to. Reducing a creature\u2019s maximum hit points over the course of days isn\u2019t usually tactically advantageous for a player.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Death Dog&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 13. This is like the bulezau\u2019s barbs, minus all the body horror. Every 24 hours the target\u2019s max hit points are reduced by 1d10.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gas Spore&#8217;s Touch<\/span>: Contact poison, DC 10. This deals 1 poison damage, and subjects the target to death in a number of hours equal to 1d12+ the target\u2019s constitution score. When the creature dies, it sprouts 2d4 tiny gas spores, from which you can harvest more poison. This can be useful for assassinations against targets without access to lesser restoration, or genociding an entire settlement, but that\u2019s really the only tactical use. The latter will almost certainly constitute an alignment change to evil.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Otyug&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 15. Identical to the death dog\u2019s bite.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rutterkin&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: Injury poison, DC 13. The target is poisoned. It can repeat the save after each long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, it becomes an abyssal wretch, which might be useful against a few creatures that resurrect upon death.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weird-poisons\">Weird Poisons<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Some creatures poison with very strange effects or interactions that probably weren\u2019t ever meant to be harvested, but perhaps still could be with a liberal interpretation of RAW, and in some cases a little bit of homebrew.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clockwork Iron Cobra&#8217;s Bite<\/span>: DC 13, Injury poison. This would be a normal poison, except you roll a d6 to see if the target is confused (on a result of 1-2), paralyzed (on a result of 3-4) or takes 3d8 poison damage. All of these results are pretty great.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flumph&#8217;s Stench Spray<\/span>: No Save, Contact poison. This one\u2019s really strange because while it seems like it should be an inhaled poison, the flumph\u2019s stench spray attack uses a dexterity saving throw instead of a constitution saving throw, implying all it needs to do to take effect is to touch a creature. It would otherwise it would be included in the inhaled section. It\u2019s easily the most interesting \u201cstench poison\u201d, as it poisons every creature within 5 feet of it without a save. This might be unwieldy to use, but at a 1d4 hour duration, it\u2019s very funny.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kraken\u2019s Ink: Of every poison a monster creates in the core books, this one needs to be homebrewed the most for a character to use. It deals 3d10 damage, has a DC 23 save and because it seemingly only works underwater, it\u2019s completely unclear as to whether it is a contact or inhaled poison. Ask your DM how\/if it works the next time you kill a kraken.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wrastilith\u2019s Foul Water<\/span>: Ingested poison, DC 18. This deals 4d6 damage on its first save, and after a minute the target must make an additional save or take 4d8 damage and be poisoned until it takes a long rest. Not technically harvestable, but could still be collected as the Wrastilith generates it unconsciously. It\u2019s the only poison from a monster I can find in the core books that would count as an ingestible poison. Plus it can heal demons, which is kind of fun if you have a quasit familiar.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"frequently-asked-questions-about-poisons\">Frequently Asked Questions about Poisons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the general ambiguity surrounding a lot of the poison rules, I thought it prudent to have a section with questions.

In real life (according to the National Institute of Health) venom can be harvested from snakes every 60 days, but that\u2019s not entirely consistent with how much venom snakes seem capable of producing in game. As a DM, this is one of the tools you can use to make sure that players don\u2019t harvest so much poison that it becomes problematic.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1661090725700\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Do effects that stem from the poisoned condition stack on top of each other? Do multiple ongoing poisons of the same type stack?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Spells with ongoing effects of the same type cannot affect a creature twice. Poisons are not spells. That being said, you also can\u2019t get the poisoned condition twice, and the poisoned condition underlies most ongoing poison effects. This is a double-edged sword though: If DMs rule this way, they should prepare for players to have their characters get drunk before battles with venomous creatures, so that they won&#8217;t be affected by the creature\u2019s poisoned condition effects.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1661090738511\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">For ingested poison, if a dose is added to a communal food container, how many people are affected by it?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>This is DM fiat, though the rules on inhaled poisons do say that the DM can choose for a partial dose to affect creatures with a reduced effect, either by granting them advantage on the save or lessening the damage dealt.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1661090767619\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can I harvest poison from transmuted or conjured creatures?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>This is totally outside the range of material covered in the rules, so the answer is it\u2019s totally up to your DM. If you are a player, you should try it. If you are a DM you should always make the poison disappear when the spell ends.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1661090770834\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How much can I sell a poison I harvested for?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Assume resellers will buy poison from you at half the market value, so 100gp for Serpent Venom, 150gp for Carrion Crawler Mucus, 600gp for Wyvern Poison, and 1000gp for Purple Worm Poison. The market value of a basic poison is 100gp, and pretty much every poison you can harvest is better than it. However, DMs are totally within their rights to change the market value of things or to make them difficult to sell since most honest people don\u2019t have a use for poison.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Poisoners are a classic character trope within the fantasy genre at large: Cunning assassins who only need to drop a small vial into their enemies food to do them in, as well as those who coat their blades with malicious substances to get an edge on their foes.
