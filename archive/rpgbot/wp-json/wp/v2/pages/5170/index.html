Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Sorcerer Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Charisma is the Sorcerer&#8217;s Key Ability\n\tScore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: 6+Con hit points. Fortunately you\n\thave plenty of room to boost your ability scores so your Constitution bonus\n\tcan compensate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Sorcerer&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are terrible. Except to get by on spellcasting and charm.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Start at Trained, and one of\n\t\tthe worst Perception proficiency progressions in the same.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Your best save is Will,\n\t\tand the Sorcerer&#8217;s Will save progression is still below average.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: One or more skills from your\n\t\tBloodline, plus 2+int Trained skills at 1st level, for a total of at least\n\t\t3+. That&#8217;s standard, but with no other need for Intelligence you may find\n\t\tthat you&#8217;re short on Skill Increases. Every bloodline in the Core Rulebook\n\t\tprovides two, so it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll get 4+ unless Paizo comes up with\n\t\tbloodlines that don&#8217;t get two skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: Only Simple weapons, and among the\n\t\tworst proficiency progressions in the game. But you&#8217;re going to use spells,\n\t\tso it&#8217;s no great loss.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: No armor, and the worst unarmored\n\t\tdefense progression in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spells<\/strong>: Standard progression for every full spellcaster\n\t\twith the exception of the Warpriest Cleric.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bloodline<\/strong>: See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/bloodlines\">Sorcerer Bloodlines Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sorcerer Spellcasting<\/strong>: The Sorcerer&#8217;s spellcasting is unique in several ways. The Sorcerer gets one more leveled spell slot and one more spell known of each level than other full spellcasters at each spell level except 10th. Considering that most spellcasters get just 3 spell slots at each spell level, that&#8217;s fully a third more spells than anyone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Spells<\/span>: Heightening spells is\n\t\tan important mechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many spells scale them. Since sorcerers\n\t\tuse a Spell Repertoire, you need to learn spells at multiple levels to\n\t\thighten them in most cases, though Signature Spells are an exception.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Fantastic every time, on any\n\t\tcharacter, in any amount. Sorcerers learn 5 cantrips at level 1 and never\n\t\tget more, but you can replace them by retraining or when you gain a level so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not locked into whatever you pick at first level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Repertoire<\/span>: Spell Repertoires are\n\tless versatile than spellcasting like the Cleric&#8217;s or the Druid&#8217;s. You know a\n\tfixed number of spells which grows as you gain levels, and while you don&#8217;t\n\tneed to prepare your spells ahead of time you also lose the flexibility of\n\tchanging your spells every day. You also need to learn the same spells as\n\tmultiple levels if you plan to heighten them, which is a difficult cost to\n\tpay. Fortunately, the Sorcerer&#8217;s Signature Spells feature (see below) allows you\n\tto heighten some of your spells without learning them multiple times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sorcerer Feats<\/strong>: See Sorcerer feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Signature Spells<\/span>: A powerful and important\n\tfeature, this allows you to heighten a small set of spells without learning\n\tthem multiple times. As their name suggests, these spells will be your go-to\n\toptions in most situations, and choosing good spells will be absoutely\n\tcrucial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Magical Fortitude<\/span>: More saves is always\n\tgreat, but this is as high as you ever get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Spellcaster<\/span>: Standard and essential\n\tfor spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: More saves is always\n\tgreat, but this is as high as you ever get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alertness<\/span>: Perception is absolutely\n\tcrucial, but this is the best you will ever get without spending General\n\tFeats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Simple Weapon Expertise<\/span>: You should never\n\tneed this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Robes<\/span>: More AC is great, but this\n\tis the best you will ever get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: You should never need\n\tthis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Spellcaster<\/span>: Standard and essential\n\tfor spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline Paragon<\/span>: 10th-level spells are\n\tcrazy. You can spend a class feat to get another, but it&#8217;s unlikely that\n\tyou&#8217;ll ever cast more than 2 10th-level spells in a day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Legendary Spellcaster<\/span>: Standard and\n\tessential for spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: The Sorcerer has no meaningful use for\n\tStrenght.

Constitution is essential.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Sorcerers get 3+ (realisitically 4+)\n\tTrained skills, so a little Intelligence helps if your party needs more\n\tskills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Perception and Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Your Key Ability Score.

The feat gives you a spellbook as its first\n\t\tfunction, and in addition after completing your daily preperations you pick\n\t\tone spell in your spellbook and gain one of two benefits.\n\t\t<p>The spellbook itself works much like the Wizard&#8217;s. As you gain levels and\n\t\t\tadd more spells to your Spell Repertoire, they&#8217;re added to the spellbook\n\t\t\tfor free. In addition, you can use the Occultism skill to add additional\n\t\t\tspells to your spellbook. Just like the Wizard, you need to add the spell\n\t\t\tat each spell level that you want to be able to cast that spell. For\n\t\t\texample: If you wanted to add False Life to your spellbook, you could use\n\t\t\tthe Occultism skill and the &#8220;Learn a Spell&#8221; activity. This spell is not\n\t\t\tadded to your Spell Repertoire when you learn it this way.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Once you have spells in your spellbook, during your daily preparations\n\t\t\tyou can pick on spell in the spellbook and gain one of two benefits. If\n\t\t\tthe spell is already in your Spell Repertoire, it becomes a Signature\n\t\t\tSpell for you for the day. This allows you to Heighten the spell without\n\t\t\tknowing the spell multiple times at different spell levels. For example:\n\t\t\tIf you has False Life in your Spell Repertoire as a 1st-level spell, you\n\t\t\tcould select it from your spellbook and it would become a Signature Spell.\n\t\t\tThis would then allow you to Heighten it to any level of spell which you\n\t\t\tcan cast.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you instead choose a spell which is in your spellbook but not in your\n\t\t\tSpell Repertoire, you add the spell to your Spell Repertoire for the day,\n\t\t\teffectively learning one extra spell. For example: If you added False Life\n\t\t\tto your spellbook as a 2nd-level spell and did not also have it in your\n\t\t\tSpell Repertoire, then selected that spell from your spellbook, you would\n\t\t\tbe able to spend spell slots to cast False Life as a 2nd-leve spell.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Oh, and you become Trained in one skill.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bespell Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This would be a decent feat on a gish character, but sorcerers get no\n\t\tmeaningful capability with weapons, so they have no meaningful way to make\n\t\tthis useful. You might use this in multiclass builds, but spending a spell\n\t\tslot to activate it for just 1d6 damage will become both expensive and\n\t\tineffective as your level advances.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Evolution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: (Bloodline with Divine Spell List) If you&#8217;re going to heal someone in\n\t\tcombat, you need the Action cost to be justified, which means that you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing to use a high-level spell slot. This removes that cost once per day.\n\t\tYou won&#8217;t be able to match the capabilities of a high-Charisma cleric, but\n\t\tthis is still a decent source of healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elaborate Flourish<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational and the Action cost is too high. Most enemies won&#8217;t be\n\t\table to identify your spells, and even when they can they may not have a\n\t\tspecific way to apply that knowledge. If you want something similar and less\n\t\tcostly, consider the Bizarre Magic skill feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Occult Evolution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: (Bloodline with Occult Spell List) The flexibility offered by this feat\n\t\tis enticing, but remember that it&#8217;s limited to mental occult spells, which\n\t\tmeans spells that are on the Occult spell list and have the &#8220;Mental&#8221; trait.\n\t\tThere are several such spells, generally from the Enchantment or Illusions\n\t\tschools, though there are some other options like Bane and Bless. Occult\n\t\tEvolution is great for getting access to situational spells within those\n\t\tnarrow restrictions, somewhat expandng your spell options beyond the usual\n\t\tconfines of a Spell Repertoire.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Evolution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: (Bloodline with Primal Spell List) Summon spells are reasonably\n\t\teffective, but since they only last a minute and they&#8217;re Sustained, they&#8217;re\n\t\tcostly to cast.

Sure, maybe Bulk is a problem so you&#8217;re using a\n\t\tbuckler and only getting a +1 bonus, but at that point consider casting the\n\t\tShield cantrip. Situations where Diverting Vortex is a better option than a\n\t\tphysical shield or the Shield cantrip are basically non-existent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Energetic Resonance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational, too costly, and not effective enough to justify the\n\t\tcost.

If you have one or two\n\t\tother spellcasters, this can dramatically simplify positioning for your\n\t\tparty by allowing your allies to cast spells from either of two places.\n\t\t<p>This is especially exciting for multiclass builds who are primarily built\n\t\t\tfor front-line melee combat. Imagine this spell on a Champion with an\n\t\t\tallied spellcaster who has powerful spells with Touch range or spells that\n\t\t\thave an Emanation as their area of effect. Casting those spells from a\n\t\t\tsafe distance (you&#8217;ll need to be within Touch range of the Champion in\n\t\t\tthis example, but that&#8217;s not necessarily within Touch range of your\n\t\t\tenemies) makes those spells much more appealing since they&#8217;re not so risky\n\t\t\tto cast.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Steady Spellcasting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The Flat Check is too difficult to make this feat an easy choice. You\n\t\thave a success rate of just 30%.

If you have a\n\t\t\tcrossblooded spell, you must first retrain it back to your own bloodline\n\t\t\tspell list. You can then retrain again to get a crossblooded spell of a\n\t\t\tdifferent spell level.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Safeguard Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: This is obviously tempting for blasters, but the effects go far beyond\n\t\tdropping a fireball on your own feat. You are not affected by the spell for\n\t\tthe entirety of the spell&#8217;s effects. If you drop an area control spell,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re free to walk through its affects unhindered. It&#8217;s not clear how this\n\t\tworks with things like Fog Cloud (are you somehow visible to everyone? can\n\t\tyou see through the fog?), so talk to your GM about how to handle those\n\t\tsituations before you take this feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soulsight<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent counter to stealth, invisiblity, and a bunch of other sneaky\n\t\tbut less-common things like Project Image. You&#8217;re a sorcerer, so once you\n\t\tfind creatures you&#8217;re well-equipped to drop AOE spells on them rather than\n\t\tsuffering through a series of ill-concieved checks to Seek the creature.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sorcerer-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ancestral Mage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re investing a lot of feats to make Ancestral Blood Magic work,\n\t\tthis is a huge asset. Your innate spells can offer access to powerful spells\n\t\toutside of your spell list, diversifying your spellcasting options\n\t\tconsiderably. More spells in your Spell Repertoire also helps address the\n\t\tbiggest limitation of Spell Repertoires.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Energy Fusion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: The additional damage is <em>far<\/em> too small to use this on\n\t\tinstantaneous damage spells like Fireball, which are also the most obvious\n\t\tuse case. Let&#8217;s say that you cast Fireball at 3rd level, dealing 6d6 damage.\n\t\tYou decide that you want some extra damage, and you know Lightning Bolt at\n\t\t3rd level. You spend an Action and a 3rd-level spell slot to add 3 damage to\n\t\tyour fireball. Sure, the damage applies to all of the targets, but if you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t get more than 3 damage per target out of that same spell slot you&#8217;re\n\t\tnot trying hard enough.\n\t\t<p>This might be worthwhile for certain area control spells like Wall of\n\t\t\tFire and ongoing spells like Flaming Sphere, as it appears that the damage\n\t\t\tapplies to each damage roll. Unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t very many of\n\t\t\tthose spells, and even for the ones that qualify it&#8217;s almost certainly\n\t\t\tmore effective to use the spell slot to case a spell.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Energy Ward<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Not a ton of damage resistance, but it&#8217;s still useful and the Action cost\n\t\tis basically free. Unfortunately, creatures which deal energy damage are\n\t\tfrequently resistant or immune to whatever damage they deal (e.g. red\n\t\tdragons and fire damage), so this is most useful against enemies who can\n\t\tdeal multiple types of energy damage, such as other spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Greater Bloodline<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Your final Focus Spell and your third Focus Point.

Most\n\t\tspells have a 2-Action casting time, so getting two spells out in a single\n\t\tturn means that you&#8217;re doing the most important part of two turns in a\n\t\tsingle turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Signature Spell Expansion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Signature Spells are a huge asset and you get very few of them. This\n\t\tallows a great deal of additional flexibility, allowing you to more easily\n\t\tcapitalize on low-level spells which scale well like Heal and Fireball,\n\t\tleaving more room in your spell list for spells which are less consistently\n\t\timportant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sorcerer-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Component Substitution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational.

Against enemies who do have such spells, the\n\t\tAction savings is nice, but likely not enough to justify the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell Shroud<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: The effect is good if you need to defend yourself or nearby allies. The\n\t\tfeat doesn&#8217;t list a duration and we haven&#8217;t seen errata for the Advanced\n\t\tPlayer&#8217;s Guide (as of July 5th, 2021) so it&#8217;s not clear when the effect\n\t\texpires. RAW you&#8217;re stuck in the shroud forever, but I imagine that it&#8217;s\n\t\tsupposed to last one round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reflect Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re going to counter spells, you&#8217;re probably countering something\n\t\toffensive and dangerous enough to justify spending a spell slot to counter\n\t\tit. If that&#8217;s the case, turning it back on the caster is really great. This\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t fix any of the problems with Counterspell, but it makes it\n\t\tconsiderably more exciting to use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sorcerer-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Effortless Concentration<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you rely on spells which require you to sustain them as an Action\n\t\t(entirely possible at this level), this could be a free action every turn.\n\t\tGet a bunch of spells going, sustain two or three, then roll them into a\n\t\tfight and wreck things without casting more spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Mental Evolution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A significant improvement to your number of known spells. Sorcerers know\n\t\tmore spells than most other Spell Repertoire users, but since your number of\n\t\tspells known is the biggest limiting factor of a Spell Repertoire, improving\n\t\tthat number is powerful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Vital Evolution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Realistically this means two spell slots of your highest-level spell\n\t\tslots. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t work with 10th-level spells because the\n\t\trules for 10th-level spells (see Bloodline Paragon) specifically say that\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t cast 10th-level spells with options which allow you to cast a\n\t\tspell without spending a spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scintillating Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: There are a ton of excellent spells which qualify for this, including\n\t\tcantrips like Electric Arc. Dazzled imposes a 20% miss chance (see the\n\t\tConcealed condition), and if you get lucky and blind your target(s) you&#8217;re\n\t\tat a massive advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Terraforming Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Situational. You might be able to use this effectively in conjunction\n\t\twith polymorph spells which give you a combat form, but otherwise you&#8217;re\n\t\tjust leaving a donut of difficult terrain in some random spot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sorcerer-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Wellspring<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re relying heavily on your Focus Spells, this is essential.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Echoing Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Similar to Bloodline Conduit, but less flexible. The obvious use case for\n\t\tthis is to cast an echoing version of some combat spell like Fireball or\n\t\tsomething, but be sure that you&#8217;re using a spell which will still be\n\t\ttactically effective on the next turn or you may find that you&#8217;re chosing to\n\t\tfireball your party or let the echo go to waste. Also be cautious about\n\t\tspells which must be Sustained since they&#8217;ll eat into your Actions\n\t\tseverely.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Crossblooded Evolution<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Trade some of your own bloodline spells for the best options from other\n\t\tspell lists. Three is fully a third of your bloodline spell list, so this is\n\t\ta ton of flexibility, and you&#8217;ll want to spend some time exploring other\n\t\tspell lists to see what your options are.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sorcerer-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline Conduit<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Out of combat, you can use this to cast Heal or similar spells to heal\n\t\tyourself and your allies. This also turns your spells at 5th-level and below\n\t\tinto a bottomless well of utility. Given a few minutes and a diverse Spell\n\t\tRepertoire, there are few problems that you can&#8217;t solve at almost no cost.\n\t\tThis isn&#8217;t as flashy or exciting as a 10th-level spell slot, and it won&#8217;t be\n\t\tso effective in combat, but the ability to cast spells of up to 5th level at\n\t\tfunctionally no cost makes you incomparably powerful anywhere outside of the\n\t\tnarrow confines of combat.\n\t\t<p>In combat, a free 5th-level slot once per minute likely only matters once\n\t\t\tper encounter, but a 5th-level fireball is still a decent source of AOE\n\t\t\tdamage even at high levels.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodline Mutation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: You can get the same benefits from spells when you need them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Perfection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The coolest thing you will ever do is to cast a 10th-level spell. You get\n\t\tone slot, so this doubles how many times you can do the coolest thing your\n\t\tclass is capable of doing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Metamagic Mastery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Really tempting, but there just aren&#8217;t enough good metamagic feats to\n\t\tmake this worthwhile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Adopted Ancestry<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Numerous Ancestries offer access to innate spellcasting, which is a great\n\t\tfit for the Sorcerer.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Armor Proficiency<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The Sorcerer&#8217;s AC is awful. Each step up in armor proficiency increases\n\t\tyour AC by 2 and reduces your reliance on Dexterity. Unfortunately you&#8217;ll\n\t\tnever advance past Trained in the additional proficiencies, but the Sorcerer\n\t\tnever gets past Expert in Unarmored Defense, so if you take Armor\n\t\tProficiency twice you&#8217;re in medium armor with +2 more AC than any other\n\t\tsorcerer. Take one more feat and you&#8217;re in heavy armor with +4 AC compared\n\t\tto other sorcerers. If you spend all of your General Feats on armor, you can\n\t\tget heavy armor at level 11 (7 if you&#8217;re Human), several levels before the\n\t\tSorcerer&#8217;s proficiency in Unarmored Defense advances to Expert and makes\n\t\tlight armor unappealing.\n\t\t<p>Of course, investing feats is expensive, and using manufactured armor\n\t\t\tmeans spending gold to enhance the armor. That&#8217;s very expensive compared\n\t\t\tto casting Mage Armor, but a suit of armor that&#8217;s several levels below\n\t\t\tyour actual level may be well worth the cost compared to spending one of\n\t\t\tyour highest-level spell slots on Mage Armor.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Canny Acumen<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Sorcerers have poor saves and poor Perception. The only problem with this\n\t\tfeat is that you can&#8217;t take it more than once.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Initiative<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Casting an area control spell before anyone else acts can win a fight\n\t\tbefore it begins, so rolling well on initiative is often crucial for\n\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Toughness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Sorcerers have few hit points, so more never hurt, but you should also be\n\t\tworking really hard to avoid being targeted by things that deal damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crossbow (Any)<\/span>: Crossbows are expensive,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not very good with them, and it takes ate least one Action to load so\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t fire them every round while casting spells in most cases.
