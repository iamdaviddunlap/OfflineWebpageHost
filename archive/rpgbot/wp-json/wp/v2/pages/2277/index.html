Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"familiars\">Familiars in the Party<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Because Familiars determine their abilities based on their master&#8217;s hit points, BAB, and skills, familiars can fill many roles in the party as well as or sometimes better than their master.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"basic-familiars\">Basic Familiars<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Common among Sorcerers and Wizards who make no effort to capitalize on their Familiars, a basic Familiar is still an excellent tool. They can serve as a delivery mechanism for touch spells, and because of their small size and good Dexterity they are often excellent at Hide and Move Silently, allowing them to move into position to attack before the party kicks in the door. They can also act as couriers for Exploding Runes and Sepia Snake Sigil, or for delivering messages non-magically to nearby recipients.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"apprentice-familiars\">Apprentice Familiars<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If your GM allows it, your Familiar may be able to use magic items, especially if you have Use Magic Device. This can make your familiar extremely useful if you hand them wands of Lesser Vigor, or scrolls\/wands offensive spells which don&#8217;t allow saving throws, like Grease. Remember that Spell Trigger items like wands and Command Word items both require that the user be able to speak.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skilled-familiars\">Skilled Familiars<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Especially useful if they have opposable digits, familiars can serve as Scouts nearly as well a Rogue. They lack Trapfinding, and can&#8217;t get the ability from their master, so be wary of traps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact mechanics of other skills are somewhat suspect. A wizard&#8217;s familiar gets the same modifier to Knowledge skills, but I don&#8217;t think any reasonable DM would allow a familiar to make a Knowledge check. Similarly, if your familiar can speak you might be able to use your familiar as the party&#8217;s Face if your Dm allows it. You might also let your familiar make spot\/listen\/search checks by itself, but the ability to provide the Alertness feat seems to be intended to reflect your familiar aiding you.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"combat-familiars\">Combat Familiars<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The biggest reason to pick up Improved Familiar (or any of the other special familiar feats) is because you want to turn your familiar into a fighting animal. There is a fantastically long list of wonderful options (see &#8220;Expanded Familiar Options&#8221;, below), many of which can be very capable combatants. Because familiars use their master&#8217;s BAB and calculate their HP based on their masters, combat familiars generally work best for combat classes like Duskblade and Hexblade.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonded Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Allows you or your familiar to save each other&#8217;s life. Hopefully you never need it.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>: The lantern archon and musteval guardinal are absolutely fantastic options as both support and light damage output, which makes them fantastic for conventional casters, but not useful for combat casters.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Good for casters who like to deliver touch spells through their familiar, but not helpful for combat familiars.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dragon Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Dr<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s important to note that Dragon Familiar uses a different familiar ability progression. This delays the lowest-level familiar abilities a bit, but because dragons can already speak you skip the speech abilities, and pick up Spell Resistance and Scry on Familiar a few levels late. Despite these issues, Dragons are a great choice of familiar; they can fly, they can speak, they&#8217;re intelligent, they have opposable digits, and they have breath weapons. Because their breath weapon damage will be terrible as wyrmlings, you want a dragon with a save or suck breath weapon. Familiars are treated as using their master&#8217;s character level for effects related to hit dice, including ability progression like the DCs of breath weapons. This makes breath weapons with status effects (especially save or suck effects) extremely potent, as they can keep pace with their master&#8217;s highest DC spells and can be used every 1d4+1 rounds. Because only metallic dragons get status effect breath weapons, chromatic dragons are worthless.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Obtain Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Opens up familiars for arcane caster who don&#8217;t usually get them like Duskblades.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stitched Flesh Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM<\/a><\/sup>: Turns your familiar into an undead creature. Very situational, and based on the wording it probably doesn&#8217;t work with feats which grant additional familiar options.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lurking Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: I have never heard of an enemy standing next to a spellcaster and choosing to attack their familiar instead. Why would you? If it ever becomes a problem, send your familiar to hide in a corner or something.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell-Linked Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Imbue Familiar with Spell Ability is strictly better, and allows your familiar to use your full caster level. You could combine the two, but that seems like a lot of investment for a minor aspect of your build.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Augment Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CW<\/a><\/sup>: The bonuses are fantastic, but because the spell&#8217;s duration is Concentration it prohibits you from doing anything interesting while you run the spell. As cool as your familiar may be, you are still the character, and a spellcaster should have much cooler options than whatever their familiar can do.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhance Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Absolutely essential for combat familiars. Hours\/level duration so you can run it all day.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Familiar Pocket:<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Amusing, but almost never matters. Go buy a bag of holding and put your familiar in it.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Familiar Refuge<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Interesting as a swift action. You might be able to come up with some very handy uses for this, but don&#8217;t expect it to be a go-to option.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fortify Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Great for combat familiars, but not quite as essential as Enhance Familiar. Hours\/level duration so you can run it all day on top of Enhance Familiar, but remember that the temporary hit points only last for an hour.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Imbue Familiar with Spell Ability<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Turn your Familiar into a tiny Wizard! Give it buff spells to enhance your allies while you&#8217;re doing something more important, or give it attack spells for extra damage output. Low-level spells with no save like the lesser elemental orb spells are good options because they do decent damage, and with a Familiar&#8217;s size and typically high dexterity they may be better at touch attacks than you are. At high levels this is a fantastic way to improve your action economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"items\">Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Collar of Healing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Heal your familiar for 50 once per. It doesn&#8217;t list an action to activate, which means that it takes a Standard Action, and wasting a Standard Action on healing in combat is generally not a good idea. 50 hit points looks tempting, even out of combat, but for the 5000 gp price you can buy 6 wands of Lesser Vigor, and still have a pile of gold left over.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Familiar&#8217;s Belt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Unless you really like delivering touch attacks with your familiar, this is worthless.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rod of Spell Channeling<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: An interesting option, but rarely worth the cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3

The only potential benefit is that it might be able to carry a Tiny rider.\n<h5 id=\"arctic-fox\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Arctic Fox<\/span><\/h5>\nThe arctic fox has nothing interesting except Scent, which plenty of better options also get.\n<h5 id=\"bat\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/bat.htm\">Bat<\/a><\/h5>\nWith flight, low-light vision, and blindsense the Bat is a portable sensor. The +3 bonus to listen is helpful, but few arcane spellcasters get Spot or Listen as class skills, so the bonus will fall off after low levels. Once your familiar gains the ability to speak to you at level 5, it can spot nearby invisible enemies and point them out for you and your allies to attack.\n<h5 id=\"cat\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/cat.htm\">Cat<\/a><\/h5>\nHilariously effective at killing 1st-level Commoners and other weak humanoids, the cat is a good generic familiar. Cats get racial bonuses to Hide and Move Silently, making them excellent Scouts if their master doesn&#8217;t invest in stealth. Unfortunately the +3 bonus to Move Silently will be wasted on most spellcasters, but Arcane Tricksters and other Rogue\/Caster hybrids may enjoy having a cat. Cats also have Scent, which allows them to detect nearby creatures, though you won&#8217;t be able to locate them.\n<h5 id=\"dire-rat\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/direRat.htm\">Dire Rat<\/a><\/h5>\nOnly accessible to Huge or larger masters, the Dire Rat doesn&#8217;t do anything that the Rat can&#8217;t do better.

No stats are provided for hedgehogs. I don&#8217;t even know what you could convert into a hedgehog. A weaker version of the horned lizard&#8217;s spikes attached to a diminutive rat might be a good start.\n<h5 id=\"horned-lizard\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Horned Lizard<\/span><\/h5>\nThe horned lizard can spray blood from its eyes, and deals a puny amount of damage if attacked with natural weapons. The horned lizard also gets a burrow speed, but a spellcaster can get a lot more from other options.\n<h5 id=\"huitzil\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Huitzil<\/span><\/h5>\nThe Huitzil flies, and appears to have opposable digits. It gets a racial bonus to Sleight of Hand and Search checks, which make it a good fit for Rogue\/Caster hybrids. The Distract ability is also amusing, but certainly dangerous to use.\n<h5 id=\"leopard\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/leopard.htm\">Leopard<\/a><\/h5>\nOnly available to Huge or larger masters, the Leopard is a bigger and scarier version of the Cat. With Improved Grab and Rake, the Leopard is a perfectly viable Striker, especially if the master has decent BAB and hit points.\n<h5 id=\"lizard\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/lizard.htm\">Lizard<\/a><\/h5>\nThe Lizard is all about climbing, and climbing is dumb when flight is so easy.\n<h5 id=\"monitor-lizard\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/lizardMonitor.htm\">Monitor Lizard<\/a><\/h5>\nOnly available to Huge or larger masters, the monitor lizard is a bite attack with a swim speed. There are better combat options, and swimming isn&#8217;t very useful.\n<h5 id=\"mouse\"><span class=\"black\">Mouse<\/span><\/h5>\nNo stats are provided for mice, so I&#8217;m not sure what to do with this. As a DM, I would just make a Diminutive version of the Rat.\n<h5 id=\"octopus\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/octopus.htm\">Octopus<\/a><\/h5>\nAn octopus is a scary predator to its prey, but when most things are medium (and therefore bigger than the octopus), its Improved Grab ability is worthless.\n<h5 id=\"owl\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/owl.htm\">Owl<\/a><\/h5>\nBasically a stealthy version of the Hawk, and the Owl&#8217;s Spot bonus applies in dim light conditions, like those common to dungeons.\n<h5 id=\"penguin\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Penguin<\/span><\/h5>\nThe penguin has a good swim speed, and can hold its breath for a very long time, but for aquatic campaigns you want something that can live in the water, and for land campaigns you want something that has a decent move speed.\n<h5 id=\"rat\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/rat.htm\">Rat<\/a><\/h5>\nLess lethal but more versatile than the cat, the rat has both climb and swim speeds, allowing it to function in many situations. It has Scent, which allows it to detect the presence of nearby creatures, and it has respectable stealth skills without relying on its master. The provided +2 bonus to Fortitude is nice for full casters who typically have poor Fortitude saves.\n<h5 id=\"raven\"><a href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/raven.htm\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rav<\/span><span class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"#raven\">en<\/span><\/a><\/h5>\nThe raven (and other birds which are basically pallet-swaps of the raven) can fly and speak a language. While this may be enough for some people, your familiar rarely has anything useful to say to anyone but you, and you can talk to your familiar at level 5. If your DM will allow your familiar to use wands, the raven is likely the only basic familiar which can do so since they can speak.\n<h5 id=\"screech-owl\"><span class=\"black\">Screech Owl<\/span><\/h5>\nOnly available to Tiny or smaller masters. No stats are provided for screech owls. As a DM, I would likely use a Diminutive owl.\n<h5 id=\"sea-snake\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sea Snake<\/span><\/h5>\nNearly identical to the snake, but with a higher poison DC, and a better swim speed than its land speed.\n<h5 id=\"snake\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/snake.htm#viperSnake\">Snake<\/a><\/h5>\nThe snake&#8217;s big appeal is its poison. At 1d6 constitution damage, viper poison can be dangerous at any level. However, with a DC of only 10 you will have a lot of trouble getting enemies to fail their saving throws. You may be able to harvest poison from your familiar if someone in the party can use it.\n<h5 id=\"thrush\"><span class=\"\">Thrush<\/span><\/h5>\nOnly available to Tiny or smaller masters, no stats are provided for the Thrush. As a DM, I would probably make a diminutive version of the Raven.\n<h5 id=\"toad\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/toad.htm\">Toad<\/a><\/h5>\nDismally slow, no useful abilities, and 3 hit points is garbage. It can&#8217;t even swim. Somehow the toad gets a +21 to Hide, but the ability to sit still and not be noticed is not enough to redeem the toad.\n<h5 id=\"viper-snake-medium\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/snake.htm#viperSnake\">Viper Snake, Medium<\/a><\/h5>\nBasically the same as the Snake, but bigger and with a very slightly higher poison DC.\n<h5 id=\"weasel\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/weasel.htm\">Weasel<\/a><\/h5>\nA climb speed and scent are the weasel&#8217;s biggest advantages, but the Rat has those plus a swim speed, and Reflex saves aren&#8217;t as important as Fortitude saves. The Attach special ability is amusing, but in practice it won&#8217;t do anything useful.\n<h5 id=\"wolverine\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/wolverine.htm\">Wolverine<\/a><\/h5>\nOnly available to Huge or larger masters. The Wolverine is basically a bigger, scarier badger with Rage. The Leopard will be a better combat option for what few casters can select between the two, but there&#8217;s something to be said for having a pet barbarian.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"expanded-options\">Expanded Familiar Options<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Additional familiar options are available with feats like Improved Familiar<sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Various<\/a><\/sup> and Celestial Familiar<sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Familiar<\/th>\n<th>Alignment<\/th>\n<th>Level<\/th>\n<th uib-tooltip=\"Prerequisites for selection in addition to caster level\" uib-tooltip-placement=\"top\" tooltip-append-to-body=\"true\"> Reqs.<\/th>\n<th>Feat<\/th>\n<th>Source<\/th>\n<th>Special<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"no-wrap\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"#air-elemental\">Air Elemental, Small<\/a><\/th>\n<td>Any<\/td>\n<td>5th<\/td>\n<td>Air Subtype<\/td>\n<td>Improved<\/td>\n<td>DMG<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"no-wrap\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"#air-elemental\">Air Elemental, Small<\/a><\/th>\n<td>N<\/td>\n<td>5th<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Planar<\/td>\n<td>PH<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"no-wrap\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"#anarchic-animal\">Anarchic Animal<\/a><\/th>\n<td>Any C<\/td>\n<td>3rd<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td>Planar<\/td>\n<td>PH<\/td>\n<td>Apply the template to any animal from the standard familiar list.

It lacks strong offensive options, but if you just need a reliable way to flank it&#8217;s absolutely fantastic.\n<h5 id=\"blue-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#blueDragon\">Blue Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nAll it can do is damage, and even then it can&#8217;t do a lot of it.\n<h5 id=\"brass-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#brassDragon\">Brass Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nRoughly equivalent to the Silver dragon. Sleep and Paralysis are largely the same, though it is easier to be awoken than to be cured of paralysis.\n<h5 id=\"bronze-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#bronzeDragon\">Bronze Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nThe Bronze dragon&#8217;s breath weapon causes enemies to flee, but somehow isn&#8217;t a fear effect. Causing enemies to flee removes them from a fight just as well as paralyzing them, but while they&#8217;re running it can be hard to kill them.\n<h5 id=\"celestial-animal\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/celestialCreature.htm\"><\/a><\/h5>\nThe aligned creature templates are decent templates, but none of the base familiar options are viable in combat, so the templates are largely wasted.\n<h5 id=\"copper-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/celestialCreature.htm\"><\/a><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#copperDragon\">Copper Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nCopper dragons have a Slow breath weapon, but Slow can&#8217;t really match the effectiveness of the Silver dragon&#8217;s paralyzing breath, but it&#8217;s a decent debuff and far fewer things are immune to it.\n<h5 id=\"coure-eladrin\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Coure Eladrin<\/span><\/h5>\nThe coure eladrin matches the Lantern Archon&#8217;s magic circle against evil, and has many of the same spell-like abilities as the musteval guardinal, but can only cast magic missile 3\/day before running out of offensive options.\n<h5 id=\"earth-elemental\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/elemental.htm#earthElemental\">Earth Elemental<\/a><\/h5>\nAt small size the earth elemental is basically a pushy child with Earth Glide. It will do nothing useful in or out of combat.\n<h5 id=\"fiendish-animal\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/fiendishCreature.htm\">Fiendish Animal<\/a><\/h5>\nThe aligned creature templates are decent templates, but none of the base familiar options are viable in combat, so the templates are largely wasted.\n<h5 id=\"fire-elemental\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/elemental.htm#fireElemental\">Fire Elemental, Small<\/a><\/h5>\nThe fire elemental&#8217;s only redeeming quality is Burn, and at small size it&#8217;s not going to be likely to hit anything. Go cast Summon Monster instead.\n<h5 id=\"formian\"><a class=\"black\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/formian.htm\">Formian<\/a><\/h5>\nThe DMG doesn&#8217;t specify which type of formian you get, but I would assume a worker. If that is the case, the formian worker is worthless. Formian workers are only useful in groups, and even then they&#8217;re hardly interesting.\n<h5 id=\"gauntlet-guardian\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Gauntlet Guardian<\/span><\/h5>\nThe gauntlet guardian is reasonably durable with DR 5\/- and fast healing 1, but its attack are pitiful, leaving it to fall into the classic tank dilemma: if no one can hurt you, and you can&#8217;t hurt them, why should they try to hurt you?\n<h5 id=\"gold-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#goldDragon\">Gold Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nIf you&#8217;re looking for a breath weapon, the silver dragon is strictly better. The gold dragon&#8217;s redeeming quality is that it is medium size, and has an absurd fly speed of 200. While its poor maneuverability makes it difficult to ride into the close confines of combat, 200 feet is still pretty incredible, and at medium size a gold dragon wyrmling can serve as a mount for a small master.\n<h5 id=\"green-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#greenDragon\">Green Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nThe only interesting thing that the green dragon has to offer is its acid breath, which deals a pitiful 2d6 damage. It may be able to use magic items, especially if you have Use Magic Device, but so can every other dragon familiar.\n<h5 id=\"hell-hound\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/hellHound.htm\">Hell Hound<\/a><\/h5>\nVery cool, but all it does it damage, and two levels later you can get a Winter Wolf, which does more damage, has Trip, and is a size category larger.\n<h5 id=\"hippogriff\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/hippogriff.htm\">Hippogriff<\/a><\/h5>\nAt large size, the hippogriff can serve as a mount for medium creatures, and with an impressive 100 foot fly speed it&#8217;s faster than using Fly. The hippogriff&#8217;s attacks aren&#8217;t spectacular, but it has darkvision, low-light vision, and scent, so it can function in a lot of situations and detect the presence of nearby enemies. This is a great option for spellcasters who want to remain at a distance, but may not have easy access to flight, as well as for combat spellcasters like duskblades who want something that can fight and help them get around. Remember that casting a spell while riding a mount requires a Concentration check, so be sure to boost your Concentration bonus.\n<h5 id=\"homunculus\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/homunculus.htm\">Homunculus<\/a><\/h5>\nHomunculi are specifically designed to be messengers and scouts, and that is just what they&#8217;re good for. They have a sleep poison which you might be able to use, but the DC is low so it won&#8217;t remain useful past low levels. If you&#8217;ve spent a feat on Improved Familiar you can find much better options.\n<h5 id=\"howler\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/howler.htm\">Howler<\/a><\/h5>\nAt large size, the Howler can serve as a mount for medium creatures. Its bite is formidable, and the Howler&#8217;s Quills ability can really help to bring down tough enemies if they fail a few reflex saves. The Howl ability won&#8217;t help much in combat, but if you can trap enemies somewhere you can send your howler off to howl a bunch and drive them insane until they fall comatose.\n<h5 id=\"imp\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/devil.htm#imp\">Imp<\/a><\/h5>\nThe demon equivalent of the quasit, the imp is the superior of the two. They have a dexterity damage poison which you may be able to harvest, but they&#8217;re not much use in combat. However, they get to use Detect Good, Detect Magic, and Invisibility (self only) at will. Invisibility makes them an excellent Scout, and and with DR and fast healing they&#8217;re durable enough to survive being thrown into a few traps. Imp can use alternate form to turn into a few things, but they&#8217;re mostly only useful as disguises. Imps have opposable digits (they have human-like hands), and can probably use magic items if you have Use Magic Device. The thing that set sets them above quasits is the ability to cast Commune once per week and ask their deity 6 questions. Commune has an experience cost, but spell-like abilities ignore material components and experience costs, you can use your Imp familiar to query the DM at no cost.\n<h5 id=\"krenshar\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/krenshar.htm\">Krenshar<\/a><\/h5>\nThe krenshar&#8217;s attacks are mediocre, and its Scare ability will stop being effective very quickly.\n<h5 id=\"lantern-archon\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/archon.htm#lanternArchon\">Lantern Archon<\/a><\/h5>\nAll archons have an Aura of Menace ability, and despite the low DC the lantern archon can inflict some nasty penalties to enemies. It also has an ongoing Circle of Protection Against Evil, providing you and your party with nice bonuses to saves and AC against evil creatures, and protecting you from evil summoned creatures. As an archon in can teleport itself and 50 pounds of gear, making it a fantastic courier and messenger, and it has a permanent Tongues effect, allowing it to serve as a flying translator. Despite their names, Lantern Archons don&#8217;t appear to provide light, but they can shoot lasers to deal 1d6 damage as a touch attack, making them a reliable (if not very intimidating) source of damage in combat.\n<h5 id=\"mephit\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/mephit.htm\">Mephit<\/a><\/h5>\nMephits come in many forms, each with slightly different abilities. Even mephit has a breath weapon and some spell-like abilities, and fast healing which works under specific circumstances. Mephits can fly and have Darkvision, which can make them useful scouts, but they&#8217;re not stealthy at all. Unfortunately the DCs of their abilities are terrible and won&#8217;t scale as you level, so your mephit will quickly stop being useful.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Air<\/span>: Breath weapon only does damage (and only 1d8), and their best spell-like ability is Gust of Wind.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dust<\/span>: The breath weapon debuff is decent, but the DC is terrible. Wind Wall is very situational.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth<\/span>: Useless breath weapon, and Soften Earth and Stone is useless. Earth mephits can increase their size to medium once per hour, but I&#8217;m not certain why they would do so.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fire<\/span>: All it can do is damage, and even then not very much.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ice<\/span>: The breath weapon applies a nice debuff, but dust mephits have better spell-like abilities.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magma<\/span>: The breath weapon applies a nice debuff, but the special abilities are garbage.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ooze<\/span>: The breath weapon applies a nice debuff, and the spell-like abilities aren&#8217;t totally worthless.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Salt<\/span>: The breath weapon applies a nice debuff, and glitterdust is a great way to handle invisible enemies. The ability to suck moisture out of the air is interesting, but the damage is pitiful.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Steam<\/span>: The breath weapon applies a nice debuff, but the spell-like abilities are useless.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Water<\/span>: The same spell-like abilities as the ooze mephit, but with a worse breath weapon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5 id=\"monstrous-centipede\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/monstrousCentipede.htm\">Monstrous Centipede<\/a><\/h5>\nWorse than the mosntrous spider with identical poison and no web.\n<h5 id=\"monstrous-scorpion\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/monstrousScorpion.htm\">Monstrous Scorpion<\/a><\/h5>\nLess versatile than the Monstrous Spider, but its poison deals constitution damage. Monstrous scorpions get constrict and improved grab, but at small size they can&#8217;t grapple very well.\n<h5 id=\"monstrous-spider\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/monstrousSpider.htm\">Monstrous Spider, Small<\/a><\/h5>\nAt small size, the monstrous spider&#8217;s web only affects medium creatures, and its poison DC is terrible for a tiny bit of Strength damage. If you want to entangle enemies, go get a net. If you want to poison things, get a snake.\n<h5 id=\"musteval-guardinal\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Musteval Guardinal<\/span><\/h5>\nThe Musteval is a personal favorite of mine. They&#8217;re a cat-sized humanoid rodent angel of some sort, and they can do a whole lot of great things. They have a whole bunch of skills, including respectable Hide and Move Silently bonuses, they have a burrow speed, they have celestial energy resistances and immunities, they have permanent Tongues effect (pet translator!), and their Focused Movement ability is basically Fly-By attack on the ground. They have humanoid hands, so they can hold hold and use magic items if you have UMD. On top of all of that, they get spell-like abilities! They get invisibility once per day for scouting, and they get several others including Magic Missile at caster level 3. That means that your Musteval can be awesome outside of combat, then spend fights sitting in a corners slinging 2d4+2 damage every round effectively forever.\n<h5 id=\"pseudodragon\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/pseudodragon.htm\">Pseudodragon<\/a><\/h5>\nWith blindsense and telepathy, pseudodragons a great way to detect and handle invisible creatures. They are good flyers, and have an impressive +20 to hide. Pseudodragons also have a sleep poison, and putting enemies to sleep essentially kills them. The DC is low, and pseudodragons aren&#8217;t useful in combat, so see if you can harvest the poison and hand it to someone in the party.\n<h5 id=\"quasit\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/demon.htm#quasit\">Quasit<\/a><\/h5>\nThe demon equivalent of the imp, quasits are tiny demons mostly dedicated to annoying people. They have a dexterity damage poison which you may be able to harvest, but they&#8217;re not much use in combat. However, they get to use Detect Good, Detect Magic, and Invisibility (self only) at will. Invisibility makes them an excellent Scout, and and with DR and fast healing they&#8217;re durable enough to survive being thrown into a few traps. Quasits can use alternate form to turn into a few things, but they&#8217;re mostly only useful as disguises. Quasits have opposable digits (they have human-like hands), and can probably use magic items if you have Use Magic Device.\n<h5 id=\"red-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#redDragon\">Red Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nRed dragons are the most powerful of chromatic dragons, but they&#8217;re not useful as familiars. They have a breath weapon which deals 2d10 fire damage, but by the time that they are available as familiars there are many better options.\n<h5 id=\"shocker-lizard\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/shockerLizard.htm\">Shocker Lizard<\/a><\/h5>\nShocker Lizards are only scary in groups.\n<h5 id=\"silver-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#silverDragon\">Silver Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nSilver Dragons are among the most powerful true dragons. They have impressive mental stats, and they have a paralyzing breath weapon. Their breath weapon paralyzes enemies for 1d6+1 rounds, easily long enough for someone to walk over and make a coup de grace. Dragon familiars can likely also use magic items, so hand your familiar a wand of something cool to use between breath weapons. Silver Dragons also get Alternate Form, and can turn themselves into a medium animal or a humanoid.\n<h5 id=\"spark-guardian\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spark Guardian<\/span><\/h5>\nThe spark guardian costs 2000gp to make (plus the 500 for the lab), It can fly, but not particularly well, It can shoot sparks as a touch attack, but 2d6 damage isn&#8217;t great. It has DR 5\/-, fast healing 1, and it&#8217;s a construct, so it&#8217;s extremely durable. You have the option of spending additional gold to craft a Spark Guardian with more hit dice, but guardian familiars still use their master&#8217;s BAB and half of their master&#8217;s HP if they are higher than the familiars, so there is no reason to do so. Also remember that guardian familiars are mindless, which limits the familiar&#8217;s capabilities considerably. If you want to replace your familiar with a mindless turret, you can do worse than the Spark Guardian. If you want useful tactical and utility options, look elsewhere.\n<h5 id=\"stirge\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/stirge.htm\">Stirge<\/a><\/h5>\nThe stirge attacks as a melee touch attack, so it can charge into melee and hit some of the toughest enemies without issue. It drains blood fast enough that it only needs to remain attached for 2 rounds on average, at which point you&#8217;ve dealt 4 points of constitution damage. The stirge&#8217;s only problem is that once it&#8217;s done feeding it&#8217;s useless until it finishes digesting. The monster manual entry doesn&#8217;t mention how long it takes the stirge to digest, but it&#8217;s probably a few hours at least, if not a full day. Beyond Blood Drain, the stirge is a mediocre flyer with Darkvision and Low-Light Vision, which can make it a decent scout in dark caves and dungeons, but a Bat will be more effective.\n<h5 id=\"viper-medium\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/snake.htm#viperSnake\">Viper, Medium<\/a><\/h5>\nThis is mediocre as an option even without spending a feat on it.\n<h5 id=\"vargouille\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/vargouille.htm\">Vargouille<\/a><\/h5>\nDarkvision and flight are fine, but the Varguille&#8217;s big draw is Shriek. Vargouille familiars don&#8217;t get the Kiss ability, which means that they&#8217;re essentially Shriek on wings. Unfortunately, the DC is only 12 so it&#8217;s going to be very hard to find enemies who are likely to fail the check. Your best bet is to have your Varguille Shriek at your party every morning (WAKE UP) to make them immune for 24 hours, then have it Shriek again at the beginning of every fight and hope that you enemies roll a 1.\n<h5 id=\"water-elemental\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/elemental.htm#waterElemental\">Water Elemental, Small<\/a><\/h5>\nThe water elemental is only useful for its Vortex ability, which is only usable underwater and is dependent on the elemental&#8217;s size.\n<h5 id=\"white-dragon\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/dragonTrue.htm#whiteDragon\">White Dragon<\/a><\/h5>\nWhite Dragons are easily the weakest of true dragons, and they&#8217;re not better as familiars. With 6 intelligence and 6 charisma they&#8217;re nothing special to talk to, and their breath weapon does 1d6 cold damage. Basically the only thing that they&#8217;re good for is flying, and possibly for using magic items.\n<h5 id=\"winter-wolf\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/winterWolf.htm\">Winter Wolf<\/a><\/h5>\nThe winter wolf is large, making it a potential mount for medium riders. It has a breath weapon, though the damage is poor, and its bit attacks deal cold damage. The most important part of the winter wolf is that is has Trip. At Large size and with 18 Strength, it can be an excellent tripper, and a great combat familiar for melee characters.\n<h5 id=\"worg\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20srd.org\/srd\/monsters\/worg.htm\">Worg<\/a><\/h5>\nThe worg is basically an intelligent wolf. At medium size it can serve as a mount for small creatures (at least according to The Hobbit), and with Trip the worg can be a an excellent combat familiar for other melee characters. As you advance in level, you will want to trade in your Worg for a Winter Wolf.\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DnD 3.5 character optimization for
