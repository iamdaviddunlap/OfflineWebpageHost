The effects don&#8217;t scale with spell level, but if you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t care about the spell&#8217;s damage this remains an effective way to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlock down single foes for your whole career.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Rations are\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcheap.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: An excellent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsingle-target damage option, and all of the damage scales with spell\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlevel rather than just the initial damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Fantastic if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re creative enough to find a use for it, but generally not a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgo-to option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dao<\/span>: With one exception, everything on\n\t\t\t\tthe Dao&#8217;s spell list is excellent, and every spell is new to the\n\t\t\t\tWarlock&#8217;s spell list.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Potentially\n\t\t\t\t\t\tforcing enemies to give up an attack is great. Sanctuary has a Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAction casting time, so you can attack or cast a cantrip in the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\tturn, then follow it with Sanctuary. However, since Sanctuary allows\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe attacker to retarget their attack, Sanctuary isn&#8217;t as effective\n\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst ranged attacks, and if you try to hurt your enemies while\n\t\t\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s running the spell ends early. So you may want to use this to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprotect yourself while you cast buffs or utility spells, if you have\n\t\t\t\t\t\tan ally who&#8217;s unable to attack for some reason, or if you already\n\t\t\t\t\t\thave an ongoing non-damaging spell running like Hold Person.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: 2d4 damage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<em>every 5 feet<\/em>, and it&#8217;s every time the creature &#8220;travels&#8221;,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot every time the creature moves. So if you push or pull the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreature, they take damage.

Give yourself\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcover, separate enemies, or make yourself a nice home out of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstone.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Djinni<\/span>: Several good options, but the\n\t\t\t\tDjinni&#8217;s spell options range wildly in effectiveness.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Decent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshort-range AOE damage, especially if you&#8217;re being swarmed or\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgrappled and can&#8217;t teleport. This isn&#8217;t a go-to offensive option\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince the AOE is small and the damage isn&#8217;t great, but it can\n\t\t\t\t\t\toccasionally solve problems for you.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Useful for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpushing enemies into ongoing AOE damage effects, but since it\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequires Concentration it&#8217;s hard to combine with things like Hunger\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof Hadar so any ongoing AOE damage effects would likely need to come\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom an ally.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Very\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Invisibility in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5e is <em>really<\/em> good, and running around for a full minute\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing almost impossible to target is a huge advantage. Sure, you\n\t\t\t\t\t\talready get Shadow of Moil at this level, but Greater Invisibility\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevents you from being targeted rather than just making you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to attack.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Very situational,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbut with an 8-hour duration you can cast it early in the day and\n\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately take a Short Rest and recover your spell slot. Still, it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmight not be worth learning permanently.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Efreeti<\/span>: The Efreeti is a blaster,\n\t\t\t\tsharing many spells with the Fiend. The biggest things that blasters\n\t\t\t\tneed are good AOE damage spells and lots of spell slots to fuel them.\n\t\t\t\tWarlocks don&#8217;t have the spell slots to back this up. This is definitely\n\t\t\t\tthe simplest option for the Genie, but that doesn&#8217;t make it good.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Burning Hands\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis a decent AOE, especially at low levels, and since warlocks get\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarmor and more hp than other arcane spellcasters like the wizard you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan survive being close enough to melee to use it. However, I\n\t\t\t\t\t\twouldn&#8217;t use it beyond very low levels. You&#8217;ll get more total damage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tout of Hex or other spell options despite Burning Hands&#8217;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tscaling.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Like Eldritch\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlast but with a worse damage type. It works great with Hex since\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou get an additional ray per spell level (up to 6 when you get\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5th-level spells), but that&#8217;s the only thing that makes it better\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthan Eldritch Blast once you add Agonizing Blast.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Fireball\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremains the best instantaneous AOE damage spell at every spell level\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuntil around spell level 8, and while the Warlock can&#8217;t cast\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFireball past 5th level, it still remains a perfect go-to AOE blast\n\t\t\t\t\t\toption. However, remember that you will often get better results out\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof spells with ongoing effects like Hunger of Hadar, and with so few\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspell slots you need to squeeze as much out of them as you can.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: You&#8217;re almost\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcertainly not built to be in melee enough that using this makes\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsense. Cast Armor of Agathys.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Flame Strike is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFireball, but a smaller AOE and worse damage. Sure, some of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamage is radiant, but if damage resistance if a problem you should\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe using Eldritch Blast since nearly nothing resist Eldritch\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlast.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Marid<\/span>: Almost nothing worth having.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: An excellent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tway to cover your escape, but you can&#8217;t see through the fog any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter than anyone else, so don&#8217;t expect to fight in this without\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome other advantage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: A great\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefensive option, but with a short duration and it requires\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConcentration. Still, it&#8217;ll help until you can get Shadow of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMoil.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: This is not good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenough for a 3rd-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Too\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Cone of Cold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis decent but unremarkable AOE damage, but if you need area damage\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll have better results with Hunger of Hadar.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">All<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th-level Spells<\/span>: The best spell\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin the game. You get one Mystic Arcanum which can cast a 9th-level\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspell, and honestly Wish is so good that there is very little\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmechanical reason to select anything except Wish.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>For more help with Wish, see our\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/wish\">Practical Guide to Wish<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Genie&#8217;s Vessel<\/span>: Bottled Respite is mostly\n\t\tfor flavor, but Genie&#8217;s Wrath is a compelling reason to keep your vessel in\n\t\thand when you&#8217;re in a fight, and to work to prevent its destruction even\n\t\tthough you can get a replacement for free.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bottled Respite<\/span>: Use this to\n\t\t\t\teavesdrop on people, to evade harmful effects, and to hide or store\n\t\t\t\titems, but the fact that you can only enter the vessel once per long\n\t\t\t\trest means that you can&#8217;t just pop in and out at random. Eventually\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll be able to stay inside long enough that you and your whole party\n\t\t\t\tcan rest inside the vessel, conveniently removing the need for things\n\t\t\t\tlike tents, keeping watch while resting, or spells like Rope Trick or\n\t\t\t\tLeomund&#8217;s Tiny Hut, but even at low levels you can still stay in the\n\t\t\t\tvessel long enough to take a Short Rest without risk of enemies\n\t\t\t\twandering by and surprising you.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Genie&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: A small, but meaningful\n\t\t\t\tand scaling bonus to your damage. It only applies once per turn, but\n\t\t\t\tthat&#8217;s really all that you need. This applies to attack rolls of any\n\t\t\t\tkind, and once again the warlock is the only class to add their\n\t\t\t\tProficiency Bonus to damage (the Hexblade does it too).\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dao<\/span>: Things with resistance to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbludgeoning damage typically resist bludgeoning, piercing, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tslashing damage from non-magical attacks. You will likely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeliver this with either a cantrip or a magic weapon (Pact of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlade), so nearly nothing in the game will resist it. You\ncan combine this with the Crusher feat for extra benefits.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Djinni<\/span>: Resistance to thunder\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamage is very rare.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Efreeti<\/span>: Fire damage is among\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe most common resistances\/immunities, so you&#8217;ll often find that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour bonus damage is ineffective.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Marid<\/span>: Cold damage isn&#8217;t quite as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommonly-resisted as fire damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Gift<\/span>: Flight for 10 minutes at a\n\t\ttime which you can activate as a Bonus Action without Concentration. This\n\t\twould be good once per Short Rest, but you can use this 3 to 6 times per day\n\t\tdepending on your Proficiency Bonus. Oh, you get some damage resistance too.\n\t\tBut honestly, the flight is so good that I forgot about the damage\n\t\tresistance.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dao<\/span>: Bludgeoning damage is one of the\n\t\t\t\tthree types of weapon damage, but most monsters which deal damage\n\t\t\t\tthrough weapons rely primarily on teeth and claws so bludgeoning is the\n\t\t\t\tleast common of the three weapon damage types. Of course, it&#8217;s also\n\t\t\t\tdifficult to get permanent resistance to weapon damage types, so the\n\t\t\t\trarity of this resistance adds to the value.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Djinni<\/span>: Thunder damage is\n\t\t\t\tuncommon.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Efreeti<\/span>: Fire damage is one of the\n\t\t\t\tmost common types of non-weapon damage, so permanent resistance is\n\t\t\t\tgreat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mardi<\/span>: Cold damage isn&#8217;t quite as\n\t\t\t\tcommon as fire damage, but it&#8217;s still very common.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Sanctuary Vessel<\/span>: The ability to hide\n\t\tyour party in something as small as a ring while taking a short rest means\n\t\tthat you can rest even in extremely dangerous places so long as you can hide\n\t\tyour vessel somewhere. The added healing benefits are minor, but they still\n\t\tfeel nice even when taking a 10-minute short rest in an extradimensional\n\t\tspace isn&#8217;t an impactful benefit at the moment.\n<p>Consider having one person who doesn&#8217;t need a Short Rest carry the vessel while the\nrest of your party has a ten-minute power nap.
