Size doesn&#8217;t matter since Rogue races don&#8217;t use heavy weapons.

Access to whips and heavy crossbows are both useful options, so if you&#8217;re considering races like the Dwarf and the Elf, consider trading them. Similarly, rogues do a lot with skills, so despite already getting 4 from their class more skill proficiencies are always welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because most rogues are equally good at both melee and ranged combat, flight is an excellent option for rogues. The ability to dart in and out of reach with Cunning Action creates a very effective synergy, allowing melee rogues to remain out of reach between turns by moving a few feet up into the air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Innate spellcasting is very tempting because it offers access to things like Invisibility, but since only the Arcane Trickster can re-cast the spells it&#8217;s not always a great choice.

However, you do still need to learn the\n\t\tspells normally and with the cap on spells known beyond your school\n\t\tlimitations that can be difficult.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Storm<\/span>: The ability increases\n\t\twork for the Rogue, but the other benefits are too situational and there is\n\t\tvery little on the spell list which arcane tricksters can justify\n\t\tlearning.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"races-dragonmarked-half-orc\">Dragonmarked Half-Orc<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW<\/a><\/sup><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Dragonmark traits replace ALL of your racial traits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-custom\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Customized Origin<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Finding<\/span>: The bonuses to\n\t\tPerception and Survival are nice, and thematically this can make the Rogue\n\t\tfeel a bit more like the Ranger. But before you go for the Scout, remember\n\t\tthat you don&#8217;t get to use any of the spells except Hunter&#8217;s Mark unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re an Arcane Trickster, and Hunter&#8217;s Mark is basically useless for the\n\t\tRogue.

Unless you&#8217;re an arcane trickster, the Variant Aasimar is a more\n\t\teffective package. Even if you are an arcane trickster, you still need to\n\t\tspend your limited non-restricted spells known to benefit, and with your\n\t\ttiny pool of spell slots that&#8217;s likely not worth the effort.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Hospitality<\/span>: Very few of the traits\n\t\tare consistently useful. The innate spellcasting includes some neat\n\t\tutilities, but they&#8217;ll make little mechanical impact. The spell list is\n\t\tdifficult to justify for the Arcane Trickster.

Rogues tend to stay alive when\n\t\tthings go poorly for the rest of the party, so having access to Healing Word\n\t\tis a benefit which is difficult to ignore. However, you do still need to\n\t\tlearn the spells normally and with the cap on spells known beyond your\n\t\tschool limitations that can be difficult.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Hospitality<\/span>: The ability score\n\t\tincreases work fine, but the spells aren&#8217;t especially useful for a class\n\t\twith access to so little spellcasting, and since you get to learn so few\n\t\tspells beyond enchantment\/illusion it&#8217;s difficult to justify learning the\n\t\tspells offered by Mark of Hospitality.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"races-dragonmarked-human\">Dragonmarked Human<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW<\/a><\/sup><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Dragonmark traits replace ALL of your normal racial traits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-custom\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Customized Origin<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Mark of Finding<\/span>: See Mark of Finding\n\t\t\tunder Dragonmarked Half-Orc, above.

Sure, you get The Bigger They Are, but that&#8217;s\n\t\textremely situational and it&#8217;s nowhere near enough to make this\n\t\tworthwhile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Making<\/span>: Magic Weapon is neat, but\n\t\tnothing else here is particularly appealing, and most of the spells are\n\t\talready on the Wizard&#8217;s spell list so the Arcane Trickster doesn&#8217;t get any\n\t\tnew options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: Misty Step once per\n\t\tLong Rest and arcane tricksters can learn Pass Without Trace.

The ability score increases work fine, and the spells are\n\t\tneat, but you&#8217;ll need to somehow have high scores in Dexterity,\n\t\tIntelligence, and Wisdom to support the spellcasting, and unless animals are\n\t\tweirdly common in your campaign you&#8217;ll get the spells so late that you&#8217;ll\n\t\talmost certainly never encounter anything worth targeting tiwth the\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mark of Making<\/span>: The ability increases\n\t\twork for the Arcane Trickster, but the spellcasting does surpisingly little\n\t\tto help you. Magic Weapon doesn&#8217;t affect Shadow Blade, and the spells are\n\t\tall on the Wizard&#8217;s spell list already so you don&#8217;t get any new options. The\n\t\tability scores are basically all that you get.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: Perfect ability score\n\t\tincreases, and the spellcasting adds some useful options for the Arcane\n\t\tTrickster including Pass Without Trace.

While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait. Despite selecting a base race, you do not count as a member of your race for the purposes of any other effect, such as qualifying for feats or using magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-custom-lineage\" class=\"rating-blue\">Custom Lineage<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>+2 increase, Darkvision, and a feat.
