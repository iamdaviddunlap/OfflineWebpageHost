It adds a little bit of Blaster and Controller to the Cleric&#8217;s existing roles, but it&#8217;s not so different from your standard cleric that it significantly changes your tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Blood Domain falls short is its reliance on damage spells without providing any meaningful damage spells. Bloodletting Focus applies to exactly 5 spells on the Cleric&#8217;s spell list, and Blood Domain only adds one more. The capstone feature, Vascular Corruption Aura, is a scary-sounding damage aura, but the damage is so small that there&#8217;s basically no reason to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The highest point of the class is Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet, which is like a downgraded version of Dominate Monster. Since it&#8217;s Channel Divinity, it works on each short rest, so you can have this available constantly and drop it on the biggest thing in every fight. This is likely the most impactful part of the subclass; while your puppet is running around causing trouble, you&#8217;re free to resort to spamming Guiding Bolt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Tal&#8217;Dorei Blood Domain Cleric Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#taldorei-blood-domain-cleric-ability-scores\">Tal&#8217;Dorei Blood Domain Cleric Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#taldorei-blood-domain-cleric-races\">Tal&#8217;Dorei Blood Domain Cleric Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#taldorei-blood-domain-cleric-feats\">Tal&#8217;Dorei Blood Domain Cleric Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#taldorei-blood-domain-cleric-weapons\">Tal&#8217;Dorei Blood Domain Cleric Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#taldorei-blood-domain-cleric-armor\">Tal&#8217;Dorei Blood Domain Cleric Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-blood-cleric-build-sunday-bloody-sunday\">Example Blood Cleric Build &#8211; Sunday, Bloody Sunday<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Sleep is a stunningly powerful way\n\t\t\t\tto end an encounter at low levels, but the scaling isn&#8217;t great.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd Level<\/span>: Hold Person is great when\n\t\t\t\tit works, but humanoids are a tiny fraction of the enemies you&#8217;ll face\n\t\t\t\tin a typical game. Of every spell in the game, Ray of Enfeeblement is\n\t\t\t\tone of them, and that is the nicest thing I have to say about it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Haste is a great buff for\n\t\t\t\thigh-damage martial allies, and Slow is a great debuff for big single\n\t\t\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">7th Level<\/span>: Blight is bad. Stoneskin\n\t\t\t\tis a good defense, but can get expensive quickly and requires\n\t\t\t\tConcentration, so you don&#8217;t want to use it constantly.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">9th Level<\/span>: The spells are great,\nbut you already have Blood Puppet, which does largely the same thing and doesn&#8217;t eat a high-level spell\nslot.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: For the most part,\n\t\tmartial weapons aren&#8217;t a massive improvement for you. You never get Extra\n\t\tAttack, and Divine Strike is weak in the best of cases, so there&#8217;s little\n\t\treason to use a weapon. Grab a whip so that you can make Opportunity\n\t\tAttacks.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodletting Focus<\/span>: A good\n\t\tamount of damage. It only affects with instantaneous durations, so no\n\t\tSpiritual Weapon or Spirit Guardians, but Guiding Bolt, Inflict Wounds,\n\t\tHarm, Flame Strike, and Sunburst work. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s literally\nthe entire list of cleric spells to which this applies. Blood Domain adds Blight, but\nit&#8217;s barely worth mentioning.\n<p>This also doesn&#8217;t specify &#8220;cleric spells&#8221;, so it&#8217;s ripe more multiclass shenanigans.\nOne level of blood cleric tacked onto any blaster is an immediate and massive improvement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond<\/span>:\n\t\tExtremely cool, but hard to use frequently.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet<\/span>: This is\n\t\tbasically a limited version of Dominate Monster. Even with the limitations,\n\t\tit&#8217;s stunningly effective.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Sanguine Recall<\/span>: The daily limitation\n\t\tmeans that this is effectively one extra spell slot per day of your highest\n\t\tspell level up to 6th level. It&#8217;s good, but it&#8217;s not going to do anything\n\t\tcrazy that you couldn&#8217;t already do. You can easily offset the hp cost with a\n\t\tspell or a few hit dice.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Strike<\/span>:\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\">Divine Strike is bad<\/a>. Take the Optional Class Feature if you can.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vascular Corruption Aura<\/span>: Double the\n\t\tradius of Spirit Guardians, no save, no concentration, but at this level 3d6\n\t\tdamage is negligible unless you&#8217;re facing a swarm of smaller enemies, and\n\t\teven then it&#8217;s still less damage than a 3rd-level Spirit Guardians (3d8). You\n\t\tcould run both effects, but they both require an Action to start, and, given\n\t\tthe choice, upcasting Spirit Guardians even slightly will deal more damage\n\t\tunless you <em>really<\/em> need the bigger area. This just isn&#8217;t good enough\n\t\tfor such a high-level feature that you can only use once per day. I&#8217;d be\n\t\thappy with double the damage because then you could reasonably say &#8220;yes,\n\t\tthis is objectively better than Spirit Guardians in the majority of cases&#8221;.\n\t\t<p>There is some fun optimization to be done around how you can trigger the\n\t\t\tdamage repeatedly. The damage applies whenever a creature &#8220;moves within 30\n\t\t\tfeet of you for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there&#8221;.\n\t\t\tGenerally language like this is intended so that the creature takes damage\n\t\t\twhen they approach you so that they&#8217;re not motivated to run in and out of\n\t\t\tthe aura, but it also means that we can re-trigger the damage by forcing\n\t\t\tmovement on other turns.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The trick is that it happens when the creature moves, not when it enters\n\t\t\tthe area (which is how Spirit Guardians works), so we can&#8217;t do things like\n\t\t\twalking the aura onto them or pulling them in with the Telekinetic feat.\n\t\t\tSpells like Infestation and Dissonant Whispers will do the trick, but\n\t\t\tremember that all you get is the extra 3d6 damage, which may not be enough\n\t\t\tto justify the effort.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"taldorei-blood-domain-cleric-ability-scores\">Tal&#8217;Dorei Blood Domain Cleric Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from other medium armor clerics.

We&#8217;ll assume that our 1d6 rolls a 3 and our 2d6 rolls a 7 so that we don&#8217;t need to worry about rounding or anything.<br><br>GB base: 10.9<br>GB w\/attack boon: 13.45<br>GB w\/damage boon: 15.45<br>GB w\/both: 19.05<br>IW base: 12.53<br>IW w\/attack boon: 15.45<br>IW w\/damage boon: 17.08<br>IW w\/both: 21.05<br><br>As we can see, the damage bonus yields higher DPR. Of course, that math changes if we upcast, and there are other considerations like Guiding Bolt&#8217;s secondary effect, but it&#8217;s still helpful to see math to make informed choices.<br><br>We can also consider physical save-or-suck spells, but clerics have few at this level. It&#8217;s basically just Blindness\/Deafness.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Destroy Undead (CR 1\/2)<br>New Spells Prepared<br>&#8211; Aura of Vitality (Optional)<br>&#8211; Haste (Domain)<br>&#8211; Slow (Domain)<\/td><td>Aura of Vitality is an optional spell, which means that it&#8217;s only on the Cleric&#8217;s spell list if your DM allows it. If they do, Vital Sacrifice is suddenly a near-bottomless pool of boons. Use Vital Sacrifice to grind your hp down to single digits and get as many boons as you can, then cast Aura of Vitality to run your hp right back up to maximum.<br><br>Vital Sacrifice really does need a limit on how many boons you can have, but that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s in the book, so here we go. If your DM sees this and says &#8220;you don&#8217;t get Aura of Vitality&#8221;, Prayer of Healing will suffice.<br><br>From here on out, I&#8217;m going to blindly assume that you have more boons than you can use in a single fight, but also you&#8217;ll have no 3rd-level spell slots because they&#8217;ve been spent on Aura of Vitality. Instead, spend boons to boost both your attack and damage with Guiding Bolt and you&#8217;re doing plenty of damage without considering that you&#8217;re probably giving an ally Advantage on their next attack roll.<br><br>If you&#8217;re ready to use save-or-suck spells, use Blindness\/Deafness. You can spend a boon every time your target(s) save.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (2\/rest)<br>Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet<br>Sanguine Recall<br><\/td><td>Time to commit body horror!<br><br>We add a second Channel Divinity charge to our sanguine pool and Blood Puppet at the same time. It\u2019s pretty common to have only two fights between rests, so Blood Puppet is almost always ready to go.<br><br>Against enemies with poor mental stats, use Blood Puppet and they&#8217;re no longer a problem. If there are no other enemies in the encounter, have them attack themselves and walk into something dangerous. Against enemies with high mental stats, use Blindness\/Deafness and debuff their save with Vital Sacrifice&#8217;s boons.<br><br>Blood Puppet notably allows you to target a corpse, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to care how that corpse got there. Find the biggest meatbag enemy you can find, haul its body around in a wagon, and turn it into a roving combat pet. You&#8217;ll need to repair the body, which is conveniently an object rather than a creature, which is why we took Mending at level 4. You may also want to cast Gentle Repose to keep it from taking on an unpleasant smell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Spells Prepared<br>&#8211; Blight (Domain)<br>&#8211; Any<br>&#8211; Stoneskin (Domain)<\/td><td>No damage spells or physical save spells on the cleric list at this level, but we do get Blight, so let&#8217;s look at Blight compared to our other spell options.<br><br>Blight is a Con save, so we can use Vital Sacrifice\u2019s boons to penalize our target\u2019s saves and turn this into a true hemoplague. That\u2019s likely enough of a penalty that we can consider a Constitution save as safe as other saves. Thanks to Bloodletting Focus, we get 8d8+6 damage (avg. 42). I don\u2019t think we\u2019re intended to use Vital Sacrifice\u2019s boons to boost the damage of non-attack spells, but it\u2019s not perfectly clear<br><br>If we instead upcast Guiding Bolt (which is a good comparison because it works at range, while Inflict Wounds does not) with a boon on the attack and damage, we&#8217;ll deal 7d6+2d6+6 damage for an average of 37.5. That&#8217;s nearly as much damage as Blight, it&#8217;s more likely to succeed (though admittedly doesn&#8217;t deal half on a miss), and also grants someone Advantage.<br><br>Stick to Guiding Bolt. Blight&#8217;s damage will scale a tiny bit better with upcasting, but not enough to really make it matter.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: Wis (16 -&gt; 18)<br>Divine Strike<\/td><td>If optional class features are an option, take Blessed Strikes.<br><br>We&#8217;re still a little bit behind the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math<\/a>, but the boons from Vital Sacrifice easily make up the difference.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>New Spells Prepared<br>&#8211; Dominate Person (Stoneskin)<br>&#8211; Flame Strike<br>&#8211; Hold Monster (Stoneskin)<\/td><td>Dominate Person and Hold Monster feel pretty silly alongside Blood Puppet.<br><br>Somehow, Flame Strike is our first AOE spell which can apply Bloodletting Focus. At 8d6 damage, it&#8217;s no better than a 3rd-level Fireball unless damage types matter. Adding +6 damage helps a lot, bringing our average damage to just 1 behind a 5th-level Fireball, which is a negligible difference.<br><br>Expect Flame Strike to be a staple option from here onward. Even against single targets, it&#8217;s only slightly behind Guiding Bolt when boosts with a Vital Sacrifice boon, so against multiple targets it&#8217;s great damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Divine Intervention<br>New Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Nothing exciting here.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Destroy Undead (CR 2)<br>New Spells Prepared<br>&#8211; Harm<\/td><td>Harm is a lot like Blight: a big pile of necrotic damage on a Con save. Like Blight, we can use Vital Sacrifice&#8217;s boon to penalize our target&#8217;s save. But since they&#8217;re both just a single-target damage on a Con save, they fill the same niche.<br><br>So which is better?<br><br>Blight upcast to 6th level with Bloodletting Focus will deal an average of 53 damage. Harm will deal an average of 57. So the gap is pretty minor.  Harm has double the range, which might be enough to justify preparing it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>ASI: Wis (18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>Finally back on the Fundamental Math.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td><p>Nothing at this level except 7th-level spells.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Destroy Undead (CR 3)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>New Spells Prepared<br>&#8211; Sunburst<\/td><td>The power of the sun\u2026 in the palm of my hand.
