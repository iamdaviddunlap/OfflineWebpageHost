Understanding Wild Shape primarily\n\tdepends on understanding and selecting forms; which forms work, which forms\n\twork in specific situations, and which forms just never work. But you can also\n\tdo quite a bit to maximize the benefits of Wild Shape between feats, spells,\n\tand magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Moon is the primary user of Wild Shape, as it&#8217;s their go-to\n\tcombat tactic and frequently their go-to answer for most challenges. With a\n\tbetter CR progression than other Druids, Wild Shape remains a powerful combat\n\toption for your whole career. However, many Wild Shape forms have problematic\n\tlimitations which might not be immediately obvious, and it&#8217;s easy to pick a\n\tbunch of underwhelming forms and not know any better until you&#8217;re rolling\n\tdeath saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Other Druids can still get a lot of our Wild Shape even if they don&#8217;t use it\n\tin combat. Additional mobility options, additional senses, and potentially\n\tadditional skills can all make Wild Shape a powerful utility. You might get\n\taway with using it in combat at levels 2 and 3, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

You can also leave the form early as a Bonus\n\t\tAction.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This describes the ways that your current Wild Shape can end. By default, when Wild Shape ends, you return to your true form. However, &#8220;until you use Wild Shape again&#8221; means that you can use it again while already in Wild Shape. You could stay in your current form and only gain a fresh batch of Temporary Hit Points, or you could change forms as though you were using Wild Shape from your true form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong><em>Number of Uses.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;You can use Wild Shape twice.

The 2014 DMG expects 2 Short Rests in a full adventuring day. At level 2\n\tyou can expect to use Wild Shape at most 4 times per day, so it&#8217;s important to\n\tfit as much adventuring as possible into the limited duration. This time\n\tpressure reduces significantly as you gain levels and the duration\n\tincreases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong><em>Known Forms.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast\n\t\tstat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1\/4 and that lack a Fly\n\t\tSpeed.

This lets us benefit from multiclassing and from our feats while in Wild Shape. However, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re intended to apply ability score increases from feats simply because it would make the system too complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You notably don&#8217;t retain anything from your species. You might look at your\n\tspecies&#8217; feats and skill proficiencies and worry, but the text says that you\n\tkeep your feats, and the next line specifies that you keep your skill and save\n\tproficiencies. You just don&#8217;t get things like Darkvision or damage\n\tresistances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your\n\t\tProficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the\n\t\tcreature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast&#8217;s stat block is\n\t\thigher than yours, use the one in the stat block.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a bit of a pain because you need to reference both stat blocks\n\tfor both your skills and your saves. Using the beast&#8217;s skills can be\n\tespecially useful because many beasts have Expertise in Perception. Of course,\n\tthe relatively low CR of your beast forms compared to your level may still put\n\tyour own Perception modifier above that of your beast forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Determining your actual modifier can be somewhat confusing, and requires\n\trecalculating modifiers nearly every time a proficiency is involved. For\n\tphysical ability scores:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If your beast form&#8217;s save\/skill modifier is already higher than yours, use\n\t\tthe beast&#8217;s modifier<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you are proficient in the save\/skill, use your PB and the beast&#8217;s\n\t\tability modifier<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the beast is proficient in the save\/skill (even if it has Expertise),\n\t\tuse your PB and the beast&#8217;s ability modifier. This will require\n\t\trecalculating the modifiers listed in the beast&#8217;s stat block<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Else, use the beast&#8217;s ability modifier as normal<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mental ability scores are even more complicated since you retain your own mental ability scores. For mental ability scores:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If your beast form&#8217;s save\/skill modifier is already higher than yours, use\n\t\tthe beast&#8217;s modifier<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you are proficient in the save\/skill, use your PB and your ability\n\t\tmodifier<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the beast is proficient in the save\/skill (even if it has Expertise),\n\t\tuse your PB and your ability modifier<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Else, use your own ability modifier as normal<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many beasts are proficiency in Perception or in Stealth, but almost never in any other skills. If you pick forms with these proficiencies, you may do well without taking proficiency in Perception or Stealth. Even so, Perception is still a really good proficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saving throw proficiencies are uncommon and unpredictable, so you can&#8217;t count on beast forms to provide them. The ones that do exist are almost exclusively physical saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong><em>No Spellcasting.<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;You can&#8217;t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn&#8217;t break your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/free-rules\/rules-glossary#Concentration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Concentration<\/a>&nbsp;or otherwise interfere with a spell you&#8217;ve already cast.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t cast spells in Wild Shape, but you can still cast things like Cal\n\tLightning, then Wild Shape as a Bonus Action, and fly around as an Owl or\n\twhatever you like while raining bolts on your enemies for the next several\n\tminutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Moon Druids have a special exception: they can cast spells from their subclass spell list while in Wild Shape.

Your equipment doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tchange size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new\n\t\tform can&#8217;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form.\n\t\tEquipment that merges with the form has no effect while you&#8217;re in that\n\t\tform.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that your armor will fit your new form, so your armor, weapons,\n\tand any gear that you&#8217;re carrying but not wearing should be merged into your\n\tform into most cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where this gets complicated is magic items.

If your forms are all amphibians and fish, traveling in the mountains will be hard. If all of your forms are native to jungles, it may be difficult to disguise yourself by turning into an animal. Sometimes the needs of your campaign will override the general considerations of character optimization. Read the assessments below, and weight that information within the context of your game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re transitioning from the 2014 rules, remember that the stats for\n\tevery Beast in the Monster Manual has changed.

Rats are\n\t\talso an ubiquitous presence in the lives of humans, so you may be able to\n\t\tmove about in civilized areas with minimal scrutiny and without drawing as\n\t\tmuch attention as you might in other animal forms, which might be worth the\n\t\treduced speed compared to the cat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Raven<\/span>\n\t\t<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MM<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: 50-foot fly speed, proficiency in Perception, and Mimicry.

It also\n\t\tmeans that non-aquatic forms with swim speeds (ex: polar bear) suddenly work\n\t\twhen fully underwater.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items-for-wild-shape\">Magic Items for Wild Shape<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Because your magic items don&#8217;t reshape to suit your new form, it&#8217;s not always\n\tobvious if a magic item will continue to function in Wild Shape. Items built\n\tfor humanoids should work fine on beasts like Apes and Monkeys, but may not\n\twork on other beasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to work with your DM to figure out what items will or won&#8217;t fit\n\tyour new form since they don&#8217;t resize. Amulets and necklaces work on many\n\tanimals unless their neck is especially thick (elephants, for example). Hats\n\tprobably work on most creatures of appropriate size, though helmets are much\n\tharder since they&#8217;re typically designed to wrap around a humanoid&#8217;s head.\n\tGloves and rings are likely out for anything except primates. Bracers might\n\twork on quadrupeds, but discuss it with your DM. Cloaks may work on a wide\n\tvariety of creatures, and I love the idea of a Mammoth wearing a tiny Cloak of\n\tProtection.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items-that-change-your-stats\">Magic items That Change Your Stats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Items which improve your stats are objectively fantastic, but it presents the horrifying need to recalculate the attacks, damage, and other stats for every one of your Wild Shape forms. For example: Gauntlets of Ogre Power would give you better Strength than most Beast forms, potentially requiring you recalculate your attack and damage bonuses when you use Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me how these items work with Wild Shape. The &#8220;specific\n\tbeats general&#8221; guidance is unhelpful here. DMs could easily use anatomy as an\n\texcuse to avoid Gauntlets of Ogre Power and Belts of Giant Strength, but Ioun\n\tStones care very little about anatomy except that they probably require a\n\thead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you DM does allow your magic items to later your Beast forms&#8217; stats, be\n\tsure to calculate those modified stats ahead of time in order to avoid doing\n\tit mid-combat.
