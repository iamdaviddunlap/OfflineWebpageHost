Oh, and firearms. Don&#8217;t forget those.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill ranks, but the\n\tGunslinger&#8217;s skill list contains very few options that work for the\n\tGunslinger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gunsmith<\/span>: Gunsmithing allows you to\n\tmaintain you weapon, craft new ones, and craft your own ammunition. Getting a\n\tfree gun at first level saves you a whole pile of money, and being able to\n\tupgrade it for 300 gp saves you the cost of buying or crafting a new one when\n\tyou&#8217;re ready to upgrade to masterwork.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Grit<\/span> (Ex): Grit fuels the Gunglinger&#8217;s\n\tdeeds, but it&#8217;s a very limited pool. You can restore grit with critical hits\n\t(very difficult) or with killing blows (much less difficult), but you still\n\twant to use Grit sparingly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deeds<\/span>: Gunslinger deeds offer numerous\n\ttactical options for the gunslinger. See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/gunslinger\/deeds\">Gunslinger Deeds Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor more help with Gunslinger Deeds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Nimble<\/span> (Ex): A nice dodge bonus to AC will\n\thelp make up for limiting the Gunslinger to medium armor, and is particularly\n\tuseful against other firearms. You can supplement this by fighting\n\tdefensively, by using Combat Expertise, and with the Halfling&#8217;s favored class\n\tbonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: The Gunslinger gets half as\n\tmany as the Fighter, but this is till a great source of additional feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gun Training<\/span> (Ex): This is a huge boost in\n\tdamage output.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Grit<\/span> (Ex): Many deeds cost a point of\n\tgrit to do something awesome, and being able to perform those deeds for free\n\tevery round can make the Gunslinger considerably more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity defines the Gunslinger, but a bit of Wisdom is important for the Gunslinger&#8217;s Grit pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump to 7.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity is everything for the\n\tGunslinger.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: More hitpoints are always welcome, but\n\tthe Gunslinger already gets d10 hit points and good Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: The gunslinger&#8217;s skill list is pretty\n\tbad and they already get 4+ skill ranks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Crucial for the Grit pool and the\n\tGunslinger&#8217;s poor Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump to 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 18<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 11<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 18<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 11<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 17<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 10<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity bonuses are crucial, and small size is very beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Despite lacking a bonus to\n\tDexterity, the Dwarf has some great defensive abilities, and the Dwarf favored\n\tclass bonus cuts down on pesky misfires.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: The bonus to Dexterity is great, but\n\tthe elf is much better as a spellcaster.

The Half-Elf favored class\n\tbonus grants extra Grit points to fuel the Guslinger&#8217;s abilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Similar to the Half-Elf, but the\n\tHalf-Elf&#8217;s favored class bonus is miles better than anything the Half-Orc has\n\tto offer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: A Dexterity bonus and small size\n\tmake the Halfling very accurate and effective.

A masterwork buckler is 165gp, has no armor check\n\t\tpenalty, and doesn&#8217;t prevent you from using your off hand. Your off hand is\n\t\tgoing to be empty anyway (unless your using two pistols, in which case the\n\t\t-1 to attacks is almost certainly worth the AC bonus), and you need all the\n\t\tAC you can get.
