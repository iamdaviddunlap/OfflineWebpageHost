The only part of the Hunter which requires you to take additional actions is Superior Hunter&#8217;s Defense. This makes the Hunter very accessible and easy to play. Unfortunately, most of the Hunter&#8217;s features provide very minor benefits and the rest won&#8217;t be consistently useful, so the subclass&#8217;s decision points only present the illusion of choice for the vast majority of builds. The Hunter&#8217;s best options are often at their strongest in melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the subclass adds so little to the Ranger in the way of new capabilities, it doesn&#8217;t change the Ranger&#8217;s role in the party. This is very much the Ranger-est Ranger that ever did range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the 2024 Hunter Ranger.

Of course, you probably can&#8217;t do anything with that information since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going to be dealing Piercing damage almost exclusively.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>None of this specifies &#8220;damage&#8221;, so RAW it appears that you also know if\n\t\t\tthe target has any condition immunities. Unfortunately,\n\t\t\tAdvantage\/Disadvantage on saves against a condition aren&#8217;t considered\n\t\t\tResistance\/Vulnerability in 5e.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Hunter&#8217;s Prey<\/strong>: You can change your choice on a Short or\n\t\tLong Rest, but realistically there is no reason to do so.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Colossus Slayer<\/span>: Enemies will spend\n\t\t\t\tvery little time in combat at full health, and then they&#8217;ll be probaly below\n\t\t\t\tfull health for the rest of their lives, so this damage is easy and\n\t\t\t\tconsistent. It&#8217;s not a ton of damage, but it&#8217;s very reliable and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\trequire any real effort.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Because this works once per turn, it also works on Opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\tAttacks. This is very helpful for melee builds, making you a bit\n\t\t\t\t\tscarier to move past even for enemies that aren&#8217;t the target of\n\t\t\t\t\tHunter&#8217;s Mark.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Horde Breaker<\/span>: This is basically the\n\t\t\t\tsame as the Cleave Weapon Mastery, except that you can&#8217;t have already\n\t\t\t\tattacked the secondary target. Since you&#8217;re stuck focusing on the target\n\t\t\t\tof Hunter&#8217;s Mark and can&#8217;t easily switch targets, you&#8217;re going to have a\n\t\t\t\tlot of trouble consistently attacking enemies that are within 5 feet of\n\t\t\t\teach other. Opportunities to use Horde Breaker will be vanishingly rare.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>The timing of Horde Breaker alongside the Cleave mastery is slightly\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplex, but doesn&#8217;t create issues. Horde Breaker applies when you\n\t\t\t\t\tmake the attack, while Cleave doesn&#8217;t apply until after you hit. This\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans that you can hit the same secondary target with both Horde\n\t\t\t\t\tBreaker and Cleave after making a single attack against your primary\n\t\t\t\t\ttarget, but none of that actually matters because Cleave only exists\n\t\t\t\t\ton Strength-based weapons and Strength-based Rangers don&#8217;t work.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><strong>Defensive Tactics<\/strong>: You can change your choice on a Short\n\t\tor Long Rest, but you&#8217;re almost certainly going to try Escape the Horde,\n\t\trealize that it&#8217;s not making an impact unless you&#8217;re deliberately drawing\n\t\tOpportunity Attack, then switch permanently to Multiattack Defense.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Escape the Horde<\/span>: If you&#8217;re relying\n\t\t\t\ton hit-and-run tactics or if you&#8217;re built to fight at range, this is a\n\t\t\t\tgood choice. However, Multiattack Defense may still provide better\n\t\t\t\toverall protection. If enemies get into melee with you and hit you with\n\t\t\t\tMultiattack, Multiattack Defense will protect you against more attacks\n\t\t\t\tthan Escape the Horse will when you try to move away on your next\n\t\t\t\tturn.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Multiattack Defense<\/span>: Almost every\n\t\t\t\tenemy that relies on weapon attacks will have multiattack by now. This\n\t\t\t\twill provide consistent defense against those creatures. If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tfighting in melee, this is a great choice. If you&#8217;re fighting at range,\nthis will rarely be useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Superior Hunter&#8217;s Prey<\/span>: 1d6 extra damage\n\t\tper turn. This is not mathematically significant. It&#8217;s nice that it works on\n\t\tevery turn so that it also applies with Opportunity Attacks, but it&#8217;s still\n\t\tnot enough damage to make a big difference and it also requires that you\n\t\thave a valid secondary target.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Superior Hunter&#8217;s Defense<\/span>: A fantastic\n\t\tdefensive option. Many enemies can only deal one damage type per turn (a\n\t\tdragon&#8217;s breath, a spell, a weapon), and the ones that deal multiple types\n\t\tare typically doing something like hitting you with a mace that does 1d6\n\t\tbludgeoning and a mountain of fire damage or something. This is going to\n\t\tmitigate a ton of damage.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Hunter Ranger Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/#backgrounds\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"species\">Hunter Ranger Species<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/#species\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Hunter Ranger Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Hunter Ranger Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Hunter Ranger Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Hunter Ranger Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Hunter Ranger Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/ranger\/#multiclassing\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Hunter Ranger Build &#8211; Oh, Hi (Hunter&#8217;s) Mark<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Ranger is all about Hunter&#8217;s Mark, and the Hunter is all about being the Ranger-est Ranger.

Note that it only works with &#8220;attacks with ranged weapons,&#8221; not &#8220;ranged weapon attacks.&#8221; This means that it does not work with thrown daggers, unfortunately.<br><br>Fog Cloud is helpful when your party is outnumbered, outranged, or otherwise in a bad spot. No one can see, which gives you cover to reposition or to escape. If members of your party can rely on saving throws from spells or special abilities, you&#8217;ll be at a tactical advantage. It will also be very helpful when you pick up Feral Senses, but that&#8217;s not for a very long time.

Getting two of them at low levels might actually be a problem, but by level 4 you likely have more gold than you know what to do with, so it&#8217;s time to upgrade from throwing tiny knives to shooting tiny crossbow bolts.<br><br>Crossbow Expert lets you apply your ability modifier to the additional attack just like Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting, which saves us the trouble of picking up a second Fighting Style feat. We can safely use them in melee, too, so we can technically fight on the front lines. The ability to ignore Loading is also crucial once we get Extra Attack.<br><br>Keep dagger as your second weapon mastery. Crossbow Expert makes it much easier to fight with two hand crossbows, but we still need to spend your Bonus Action to do so. If we need to use our Bonus Action on a turn to do something like move Hunter&#8217;s Mark, we can use a Nick weapon like a dagger and still make the additional attack.<br><br>This involves juggling weapons quite a bit, so familiarize yourself with the rules for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/free-rules\/rules-glossary#Attack[Action]\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">equipping\/unequipping weapons<\/a>. Start your turn with a hand crossbow in hand. Declare the Attack action. Attack, then draw either your second hand crossbow or a dagger. If you use your dagger to attack, you can equip\/unequip again because the additional attack is made as part of your Attack action, so you can stow the dagger if you didn&#8217;t throw it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br>New Prepared Spells:<br>&#8211; Magic Weapon<\/td><td>Extra Attack makes juggling weapons much easier since you can equip\/unequip one weapon per attack. Oh, also you get another attack. That&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s a lot of extra damage. We&#8217;re now making 3 attacks on a typical turn. If we don&#8217;t use our Bonus Action, we get to make a much better attack with a hand crossbow as a Bonus Action. If we do, we still get to attack with a dagger to apply the Hunter&#8217;s Mark damage bonus.<br><br>We also get level 2 spells at this level, giving us access to Magic Weapon. If you don&#8217;t already have magic weapons, it&#8217;s a boring but incredibly effective boost to your damage output. You get just 2 level 2 spell slots at this level, so you&#8217;ll likely need to stretch them over a long adventuring day.

The 3d10 damage isn&#8217;t amazing, especially since we haven&#8217;t maxed Wisdom, but compare it to 3d6 damage from Hunter&#8217;s Mark. We&#8217;ll hit very reliably with attacks, but, even at half damage, Conjure Animals does almost as much damage as Hunter&#8217;s Mark. If you can hit two enemies per turn once every 3 turns, Conjure Animals easily outdamages Hunter&#8217;s Mark. Of course, it&#8217;s much more expensive, so save it for use against crowds.<br><br>Lightning Arrow is fine. It&#8217;s good for crowds of enemies that are too far away for Conjure Animals, and you can use it as a Bonus Action after attacking, so you can use it to finish off enemies that are at low hp even if you missed your attack. <br><br>We also get access to Elemental Weapon at this level, but it&#8217;s not viable. Magic Weapon won&#8217;t stack with it and doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, so we do better running Magic Weapon and Hunter&#8217;s Mark. +1 to attack and +1d4 from Elemental Weapon or +1 to attack and +1d6+1 from Magic Weapon and Hunter&#8217;s Mark. We could discuss the benefits of not being locked into one target, but we&#8217;re fine trading away our Bonus Action when necessary.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Tireless<\/td><td>You should now walk into every encounter with Temporary Hit Points.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Superior Hunter&#8217;s Prey<br>New Prepared Spells:<br>&#8211; Revivify<\/td><td>1d6 damage once per turn isn&#8217;t going to make a big difference. It also applies on Opportunity Attacks, but that&#8217;s not a huge difference, either. Imagine being just some random bystander, then you take 1d6 Force damage from Hunter&#8217;s Mark as a side effect. It&#8217;s rude.<br><br>Revivify isn&#8217;t super fun, but it&#8217;s very important.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Mage Slayer (Dex 19 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>Spellcasters become increasingly common enemies as you gain levels.

Going one-on-one with a single enemy puts you at a huge advantage because you can give yourself resistance to their biggest damage type, then any additional attacks have Disadvantage, and then you&#8217;re built to focus damage on a single target.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Fey Touched<br>&#8211; Wisdom 15 -&gt; 16<br>&#8211; Command<\/td><td>We take Fey Touched to get some extra spells and to increase our Wisdom modifier.<br><br>Increasing Wisdom improves our offensive spells.

Or do Vex weapons feel less impactful? It&#8217;s hard to say. Swap your Weapon Mastery from Hand Crossbow to something else like a heavy crossbow. You can make your first attack each round with whatever other weapon, then swap weapons and still attack with a hand crossbow to let you make the additional attack from the Light property.<br><br>Alternatively, you can stick to the hand crossbow, and lean into Swift Quiver. You&#8217;ll never have more than 2 level 5 spell slots, unfortunately, so it&#8217;s only good for one or two encounters per day. You can make 2 hand crossbow attacks as your Attack action, 2 as a Bonus Action, and you could even throw a dagger if you keep Weapon Mastery for it. But, without the damage boost from Hunter&#8217;s Mark, there&#8217;s very little point.<br><br>This raises an interesting question: Is Swift Quiver worth the spell slot for this build? Probably not. Hunter&#8217;s Mark, which is borderline free since we now get 6 free castings per day, adds +1d6 damage. We can already make 3 attacks per turn using some combination of hand crossbows and daggers. Is the 1d4+5 damage from a fourth hand crossbow attack going to outdamage +3d6 from Hunter&#8217;s Mark? No. So, unless we have some other damage boosts (such as a magic weapon), there&#8217;s very little reason for this build to use Swift Quiver.<br><br>Now if we had built around longbows, muskets, or heavy crossbows, the math would be very different. A weapon with Heavy would mean that we could bring Heavy Weapon Master into the mix, and adding +PB to your damage makes those additional attacks very powerful. We might even look at Hunter&#8217;s Prey (Horde Breaker), especially if we use a heavy crossbow for the Push Weapon Mastery so that we can force enemies into position to get the additional attack. But you would be playing a build for a very long time in hopes that it pays off starting at level 17.<br><br>This level also brings level 5 spells, of which the Ranger has very few good options. Steel Wind Strike combines very well with Nature&#8217;s Veil, giving us easy Advantage on the spell attack rolls and making it a great way to deal a bunch of burst damage without endangering our allies or waiting multiple turns for Conjure Animals to gradually wear them down.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Feral Senses<\/td><td>Feral Senses can be very powerful when paired with Fog Cloud. You have enough Blindsight that you can comfortably fight at range, while enemies need to stumble about in the fog until they find a target. This can buy your party a couple rounds to position and plan while you cause trouble, making it a great way to recover from an ambush or from an encounter that&#8217;s going badly. Just remember that your party probably can&#8217;t see in the fog, so don&#8217;t use this in every encounter unless your party is prepared for it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Epic Boon: Boon of Irresistible Offense<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211;<\/td><td>Irresistible Offense is good for builds that make a lot of attacks every turn. We&#8217;re routinely making 3 (or 4 if you pivot to Swift Quiver), and they&#8217;ll nearly always be made with Advantage. That gives you a 26% chance to roll a natural 20 every turn or 34% with Swift Quiver. You can&#8217;t expect the damage boost constantly, but +21 damage every couple turns will have an impact. If you&#8217;re not sold, Boon of Fate is also good.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Foe Slayer<\/td><td>We&#8217;re making 3 attacks per turn every turn, so we&#8217;ll definitely benefit from the damage bonus. It adds +6 to our average damage per turn if we hit with every attack (which we should). That&#8217;s fine.<br><br>But compare that to Irresistible Offense. If we assume that it works once every 4 turns, it&#8217;s a little more than +5 damage per turn on average, and it just works rather than requiring us to babysit Hunter&#8217;s Mark.
