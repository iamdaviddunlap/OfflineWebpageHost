Shared defense removes the Paladin&#8217;s ability to remove negative status effects, but provides a few immunities to your allies for a few rounds. The change to Divine Bond is perhaps the biggest part of the archetype.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Shared Defense<\/span> (Su): The bonuses are small,\n\tthe area is small, all of the effects are situational, and the duration is\n\tterrible. You give up Mercy for this, so ensure that you have a capable healer\n\tin the party to handle conditions which you could cover with Mercy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Su): Divine Bond is much\n\tbetter for weapons, but this is miles better than the Sacred Shield archety&#8217;es\n\tDivine Bond. The list of abilities is respectable, and the ability to add\n\tenergy resistance adds some nice defensive versatility to the Paladin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Chastity, Corruption, Loyalty, Savagery, Vengeance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Mercy, Divine Bond<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Hospitaler, Undead Scourge, Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"divine-hunter\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/divine-hunter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Divine Hunter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Paladins are melee characters, but the Divine Hunter takes a step back to use ranged weapons. The Divine Hunter is on par with the standard Paladin, and brings some nice feats and abilities which make archery easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Shot<\/span>: Absolutely essential for\n\tranged characters. It hurts to give up heavy armor, but with enough dexterity\n\tto be a decent archer it shouldn&#8217;t matter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shared Precision<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s not often that\n\tyou have allies who need precise shot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Su): If you are adding the\n\tReturning quality to your weapons, you should just buy a weapon with the\n\tReturning quality.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Distant Mercy<\/span> (Sp): This is a fair trade\n\tfor a Mercy, but it will take until fairly high level before the range exceeds\n\tyour move speed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Care<\/span> (Su): This greatly mitigates\n\tthe need for Improved Precise Shot, especially if you spend all of your time\n\tjust outside of reach.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hunter&#8217;s Blessing<\/span> (Su): If your allies need\n\tthese feats they should have them already. The only way to really use this is\n\tto hand everyone in your party a bow and point them at something far away.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Righteous Hunter<\/span> (Su): Essential. At this\n\tlevel almost everything will have DR, and DR\/good is common for evil\n\tcreatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: No<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Proficiency, aura of courage, divine bond, Mercy (6th level), aura of resolve, aura of justice, aura of faith<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"empyreal-knight\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/empyreal-knight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Empyreal Knight<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Empyreal Knight is a Paladin trying to become an Angel. While the concept is great, and the flavor makes sense, the archetype just isn&#8217;t very good. You give up many important Paladin abilities for some abilities that could replaced with a single spell or a few skill ranks. Overall, the archetype just doesn&#8217;t add anything worth having.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Voices of the Spheres<\/span>: One rank of\n\tlinguistics could replace this, and Divine Grace is one of the Paladin&#8217;s best\n\tabilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Celestial Heart<\/span> (Su): A nice range of\n\tresistances, and they scale with level. At higher levels you gain truespeech,\n\tcompletely invalidating Voices of the Spheres, and finally you gain the\n\tability to create a protective aura for a few rounds per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Celestial Ally<\/span> (Sp): Summon Monster is\n\tvery powerful, but you get it three levels behind Clerics and Wizards.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Su): Turn your Warhorse into a\n\tflying warhorse, which technically isn&#8217;t a Pegasus. Flight is crucial at high\n\tlevels, so it&#8217;s nice to have access to a constant source of flight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Empyreal Champion<\/span>: A collection of cool\n\tabilities, and you can fly without needing your mount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Loyalty<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Divine Grace, Lay on Hands, Mercy, Channel Positive Energy, Divine Bond, Holy Champion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Undead Scourge, Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"holy-guide\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/holy-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Holy Guide<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Holy Guide is a lousy attempt to introduce Teamwork feats and Favored Terrain to the Paladin. The Teamwork Feat ability is lousy and doesn&#8217;t improve, and Favored Terrain has always been awful and boring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Both skills are situational,\n\tand Paladins only get 2+ skills ranks, and Intelligence is their only dump\n\tstat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Favored Terrain<\/span> (Ex): I hate Favored Terrain.\n\tIt&#8217;s dull, the bonuses are mediocre, and in this case you have top give up\n\tMercies to increase the crappy bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Teamwork Feat<\/span> (Ex): A free feat is nice,\n\tbut by 5th level you won&#8217;t be able to get anything particularly exciting, and\n\tyou can only share this one feat with your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Corruption, Fiends, Savagery, Wyrm, Charity, Chastity, Loyalty, Vengeance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Mercy (3rd, 5th)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Holy Gun, Holy Tactician, Hospitaler, Sacred Servant, Sacred Shield, Shining Knight, Temple Champion, Undead Scourge, Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"holy-gun\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/holy-gun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Holy Gun<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Holy Gun merges the Gunslinger with the Paladin. You still get all of the Paladin&#8217;s excellent healing and defensive abilities, and you get the ability to use a gun and a limited number of Gunslinger deeds. The biggest issue with the archetype is the Grit pool. Until you hit level 11, you may only have one or two points to use in a day, which will mean that many of your fights will be a repetetive series of full attack actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to read my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/gunslinger\/deeds\">Gunslinger Deed Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Giving up\n\theavy armor is annoying, but if you&#8217;re using firearms you generally don&#8217;t need\n\tit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Have Gun<\/span>: Two free feats and a weapon. Don&#8217;t\n\tforget to pick your first level Gunslinger deed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Deed<\/span>: You get one deed in addition\n\tto your free deed from Amateur Gunslinger.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Smiting Shot<\/span> (Su): Considering you get 1\n\t\tGrit point per day, and can only gain a small number of points in a day,\n\t\tthis will eat through your Grit points very quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Bond<\/span>: This adds a lot of versatility\n\tto your weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Holy Grit<\/span> (Ex): Finally you get a decent\n\tsized Grit pool. The additional deeds are great too, and can give you a lot of\n\tgreat options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Slinger<\/span> (Ex): 1 Grit point for a\n\tchance to banish evil outsiders. Not quite as easy to use as regular Smite\n\tEvil, but you can use it on multiple targets in a round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Chastity, Fiends<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Weapon and Armor Proficiency, Detect Evil, Smite Evil, Divine Bond, Aura of Justice, Holy Champion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"holy-tactician\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/holy-tactician\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Holy Tactician<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Holy Tactician is a teamwork feat archetype. Like many teamwork feat archetypes, it assumes that not everyone in the party is taking teamwork feats, so it grants you the ability to share them with your party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weal&#8217;s Champion<\/span> (Su): A bit like a shared\n\tversion of Smite Evil, Weal&#8217;s Champion deals less damage, but grants your\n\tallies a bonus to hit your target and a tiny bit of extra damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tactical Acumen<\/span> (Ex): Losing Divine Bond is\n\tunfortunate, but 5 free feats is pretty great. When selecting your feats,\n\tremember that you can share them with Battlefield Presence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battlefield Presence<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s not clear if\n\tyour allies need to remain within 30 feet to continue to receive the bonus\n\tfeat, but you can grant your allies a teamwork feat any number of times per\n\tday. Grant your allies something cool before going into combat like\n\tCoordinated Charge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Guide the Battle<\/span> (Ex): Using a move action\n\tto do this is hard because it prevents you from making a full attack or\n\tcharging. However, this can get your weak characters out of melee, or it can\n\thelp your allies position themselves in a round in which you need to cast a\n\tspell or use Lay on Hands.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weal&#8217;s Wrath<\/span> (Su): This greatly improves\n\tyour ability to fight multiple foes simultaneously.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Masterful Presence<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s pretty rare\n\tthat you will want allies to have different teamwork feats since teamwork\n\tfeats typically only work if everyone has them. Confirming critical hits is\n\tgreat, assuming someone in your party relies on them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Smite Evil, Aura of Courage, Divine Health, Divine Bond, Aura of Resolve, Aura of Justice, Holy Champion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"hospitaler\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/hospitaler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hospitaler<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hospitaler gives up a bit of the Paladin&#8217;s offensive ability for the ability to channel energy without using Lay on Hands charges, adding another pool of healing to the Paladin. The capabilities lost are fairly minor, which makes this archetype a good choice if your party needs additional healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Smite Evil<\/span> (Su): Less smites per day, but\n\tthey still work the same way.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Positive Energy<\/span> (Su): Channel\n\tEnergy is not a great option at Paladin level -3, but it&#8217;s free healing that\n\tdoesn&#8217;t consume your uses of Lay on Hands.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Healing<\/span> (Su): Assuming your party\n\tis all the same level, this aura will provide less healing on average than a\n\tnormal usage of Channel Positive Energy. The big draw is the ability to make\n\tan extra save against ongoing conditions, and the ability to heal allies\n\twithout healing enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Charity, Chastity, Fiends<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Smite Evil, Channel Positive Energy, Aura of Justice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Divine Defender, Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sacred-servant\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/sacred-servant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sacred Servant<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sacred Servant reduces the Paladin&#8217;s usual reliance on weapons, and introduces some extra spell slots and the ability to enhance your Channel Energy ability through a Divine Bond with your holy symbol. If you want to make a character focused on Channel Energy, this is a great option. Otherwise, you may be better served to play a Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Smite Evil<\/span> (Su): Less smites per day, but\n\tthey still work the same way.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spells<\/span>: Some domains have good options in\n\ttheir first few spell slots, and many have abilities which a Paladin will find\n\tvery useful. Read my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/domains\">Cleric Domain Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor help choosing a domain.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Su): If you like to channel\n\tpositive energy, this is the way to do it. Use your holy symbol to boost your\n\tdamage\/healing and your DC and go nuts.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<!-- Read my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/channel_energy\">Practical Guide to Channel Energy<\/a> for help making the best use of Channel Energy. --><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Call Celestial Ally<\/span> (Sp): The Planar Ally\n\tspells are very powerful, but their biggest limitation is their cost. Removing\n\tthis cost allows you to do a lot of very cool things.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<!-- Read my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/planar_ally\">Practical Guide to Planar Ally<\/a> for help making the best use of Call Celestial Ally. --><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Corruption, Savagery, Vengeance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Smite Evil, Spells, Divine Bond, Aura of Resolve<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sacred-shield\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/sacred-shield-archetype\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sacred Shield<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If every enemy was nice enough to stand and hit you in the face with a pointy stick while you did the same, this archetype would be fantastic. Instead the Sacred Shield trades in the Paladin&#8217;s Smite Evil ability for the ability to protect himself and his allies from pointy sticks and not much else. The Sacred Shield and his allies are still wholly vulnerable to spells, special attacks, falling rocks, and traps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bastion of Good<\/span> (Su): Reducing damage to\n\tyour allies by half sounds great, but this doesn&#8217;t affect spells, special\n\tabilities, or other sources of damage. The bonus to your AC is also nice, but\n\tit certainly won&#8217;t prevent your enemies from killing your allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Shield<\/span> (Su): The bonus to AC is nice,\n\tespecially when combined with Bastion of Good, but the duration is fairly\n\tshort and this ability stull doesn&#8217;t protect you from spells or special\n\tabilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Su): Effects like this are\n\tworse on armor and shields than they are on weapons. Armor costs half as much\n\tto enhance, and to get the most mileage out of Bastion of Good and Holy\n\tShield, your shield&#8217;s enhancement bonus should be high. The list of abilities\n\tis small and not very good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Bastion<\/span>: This makes Bastion of\n\tGood considerably easier to use, and keeps pace with Holy Shield so that their\n\teffects affect the same area.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Perfect Bastion<\/span>: This makes your party very\n\tresistant to the target of your Bastion of Good, but it still doesn&#8217;t protect\n\tyour from spells or special abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Chastity, Fiends<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Smite Evil, Channel Positive Energy, Divine Bond, Aura of Justice, Holy Champion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"shining-knight\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/shining-knight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shining Knight<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shining Knight doesn&#8217;t add much, but it adds everything you need to be get by as a mounted combat Paladin. You need to take all of the feats on your own, but your mount will be very difficult to kill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skilled Rider<\/span> (Ex and Su): Removing the\n\tarmor check penalty from ride checks will really help for Mounted Combat\n\tchecks, and adding Divine Grace to your mount will make it considerably\n\ttougher to kill with magic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Su): It would be a bit silly to take\n\tanything else on a mounted combat archetype.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knight&#8217;s Charge<\/span> (Su): Taking an enemy\n\tstraight to Panicked effectively takes them out of the fight. You can continue\n\tto hit them with mounted charges as they run around futily trying to escape\n\tfrom you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Chastity, Fiends, Loyalty<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Divine Health, Divine Bond, Aura of Justice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"temple-champion\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/temple-champion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Temple Champion<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Temple Champion trades in the Paladin&#8217;s spells for access to a Warpriest Blessing. While Warpriest Blessings are certainly powerful, the Paladin&#8217;s spell list is much more versatile and effective than a single Blessing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spells<\/span>: The Paladin spell list is\n\tsurprisingly good, and includes a lot of very powerful buffs unique to\n\tPaladins. Losing access to spells is unfortunate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Granted Power<\/span>: Most Cleric domain\n\tabilities available at first level won&#8217;t help you much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessing<\/span> (Su): You only get one blessing,\n\tand you get the Minor Blessing power 4 levels late, at which point many of the\n\tblessings will have trouble remaining important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: All<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Spells, Divine Bond, Aura of Justice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Holy Guide, Hospitaler, Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"undead-scourge\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/undead-scourge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Undead Scourge<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Undead Scourge gives up a little bit of the Paladin&#8217;s general evil-smiting ability for some extra powers to destroy the undead. If your campaign features an unusually large number of undead, this is great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Smite Evil<\/span> (Su): Not quite as good, but not\n\tnotably worse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Life<\/span> (Su): Useful if you plan to\n\tChannel Energy to damage the undead around you, but other than that it&#8217;s not\n\tvery helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Undead Annihilation<\/span> (Su): Save or die for\n\tundead foes. This can be a great way one-shot the BBEG Lich.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oaths: Charity, Wyrm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Smite Evil, Aura of Resolve, Aura of Justice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Divine Defender, Empyreal Knight, Warrior of the Holy Light<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"warrior-of-the-holy-light\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/paladin\/archetypes\/paizo-paladin-archetypes\/warrior-of-the-holy-light\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warrior of the Holy Light<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having a small spell list and very few spells per day, the Paladin has a lot of very good spells which are exclusive to the Paladin. Giving up these options, especially great spells like Holy Sword, are difficult. Power of Faith is a cool ability, but it&#8217;s very hard to make it compete with a full spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power of Faith<\/span> (Su): This is what you get\n\tin exchange for your spells. Giving up spellcasting always makes me nervous\n\tbecause it&#8217;s so powerful and versatile, but if you&#8217;re okay with that, the\n\tbonuses are decent, and you can get a lot of useful effects in a single\n\tstandard action.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shining Light<\/span> (Su): Like an awesome\n\tcombination of Channel Positive Energy and Holy Word.
