As you gain levels, you&#8217;ll get the ability to create a few\n\titems for free using Quick Alchemy without spending your precious Infused\n\tReagents. You&#8217;ll also get some specific features which improve the\n\tfunctionality of your favored type of items, and it&#8217;s these features which\n\tlargely define the subclasses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because each subclass is tied to a specific type of alchemical item, the availability of those items is central to the subclass.

At their\n\tsimplest, the Bomber is a Striker. But as you accumulate feats you&#8217;ll add a\n\tbit of Blaster and Controller, so your capabilities expand as you become more\n\tproficient and comfortable with your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not a Bomber, you&#8217;re not using alchemical bombs to their full\n\tpotential. The biggest drawback to bombs is their disposable nature, which\n\tmeans that they become expensive quickly, which the Alchemist neatly solves\n\twith their Alchemy feature. That immediately means that you don&#8217;t need weapon\n\toptions beyond bombs (except for extremely long range, which can be addressed\n\tusing a Bomb Launcher from Guns and Gears), allowing you to focus nearly all\n\tof your attention on making your bombs terrifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strongly consider buying a Bomb Coagulator Alembic (see Treasure Vault). A\n\tfew bombs that deal a bunch of persistent damage will make a big difference in\n\tencounters against small numbers of powerful foes. Calculated Splash does not\n\taffect the Bomb Coagulator Alembic because the feat&#8217;s effect takes place when\n\tyou throw the bomb, but don&#8217;t let that stop you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Research Field<\/span>: You get two bombs added to\n\t\tyour Formula Book for free, and those are your &#8220;signature items&#8221;, which you\n\t\tcan make more of using your Infused Reagents. Make sure to diversify your\n\t\toptions so that you won&#8217;t be stopped by damage resistances, but also pick\n\t\tbombs that you know you&#8217;ll use every day. Be sure to upgrade these as often\n\t\tas you can. The bombs you create at the beginning of the day using Advanced\n\t\tAlchemy are often your go-to option in combat. Because these bombs can be up\n\t\tto your level, they&#8217;ll be more effective than what you&#8217;ll eventually be able\n\t\tto create with Perpetual Infusions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Field Discovery<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to use a lot\n\t\tof bombs most days, so getting extra for free is a great way to stretch your\n\t\tresources.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perpetual Infusions<\/span>: Lesser bombs are\n\t\tbasically your cantrips: easily reusable, but unimpressive damage (though\n\t\tfeats like Calculated Splash and Expanded Splash certainly improve them).\n\t\tYou only get to pick two types of bombs which you can do this with, so pick\n\t\ttwo which you can use a lot. I recommend either acid flask or alchemist&#8217;s\n\t\tfire for simple, reliable damage and something with a good debuff like skunk\n\t\tbomb.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perpetual Potency<\/span>: A significant increase\n\t\tin your damage output from bombs created for free, often doubling their\n\t\tdamage and adding a +1 item bonus to attacks. At this level you can start\n\t\tcrafting Greater bombs using Advanced Alchemy, but they&#8217;re limited by your\n\t\tnumber of Infused Reagents. If you don&#8217;t need the extra damage, your free\n\t\toption is now massively more dangerous.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Field Discovery<\/span>: Somewhat\n\t\tunderwhelming compared to other research fields, but more splash area means\n\t\tmore splash damage. And if you&#8217;re raining cheap bombs over an area with\n\t\tCalculated Splash and Expanded Splash, you&#8217;re dealing at least 5 splash\n\t\tdamage to everything in a 15-foot radius burst even if you miss. Do that\n\t\tthree times a round with permanent lesser bombs via Quick Bomber (laughably\n\t\tinexpensive at this level), and you&#8217;re doing a sizeable amount of damage at\n\t\tnearly no effort or cost, plus possibly applying effects like clouds of\n\t\tsmoke, speed penalties, persistent damage, etc.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perpetual Perfection<\/span>: Even more damage,\n\t\tbigger debuffs, and item bonuses to attack rolls. Greater bombs typically\n\t\toffer a +2 item bonus to attacks and deal roughly three times as much as\n\t\tlesser bombs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chirurgeon\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ResearchFields.aspx?ID=2\" class=\"rating-orange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chirurgeon<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>So the party asked you to play a Healer and you stubbornly refuse to play a\n\tspellcaster. Sure, you could limp along with the Medicine skill, but no amount\n\tof skill in Medicicine can match the stunning effectiveness of alchemical\n\titems&#8217; restorative capabilities. Between available items and class feats, the\n\tAlchemist can remove nearly any status condition, as well as providing\n\tbottomless healing via Perpetual Infusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the Chirurgeon struggles to do anything proactively. Healing\n\telixirs are great for healing and removing status conditions, but nothing\n\tabout the subclass supports overcoming challenges which your party will face.\n\tHealing elixirs can provide some defensive buffs, but otherwise the subclass\n\tis entirely reactive. You&#8217;ll need to resort to core class features and class\n\tfeats to make options like bombs viable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chirurgeon has seen some crucial errata. When the Core Rulebook released,\n\tI described the Chirurgeon as &#8220;a vending machine that only sold off-brand\n\ttonic water&#8221;, which still feels accurate considering that the the only thing\n\twhich the Chirurgeon did well at the time was produce antitoxins and\n\tantiplagues.

Fortunately, Perpetual\n\t\tPotency and Perpetual Perfection will have more options.\n\t\t<p>Note that if you use Perpetual Infusions to restore hit points, the\n\t\t\trecipient has a 10-minute cooldown. This is explicitly to prevent abuse\n\t\t\toutside of combat.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perpetual Potency<\/span>: Several interesting\n\t\toptions sneak in under the level 6 cap. Contagion Metabolizer is great for\n\t\tthe Chirurgeon and since it uses your stats, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you only\n\t\tever have the level 5 version. Soothing Tonic is great to hand out right\n\t\tbefore a fight starts so that your allies can start combat with some Fast\n\t\tHealing to protect them from both persistent bleed and from dropping to 0\n\t\thp.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Field Discovery<\/span>: At this level\n\t\tyou can craft a Greater Elixir of Life and heal a guaranteed 92 hit points.\n\t\tIn a pinch that&#8217;s really good, but in-combat healing should be a rare\n\t\tfallback for when things are going badly. Still, 92 hit points is much\n\t\tbetter than most in-combat healing, so it may actually be worth the Action\n\t\tcost. Of course, this has the same cost as making three elixirs, so you&#8217;re\n\t\tgiving up 50% of your potential healing on average in exchange for speed, so\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t want to do this all the time.\n\t\t<p>This does also apply to elixirs of life created with Perpetual\n\t\t\tInfusiions, but don&#8217;t forget asbout the 10-minute cooldown.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perpetual Perfection<\/span>: No new options, but\n\t\tElixir of Life and Soothing Tonic remain good choices.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mutagenist\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ResearchFields.aspx?ID=3\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mutagenist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Mutagenists are conceptually cool: Drink some stuff, and mutate yourself to\n\tadjust your capabilities. Usually this means using Bestial Mutagen to turn\n\tyourself into a melee Striker. You can get pretty durable by combining various\n\tmutagens and elixirs, but you&#8217;ll never quite be a Defender without a Reaction\n\toption like Attack of Opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re not significantly better at using mutagens than any other alchemist until you get Greater Field Discovery at 13th level so that you can combine two mutagens at once. However, you can make good use of mutagens to buff your allies, especially once you have Perpetual Infusions and can pass out low-level mutagens like candy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The available class feats which support the Mutagenist assume that you&#8217;re\n\tstuck with the combat mutagens available in the Core Rulebook: Bestial Mutagen\n\tand Juggernaut Mutagen. But over PF2&#8217;s lifetime, we&#8217;ve seen a number of\n\tadditional mutagen and elixir options which are often more effective than\n\tBestial and Juggernaut.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way mutagens are designed further hampers you: the only mutagens that are\n\tuniversally useful in combat (Bestial and Juggernaut) aren&#8217;t very good unless\n\tyou invest class feats to improve them, so you&#8217;re locked into several feats if\n\tyou just want to meet a bare minimum amount of effectiveness. And even then,\n\tyou&#8217;ll need expensive magic handwraps to apply runes to your unarmed\n\tstrikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you gain levels, it&#8217;s absolutely essential that you acquire a Collar of\n\tthe Shifting Spider. Triggering a mutagen as a Free Action when initiative is\n\trolled saves you at least one Action on the first turn of combat (possibly 2\n\tsince you need to Interact to pull the mutagen out of your pocket or to use\n\tQuick Alchemy to create one). Mutagenic Flashback helps, especially at low\n\tlevels, but it&#8217;s only once per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re working from the printed Core Rulebook, note that the Alchemist got\n\ta lot of errata to support the Mutagenist specifically because at release it\n\twas an unplayable mess. Medium armor proficiency and Mutagenic Flashback have\n\tdone a lot to help the Mutagenist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mutagenic Flashback<\/span>: An emergency option\n\t\tfor when you&#8217;re caught unawares or when you&#8217;re out of your best mutagens. It\n\t\tonly functions once per day, so if you use it, strongly consider ending the\n\t\tday and getting some rest.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Research Field<\/span>: You get two mutagens\n\t\tadded to your Formula Book for free, and those are your &#8220;signature items&#8221;,\n\t\twhich you can make more of using your Infused Reagents. Bestial Mutagen and\n\t\tJuggernaut Mutagen are good go-to options at level 1. Create a big batch of\n\t\teach during your Daily Preparations, and when those start running short,\n\t\tconsider calling it a day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Field Discovery<\/span>: You get the unique\n\t\toption of crafting any three different mutagens rather than 2 or 3 of the\n\t\tsame item like other alchemists. Be sure to bring a few different types so\n\t\tthat you&#8217;re ready for anything.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perpetual Infusions<\/span>: Pick your favorite\n\t\tgo-to mutagen, and make sure that you and your allies always have it\n\t\trunning. While this can mean having your favorite mutagen running at all\n\t\ttimes, remember that most 1st-level mutagens won&#8217;t be especially effective\n\t\tin combat, so you still need to use some Infused Reagents to make the\n\t\tmutagens that you&#8217;re going to use in a fight. Instead, plan to share these\n\t\twith your allies.\n\t\t<p>Combined with the Revivifying Mutagen feat, this means that you can\n\t\t\trepeatedly create a free mutagen, consume it, then end it to heal.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perpetual Potency<\/span>: Linear improvement to\n\t\tyour favorite mutagens, but 3rd-level mutagens on an 11th-level character\n\t\taren&#8217;t much help. Plan to use them on your allies instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Field Discovery<\/span>: Combine Bestial\n\t\tand Juggernaut and wade into melee like a horrifying mutated wrecking ball.\n\t\tThis is why you play a Mutagenist for mutagen builds rather than any other\n\t\toption. You can do this with Combine Elixirs, but it&#8217;s not quite as\n\t\teffective. Keep in mind that if you add more mutagens you&#8217;ll keep the\n\t\tbenefits of two but accumulate the drawbacks of all of them. Ending your\n\t\tmutagens intentionally with Revivifying Mutagen allows you to reset.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perpetual Perfection<\/span>: Another linear\n\t\tincrease in effectiveness, but the level cap is still far, far behind your\n\t\tactual level. Plan to use these free mutagens to buff your allies and use\n\t\tPersistent Mutagen and Greater Field Discovery to keep your two favorite\n\t\tcombat mutagens running on yourself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"toxologist\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/ResearchFields.aspx?ID=4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toxicologist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Poisons in Pathfinder 2e are extremely effective, but they&#8217;re also complicated, and like many consumable items they&#8217;re limited by cost, a fixed save DC, and the action economy around using them. The Toxicologist addresses all of those issues, making poisons a much more accessible combat option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Toxicologist Research Field allows you to apply poisons to weapons in one\n\tAction instead of the usual two, though you still need to spend one Action to\n\tdraw the poison or create it with Quick Alchemy applying it. This action cost\n\tcan be greatly mitigated by using an Injection Reservoir (see Treasure Vault)\n\tand\/or by taking Rogue Dedication archetype feats to get Poison Weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they&#8217;re few in number, don&#8217;t overlook inhaled poisons. You can scatter\n\tthem into the air in a 10-foot cube as an Action, turning that poison into a\n\tsmall AOE without relying on the Alchemist&#8217;s terrible attack proficiency\n\tprogression. Similarly, contact poisons can be applied directly to a single\n\tcreature as an Action, which requires them to immediately save against the\n\tpoison without adding a Strike to the mix, but they also typically have an\n\tonset period which makes them largely useless in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Toxicologist, your best asset is your allies. Every weapon in your party is a vehicle to deliver injury poisons, and you are at your most effective when you&#8217;re delivering as many poisons as possible as quickly as possible. To achieve that goal, you need to share your poisons with your party and trust that they&#8217;ll end up in the right place. Choosing an array of go-to poisons to apply to your party&#8217;s weapons is a great investment of real-world time, and going into every encounter with your allies&#8217; weapons poisoned will tilt many encounters in your party&#8217;s favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the benefits of poisons, be aware of its limitations. Many\n\tenemies are immune to poison (constructs, undead, etc.), so you&#8217;ll need other\n\toptions to handle those foes like bombs or conventional weapons. Poison can\n\talso be difficult to apply in combat, and if you&#8217;re using a weapon that needs\n\tto be loaded like a crossbow you may have turns where you don&#8217;t do anything\n\texcept get ready to do something on your next turn. Managing your actions will\n\tbe especially challenging in combat, so going into combat with poisons ready\n\tto go is essential. You need to have a big impact early in combat in case you\n\tfind yourself struggling as combat drags on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Research Field<\/span>: Increasing the save DC of\n\t\tpoisons makes low-level poisons viable at much higher level, opening up a\n\t\tmuch broader array of poison options than just whatever is the highest level\n\t\tavailable to you (though that is often still your best choice). Reducing the\n\t\tAction cost from 2 to 1 also means that you can more easily apply poisons in\n\t\tcombat, allowing you to quickly employ the right poison for the situation.\n\t\t<p>The two poisons you pick also become your &#8220;Signature Items&#8221; so you can\n\t\t\tcreate more of them using your Infused Reagents. Pick some easy go-to\n\t\t\tpoisons which will be consistently useful in most combat encounters (Giant\n\t\t\tCentipede Venom is great at level 1), and plan to upgrade every level so\n\t\t\tthat your signature poisons are as good as they can possibly be.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Field Discovery<\/span>: Much like bombs, poisons\n\t\tare a single-use item that you may burn through quickly in combat.

Powerful Alchemy\n\t\t\traises the save DC for these poisons, but the damage of low-level poisons\n\t\t\twill gradually shrink in effectiveness until you get the next upgrade to\n\t\t\tyour Perpetual Infusion items at levels 11 and 17. However, debuffs will\n\t\t\tremain perpetually useful throughout your career. Tragically, the only\n\t\t\t1st-level injury poisons are Spear Frog Poison and Giant Centipede Venom,\n\t\t\tso you don&#8217;t really get to choose.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You could more easily use this with inhaled poisons, but there are only\n\t\t\ttwo qualifying poisons as of this writing (False Flayleaf, Yellow Musk\n\t\t\tVial), and they&#8217;re not useful consistently enough to justify picking them\n\t\t\tfor Perpetual Infusions. Of course, a Lab Assistant familiar could run\n\t\t\taround dropping clouds of Yellow Musk Vial and make a huge impact.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me if poison applied to weapons\/objects or thrown into\n\t\t\tthe air persists past the beginning of your next turn. If it doesn&#8217;t, this\n\t\t\tis abysmally hard to use. If it does, you can freely poison every weapon\n\t\t\tand piece of ammunition in your party after every encounter. The best\n\t\t\tanswer I&#8217;ve found comes from the Infused property which the Alchemist&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlchemy feature applies: &#8220;Any nonpermanent effects from your infused\n\t\t\talchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting\n\t\t\tpoisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.&#8221; I\n\t\t\t<em>think<\/em> this means that once your poison is &#8220;used&#8221; (applied to a\n\t\t\tweapon, poured into a drink, thrown into the air, etc.) it remains\n\t\t\tfunctional until your next daily preparations. This seems extremely\n\t\t\tpowerful, especially if you poison a big pile of arrows, but I haven&#8217;t been\n\t\t\table to find official rules answers on the subject.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Perpetual Potency<\/span>: Increasing the level\n\t\tof the poisons is great. For easy go-to options, Lethargy Poison (imposes\n\t\tSlowed, but has the Incapacitation trait so don&#8217;t use it against powerful\n\t\tfoes) and Hunting Spider Venom (imposes both Flat-Footed and Clumsy) are\n\t\tgreat go-to choices.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Field Discovery<\/span>: The ability to\n\t\tcombine two poisons is spectacular, but since this can&#8217;t be used on\n\t\tammunition you need to put this on a melee weapon. Melee is a hard place for\n\t\tthe Toxicologist due to the action economy challenges of using poisons, but\n\t\tyou can use this outside of combat to set your party up with poisons that\n\t\twill give your party an advantage early in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Perpetual Perfection<\/span>: Again: better\n\t\tpoisons are great. By this level, there are numerous contact and inhaled\n\t\tpoisons, so it&#8217;s easy to look beyond injury poisons. Blightburn Resin deals\n\t\ta mountain of poison damage as a contact poison, so your dismal attack bonus\n\t\tno longer matters. If you can get the formula for Azure Lilly Pollen (it&#8217;s\n\t\tRare), it&#8217;s a decent inhaled option.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Alchemist&#8217;s subclasses (Research Fields) choose a specific type of alchemical item and make you an expert with that type of item. This allows you to create those items more efficiently (sometimes entirely for free) using Advanced Alchemy and Quick Alchemy, so expect to spend a lot of time using whatever favorite items you picked. All of the subclasses work roughly the same ways. At level 1, you&#8217;ll generally get some &#8220;signature items&#8221; which you&#8217;re really good at making using Advanced Alchemy.
