A Wizard with a comprehensive spellbook can do essentially anything in\n\tthe game, often as well as or better than a non-magical character who is built\n\tto do that thing. A Wizard with Invisibility is as nearly stealthy as a Rogue,\n\tor a divination spell can be even more subtle. A Wizard with a summoned pet\n\tcan often replace a Fighter (at least temporarily) as the party&#8217;s durable\n\tfront line. A clever Wizard could even find a way to heal their allies and\n\treplace a Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Wizards can do so much so well, their possible roles within the party are numerous and varied. However, in a typical party the Wizard&#8217;s primary functions are as a Blaster, Controller, Librarian, Support caster, Striker, and Utility Caster. Depending on your spells and potentially your skills, you can also serve as a Defender, Face, Healer (though it&#8217;s difficult), and Scout. You may think, &#8220;but wait, isn&#8217;t that every role?&#8221;. Yes. Yes, it is. But be sure not to spread yourself too thin. DnD is a game that often rewards specialization and frequently punishes breadth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite their many strengths, Wizards are among the least durable characters\n\tin the game, having no armor proficiencies, poor saving throws, and the lowest\n\thit dice available. Staying alive as a wizard can be very difficult, and in\n\tmost cases requires a party of sturdy allies willing to protect you from harm.\n\tThere are exceptions to this rule (bladesingers can achieve some of the\n\thighest AC in the game without the aid of magic items), but they are few in\n\tnumber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Wizard, perhaps more than any other class in the game, rewards the player\n\tfor mastery of both their character and the game system as a whole. A\n\tproficient player with the right spell can solve any problem. But developing\n\tthat proficiency takes time and effort. If you&#8217;re not ready to invest the time\n\tto reach that level of proficiency, the Wizard can still be a lot of fun to\n\tplay. The 2024 Player&#8217;s Handbook describes the Wizard&#8217;s complexity as\n\t&#8220;average&#8221;, and it&#8217;s not wrong. The Wizard&#8217;s features are simple, and sticking\n\tto straightforward, reliable spells can be effective without a ton of effort\n\ton the player&#8217;s part.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly all of of the class&#8217;s complexity is buried in managing and casting your spells. A spellbook requires an unusual extra layer of bookkeeping, and unlike Clerics and Druids who can select from a vast spell list after every long rest, you need to hoard newly-learned spells to expand your capabilities beyond the handful of spells which you learn at each level, often at great expense. Learning new spells can be a gamble, costing precious gold for a spell which you may never use. If you are prone to analysis paralysis or don&#8217;t enjoy carefully tracking resources, you might find this part of the Wizard frustrating. But, again, you can do the bare minimum and still be perfectly fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell anyone who asks that the Wizard is my favorite class, and that has\n\tbeen the case since early in my career with Dungeons and Dragons. The Wizard\n\tis a class that rewards system mastery, and while you don&#8217;t need to be an\n\texperienced player to succeed as a wizard, improving your familiarity with the\n\tgame will pay dividends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>You may also enjoy our other supporting articles for the Wizard:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/wizard\/wizard-subclasses\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28439\">DnD 2024 Wizard Subclasses Guide<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/wizard\/spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31074\">DnD 2024 Wizard Spells Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re playing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, you might also enjoy our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/classes\/wizard\/\">Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 Wizard Guide<\/a>.

They can do everything: kill stuff, charm stuff, solve problems,\n\tgather information, travel, whatever. If you can imagine doing it with magic,\n\ta Wizard can do it. Except healing. They can&#8217;t really do that beyond Arcane\n\tVigor, which only targets the caster.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>For help selecting spells, see our\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2687\">Wizard Spells Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Ritual Adept<\/span>: Wizards are one of the best\n\tritual casters in the game. They get the most ritual spells on their spell\n\tlist, and they can cast any ritual spell in their spellbook rather than\n\trequiring the spell to be prepared like other spellcasters. This means that,\n\tif you collect the spells and add them to your spellbook, you can make every\n\tritual on your spell list available at all times.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Recovery<\/span>: This provides a bit of\n\tsustainability to the Wizard which was missing in previous editions. Wizards\n\twere the biggest cause of the &#8220;five minute day&#8221;, in which the Wizard would\n\tburn their biggest spells in the first encounter, then would be essentially\n\tuseless unless the party immediately took a long rest. Arcane Recovery gives\n\tyou the ability to recover a bunch of spell slots, allowing you to continue at\n\tleast through the first Short Rest of each day without issue. While Arcane\n\tRecovery can&#8217;t restore slots above level 6, it&#8217;s still a crucial resource,\n\tallowing you to recover low-level spell slots which will remain a perpetual\n\tsource of crucial defensive and utility spells like Shield and Darkvision.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>2. <span class=\"rating-green\">Scholar<\/span>: Expertise is always nice. The\n\tlist includes every skill which you could select with your 2 wizard skills at\n\tlevel 1 except for Insight. They&#8217;re also all Intelligence-based, except for\n\tMedicine, which means that you&#8217;re well suited to using these skills\n\teffectively.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Wizard subclasses are briefly summarized below.

Once you&#8217;ve mastered picking your spells, you can use this to\n\tswap out long-duration buffs after you cast them, or you can swap out\n\thigh-level spells when you run out of high-level spell slots.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>18. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Mastery<\/span>: Your first thought might\n\tbe to pick up something to replace your cantrips as a go-to damage solution,\n\tbut your cantrips hit 4dx damage a level ago, which means they will outstrip\n\tnearly all level 1 and level 2 spells in terms of single-target damage. Your\n\tbest bets for damage are Shatter (if you need a spammable AOE) and Scorching\n\tRay, but even Scorching Ray only beats cantrips by an average of 3 damage.\n\tInstead, look for utility spells which are helpful to spam like Invisibility,\n\tdefenses like Mirror Image, save-or-suck spells like Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter, and more\n\tstrategically interesting options like Magic Missile for breaking enemy\n\tspellcasters&#8217; Concentration<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Spell Mastery doesn&#8217;t consume a spell slot, it doesn&#8217;t run into the &#8220;one spell with a spell slot per turn&#8221; rule. This means that, like cantrips, you can use Spell Mastery to cast spells on a turn in which you cast another spell. Since Spell Mastery only works for spells with a casting time of 1 Action, this means casting spells like Misty Step as a Bonus Action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>20. <span class=\"rating-green\">Signature Spells<\/span>: Cool, but not nearly\n\tas important as Spell Mastery. The free castings are nice, but the biggest\n\tdraw is the two extra spells prepared per day, which improves your versatility\n\teven at this level when you&#8217;re already able to prepare so many.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-wizard-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Wizard Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Spellcasting. Now allows you to change a cantrip on Long Rest, which only Wizards can do. Everyone else needs to gain a class level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Ritual Adept. Broken out from the Spellcasting feature, where it was buried and often overlooked in the 2014 rules. This remains one of the Wizard\u2019s best tools.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Scholar. Expertise in one skill from the Wizard\u2019s class skill list, excluding Insight. This makes the wizard feel very scholarly, which I love.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Memorize Spell. Replace one of your prepared spells on a Short Rest. Guessing which spells to prepare has long been the hardest part of playing a Wizard, and this takes some of that stress away. It also gives you even more excuses to collect spells like some kind of librarian magpie.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>18. Spell Mastery. Your spell choices are limited to spells that can be cast as an Action, so no more Shield or Misty Step. They now count as always prepared, which was a weird omission from the 2014 version. You can now change the spells on a Long Rest, instead of with 8 hours of study. Mostly a nerf.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Signature Spells. Identical to the 2014 version.

If legacy content is available, grab Absorb\n\t\tElements and ignore this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boon of Fate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: 2d4\n\t\taverages to 5. Adding +5\/-5 to a saving throw can rescue you or an ally, or\n\t\tit can cause an enemy to fail a save. On a d20 scale, 5 means that there&#8217;s a\n\t\t25% chance on any given roll that this will have an impact. Granted, it is\n\t\tstill a dice roll, so the smaller the gap, the safer this is to use. On a\n\t\tfull caster where save-or-suck spells are such a huge part of\n\t\tyour arsenal, this is devastatingly effective. The fact that you can use it\n\t\tonce per encounter is amazing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boon of Fortitude<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: More hit\n\t\tpoints are great on a class as frail as the Wizard, but given the choice\n\t\tbetween this and Resilient (Constitution), you need proficiency in\n\t\tConstitution saves much more than 40 hp and some extra healing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Boon of Recovery<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The Last\n\t\tStand feature is great insurance, but defintiely not enough to justify your\n\t\tfirst Epic Boon. Try to get someone to cast Death Ward on you.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boon of Skill<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Always a\n\t\tgood fallback once you&#8217;ve grabbed a few other boons, but Wizards don&#8217;t do a\n\t\tlot with skills beyond the Intelligence-based skills which you likely\n\t\tstarted with at level 1.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Boon of Speed<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Take Boon\n\t\tof Dimensional Travel instead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boon of Spell Recall<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This gives\n\t\tyou a 25% chance to retain your spell slot when casting spells of up to\n\t\tlevel 4. You get 4 level 1 spell slots and 3 of each of levels 2, 3, and 4.\n\t\tOn average, you get 1 extra level 1 spell slot, and slightly less than 1 for\n\t\tlevels 2, 3, and 4. This is fine, but definitely don&#8217;t make it your first\n\t\tboon.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boon of the Night Spirit<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Be\n\t\tinvisible at all times outside of combat. Take advantage of invisibility at\n\t\tthe start of combat, then look for ways to become invisible as frequently as\n\t\tpossible. Even if you&#8217;re not making attack rolls (and you almost certainly\n\t\taren&#8217;t doing so often), the defensive benefits of invisibility are massive.\n\t\tHowever, remember that a lot of things are an Action, so it&#8217;s very easy to\n\t\tbreak this invisibility. Notable examples that people easily overlook\n\t\tinclude Hide, Search, and Study.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Boon of Truesight<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fantastic,\n\t\tbut technically only situationally useful. You can already cast both See\n\t\tInvisibility and Truesight. This is objectively good, but don&#8217;t make it your\n\t\tfirst boon unless you have a very specific reason to do so.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Wizard Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Wizard is proficient in simple weapons.
