After all, it\u2019s one of the original subclasses from the PHB, it\u2019s in the SRD, and it\u2019s old, so surely newer subclasses are superior. Not necessarily. The Hunter might not be flashy, but instead it\u2019s incredibly consistent, being able to pump out plenty of weapon damage every turn with options for both ranged and melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, the Hunter Archetype is all about increased damage and increased self survivability, but with choices at every feature the exact nature of those benefits is the Hunter\u2019s choice. For example, a Colossus Slayer Hunter does an extra 1d8 once per turn when it hits with a weapon attack while a Giant Killer Hunter can attack as a reaction if a Large or larger creature attacks the Hunter regardless of the triggering attack\u2019s hit or miss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>What really sets Hunter apart is the Multiattack feature. Most Ranger Archetypes gain some kind of attack steroid at eleventh level, usually some extra damage or one extra attack. Hunter instead gets either a melee swing against every adjacent target, or a ranged attack against every target in a 10 foot radius of a point within range, multiplying the benefits of additional damage from sources such as Sharpshooter or Elemental Weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The example build makes some silly choices in order to wear heavy armor and be part Cleric while firing all the arrows.

Most\n\t\t\t\tcreatures will take some amount of damage early in a fight, so it&#8217;s easy\n\t\t\t\tto trigger this damage bonus and you don&#8217;t need to spend a Bonus Action\n\t\t\t\tto activate it like some other subclass damage boosts, so options like\n\t\t\t\tTwo-Weapon Fighting and Crossbow Expert are still viable.<p>Generally this is the best Hunter&#8217;s Prey option for melee builds\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause melee builds are usually forced to focus on a single enemy at\n\t\t\t\t\ta time since switching targets typically involves getting hit with an\n\t\t\t\t\tOpportunity Attack.<\/p><\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Giant Killer<\/span>: A lot of enemies are\n\t\t\t\tLarge or larger, especially big martial enemies like beasts, dragons,\n\t\t\t\tfiends, etc. This requires that the subject attack you, but if your AC\n\t\t\t\tis decent and you can handle being attacked a few times this can be an\n\t\t\t\texcellent source of damage output. Unfortunately, since this doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tapply to every enemy, you may find that numerous encounters don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tbenefit from Giant Killer. If you know that your campaign will involve\n\t\t\t\tnumerous oversized enemies (Storm King&#8217;s Thunder is a great example if\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re looking at published campaigns), this is a good choice.\n\t\t\t\tOtherwise, you might just decide to be happy only using this some of the\n\t\t\t\ttime.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Horde Breaker<\/span>: In encounters with\n\t\t\t\tnumerous foes, this is a significant damage boost, but the extra attack\n\t\t\t\thas strict requirements and doesn&#8217;t cooperate with staple ranger options\n\t\t\t\tlike Hunter&#8217;s Mark\/Favored Foe which encourage you to focus on bringing\n\t\t\t\tdown one target at a time rather than spreading damage to multiple foes.\nConsider instead buffs that boost your weapon on all attacks like Elemental Weapon or Guardian of Nature.\n\t\t\t\t<p>Melee builds will have trouble using this unless you have reach,\n\t\t\t\t\tespecially if enemies are attacking your allies rather than swarming\n\t\t\t\t\tyou. Ranged builds will have less trouble because you can easily\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch targets to any enemies who happen to be close enough\n\t\t\t\t\ttogether.<\/p><\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defensive Tactics<\/span>: All of the options\n\t\tare technically situational, but I would pick Multiattack Defense nine times\n\t\tout of ten.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Escape the Horde<\/span>: Rangers are more\n\t\t\t\tdurable than Rogues, so running away from enemies isn&#8217;t something you\n\t\t\t\ttypically need to do. If you do need to run away, consider taking the\n\t\t\t\tDisengage action. If you need to run away a lot, consider the Mobile\n\t\t\t\tfeat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Multiattack Defense<\/span>: Large single\n\t\t\t\tenemies frequently have multiple attacks, especially as you gain levels,\n\t\t\t\tso this boost to AC will occur frequently and will prevent a lot of\n\t\t\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Steel Will<\/span>: Fear effects are common,\n\t\t\t\tbut generally won&#8217;t get you killed. You can also get this resistance\n\t\t\t\tfrom numerous sources, such as the Halfling&#8217;s Brave trait.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Multiattack<\/span>: Both options are fantastic. To get the most out of this feature, look for effects that add damage to every attack, such as Magic Weapon or Great Weapon Master.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Volley<\/span>: The obvious choice for ranged\n\t\t\t\tbuilds. This won&#8217;t benefit much from Hunter&#8217;s Mark\/Favored Foe, but\n\t\t\t\thitting three or more foes will typically deal more damage than focusing\n\t\t\t\ton a single marked target.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Whirlwind Attack<\/span>: Melee builds not\n\t\t\t\tbuilt around two-weapon fighting will get the most out of this ability\n\t\t\t\tsince their normal attacks deal higher damage than TWF builds, and since\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not taking the Attack action you can&#8217;t spend your Bonus Action to\n\t\t\t\tmake an additional attack. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s limited to creatures\n\t\t\t\twithin 5 feet of you, so you can&#8217;t abuse reach to get additional\n\t\t\t\ttargets.\n\t\t\t\t<p>However, even TWF builds may find this ability helpful since they may\n\t\t\t\t\tstill get the same number of attacks without consuming their Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\tAction, allowing you to use it for something like casting a spell.<\/p><\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Superior Hunter&#8217;s Defense<\/span>: Uncanny Dodge\n\t\tis clearly the best option here, but Evasion is good, too.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Evasion<\/span>: With high Dexterity and\n\t\t\t\tproficiency in Dexterity saves, this makes you practically immune to AOE\n\t\t\t\tdamage effects like Fireball and breath weapons.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stand Against the Tide<\/span>: The\n\t\t\t\tpositioning to make this work is very difficult in most situations, and\n\t\t\t\tas soon as enemies see you do this they&#8217;re reasonably going to space\n\t\t\t\tthemselves out to prevent you from doing it again.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: The majority of damage\n\t\t\t\tyou will take in the game will come from attacks. Combined with\n\t\t\t\tMultiattack Defense, you can reduce the damage of the first hit, then\n\t\t\t\tdramatically reduce the likelihood of suffering further hits.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hunter-ability-scores\">Hunter Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Hunters can just follow the Ranger Handbook and do fine, or they can go Strength and pick up a greatsword for Horde Breaker Whirlwind shenanigans.

However, that only applies after we get Volley at eleventh level. Switching to a Heavy Crossbow when Volley becomes an option would work, but at that point this feat is losing more ground to Gunner because it gives up the +1 Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Weapon Master<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Because we have options that allow for getting in extra attacks against extra foes, added flat damage is great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gunner<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Even if you can\u2019t get a firearm, using this with a bow still works for ignoring Disadvantage firing in melee, while being a hybrid feat for +1 Dexterity.

If you can pick a Strixhaven background, Prismari Student has the same skills and bonus spells. If you can\u2019t pick a Strixhaven background but can pick a Ravnica background, Rakdos Cultist also has the same skills and different bonus spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we go with Prismari, the cantrips we take from Prismari Initiate are Prestidigitation and Ray of Frost, and for a 1st-level spell we take Shield off the Sorcerer list.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>From Leonin we take Survival. From Ranger we pick Animal Handling, Perception, and Insight, with Expertise in Perception from Deft Explorer.

If you have access to firearms, a Pistol or Musket are both good upgrades from a Longbow, but this feat still works great with Archery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At ninth level, we take Sharpshooter to boost our damage against less armored targets as well as make more use of attacks at long range. The Archery style will help offset both the penalty from using Sharpshooter and from not taking our ASI this early.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At thirteenth level, we take an ASI to cap Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At seventeenth level, we take Resilient (Constitution) to round it off and boost our Concentration saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twentieth level, we take an ASI for +2 Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Because Hunter has choices at every subclass feature, this section goes over those choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Ranger third level, for Hunter\u2019s Prey we take Horde Breaker because it\u2019s free additional attacks. While Colossus Slayer is slightly more consistent since Horde Breaker requires multiple targets to be adjacent, any additional damage we can get on attacks, such as Sharpshooter or magical bonuses, will apply to the free attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Ranger seventh level, for Defensive Tactics we take Multiattack Defence. Sure, we have to actually get hit once for it to trigger, but it\u2019s still more useful than the other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Ranger eleventh level, for Multiattack we\u2019re taking Volley because we\u2019re ranged. Importantly, Volley can trigger Horde Breaker, which would allow us to hit someone twice if adjacent creatures are in the Volley together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Ranger fifteenth level, for Superior Hunter\u2019s Defense, we\u2019ll be taking Uncanny Dodge. If we happen to know Shield from the Strixhaven Initiate background we\u2019ll want Evasion instead because Shield is a better use of our Reaction than Uncanny Dodge because the AC lasts the entire round.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1-Ranger 1<\/td><td>Skills<br>-Animal Handling<br>-Acrobatics<br>-Insight<br>-Perception<br>-Performance<br>-Survival<br><br>Tools<br>-Cook\u2019s Utensils<br><br>Deft Explorer<br><br>Expertise<br>-Perception<br><br>Favored Foe 1d4<\/td><td>We take the starting equipment for a Ranger.<br><strong>Ranger<\/strong><br>-Scale Mail &#8211; It\u2019s decent medium armor for our start.<br>-Two Melee Weapons &#8211; These are mostly for the wilderness utility of being a small axe and a small knife.<br>\u2013Dagger<br>\u2013Handaxe<br>-Explorer\u2019s Pack<br>-Longbow and Arrows &#8211; Our primary weapon. 1d8+dex<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2-Cleric 1<\/td><td>Life Domain<br>-Heavy Armor<br>-Domain Spells<br>\u2013Bless<br>\u2013Cure Wounds<br>-Disciple of Life<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-Cantrips<br>\u2013Light<br>\u2013Mending<br>\u2013Word of Radiance<br>-1st-level Cleric Spells<\/td><td>We immediately take a dip into Life Cleric to gain Heavy Armor proficiency and Disciple of Life.

Each individual berry gains the bonus healing, which is great for healing in between battles, giving us a total of 40 hp worth of healing from a 1st-level slot.<br><br>We also gain three Cleric cantrips. We choose Light, Mending, and Word of Radiance. Because Clerics can prepare new spells each day, consult the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/spells\/#spells-1\">Cleric Spell Breakdown<\/a> for good options.

Life Domain means we always prepare Bless, which is a boost to three targets both offensively and defensively. We also carry three flavors of defensive buff: Protection from Good and Evil, Shield of Faith, and Fog Cloud. On Fog Cloud, cast it behind yourself when you\u2019re fighting at long range then just stand a few feet into the cloud when it\u2019s not your turn. And if we don\u2019t need any of those, Favored Foe can just stand in for Hunter\u2019s Mark.<br><br>Also, as mentioned above, Goodberry combines well with Disciple of Life to be the most healing that can be squeezed out of a 1st-level spell slot. In fact, because Goodberry lasts 24 hours, if you have slots at bedtime, spend every slot on tomorrow\u2019s Goodberries.
