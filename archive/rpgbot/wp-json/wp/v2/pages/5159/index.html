Despite being one of few classes in Pathfinder with no access to magic, the Fighter is still a powerful and versatile class capable of being a terrifying and powerful force in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Fighter is at their best in combat, where their capabilities truly shine. The Fighter has fewer skills than most classes and terribly few utility options, but in a fight the Fighter is versatile, capable, and often surprising. The Fighter primarily serves their party as a Defender and a Striker, but despite the narrow scope of their capabilities they still have a ton of room for customization and diversity in how their play and what tactics they choose to employ in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of interesting mechanical things about the fighter. Unlike other classes, the Fighter has no sublasses. Instead, you can totally determine how the Fighter works by your choice of class feats. Even in the limited options of the Core Rulebook there are feats to cater to a dizzying variety of weapon and armor arrangements. Want to use shields? There are options for it. Two-handed weapons? You&#8217;ve got it. Two weapons at the same time? Definitely. Want to have a free hand for high-fives and such? Surprisingly, they found a way to make that viable. Even archery is a viable option, though it takes a few levels to get off the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Fighter is defined almost entirely by their feats and their choice of weapon, Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s retraining rules are absolutely crucial for the Fighter. Expect that any time your party&#8217;s membership changes, or whenever you find a cool magic item, you may need to make some changes to your feats to make yourself as effective as possible. However, your ability scores are difficult to change, so you&#8217;ll be locked into some sets of options depending on whether your choose Strength or Dexterity as your key ability score.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#strength-based\">Strength-based Fighter<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dexterity-based\">Dexterity-based Fighter<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Fighter-feats\">Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Fighter-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Fighter-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#weapons-archery\">Archery Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-single-weapon\">Single-Weapon Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-two-handed\">Two-Handed Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-two-weapon\">Two-Weapon Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons-sword-and-board\">Sword-and-Board Builds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Choose whichever caters to your preferences. Strength-based fighters will be largely locked into melee, while Dexterity-based fighters can switch between melee and ranged combat but may deal slightly less damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: 10+ hit points, and it&#8217;s easy\n\tfor you to focus on keeping your Constitution high since the Fighter needs so\n\tfew ability scores.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: All armor, and both\n\tsimple and martial weapons, and you get all the way to Legendary, giving the\n\tFighter the highest weapon proficiency in the game. Your AC and attack bonus\n\twill be higher than any other character at 1st level. On top of that, the\n\tFighter is the only class which is Trained with advanced weapons at 1st level\n\twithout spending a feat to get it.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span>: Expert at 1st level and you\n\t\timprove to Master at 7th and get an additonal +2 to Perception checks for\n\t\tInitiative.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Fortitude and Reflex saves\n\t\twill be good, especially if you emphasized Dexterity, but Will saves are a\n\t\thuge weakness so don&#8217;t dump your Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 4+ skills is average,\n\t\tbut Fighters often dump Intelligence so you may find yourself with few\n\t\tskills. Take Athletics if you plan to rely on Strength, and consider\n\t\tAcrobatics if you plan to rely on Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Attacks<\/span>: Expert with simple and martial\n\t\tweapons at 1st level, and the Fighter is the only class that is Trained in\n\t\tAdvanced Weapons without spending a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Defenses<\/span>: Trained in all armor and\n\t\tunarmored defense at 1st level, and your proficiency rises to Master so your\n\t\tAC should be higher than nearly any other character.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: There are no published Fighter options which\n\t\tmake use of the Fighter Class DC, but some other things like critical\n\t\tspecializations can sometimes rely upon your class DC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Attack of Opportunity<\/span>: Very few creatures in\n\tPathfinder 2e have the ability to punish creatures for moving through their\n\treach, so most creatures can simply rush past each other to reach vulonerable\n\ttargets. The ability to make even one additional attack in these cases is a\n\tsignificant deterrent, and the Fighter is the only class that gets this option\n\twithout spending a feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield Block<\/span>: It&#8217;s difficult to choose to\n\tuse a shield without this feat, so getting it for free is helpful. Don&#8217;t feel\n\tlike you absolutely need to use it, but remember that shields are always an\n\toption if you find yourself in a tough spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fighter Feats<\/strong>: See Fighter feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter Weapon Mastery<\/span>: The Fighter&#8217;s weapon\n\tproficiency advances strangely. You choose one weapon group (Brawling, Swords,\n\tetc.) and your proficiency with that group (including Advanced Weapons)\n\tadvances at 5th level while your other weapon proficiencies remain\n\tunchanged.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battlefield Surveyor<\/span>: This is as good as\n\tyour Perception will get without spending a feat, but Master is still really\n\tgood.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage on weapon\n\tattacks, and since your proficiency is already Expert or Master with your\n\tweapon, you&#8217;re getting a better damage bonus than other classes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Flexibility<\/span>: Class feats are the best\n\tfeats, and getting one more of any level offers a ton of great options. Since\n\tyou get to change this every day, it&#8217;s a great way to experiment with options\n\twhich you&#8217;re not certain that you&#8217;ll like without spending Downtime to train,\n\tand it&#8217;s a great way to bring in material from newly-published sourcebooks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Juggernaut<\/span>: Fortitude saves are very\n\timportant, and between your high proficiency and your probably 18 Constitution\n\tyou should be very good at them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Expertise<\/span>: +2 AC and access to armor\n\tspecialization effects. I&#8217;m partial to full plate because slashing damage is\n\tcommon, so 2+ damage resistance to slashing damage is a significant\n\tbenefit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Fighter Expertise<\/span>: The Fighter class DC isn&#8217;t\n\tused for anything.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Legend<\/span>: Master in Simple\/Martial,\n\tExpert in Advanced, Legendary in all Simple\/Martial weapons in one group, and\n\tMaster in the Advanced Weapons in that group. Legendary proficiency opens up\n\tsome exciting options that most characters can&#8217;t use until much higher level,\n\tand it gives you more damage from Weapon Specialization.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Even if your Dexterity is poor,\n\tFull Plate&#8217;s Bulwark trait and your high proficiency give you a good bonus to\n\tReflex saves, so Critical Successes should be common.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: You&#8217;re\n\tLegendary or Master in the weapons which you care about the most, so this is a\n\tbig damage boost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Flexibility<\/span>: Another free class\n\tfeat! Great for all the same reasons that Combat Flexibility is great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Mastery<\/span>: Another +2 to AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Versatile Legend<\/span>: Realistically, this won&#8217;t\n\tmatter much. You&#8217;ve spent your career dumping gold into a weapon or two which\n\tyou care about and which are probably in the same weapon group. Even with\n\tLegendary proficiency, other weapons won&#8217;t do enough damage to keep up with\n\tyour super-powered pointy stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strength-based\">Strength-based Fighter<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most fighters will be Strength-based. Dexterity is not the &#8220;god stat&#8221; that it was in Pathfinder 1e. Since you only need three high Ability Scores, you have a lot of flexibility with your other ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Your defining ability score<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Full Plate has a Dexterity Cap of +0,\n\tand you want to be in Full Plate. Once you&#8217;re in Full Plate, the Bulwark trait\n\treplaces your Dexterity modifier.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Only useful for starting skills and\n\tlanguages. You can only maximize three skills, and you get a total of 4+\n\tskills so dumping Intelligence to 8 means that you&#8217;ll still get three skills\n\tthat you can maximize, but just being Trained in a skill is often enough to\n\tmake it useful, and if you have spare Ability Boosts more skills can broaden\n\tyour usefulness in the party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Essential for Perception and Will\n\tSaves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Only useful if you&#8217;re building for\n\tIntimidation.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dexterity-based\">Dexterity-based Fighter<\/h3>\n\n<p>Finesse weapons and ranged weapons make Dexterity-based builds an option, but<br>\n\tkeep in mind that even the most Dexterity-heavy Fighter can still benefit a<br>\n\tlot from high Strength.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: You want some for Propulsive weapons\n\t(bows) and for melee weapons, but there is very little reason to go beyond 18\n\tand you can start as low as 14 and you&#8217;ll be fine.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Your defining ability score.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Even if you fight at range, you want\n\tthe extra hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Only useful for starting skills and\n\tlanguages.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Essential for Perception and Will\n\tSaves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Only useful if you&#8217;re building for\n\tIntimidation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Since the Fighter primarily needs boosts to physical ability scores and every Ancestry gets one, nearly any Ancestry works. Strangely, a bonus to Wisdom from an Ancestry is actually a better way to identify Ancestries that work well. Also look closely at Ancestry Feats, especially those which reduce the proficiency type on racial Advanced Weapons and grant access to Uncommon weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Constitution, Wisdom, and a Free\n\tAbility Boost can go into your choice of Strength or Dexterity, so the Dwarf&#8217;s\n\tAbility Boosts are perfect. Their Ability Flaw in Charisma makes Intimidation\n\tbuilds hard, but that&#8217;s barely a problem, and -1 to your Charisma modifier is\n\tnot insurmountable. Dwarven Weapon Familiarity makes the Dwarven War Axe a\n\tgreat option for dueling builds, and Unbound Iron can do a lot to mitigate the\n\tDwarf&#8217;s poor speed. Dwarfs also have the highest hit points from their\n\tAncestry <em>and<\/em> Darkvision, making them a truly fantastic option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: A Boost to Intelligence is wasted, and a\n\tFlaw in Constitution is risky. If you&#8217;re set on Elf, be sure to use the\n\tVoluntary Flaws rule to fix the Constitution penalty, but most likely you&#8217;ll\n\tend up with +2 Dex, -2 Int, and nothing else. At that point, just play a\n\tHalf-Elf.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: Even for Dexterity-based builds, a\n\tStrength Flaw means less damage for nearly every Fighter. You could use the\n\tVoluntary Flaws rule to end up with +0 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Int, -2 Wis, +2\n\tCha, which could work for a Dexterity-based Intimidation build, but I don&#8217;t\n\tknow if that&#8217;s enough. Gnome Weapon Familiarity gets you access to the Gnome\n\tFlickmace, but with a Strength flaw that&#8217;s not helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Goblin<\/span>: The ability boosts and flaws work\n\tfine for the Fighter, but few of the Goblin&#8217;s Ancestry Feats work especially\n\twell. Goblin Scuttle is helpful if you like Flanking (and you should), but\n\tGoblin Weapon Familiarity isn&#8217;t helpful because goblin weapons aren&#8217;t great\n\toptions for the Fighter. Consider Adopted Ancestry (Elf) so that you can take\n\tElf Step and use Goblin Scuttle to Step twice and get into Flanking position\n\tmore easily.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Dexterity and Wisdom work great,\n\tbut a Strength Flaw is a problem for many fighters, so consider the Voluntary\n\tFlaws rule to offset the Strength Flaw. Most halfling feats won&#8217;t be very\n\thelpful, but Halfling Luck is fantastic, and you can use Cultural Adaptability\n\tto open up great options from other Ancestries, such as Human for the Natural\n\tAmbition feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always a great choice, your two free\n\tBoosts can go into Strength or Dexterity and whatever other ability you want.\n\tNatural Amibition gives you an extra 1st-level Class Feat, and many of the\n\tFighter&#8217;s 1st-level feats are great. Unconventional Weaponry can make one\n\tAdvanced Weapon a martial weapon, making options like the Dwarven Waraxe and\n\tthe Sawtooth Saber much more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Look for backgrounds that offer boosts to Strength or Dexterity, depending on your build.

Battle Cry is still worthwhile, but\n\t\t\t\tthat&#8217;s probably your only reason to use Demoralize over Scare to\n\t\t\t\tDeath.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Terrified Retreat<\/span>: If the target&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tlevel is lower than yours, there&#8217;s probably more than one creature in\n\t\t\t\tthe fight, and sending one or more of them fleeing will make the fight\n\t\t\t\tmuch easier for you.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lore<\/span> (Int): Intelligence is your biggest\n\t\tdump stat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Medicine<\/span> (Wis): You need Wisdom to\n\t\tcompensate for your relatively poor Will saves and to boost your Perception,\n\t\tso you may have enough to make this work. It&#8217;s also your only healing option\n\t\tshort of resting or items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nature<\/span> (Wis): Essential if you want to\n\t\tfight while mounted, but otherwise skip it.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonded Animal<\/span>: A poor man&#8217;s Animal\n\t\t\t\tCompanion, a Bonded Animal is a great stand-in for mounted characters\n\t\t\t\tuntil you can get a Multiclass Archetype that gives you an Animal\n\t\t\t\tCompanion. A great option for mounted builds, but I would retrain it\n\t\t\t\tonce you get an Animal Companion.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Occultism<\/span> (Int): Intelligence is your\n\t\tbiggest dump stat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Performance<\/span> (Cha): Aside from a handful of\n\t\tfeats that you probably don&#8217;t want, there is no reason for you to be good at\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Religion<\/span> (Wis): You&#8217;ll have the Wisdom\n\t\tto make this work passably, but I would leave it a Wisdom-based spellcaster\n\t\tif you have one in the party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Society<\/span> (Int): Intelligence is your biggest\n\t\tdump stat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Many fighters have high\n\t\tDexterity, so Stealth is absolutely an option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Only situationally\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thievery<\/span> (Dex): Many fighters have high\n\t\tDexterity, and Thievery is an absolutely crucial skill to have available to\n\t\tthe party.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats\">Fighter Feats<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-1\">1st Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Assessment<\/span>: This would be a great\n\t\tfeat on a ranger going for a monster warden build. But there&#8217;s nothing else\n\t\ton the Fighter which encourages the use of Recall Knowledge or the\n\t\tassociated skills, so a typical fighter is woefully ill-equipped to use\n\t\tthis. But for a ranger looking to multiclass into fighter it&#8217;s great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Double Slice<\/span>: Essential for two-weapon\n\t\tusers. Rangers and Rogues get arguably better two-weapon fighting feats, but\n\t\tDouble Slice does better against foes with damage resistance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Exacting Strike<\/span>: You can only use this\n\t\tas a second action on your turn because it has the Press trait, and it&#8217;s\n\t\tonly useful if you&#8217;re going to make a Strike as part of your third action.\n\t\tThat&#8217;s an extremely specific situation, and if you hit this is exactly the\n\t\tsame as making a regular Strike. So this is situational, only useful for\n\t\tsingle-weapon melee builds, and it only matters if you miss.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Point-Blank Shot<\/span>: Crucial for archers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Attack<\/span>: This is only effective\n\t\twith a weapon that uses d12 damage dice, and even then it&#8217;s not great. Your\n\t\tbest use cases are on turns where you have three Actions and nothing better\n\t\tto do except make attacks, or when you&#8217;re facing an enemy with damage\n\t\tresistances. While those turns happen, they&#8217;re not every turn, sometimes\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll need an Action to Step or something like that so the Action cost to\n\t\tmake Power Attack more effective then other options doesn&#8217;t always make\n\t\tsense.\n\t\t<p>At low levels, the additional damage die can be more impactful than the\n\t\t\tadditional damage from a second Strike due to the Multiple Attack Penalty,\n\t\t\tbut weirdly the math on Power Attack actually improves at around 10th\n\t\t\tlevel. The math here is complicated, and how good Power Attack looks\n\t\t\tdepends heavily on when Runes of Striking become available, the\n\t\t\tavailability of other damage boosts like Property Runes, the prevalence of\n\t\t\tdamage resistances, and what baseline AC you use to calculate the\n\t\t\tlikelihood of hitting with your Strikes.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Because the math is so complex here, it&#8217;s hard to definitively recommend\n\t\t\ttaking or not taking Power Attack. My advice: if your GM is going to let\n\t\t\tyou retrain it, give it a try and see if it works out for you. If there&#8217;s\n\t\t\ta risk that it won&#8217;t work out and you&#8217;ll be stuck with it forever, look\n\t\t\telsewhere.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reactive Shield<\/span>: Raising a shield costs\n\t\tan action, which is a difficult commitment when an extra attack seems more\n\t\tuseful, or when you need to Stride and also hit some stuff. This is a good\n\t\tfallback, but if you&#8217;re committed to using a shield you&#8217;re probably counting\n\t\ton using the Shield Block Reaction, which will conflict with this until you\n\t\tget Quick Shield Block.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Snagging Strike<\/span>: This is a great first\n\t\tattack every round. Making the target flat-footed reduces their AC, which\n\t\tnot only makes your own follow-up attacks more reliable but makes things a\n\t\tlittle easier for all of your allies because the effect remains until the\n\t\tstart of your next turn or until the target moves away.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sudden Charge<\/span>: Great action economy, and\n\t\tyou still have another action to draw a weapon or raise a shield.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aggressive Block<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using your\n\t\tshield to block an attack, pushing an enemy 5 feet away probably puts them\n\t\tout of reach, thereby denying them the ability to make another attack.\n\t\tInstead, the attacked will be forced to use their Action to Step or Stride\n\t\tto get back into reach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Assisting Shot<\/span>: Conceptually\n\t\tinteresting, but Aid is absolutely not worth an Action in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brutish Shove<\/span>: Shoving a creature isn&#8217;t\n\t\talways useful, but it can help you force them into a space where you want\n\t\tthem like off a cliff or into a wall of fire. Hit or miss, the target is\n\t\tflat-footed for the remainder of your turn, which means that if you follow\n\t\tup with another Strike their AC is reduced. However, this action has the\n\t\tPress trait so you can only use it after you&#8217;ve already made a Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Grab<\/span>: Grabbed prevents the target\n\t\tfrom moving, but you might prefer to let them move so that you can take an\n\t\tAttack of Opportunity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragging Strike<\/span>: Even if you never need\n\t\tto drag the target around, you make the target flat-footed until the end of\n\t\tyour current turn, which is very helpful if you&#8217;re making three or more\n\t\tattacks during that turn. This feat has the Press trait so it can&#8217;t be your\n\t\tfirst attack, otherwise this would be\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span> and it would become your default\n\t\tattack action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dueling Parry<\/span>: This is essentially the\n\t\tsame as the Raise a Shield action, at least in terms of the AC bonus.\n\t\tMultiple attack penalties stack up quickly, so your third action is often\n\t\tleft to making an attack at a -10 penalty or doing literally anything else.\n\t\tIn those cases +2 to AC is very appealing compared to a borderline useless\n\t\tattack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intimidating Strike<\/span>: -1 to all checks\n\t\tand saves isn&#8217;t enough, and you can&#8217;t rely on getting the -2. If you plan to\n\t\tpick up Fearsome Brute later, this becomes much more important, but you may\n\t\twant to take something more interesting at this level then retrain a feat\n\t\tlater when you pick up Fearsome Brute.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lunge<\/span>: Movement is too easy in\n\t\tPathfinder 2e to make reach especially important, and using Stride to get\n\t\tinto reach means that you can use more interesting feats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rebounding Toss<\/span>: For a thrown weapon\n\t\tbuild this can be very good. Obviously the 10-foot distance between the two\n\t\ttargets is somewhat limiting, but this is a situation which will come up\n\t\tfrequently so you&#8217;ll definitely get use out of this feat. The biggest\n\t\tproblem is that you must hit with the first Strike to get a chance as the\n\t\tsecond, so aim for the target with the lowest AC first.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Barreling Charge<\/span>: Situational. You won&#8217;t\n\t\tneed this in most combats, and you can often solve this problem with other\n\t\tmeans that are less expensive than a Class Feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Double Shot<\/span>: Normally making two attacks\n\t\twould take two actions and one would be at a -5 penalty. Two attacks, both\n\t\tmade at -2, is a slight improvement.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dual-Handed Assault<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t many\n\t\tweapons with the two-handed trait which justify this feat, but the Dwarven\n\t\tWaraxe goes from d8 to d12, which is tempting. Unfortunately, this is a\n\t\tFlourish so you can only do this once per turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knockdown<\/span>: Knocking the target prone\n\t\tmakes them flat-footed and imposes a -2 penalty to AC. They&#8217;ll likely spend\n\t\tan action on their turn to stand up (a &#8220;move action&#8221;), which both wastes one\n\t\tof their actions and gives you an attack of opportunity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Parting Shot<\/span>: If you are fighting ar\n\t\trange, enemies will try to get into melee with you. The natural response is\n\t\tto Step away, then shoot them. This allows you to do that while also making\n\t\tthem Flat-footed to your Strike when you do so. Not essential by any means,\n\t\tbut still a good option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Powerful Shove<\/span>: If you took feats to shove\n\t\tenemies, it&#8217;s really disappointing to run into things too big to shove.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Reversal<\/span>: Situational, but really\n\t\tgood when the situation arises. Unfortunately it&#8217;s a Flourish so you can\n\t\tonly use it once per turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shielded Stride<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\tdefinitely better than taking a Step if you&#8217;re already going to use Raise a\n\t\tShield in the same turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swipe<\/span>: Sweep weapons like axes are great\n\t\tfor handling crowds of enemies, and Swipe builds on that capacity. The\n\t\tattack bonus from Sweep adds to both Swipe attacks, so I recommend using\n\t\tSwipe before making other Strikes. Unfortunately, the targets need to be\n\t\tadjacent to each other, which can be difficult when enemies are typically\n\t\ttrying to circle around and flank you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Twin Parry<\/span>: Basically the same as\n\t\tDuelling Parry, but for two-weapon fighters. Because TWF actions typically\n\t\tinvolve making more than one Strike, you&#8217;ll accumulate multiple attack\n\t\tpenalties almost immediately, making your second and third actions difficult\n\t\tto attack with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-6\">6th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Advanced Weapon Training<\/span>: Some Advanced\n\t\tweapons can add a lot to a build, and this brings them on par with your\n\t\tother weapons so you&#8217;ll get another +2 to attacks and extra damage from\n\t\tWeapon Specialization. However, you can often use an Ancestry feat to reduce\n\t\tthe type of proficiency for a handful of Advanced Weapons from Advanced to\n\t\tMartial, which is usually a better deal since Class Feats are typically more\n\t\timportant than Ancestry Feats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advantageous Assault<\/span>: A great option on\n\t\ttop of Combat Grab or Knockdown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dazing Blow<\/span>: If you have a creature\n\t\tgrappled, this instantly becomes your best option. You deal bludgeoning\n\t\tdamage even if your weapon normally deals a different damage type (like\n\t\tstriking en enemy with the pommel of a dagger), but otherwise your make your\n\t\tStrike as you normally would. The target then gets a Fortitude save, but\n\t\teven on a failure they&#8217;re Stunned 1, which robs them of an Action on their\n\t\tturn. If you can use this more than once, Stunned won&#8217;t stack (you take the\n\t\tlarger of the two), but they might roll worse on the save and lose even more\n\t\tActions. Note that this has the Press trait so you need to use it after\n\t\tmaking an Attack. Conveniently, the Grapple action has the Attack trait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disarming Stance<\/span>: Too situational and the\n\t\tbonus is too small.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Furious Focus<\/span>: This makes following Power\n\t\tAttack with another Attack much more reliable, but by this level Power\n\t\tAttack is mathematically obsolete.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guardian&#8217;s Deflection<\/span>: Situational. If\n\t\tyou spend a lot of time adjacent to your allies in melee this can be really\n\t\timpactful, but bunching up in melee isn&#8217;t always a great option so you may\n\t\tspend a lot of time totally unable to use this feat. Both the Fighter and\n\t\tthe Swashbuckler get access to this Class Feat. The text is identical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reflexive Shield<\/span>: Reflex saves are the\n\t\tFighter&#8217;s low save, and dropping AOE damage is an easy way to wear down a\n\t\tcharacter with a huge pool of hit points like a fighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revealing Stab<\/span>: Invisible creautures are\n\t\ta serious problem, but your party should be using magic or Blind-Fight to\n\t\taddress them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ricochet Stance<\/span>: A Returning rune is a\n\t\tlevel 3 item worth 55gp. If you&#8217;re built to throw things, you almost\n\t\tcertainly have one by this level. Even if you don&#8217;t, this is an awful\n\t\tfeat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shatter Defenses<\/span>: A decent follow-up to\n\t\tIntimidating Strike, but borderline useless on its own.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Warden<\/span>: Great for protecting your\n\t\tallies, but in combat they typically shouldn&#8217;t be adjacent to you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Triple Shot<\/span>: Three shots for two actions\n\t\tis good, and the -4 penalty doesn&#8217;t make that significantly worse.\n\t\tMathematically, -4\/-4\/-4 is better than +0\/-5\/-10, especially since your\n\t\tattack bonus with a bow will already be higher than most characters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blind-Fight<\/span>: Your best best for tackling\n\t\tInvisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disorienting Opening<\/span>: Too situational, and\n\t\tyou gain no benefit from this since the effect expires at the start of your\n\t\tnext turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling Riposte<\/span>: Dueling Parry is a great\n\t\tchoice, especially compared to a third attack. This makes that even better.\n\t\tThe Fighter is a Defender, which means that they&#8217;re typically standing\n\t\tbetween their allies and their enemies and drawing the bulk of their\n\t\tenemies&#8217; attacks. The Fighter also has the second-best armor proficiency in\n\t\tthe game (behind only the Champion), which means that your AC should be high\n\t\tenough to keep you alive. Together, that means that you have ample\n\t\topportunities to trigger this <em>and<\/em> you&#8217;re more likely to trigger the\n\t\tReaction any time you&#8217;re attacked. Unlike Attack of Opportunity, Twin\n\t\tRiposte does not include clarifying text that says how the Multiple Attack\n\t\tPenalty works with Twin Riposte, but the rules for Multiple Attack Penalties\n\t\tare clear: Multiple Attack Penalties don&#8217;t apply outside of your own\n\t\tturn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Felling Strike<\/span>: With no built-in magic\n\t\toptions, flying enemies are a serious problem for the Fighter. This doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire any specific type of Strike, so you can do something as simple as\n\t\tthrowing a rock. You won&#8217;t need this all the time since not all enemies fly,\n\t\tbut an easy, reliable counter to an extremely common problem is a great\n\t\ttool.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incredible Aim<\/span>: Situational. Usually\n\t\tusing Triple Strike will work out better on average.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mobile Shot Stance<\/span>: The ability to make\n\t\tAttacks of Opportunity with a bow is worth the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Positioning Assault<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Shield Block<\/span>: If you use a shield,\n\t\tyou absolutely need this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resounding Bravery<\/span>: The effect is really\n\t\ttempting. Unfortunately, it requires that you make a Will save (one of three\n\t\ttypes of saves, and almost certainly your worst one) and critically succeed\n\t\ton that save to enjoy the benefits. So even in the rare cases where you&#8217;re\n\t\ttargeted with an appropriate effect, you have a very small chance to\n\t\tcritically succeed on the save and therefore an absolutely miniscule change\n\t\tof getting the benefits of the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sudden Leap<\/span>: If you&#8217;re facing a flying\n\t\tenemy, switch to a ranged weapon. If you insist on using this, be sure to\n\t\tinvest Skill Increases in Athletics to improve your jumps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Agile Grace<\/span>: Essential for TWF users and\n\t\tfinesse fighters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Certain Strike<\/span>: You&#8217;re guaranteed your\n\t\tStrength bonus bonus to damage and similar bonuses, but that&#8217;s not enough.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s better than a plain Strike, but it&#8217;s still not great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: If your GM lets enemies\n\t\ttrigger Attack of Opportunity frequently, this is absolutely worth a feat.\n\t\tIf your GM makes creatures run up to you and stand still, this won&#8217;t get\n\t\tmuch use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cut from the Air<\/span>: Too situational. Enemies\n\t\twhich rely on physical ranged strikes are a tiny minority. The bonus is\n\t\texcellent, and using it as a Reaction is great, but there simply aren&#8217;t\n\t\tenough enemy archers at this level to justify the feat. If you are facing\n\t\tenemy archers, you can use Improved Combat Flexibility to pick this up\n\t\ttemporarily.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Debilitating Shot<\/span>: Against big single\n\t\tfoes, this may be more useful than dealing a pile of damage with Triple\n\t\tShot. You&#8217;ll need to rely on your allies to capitalize on the enemy&#8217;s\n\t\treduced actions, so hopefully you&#8217;re not the only one in the party dealing\n\t\tbig piles of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disarming Twist<\/span>: Situational because not\n\t\tevery enemy uses a weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disruptive Stance<\/span>: Activate to murder\n\t\tspellcasters. They may still be able to Step out of your reach, so consider\n\t\tusing a reach weapon to keep them in your reach if spellcasters are a\n\t\tfrequent opponent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fearsome Brute<\/span>: Potentially excellent if\n\t\tyou have Intimidating Strike, or if your party has other options to frighten\n\t\tenemies. Consider the Battle Cry skill feat, and encourage allies to use\n\t\tspells that cause fear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Knockdown<\/span>: Skipping the\n\t\tAthletics check to trip the target makes Knockdown dramatically more\n\t\treliable, and it means that you&#8217;re not strictly required to put Skill\n\t\tIncreases into Athletics. The critical success effect on a trip deals 1d6\n\t\tdamage, and improving that do a d12 isn&#8217;t a huge improvement so don&#8217;t stress\n\t\tabout not using a two-handed weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mirror Shield<\/span>: Too situational, and as soon\n\t\tas you use it once the enemy will switch to targeting your allies or casting\n\t\tAOE spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Overpowering Charge<\/span>: Turn Barreling\n\t\tCharge into a damaging line effect. Neat, but unless enemies are tightly\n\t\tpacked in small quarters you&#8217;ll do more total damage by swinging a\n\t\tweapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Twin Riposte<\/span>: Great for all the same\n\t\treasons that Dueling Riposte is great.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brutal Finish<\/span>: A spectacular follow-up to\n\t\tPower Attack. Two actions on Power Attack (which counts as two Strikes for\n\t\tthe Multiple Attack Penalty), then follow up with Brutal Finish to end your\n\t\tturn. You&#8217;ll probably miss with the -10 Multiple Attack Penalty, but the\n\t\tFailure effect on Brutal Finish guarantees you a bit of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling Dance<\/span>: If you&#8217;re built for a\n\t\tsingle weapon and a free hand, this is basically required. One action gets\n\t\tyou +2 to AC for the rest of a fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flinging Shove<\/span>: Increasing the range on a\n\t\tsuccess is fun, but the biggest appeal is that you still Shove the target 5\n\t\tfeet on a failure. That&#8217;s usually enough to force an enemy far enough away\n\t\tthat they can&#8217;t reach you with additional attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Dueling Riposte<\/span>: You no longer\n\t\tneed to give up a possible Attack of Opportunity to riposte, and if you&#8217;re\n\t\textremely lucky you might even be able to Riposte twice!<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incredible Ricochet<\/span>: Tempting,\n\t\tespecially in cases where Incredible Aim applies, but those situations are\n\t\tinfrequent and you&#8217;re making this attack at the usual Multiple Attack\n\t\tPenalty and without Incredible Aim&#8217;s +2 attack bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lunging Stance<\/span>: Absolutely spectacular. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not already using a Stance feat regularly, this is a great option. If\n\t\tyou combine this with a reach weapon, you can effectively control a 15-foot\n\t\tradius sphere. If you have Combat Reflexes, you may be able to make multiple\n\t\tattacks of opportunity agains the same target as it moves through your\n\t\treach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Paragon&#8217;s Guard<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using a shield,\n\t\tthis is an absolute must. Spending the action every turn to Raise a Shield\n\t\tcuts into time you should be spending doing other stuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spring Attack<\/span>: This is a badly-written\n\t\tfeat. It requires that you be adjacent to one enemy, and since Spring Attack\n\t\thas the Press trait you must make a Strike before using it. So you spend at\n\t\tleast one Action to Strike the first target, then move to a second target\n\t\tand make another Strike. If the first creature can make an Attack of\n\t\tOpportunity, Spring Attack does nothing to prevent it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Desperate Finisher<\/span>: Nearly every fighter\n\t\thas a good Press feat available. If you&#8217;re unlikely to use your Reaction in\n\t\tthe next round (maybe you fight at range or something), or if you have an\n\t\textra Reaction from something like Combat Reflexes, spending your Reaction\n\t\tto do more on your own turn is a great idea. A Press feat will typically be\n\t\tmore interesting than the basic Strike granted by an Attack of Opportunity,\n\t\tbut keep in mind that you still suffer the normal Multiple Attack Penalty,\n\t\twhich is like -10 at this point in your turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Determination<\/span>: Essentially a second save\n\t\tagainst a problematic ongoing effect. It&#8217;s based on your Will save, which is\n\t\tprobably your worst save, but it&#8217;s still helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guiding Finish<\/span>: Situational. Unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re trying to force an enemy into place to be flanked, or to put them\n\t\tsomewhere dangerous, this isn&#8217;t helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guiding Riposte<\/span>: Basically the same as\n\t\tGuiding Finish. I wouldn&#8217;t take both.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Twin Riposte<\/span>: Great for all the\n\t\treasons that Improved Dueling Riposte is great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stance Savant<\/span>: Activating a Stance\n\t\tnormally only costs one action, which usually isn&#8217;t a huge problem. However,\n\t\tmore actions early in a fight is always a significant advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Two-Weapon Flurry<\/span>: Absolutely essential\n\t\tfor fighting with two weapons, but it&#8217;s both a Press and a Flourish, so you\n\t\tcan only use it once per round, and you can only use it after you&#8217;ve already\n\t\tattacked. It works with Desperate Finisher, but you can still only use it\n\t\tonce per turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Whirlwind Strike<\/span>: Great with a reach\n\t\tweapon, but I don&#8217;t know if I would use it otherwise. Three actions means\n\t\tthat you need to be in position the turn before, which can be hard to\n\t\taccomplish unless you&#8217;re in a fight with numerous enemies. You get to make\n\t\tevery attack before applying a Multiple Attack Penalty, which is really\n\t\tsatisfying if you can make a whole bunch of attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Graceful Poise<\/span>: Essential for a two-weapon\n\t\tfighter. Reducing your Multiple Attack Penalty means a big boost for\n\t\tTwo-Weapon Flurry.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Reflexive Shield<\/span>: Potentially\n\t\texcellent, but technically situational. Your job is to keep dangerous stuff\n\t\taway from your frail allies. If your frail allies are adjacent to you,\n\t\tthey&#8217;re too close to dangerous stuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Multishot Stance<\/span>: Archers typically don&#8217;t\n\t\tneed to move once they&#8217;re well-positioned anyway, and the attack penalty\n\t\treduction is significant when applied to three attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Overwhelming Blow<\/span>: High risk, high\n\t\treward. If you hit, you&#8217;ll deal an absolutely massive amount of damage. If\n\t\tyou miss, you&#8217;re in trouble. Either way, you&#8217;re done with your turn and you\n\t\tlose an Action on your next turn. If you do use this, look for ways to get\n\t\tbonuses to your attack roll like Aid or Guidance, and consider using a Hero\n\t\tPoint.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Twinned Defense<\/span>: Absolutely essential for\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impossible Volley<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using a\n\t\tlongbow, this is basically Whirlwind Attack at range. Whirlwind Attack is\n\t\tfantastic, but since it costs three actions it&#8217;s difficult to position\n\t\tyourself for it to be useful. Since this works anywhere outside your\n\t\t&#8220;volley&#8221; range (30 ft. for a longbow) and out to your maximum range (600 ft.\n\t\tfor a Longbow), you can target groups of enemies at extremely long range.\n\t\tYou still suffer range penalties, you take a -2 penalty to each of the\n\t\tattacks, and Multishot Stance doesn&#8217;t apply, but if you can get more than\n\t\tthree attacks this is almost certainly going to deal more damage on average\n\t\tthan Triple Shot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Savage Critical<\/span>: More critical hits is\n\t\talways great, and you&#8217;ve been Legendary with simple\/martial weapons in one\n\t\tweapon group since 13th level. You still need to hit on a d20 roll of 19,\n\t\tbut if a high-level fighter can&#8217;t hit on a 19 your problem isn&#8217;t the enemy&#8217;s\n\t\tAC. Anything like concealment or a miss chance of some sort can still\n\t\tprevent this just like it would prevent hitting on a natural 20. This\n\t\tnotably makes weapons with the Fatal trait much more effective, but at level\n\t\t18 you may be attached to whatever you&#8217;ve been swinging about for 17 levels,\n\t\tso unless you&#8217;re already using a Fatal weapon I don&#8217;t expect you to suddely\n\t\tdevelop a fondness for picks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Smash from the Air<\/span>: Expands Cut From the\n\t\tAir to work against spell attacks. Conceptually neat, but most spellcasters\n\t\twill just switch to spells which don&#8217;t require attack rolls and then your\n\t\t18th-level feat is worthless. You might consider this with Ultimate\n\t\tFlexibility if you&#8217;re facing enemy spellcasters, but I would never commit a\n\t\tpermanent feat to this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Fighter-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boundless Reprisals<\/span>: Fighters can do a lot\n\t\twith Reactions, and there a number of wonderful Fighter Class Feats that\n\t\toffer you a single additional Reaction which you can use for a specific type\n\t\tof Reaction. This adds an additional Reaction not once per round, but once\n\t\tfor <em>each enemy turn<\/em>. That means that you can make an Attack of\n\t\tOpportunity or any other Reaction at least once on each enemy&#8217;s turn,\n\t\tallowing you to make Attacks of Opportunity nearly whenever you want, Shield\n\t\tBlock nearly every attack, Riposte nearly every critical miss, or any number\n\t\tof other wonderful things. If you picked up Desperate Finisher, you&#8217;re much\n\t\tmore free to spend your normal Reaction to get more out of your turn,\n\t\tconfident in the knowledge that you&#8217;ll get at least one Reaction on each\n\t\tenemy&#8217;s turn.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ultimate Flexibility<\/span>: Spending an hour to\n\t\tretrain three feats isn&#8217;t likely to happen between every encounter, but the\n\t\tability to change a chunk of your build a few times per day is a massive\n\t\tadvantage. All of the Fighter Class Feats with weird, situational use cases\n\t\tsuddenly become a part of your massive toolbox, allowing you to adjust your\n\t\tfighter to be the perfect response to any combat scenario that you can\n\t\tforesee. The biggest problem with this feat is anticipating what you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing to face on any given day, so forewarned is forearmed. Get very\n\t\tcomfortable with your party&#8217;s Scout and with anyone who can cast Divination\n\t\tspells. Even a hint at what you&#8217;ll be facing will dramatically improve this\n\t\tfeat&#8217;s effectiveness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Supremacy<\/span>: An extra action is\n\t\talways great, but you can only use it to make a Strike action, which isn&#8217;t\n\t\tvery exciting and will frequently be made at a -10 maximum Multiple Attack\n\t\tPenalty. This does buy you more flexibility to spend your Actions on other\n\t\tthings (Step, Demoralize, Raise a Shield, etc.), but it&#8217;s up to you to make\n\t\tsure that you can capitalize on your expanded action economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Diehard<\/span>: Fighters are the front line of\n\t\tmost parties, so you&#8217;re going to take a lot of damage, and as a result you\n\t\tmay find yourself dropping to 0 hit points frequently. I would pick up\n\t\toptions like Toughness first, but if you have a General Feat to spend you\n\t\tcould do much worse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fleet<\/span>: Offset the speed penalty from\n\t\theavy armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Incredible Initiative<\/span>: Going first is\n\t\talways great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ride<\/span>: If you&#8217;re fighting while mounted,\n\t\tyou want to have this. Rolling checks every turn to command your mount gets\n\t\tannoying very quickly, and failing makes you feel really silly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toughness<\/span>: Fighters already get a lot of\n\t\thit points, but they also take a lot of damage so you want as many as you\n\t\tcan possibly get.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of weapons needs to line up with your Class Feat choices. If you&#8217;re running around with a longbow, Power Attack won&#8217;t help you. Expect to pick a single weapon that will be your weapon of choice unless a magic item comes along that justifies switching. In some cases you can change your type of weapon with little effort (battleaxe to longsword isn&#8217;t a big change), but in other cases you may need to retrain a long list of feats to change weapons effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-archery\">Archery Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of weapon as an archer comes down to two decision points. First, will your Strength score be 14 or higher? If so (and there&#8217;s little reason why it shouldn&#8217;t), get a composite bow. Second, you need to consider the range at which you&#8217;ll be fighting. Shortbows work better within 30 ft. because they aren&#8217;t Volley weapons, but in every other case longbows are better. At low levels you can switch between bows easily, but at high levels when you have magic weapons you won&#8217;t want to drop your +2 Greater Striking Longbow to use a mundane shortbow just because and enemy is only 25 ft. away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crossbows are worthless. Ignore their existence.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-single-weapon\">Single-Weapon Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Single-Weapon builds are a lot of fun, and enable things like holding shields, pushing, and grappling with your free hand. Your first though might be a nimble, high-dexterity fencer, but that&#8217;s definitely not your only option. Even high-Dexterity fighters still need high Strength for the bonus damage, so your Strength and Dexterity scores will rarely be more than 2 apart, and a Strength-based single-weapon build may actually be more effective in some ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the weapon traits which you find valuable, as they&#8217;re often more important than your weapon&#8217;s damage die. The gap between a rapier&#8217;s d6 and a longsword&#8217;s d8 isn&#8217;t significant, even when you&#8217;re rolling multiple dice. Agile is great if you plan to make numerous attacks, but if you&#8217;re relying on options like Power Attack, you don&#8217;t need to worry about Agile. Try to get an idea of what feats you want to take as you gain levels, and choose a weapon which works will with those feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some examples of good weapons and feats you could use to maximize their effectiveness:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Axe \/ Longsword \/ Pick \/ Warhammer<\/span>: Simple, go-to weapons. The d8 damage die is geat, and Power Attack\n\t\tpresents a significant damage boost, especially at low levels. The Battle\n\t\tAxe&#8217;s Sweep property is helpful against multiple foes, especially if you\n\t\tplan to use Swipe. Longswords are Versatile, which makes it easier to deal\n\t\twith enemy damage resistances. Picks have Fatal, which is like deadly but\n\t\tmore lethal (those are all synonyms), so if you&#8217;re trying to get lots of\n\t\tcritical hits it&#8217;s great. Warhammers have the Shove property, which is\n\t\thelpful if you want to Shove but don&#8217;t have a free hand.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bastard Sword \/ Dwarven Waraxe<\/span>: If you\n\t\tplan to primarily fight two-handed but want the ability to use a free hand\n\t\tfor stuff like shoving, the Bastard Sword and Dwarven War Axe are your best\n\t\toptions. You can also use options like Dual-Handed Assault to get the\n\t\tbenefits of a d12 damage die while still maintaining a free hand. The\n\t\tDwarven War Axe adds the Sweep property, but is otherwise identical to the\n\t\tBastard Sword, so go for the Dwarven War Axe if it&#8217;s convenient to do\n\t\tso.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flail<\/span>: By no means a bad weapon, but you\n\t\tneed to be willing to put mental effort into capitalizing on special\n\t\tmaneuvers in combat to make it useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome Flickmace \/ Whip<\/span>: Reach on a\n\t\tone-handed weapon is a huge advantage. You get the most important part of a\n\t\tpolearm, but you can also use your other hand for things like a shield. The\n\t\tGnome Flickmace has a bigger damage die and doesn&#8217;t have the Nonlethal\n\t\ttrait, but otherwise the whip is a much better weapon due to its numerous\n\t\tuseful traits. Unfortunately, some creatures are immune to nonlethal damage,\n\t\tso the whip isn&#8217;t always a safe bet. If you&#8217;re building to make attacks of\n\t\topportunity, consider either a flickmace or a whip, and look at feats like\n\t\tCombat Reflexes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Katana<\/span>: Similar in many ways to the\n\t\trapier, but it&#8217;s an Advanced Weapon so you&#8217;re either spending a feat or\n\t\tlosing attack bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapier<\/span>: The go-to for Dexterity-based\n\t\tmelee builds, but by no means a perfect weapon. Deadly is great, but likely\n\t\twon&#8217;t close the damage gap between d6 and d8, and disarm is only\n\t\tsituationally useful. Finesse is nice at low levels, but your Dexterity and\n\t\tStrength will rarely be more than 2 apart so it&#8217;s not a significant boost to\n\t\tyour attack bonus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-two-handed\">Two-Handed Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There are two good reasons to use a two-handed weapon: reach, and big damage dice. No one-handed weapon has a damage die larger than 1d8, and no one-handed weapons have reach without also having a handicap like the Nonlethal trait or being an Advanced weapon. Two-handed weapons frequently have interesting traits like Backswing and Forceful, but otherwise they&#8217;re not much different from one-handed weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elven Curve Blade<\/span>: I can&#8217;t think of a case\n\t\twhere the Elven Curve Blade is better than a Falchion. Maybe for an elf\n\t\trogue with the Elven Weapon Familiarity feat? For the Fighter, it&#8217;s\n\t\tbasically a worse Falchion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Falchion<\/span>: If you&#8217;re planning to rely on\n\t\tmultiple attacks every turn, the Falchion can be good. Swipe in particular\n\t\tworks very well with the Falchion. The 1d10 damage die is smaller than other\n\t\toptions, but the bonus damage from Forceful is very effective if you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing something like Swipe to make multiple attacks before your Multiple\n\t\tAttack Penalty applies. Otherwise, stick to weapons with a larger damage die\n\t\tlike the Greataxe and Greatsword.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greataxe<\/span>: Simple and straight to the\n\t\tpoint, the Greataxe has a big damage die and Sweep so it works well with\n\t\tPower Attack for single enemies and Swipe with multiple enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greatclub \/ Maul<\/span>: Backswing is a bad\n\t\ttrait, and Shove isn&#8217;t good enough to make these viable on its own.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greatsword \/ Halberd<\/span>: Basic, generic\n\t\toptions that have Versatile instead of something interesting. If you don&#8217;t\n\t\tplan to use special maneuvers like Trip or Shove, go for one of these.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Guisarme \/ Ranseur<\/span>: Reach and you can use\n\t\tthem for a special maneuver. I prefer Trip over Disarm, personally.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Horsechopper<\/span>: Low damage die for a\n\t\ttwo-handed weapon, but you get Reach, Trip, and Versatile on a single\n\t\tweapon. I consider it on par with the Guisarme, but I wouldn&#8217;t go to great\n\t\tlengths to find one.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">War Flail \/ Spiked Chain<\/span>: Like the Flail,\n\t\tthe War Flail and the Spiked Chain emphasize special maneuvers like\n\t\tdisarming and tripping over raw damage. The War Flail is the better option:\n\t\tSpiked Chain reduces the damage die and loses Sweep in favor of Finesse.\n\t\tFinesse is most likely no more than +1 to attacks if you&#8217;re maximizing your\n\t\tDexterity, and you need high Strength to Disarm and Trip successfully\n\t\tanyway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-two-weapon\">Two-Weapon Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Two-weapon builds have twice as much room to choose weapons, but you also need to spend more money to enhance those weapons. You also need to consider how the two weapons interact with each other, and with the feats you plan to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, you&#8217;ll be using two different weapons: a larger primary weapon like a longsword and a smaller Agile weapon like a dagger. Double Slice is your defining class feat at low levels, so having an Agile second weapon is crucial. You have more flexibility with your primary weapon; see Single-weapon builds, above, but keep in mind that you have two weapons which might support things like Disarm and Trip, so you may want to spread those capabilities across your weapons if you plan to use them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to pick up a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=1221\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=1221\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blazons of Shared Power<\/a><sup>GaG<\/sup> to dramatically reduce the cost of putting magic on both of your weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dagger \/ Starknife<\/span>: The Starknife is\n\t\tjust a better dagger, so there&#8217;s little reason to use a dagger except as a\n\t\tbackup weapon. The Starknife&#8217;s damage isn&#8217;t as good as a shortsword, and\n\t\tDeadly isn&#8217;t enough to close that gap, but the ability to throw it is\n\t\ttempting so it&#8217;s worth considering as your second weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dogslicer \/ Filcher\u2019s fork<\/span>: Similar to\n\t\tother weapons, but notably the Dogslicer and Filcher&#8217;s Fork add Backstabber.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s a bit of extra damage, but without something like Twin Feint to\n\t\tguarantee a flat-footed target I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worth a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clan Dagger \/ Main-gauche<\/span>: Much like the\n\t\tStarknife, the Clan Dagger and Main-gauche are upgraded daggers, adding the\n\t\tParry trait. Giving up a shield means reduced AC, but with a Parry weapon\n\t\tyou can spend an Action for a +1 Circumstance bonus to AC, making up some of\n\t\tthe gap. If you take Twin Parry at 4th level, this bonus increases to +2 to\n\t\tmatch the bonus from a shield. Even with an Agile weapon, your third attack\n\t\tis still made at -8, so spending your third Action to defend yourself is\n\t\tfrequently a better idea than attempting another Strike. The difference\n\t\tbetween the Clan Dagger and the Main-gauche is Versatile or Disarm. Disarm\n\t\tis situational because monsters don&#8217;t typically use weapons, but the Clan\n\t\tDagger is Uncommon so it&#8217;s not available to most characters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gauntlet \/ Spiked Gauntlet<\/span>: Not a lot of\n\t\tdamage, but combine the best parts of two-weapon fighting and dueling\n\t\tbuilds. A free hand allows you perform special maneuvers like Disarm and\n\t\tTrip, though admittedly you won&#8217;t get the item bonus to the check that you\n\t\twould from a weapon designed for that maneuver. You may also be able to make\n\t\tuse of the dueling feats like Dueling Parry and Dueling Riposte, which are\n\t\tavailable two levels before the comparable Two-Weapon Fighting feats and\n\t\tfrequently have the same effect. At the very least, a gauntlet is a great\n\t\tbackup weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hatchet<\/span>: Agile, throwable, and 1d6\n\t\tdamage. It has Sweep, too, so if you switch to another target your third\n\t\tStrike in a turn will only be at a total penalty of -7.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sawtooth Saber<\/span>: Tailor-made for\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting, the Sawtooth Saber is the only published weapon with\n\t\tthe Twin property. Twin adds some extra damage to your second attack, which\n\t\tis great motivation to make more attacks each turn. The Sawtooth Saber also\n\t\thas the Agile trait, which is absolutely crucial for Double Slice. However,\n\t\tbecause the Sawtooth Saber is an Advanced Weapon your proficiency bonus will\n\t\tlag behind other weapons unless your take Advanced Weapon training at 6th\n\t\tlevel, and I don&#8217;t know if the tiny bit of extra damage is worth a class\n\t\tfeat when there are comparable options like the shortsword.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortsword<\/span>: Reliable and uncomplicated.\n\t\t1d6 damage and versatile, so if all you need is damage you&#8217;re good to\n\t\tgo.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-sword-and-board\">Sword-and-Board Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>See Single-Weapon Builds, above.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t use light armor. Armor specialization effects don&#8217;t apply to light armor, and your AC goes up by 1 with every armor tier. Even if you&#8217;re an archer, it&#8217;s easy (and smart) to have enough Strength to not be impeded by heavy armor. However, Dexterity-based characters should avoid Full Plate because the Bulkwark trait may actually <em>reduce<\/em> your bonus to Reflex Saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Alchemist<\/span>: Mutagens are a tempting buff,\n\t\tand other alchemical items can give you a lot of utility and support\n\t\toptions. It&#8217;s easy to avoid options which require high Intelligence, and you\n\t\twon&#8217;t get much from most Alchemist Class Feats, so you&#8217;re probably fine with\n\t\tAlchemist Dedication, Expert Alchemy, and Master Alchemy. Infused Reagents\n\t\tyou can create enough free items to get you through the day and still have\n\t\tplenty of reagents left over for a few bombs and elixers. Alchemical bombs\n\t\tare a martial weapon, so you get your usual proficiency bonus to attacks and\n\t\tyour Weapon Specialization damage bonuses with them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Barbarian<\/span>: Rage is a significant buff for\n\t\ta melee fighter. You have enough AC to absorb the AC penalty, and the\n\t\ttemporary hit points should make up the difference anyway. There are only\n\t\ttwo Fighter Class Feats with the Concentrate trait, and they&#8217;re\n\t\tarchery-related so you won&#8217;t use them with Rage anyway. If you&#8217;re building\n\t\tto emphasize Intimidation, consider the Raging Intimidation feat. Avoid the\n\t\tFury instinct since it doesn&#8217;t have an Instinct Ability<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bard<\/span>: Bards are Charisma-based, and most of\n\t\tthe options available to you involve spellcasting. You might be able to make\n\t\tuse of options like Inspire Courage, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s good enough to\n\t\tput the points into 14 Charisma and then spend a class feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Champion<\/span>: Champion&#8217;s Reaction is really\n\t\tgood, but it might conflict with your other Reaction options like Attack of\n\t\tOpportunity. The biggest benefit is probably access to Focus Spells like Lay\n\t\ton Hands which will scale with your level without further investment. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going for a mounted build, you might like Divine Ally to get an\n\t\tanimal Companion, but you can also get an animal companion from the Druid or\n\t\tthe Ranger so that shouldn&#8217;t be the only thing you want from the Champion if\n\t\tyou choose to multiclass.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: Clerics have a surprisingly\n\t\tlarge amount to offer martial classes like the Champion and the Fighter. The\n\t\tdedication feat doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of proficiencies, but the\n\t\tDivine spell list&#8217;s cantrips include great options like Guidance (easy +1 on\n\t\tbasically anything whenever you want it, with a cooldown) and Shield\n\t\t(no-hand Shield Block with a cooldown, but works great if you don&#8217;t use a\n\t\tshield). Domain Initiate gives you a Focus Pool and access to several useful\n\t\tdomain spells depending on your choice of deity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid<\/span>: If you want spellcasting, I think\n\t\tthat the Cleric makes more sense. If you want Focus Spells, I think the\n\t\tChampion makes more sense. If you want an Animal Companion, the Ranger\n\t\toffers the same options, plus other feats that cater to the Fighter&#8217;s\n\t\tmartial capabilities. There are some amusing things that you can do with\n\t\tWild Shape and related feats, but sticking to weapons will typically be more\n\t\teffective and you would need to invest a significant number of class feats\n\t\tto make those options worthwhile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monk<\/span>: With the right stance feat your\n\t\tunarmed strikes are as good as some two-handed weapons, but remember that\n\t\tsome stances require you to be unarmored. You can combine many of the Monk&#8217;s\n\t\tcapabilities with Fighter Class Feats which are usually intended for fencing\n\t\tbuilds. Monastic Weaponry gets you access to interesting options like\n\t\tShuriken, a well as several melee options like the Kama and the Sai, both of\n\t\twhich are potential candidates for two-weapon fighting builds. Monks&#8217; Flurry\n\t\tgets you access to Flurry of Blows, but remember that it&#8217;s a Flourish so you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t combine it with things like Double Shot or Two-Weapon Flurry. There&#8217;s\n\t\ta lot to capitalize on here.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ranger<\/span>: A good option for archers and\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting builds. Disrupt Prey is easy to miss, but it essentially\n\t\tadds another version of Attack of Opportunity that you can use against your\n\t\tPrey which can also disrupt some actions. You can also get an Animal\n\t\tCompanion, which is crucial for mounted builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get to choose a Racket,\n\t\twhich dramatically limits your Rogue Class Feat options, but there are still\n\t\ta few gems. You&#8217;re Next and Dread Striker are great for Intimidation\n\t\tenthusiasts. Quick Draw is absolutely required for thrown weapon builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Sorcerer feats are almost\n\t\texclusively related to casting spells. If you want spellcasting, nearly any\n\t\tother option will work just as well and they&#8217;ll all offer other useful\n\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wizard<\/span>: All the same issues as the\n\t\tSorcerer. You might be able to get some use out of some school spells like\n\t\tProtective ward, but they&#8217;re not good enough to justify two class feats when\n\t\tother, better options are widely available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The master of arms and armor, the Fighter is an iconic class dating back to the earliest editions of Dungeons and Dragons. Despite being one of few classes in Pathfinder with no access to magic, the Fighter is still a powerful and versatile class capable of being a terrifying and powerful force in combat. The Fighter is at their best in combat, where their capabilities truly shine. The Fighter has fewer skills than most classes and terribly few utility options, but in a fight the Fighter is versatile, capable, and often surprising.
