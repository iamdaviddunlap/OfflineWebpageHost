While you can play a character however you like, these undertones are built into the class mechanics, with a resource that refuels when anything around the Phantom dies. Managing this resource properly, the Phantom can do plenty of extra damage very consistently. The only unfortunate part of this is that Phantoms do not get this kill recharging ability until ninth level. Until then, we\u2019re still a Rogue, trying to get our Sneak Attacks in when we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of party roles, Phantom doesn\u2019t alter the Rogue\u2019s primary purpose. The features of Phantom instead amplify the damage output role of the Rogue as long as combats involve more than one foe. Out of combat, the Phantom is an interesting mirror to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/soulknife\/\">Soulknife<\/a>. Where the Soulknife is able to push the upper limits of the skills it knows, the Phantom instead can alter the skills it knows with a little preparation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Rogues can feel a bit similar as far as builds, our example explores flavor and style without sacrificing our damage. The build is designed to be one who reaps souls in the name of the Raven Queen, enforcing mortality on those who would dare run from death. Yes it\u2019s kinda super edgy and on the nose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Phantom Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#phantom-ability-scores\">Phantom Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#phantom-races\">Phantom Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#phantom-feats\">Phantom Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#phantom-weapons\">Phantom Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#phantom-armor\">Phantom Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-phantom-build-cant-defeat-her-so-instead-ill-have-to-be-her\">Example Phantom Build &#8211; Can\u2019t defeat Her, so instead I\u2019ll have to be Her<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

If you can combine\n\t\tthis with other buffs like Enhance Ability and Guidance, you can get around\n\t\tnearly any skill-based or tool-based challenge if you have time to prepare.\n\t\t<p>Most of the time you can leave this on a low-importance skill\n\t\t\tproficiency, but most tools won&#8217;t come up unless you&#8217;ve got time for a\n\t\t\tshort rest. No one is going to ambush you and ask you to break out the\n\t\t\tBrewer&#8217;s Tools and make them some beer (I&#8217;ve made beer. It takes a few\n\t\t\thours, and spending one hour to take a nap first isn&#8217;t a big ask. I&#8217;ve\n\t\t\tdone that, too.).<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wails from the Grave<\/span>: Starts very slow\n\t\t(1d6 twice a day), but ramps up exponentially as your Sneak Attack damage\n\t\tand your Proficiency Bonus increase. The damage is necrotic, which is rarely\n\t\tresisted, and it&#8217;s automatic provided that you made a successful Sneak\n\t\tAttack so it&#8217;s great for enemies that may be difficult to hit. Even as it\n\t\tgains in power, you don&#8217;t want to throw this around needlessly. You&#8217;ll never\n\t\tget more than 6 uses (not counting Tokens of the Departed) and they&#8217;ll never\n\t\tdeal more than 5d6 damage, so you need to be strategic.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tokens of the Departed<\/span>: I love everything\n\t\tabout this feature. The theme is cool, the mechanic is fun, the resource\n\t\tpool is appropriately limited but easy to restore, and the benefits are fun,\n\t\tthematically appropriate, and really good. You get three benefits at level\n\t\t9, but at level 13 you can recharge Ghost Walk with a trinket and at level\n\t\t17 you wake up from longs rests with a free soul tinket.\n\t\t<p>The first benefit is without doubt the best of the three, and it&#8217;s good\n\t\t\tenough that you should nearly always keep a Soul Trinket handy. Advantage\n\t\t\ton Constitution saves isn&#8217;t quite as good as proficiency, but it&#8217;s close.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, the Phantom doesn&#8217;t need to worry about Concentration\n\t\t\tunless you take Magic Initiate or Multiclass, so you don&#8217;t get to wave\n\t\t\tyour token around every time you cast a Concentration spell.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The second benefit helps with Wails of the Grave, and it&#8217;s easily your\n\t\t\tmost frequent way to spend trinkets. Wails from the Grave is a decent bit\n\t\t\tof damage by this level, matching what a spellcaster can do with many\n\t\t\tcantrips. However, the Proficiency Bonus usage limit won&#8217;t get you far, so\n\t\t\tyou can destroy a trinket to get a free bit of damage. Every time you\n\t\t\tthink &#8220;is a new trinket worth my Reaction right now?&#8221;, remember that it&#8217;s\n\t\t\ta small pile of easy necrotic damage when you need it later.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The third benefit is basically Speak with Dead, but you only get one\n\t\t\tquestion. Otherwise, it has all the same problems where the subject can be\n\t\t\tvague, misleading, or otherwise unhelpful. Very situational, but if you\n\t\t\tcan somehow make it work it&#8217;s excellent. This also has a curious edge case\n\t\t\twhere the creature which allowed you to produce the token might be alive\n\t\t\tagain, especially in cases where your allies die and a raised from the\n\t\t\tdead. You might use this to ask a question of a creature who is currently\n\t\t\talive, leading to hilarious situations where the ghostly apparition of a\n\t\t\tliving creature appears in the same room as that creature only to say\n\t\t\tsomething totally unhelpful before disappearing.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The one flaw in the whole thing is that it falls prey to the classic &#8220;Bag\n\t\t\tof Rats&#8221; trick. You can kill any creature to generate a new Soul Trinket,\n\t\t\tso if you have a bag of rats or access to other easily-expendable\n\t\t\tcreatures, you can kill them out of combat to recharge. Your DM might\n\t\t\tjustifiably make some adjustments to disallow that (requiring a CR above 0\n\t\t\tmay be sufficient, especially at 9th level), so try not to lean on the\n\t\t\tabuse case too much. This generally won&#8217;t work with summoned creatures\n\t\t\t(they need to die, not just be reduced to 0 hit points), and since death\n\t\t\tand being reduced to 0 hp suddenly mean different things, I encourage DMs\n\t\t\tto start tracking death saves for enemies.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghost Walk<\/span>: A 1-minute duration on this\n\t\twould be good. A 10-minute duration on this is fantastic. 10 minutes is\n\t\tobviously plenty if you&#8217;re using this in combat, but it&#8217;s more important\n\t\toutside of combat where you might need to move through walls, floors, or\n\t\tceilings while scouting. The 10 ft. move speed is tiny, but remember that\n\t\tyou have Cunning Action so you can Dash as a Bonus Action. If you can get\n\t\tbuffs like Longstrider, they&#8217;ll do a lot to help both because any flat\n\t\tnumeric increase is relatively large compared to 10 ft. and because you can\n\t\tessentially double the effect by dashing without spending your Action.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Death\u2019s Friend<\/span>: At this level Wails of\n\t\tthe Grave deals 4d6 damage, just short of its maximum at 6d6. Adding that\n\t\tdamage to your primary target when you use Wails of the Grave means that\n\t\tyour Sneak Attack deals 50% more damage, though it&#8217;s not clear if you can\n\t\tmultiply the damage on a critical hit. I believe that you can&#8217;t because the\n\t\tdamage is applied to the target from a separate source rather than added to\n\t\tthe damage of original attack like effects like Divine Smite.\n\t\t<p>The second benefit of this feature ensures that you have at least one\n\t\t\tSoul Trinket at the end of a Long Rest. This is a crucial benefit so that\n\t\t\tyou can benefit from Advantage on your Constitution saves, so try not to\n\t\t\tburn your trinket the first time you want to use Wail of Souls. But since\n\t\t\tyou get the trinket for free, this also makes it easier to spend your last\n\t\t\ttrinket right before you take a long rest. Of course, you could just use\n\t\t\tthe bag of rats trick to get free Soul Trinkets, so this benefit isn&#8217;t as\n\t\t\timpactful as WotC wanted it to be when they wrote it.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"phantom-ability-scores\">Phantom Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Phantom is a typical Rogue and wants typical Rogue stats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: While there is technically a case for Athletics and possibly some tools, those are very niche options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: AC, Attack Rolls, Stealth, Other stuff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Don\u2019t die please.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: For Scholarly skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: For Explorer skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: For Face skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Phantoms have a floating skill proficiency and we\u2019re not in urgent need of any of the mental stats, when using point buy we can bump two to 10 and the third to 13 to remove any penalties and open up potential multiclassing minimums.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Standard Array<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>10 (13)<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>13 (10)<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>10 (13)<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"phantom-races\">Phantom Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Consult the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/races\/\">Rogue Race Breakdown<\/a>, nothing changes in what we need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wood Elf<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The standard Elf traits and access to Elven Accuracy combine well with a set of weapon proficiencies that can be traded in to expand Rogue options and an extra 5 feet of walking speed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"phantom-feats\">Phantom Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Phantom\u2019s subclass features don&#8217;t change what we want from the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#feats\">Rogue Handbook Feats.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"phantom-weapons\">Phantom Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Use a Finesse weapon or a Ranged weapon to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#weapons\">your preference<\/a>, but remember that while Wails from the Grave only cares about the distance between your targets,Tokens of the Departed does care about you being within 30 feet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your race has weapon proficiencies that can be switched out, you might want to choose one of the following options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Whip<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A one-handed finesse slashing weapon with reach.

Most of the archetypes just give alternate conditions to apply Sneak Attack damage, and Phantom is no exception. Well, half-exception. Phantom doesn\u2019t give a different way to make a target susceptible to Sneak Attack but instead allows the Rogue to apply some damage to a second target.

We\u2019ll choose the Raven Queen for the example, but any god or goddess of death works.

Primarily, we needed a race with at least one martial weapon proficiency that we can trade out for Whip proficiency using the custom origin rules. Wood Elves come with four proficiencies, so we can trade the other three out for useful tools: Brewer\u2019s Supplies, Cartographer\u2019s Tools, and Cook\u2019s Utensils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re also keeping the Perception proficiency because it\u2019s useful to us. On top of all that, Fleet of Foot increases our Walking speed to 35 and Mask of the Wild allows hiding while only lightly obscured by natural phenomena.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re taking the Marine background which would grant us Athletics and Survival, except if we choose Athletics as one of our Rogue options, we can replace it with any skill. We\u2019re choosing Religion to add a little flavor to the build in the form of Faith. Because that choice is entirely for flavor, anything else you prefer to be good at is an option. Marine also gives both Vehicle proficiencies, Land and Water.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>From Wood Elf, we get Brewer\u2019s Supplies, Cartographer\u2019s Tools, Cook\u2019s Utensils, and Perception. From Rogue, we get Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Stealth, and Thieves\u2019 Tools. From the Marine background, we get Religion, Survival, and Vehicles (Land and Water).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Phantom becomes extra useful to the party due to tool synergies. Brewer\u2019s Supplies can turn any water into clean drinkable water. Cartographer\u2019s Tools allow recording a proper map while on the move. Cook\u2019s Utensils have two great benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with Survival, Utensils grant Advantage on checks to forage for food, and then if food is cooked and eaten during a short rest, everyone adds an extra +1 per hit die rolled for recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our first level Expertise, we\u2019re choosing Athletics to compensate for our 8 Strength and Survival to double down on our tertiary investment in Wisdom. For our sixth level Expertise, we\u2019re choosing Religion, to really bring out the flavor of being a reaper, and Stealth, which works well with our Mask of the Wild hiding.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we pick up Elven Accuracy, adding +1 to Dexterity. This is great for situations where we can get Advantage, such as if we have access to Steady Aim or if we successfully hide before attacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we take Slasher, adding another +1 to Dexterity. While this puts us a little behind the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">fundamental math<\/a>, Rogues have an ASI at tenth level, which will allow us to catch up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tenth level, we take Athlete, adding the last +1 to Dexterity. This gives us a small boost to mobility while also being a hybrid feat. Alternatively, if you really want more Expertise, Skill Expert is never a poor choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, Resilient (Constitution) gives us +1 Constitution, rounding us up to 16 and making us proficient in Constitution saves. We already get Advantage on these saves from Tokens of the Departed, but now we\u2019re just being rude to anything asking for a Con save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth level, we pick up Mobile. Increasing our move speed from 35 to 45 is great, but the synergy with Cunning Action means we can ignore difficult terrain as a bonus action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At nineteenth level, we take an ASI for +2 Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Sneak Attack<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Light Armor<br>Whip (from Wood Elf)<br><br>Saves<br>-Dexterity<br>-Intelligence<br><br>Skills<br>-Insight<br>-Investigation<br>-Perception<br>-Religion<br>-Stealth<br><br>Expertise<br>-Athletics<br>-Survival<br><br>Tools<br>-Brewer&#8217;s Supplies<br>-Cartographer&#8217;s Tools<br>-Cook&#8217;s Utensils<br>-Thieves&#8217; Tools<br>-Vehicles (Land)<br>-Vehicles (Water)<br><br>Thieves\u2019 Cant<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>We can take average starting gold (2.5*4*10=100g) to buy Studded Leather (45g), a Whip (2g), Cook\u2019s Utensils (1g), Thieves\u2019 Tools (25g), and either Brewer\u2019s Supplies (20g) or Cartographer\u2019s Tools (15g).<br><br>We\u2019re mostly a standard Rogue at this point, except that we\u2019ve done what we need to to get a reach weapon, so stand 10 feet from our foes while our allies hold the line.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Cunning Action<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>Bonus Acton for Dash, Disengage or Hide.

Managing this resource properly, the Phantom can do plenty of extra damage very consistently.
