Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin.

I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"metamagic-feats\">Metamagic Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Black Lore of Moil<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+0): The damage is\n\t\tpoor, and this can get expensive <em>very<\/em> quickly.

The best\n\t\tway to use this is to trigger the Fell X metamagic feats, which only trigger\n\t\tif the spell deals damage. 25gp for 1d6 damage is a bad trade by itself, but\n\t\twith a Fell X metamagic feat you can do some fun things.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Born of Three Thunders<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+0): Only useful for\n\t\tdevoted blasters, and even then only if you can overcome the Dazed condition\n\t\teasily.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Chain Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+3): Chain Spell is\n\t\tgreat for powerful single-target spells, but adding a reflex save to a lower\n\t\tlevel spell which normally requires a touch attack can be difficult, if you\n\t\tuse a spell which only requires a save the -4 to your DC can be very\n\t\tproblematic.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">City<\/span>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Magic<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Cs<\/a><\/sup> (+1): The feat\n\t\tdescription doesn&#8217;t actually specify that you need to use the feat inside a\n\t\tcity, though a smart DM would make the logical connection. If you&#8217;re running\n\t\tstrictly RAW, you can use this on <em>all<\/em> of your damage spells to\n\t\tconvert half of their damage to irresistible &#8220;city&#8221; damage. If your DM is\n\t\tsmart enough to only allow this to apply in a city, this probably isn&#8217;t\n\t\tworth a feat since most campaigns don&#8217;t take place entirely inside\n\t\tcities.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Coercive Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DotU<\/a><\/sup> (+1): This might be\n\t\tnice if you plan to follow up with a save or suck spell, but leading with\n\t\tthe save or suck spell is probably a better choice.

It also converts half of the damage to\n\t\tirresistible holy damage, making this excellent for Blasters. The BoED also\n\t\tadds its own +1 to the Caster Level of the spell, but because Complete\n\t\tDivine was published later, it is the definitive version.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Cooperative Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+0): Instead of wasting\n\t\ttwo characters turns casting one lousy spell, go cast two spells.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Corrupt Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoVD \/ CD<\/a><\/sup> (+1): Essentially\n\t\tthe same as Consecrate Spell, but it&#8217;s evil.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Deafening Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DotU<\/a><\/sup> (+1): Deafening a\n\t\tcreature rarely does anything useful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Deceptive Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Cs<\/a><\/sup> (+1): Certainly not worth\n\t\ta spell level.

An empowered spell will often do\n\t\tmore damage than a higher level spell, but once your caster level runs past\n\t\tthe maximum for your lower level spells your higher level spells will begin\n\t\tto overtake Empowered spells.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Energize Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM<\/a><\/sup> (+2): Empower Spell for\n\t\tpeople who only fight undead, and have living allies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Enervate Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM<\/a><\/sup> (+2): Empower Spell for\n\t\tpeople who only fight living creatures and have undead allies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Energy Admixture<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+4): Adding a second\n\t\tenergy type means potentially twice as much resistance.

You can use this to abuse\n\t\tspells with hours\/level or longer durations to cast them on the night before\n\t\tand gain their benefits without using a spell slot of the day.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fell Animate<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM<\/a><\/sup> (+3): This will save you\n\t\tthe cost of Obsidian for Create Undead and similar spells, and it&#8217;s a fun\n\t\tway to turn enemies into allies immediately. Remember that you must deal\n\t\tdamage to get the effect.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fell Drain<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM<\/a><\/sup> (+2): Negative levels are\n\t\tvery potent, but you won&#8217;t get much use out of this unless you combine it\n\t\twith spells which already inflict negative levels. Remember that you must\n\t\tdeal damage to get the effect.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fell Frighten<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM<\/a><\/sup> (+2): Shaken is a great\n\t\tstatus effect to inflict if you&#8217;re going to follow up with a save or suck\n\t\tspell. Combine this with Coercive Spell for a total -4 to Will saves, then\n\t\thit your targets with something nasty. Remember that you must deal damage to\n\t\tget the effect, so Black Lore of Moil can make for a potent combination.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Fell Weaken<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LM<\/a><\/sup> (+1): A -4 penalty to\n\t\tStrength is nothing.

Of course, in-combat healing is generally a bad idea, so there&#8217;s\n\t\tlittle reason to use this for anything except the Healing domain&#8217;s rider\n\t\teffect which grants temporary hit points for an hour, dramatically improving\n\t\tthe effectiveness of Cure Light Wounds.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Invisible Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Cs<\/a><\/sup> (+1): This requires a bit\n\t\tof creativity to make work well, and it requires a permissive DM who can\n\t\tdetach himself from monsters enough to let them fall for this. In general if\n\t\tyour DM is good with illusionists, this can work. The provided example of an\n\t\tinvisible fireball is cute, but the real appeal is much greater. Imagine\n\t\tinvisible versions of area control spells like wall of blades, cloud kill,\n\t\tor solid fog.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Lord of Uttercold<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+0): Corrupt Spell and\n\t\tConsecrate Spell add abusable alignment tags to the spell, and their damage\n\t\ttypes don&#8217;t heal undead enemies, but they also increase spell level.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Maximize Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (+3): The math for\n\t\tmaximized spells is very good, especially for blasters. However, you will\n\t\talways have problems with spell DC&#8217;s, and the cost is very high, so this is\n\t\toften best reserved for spells which don&#8217;t allow saving throws like rays and\n\t\tranged touch attacks.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Nonlethal Substitution<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED \/ CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+0): There are\n\t\tplenty of nonlethal spells which you can use in place of damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ocular Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup> (+2): You can only have\n\t\ttwo prepared at a time, but casting two spells as full round action is\n\t\tpretty great, especially since you can combine this with other metamagic\n\t\tfeats. Even at high levels, combining two low levels spells is still a\n\t\tfantastic option. You cast the spells the first time as a full round action\n\t\tto store them, then cast them against later as a second full round action,\n\t\tso if you like you can recharge your eyeballs between encounters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Persistent Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+6): Because the cost\n\t\tis so high, this is typically reserved for Divine Metamagic users.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Piercing Cold<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Fb<\/a><\/sup> (+1): Only useful for\n\t\tblasters dedicated to Cold damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Purify Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup> (+1): If you like to\n\t\tdrop damage on your allies, this is helpful.

For one less spell level, Repeat Spell has the\n\t\tsame effect but delays the second casting for one round. This can be fine\n\t\tfor spells with long durations, but when you need to murder something before\n\t\tit reaches your party, Twin Spell is the obvious choice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Retributive Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup> (+1): An interesting\n\t\toption for gishes and front-line Clerics who tend to draw a lot of attacks.\n\t\tVampiric Touch would be a fantastic and amusing option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Sanctum Spell<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup> (+0): Adventurers are\n\t\toften slandered as &#8220;Murder Hobos&#8221; because they spend most of their time\n\t\ttraveling, and rarely have a permanent home.
