Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that they are purchased as masterwork and magic weapons in stacks of 50. However, it also means that shurikens are single-use. Because they&#8217;re single-use and we plan to use them in vast quantities, we need to find a way to cut the cost of magic shurikens. That&#8217;s going to rely on Greater Magic Weapon rather than burning money on single-use ammunition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it also means that you can draw shurikens as a free action like other ammunition without the need for the Quick Draw feat. This saves you a feat, which is a big deal in Pathfinder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The numerical stats of shurikens are garbage. 1d2 damage at medium size, x2 crits, and 10 ft. range means that on their own shurikens are one of the worst weapons in the game. However, the ability to draw them as a free action and the other options surrounding them make shurikens a powerful weapon if you know how to use them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shurikens can&#8217;t be used as a melee weapon. Normally you can at least use a ranged weapon as an improvised weapon, but you can&#8217;t do that with shurikens. Grab a spiked gauntlet so you can make attacks of opportunity and helps allies flank, but otherwise it doesn&#8217;t matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Strength applies to your Shuriken\n\tdamage, so don&#8217;t dump it too hard unless you really need the points.\n\tUnfortunately there isn&#8217;t a way to apply Dexterity in place of Strength to\n\tyour thrown weapon damage within the content options which I support.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Attacks, AC, Reflex Saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Con<\/span>: You need hit points and Fortitude\n\tsaves, but you&#8217;re going to be spending more time trying not to be attacked\n\tthan trying to survive damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Great for skill ranks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: You need a bit for Will saves and\n\tPerception.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Use Magic Device and your Ki Pool both\n\trely on Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:<\/li>\n<li>Dex:<\/li>\n<li>Con:<\/li>\n<li>Int:<\/li>\n<li>Wis:<\/li>\n<li>Cha:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:<\/li>\n<li>Dex:<\/li>\n<li>Con:<\/li>\n<li>Int:<\/li>\n<li>Wis:<\/li>\n<li>Cha:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:<\/li>\n<li>Dex:<\/li>\n<li>Con:<\/li>\n<li>Int:<\/li>\n<li>Wis:<\/li>\n<li>Cha:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:<\/li>\n<li>Dex:<\/li>\n<li>Con:<\/li>\n<li>Int:<\/li>\n<li>Wis:<\/li>\n<li>Cha:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity increases are crucial.

You can recharge the\n\t\tstaff using 2nd-level spells like Bull&#8217;s Strength and cast Greater Weapon\n\t\tWeapon (a 3rd-level spell) at the same rate, which makes it easy to recharge\n\t\tthe staff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Abundant Ammunition<\/span>: Unfortunately,\n\t\tAbundant Ammunition doesn&#8217;t work with special materials or magic ammunition,\n\t\tso this won&#8217;t help much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Weapon<\/span>: Doesn&#8217;t work on\n\t\tammunition.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Magic Weapon<\/span>: Permanent magic\n\t\tshurikens are a trap.

Normal Magic Weapon doesn&#8217;t\n\t\twork on ammunition, but Greater Magic Weapon works on up to 50 pieces of\n\t\tammunition at a time. A single charge will last 5 hours and is worth 225gp,\n\t\twhich sounds expensive, but compare that to 2,000gp for a stack of permanent\n\t\t+1 shurikens.

You can spend a point of Ki as a swift action to make an extra attack at your full BAB, which complements two-weapon fighting nicely and can present a useful damage boost even if you&#8217;re in melee waving daggers around.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Best Case Scenario: +7\/+7\/+7\/+7 2+2d6<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 &#8211; Ninja 4<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Increase: Dexterity<\/li>\n<li>Ninja Trick: Vanishing Trick<\/li>\n<li>Uncanny Dodge<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Vanishing Trick is just all-around good. It&#8217;s good on any ninja. Unfortunately it won&#8217;t let you full attack and sneak attack on every attack while you&#8217;re in combat, but it&#8217;s great for positioning yourself before you get into combat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Best Case Scenario: +8\/+8\/+8\/+8 2+2d6<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 &#8211; Ninja 5<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat: Rapid Shot<\/li>\n<li>Sneak Attack +3d6<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>5th level is a great level. Rapid Shot gets us an extra attack, albeit at a -2 penalty, and we get an extra Sneak Attack die. But on top of all that, this is the earliest level at which your friends can cast Greater Weapon Weapon. Because it&#8217;s the highest-level slot available to your party, don&#8217;t expect the wizard to forgo Fireball in order to give you +1 with your shurikens, but it may be time to start looking for a wand.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This level also marks when we have picked up all of our most crucial character options. Despite a relatively poor attack bonus, 5 attacks, each potentially dealing Sneak Attack damage, is excellent. If you have allies who can provide you with bonuses to attack and damage (bardic music, cleric buffs, etc.) those bonuses are extremely effective for you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Best Case Scenario: +6\/+6\/+6\/+6\/+6 2+3d6<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 &#8211; Ninja 6<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Light Steps<\/li>\n<li>Ninja Trick: Combat Trick<\/li>\n<li>Bonus Feat: Improved Initiative<\/li>\n<li>No Trace +2<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At this level we have every ninja trick we care about (at least until we get Ninja Master Tricks), so pick up Combat Trick to help pick up all of those feats we want. Improved Initiative, coupled with our already excellent Dexterity and Reactionary, gives us a truly excellent initiative bonus. Going first is the best way to guarantee that we can deliver a Sneak Attack.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Best Case Scenario: +7\/+7\/+7\/+7\/+7 2+3d6<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 &#8211; Ninja 7<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat: Far Shot<\/li>\n<li>Sneak Attack +4d6<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>10 feet is a brutally short range for a ranged character.

Because it&#8217;s at BAB -5 it&#8217;s not likely to hit often without other buffs. Fortunately, Greater Magic Weapon also improves at this level, so if you have allies spending spell slots to enhance your shurikens you&#8217;ll get another +1 to attack and damage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our second ability increase also means another point of Dexterity bonus.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Your choice of Ninja Trick isn&#8217;t especially important at this level, but Weapon Training gives us Weapon Focus, and even tiny bonuses to our attacks can result in significant improvements to our damage output.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Best Case Scenario: +11\/+11\/+11\/+11\/+11\/+6 2+4d6<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 &#8211; Ninja 9<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Feat: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<\/li>\n<li>No Trace +3<\/li>\n<li>Sneak Attack +5d6<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Improved Two-Weapon Fighting is a gamble.

Let&#8217;s Talk About Shurikens Shurikens are a unique weapon with a special rule: Although shuriken are thrown weapons, they are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown.
