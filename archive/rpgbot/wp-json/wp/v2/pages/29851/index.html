Since it&#8217;s available from level 1, you can build around Shillelagh immediately. This does limit you to the Slow and Topple Weapon Masteries, but, once you gain Tactical Master at level 9, that becomes less of an issue since you can use Push, Sap, and Slow regardless of weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has a huge impact on the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s spell selection. At the cost of limiting yourself to exactly two weapon choices, you can build around Intelligence almost entirely. This makes your spell attacks and save DCs comparable to those of a Wizard or any other full spellcaster, which is why it features heavily in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/fighter\/fighter-subclasses\/eldritch-knight\/#example\">example build<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, you have enough spell options that you could dump\n\tIntelligence and still do just fine. If you want to use other weapons, you can\n\tstill be very effective. But, between Shillelagh&#8217;s scaling damage and\n\tsimplifying your ability score needs, Shillelagh is objectively easier than\n\trelying on Strength or Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Eldritch Knight Fighter Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eldritch-knight-fighter-cantrips\">Eldritch Knight Fighter Cantrips<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Eldritch Knight&#8217;s level 7 feature, War Magic, makes your cantrips<br>extremely impactful.
