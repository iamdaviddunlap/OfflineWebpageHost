If a threat&#8217;s CR ever falls by &#8220;-1&#8221;, and would fall\n\tbelow 1, move it one step along this track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: NPC characters&#8217; CR is their level minus 2. A level 1 Warrior is CR\n\t1\/3, while a level 2 warrior is CR 1\/2.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"scaling\">Scaling Encounters for More Than 4 Players<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, you have almost never fortunate enough to run a\n\tgame exactly 4 players. My ongoing games typically include 5 or 6 players.\n\tWhile I certainly enjoy having my friends around the table, larger parties\n\tprovide some mathematical challenges when designing encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-more-players-requires-adjustment\">Why More Players Requires Adjustment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Adding even one player above 4 can be hugely destabilizing. One extra player\n\tcan be an extra person to flank with, an extra save-or-suck spell every round,\n\tan extra chunk of damage, or a whole mess of buffs (I&#8217;m looking at you,\n\t5th-man bard). Any good party is greater than the sum of its parts, and adding\n\textra players does not change that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even from level 1, extra players can do a lot to upset the balance of\n\tencounters. As of this writing, I am running\n\t<a href=\"\/\/firemountaingames.com\/way_of_the_wicked.html#wotw1\">Way of the Wicked<\/a>\n\tfor a party of 6. Without going into any real spoilers, the party begins\n\tunarmed and unarmored in prison. Several of the early encounters pit the party\n\tagainst two guards (human warrior 2), which makes for a CR 1 encounter. For 4\n\tcharacters, this would be a scary fight without normal gear. With 6 players,\n\tthis encounter is a joke, even without weapons or armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To handle scaling, the rulebook suggests adding 1 to the party&#8217;s &#8220;average\n\tplayer level&#8221;. I find that this rule does not typically solve the issue of\n\tadditional players. As an example: The &#8220;Advanced Creature&#8221; template adds to\n\tthe stats of a creature without cosmetically changing it, and increases its CR\n\tby 1, which should compensate for 6 or more players according to the rulebook.\n\tAny solo monster (a dragon, a beholder, etc.) would still be hard pressed to\n\tdefeat 6 well organized players. This is due in great part to the huge\n\tdifference in the number of actions which the players take compared to the\n\tnumber of actions which the monster could take. A reasonably well built party\n\tof 6 with decent initiative rolle can easily kill a solo monster of their CR\n\t(or sometimes several CRs higher) before it can take a turn.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"determining-experience-budget\">Determining Experience Budget<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The official &#8220;Experience Point Awards&#8221; table lists an estimation of\n\texperience to be awarded to each player depending on how many players are in\n\tthe party. This is a rough guideline to save you the trouble of dividing, and\n\tI generally choose to ignore it. It also assumes that you do not add\n\tadditional threats to the encounter to compensate for additional\n\tcharacters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, use the following table to determine how much experience to allocate\n\tper player per encounter. Note that the #\/level column specifies the number of\n\tencounters needed for the party to reach their next level at the specified\n\tgame speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table align-center is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>Slow<\/th><th>Slow<\/th><th>Medium<\/th><th>Medium<\/th><th>Fast<\/th><th>Fast<\/th><\/tr><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>XP\/Encounter<\/th><th>Gold<\/th><th>#\/level<\/th><th>Gold<\/th><th>#\/level<\/th><th>Gold<\/th><th>#\/level<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>100<\/td><td>33.33<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>50.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>76.92<\/td><td>13.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>150<\/td><td>100.00<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>150.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>225.00<\/td><td>13.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>200<\/td><td>184.62<\/td><td>32.5<\/td><td>300.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>444.44<\/td><td>13.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>300<\/td><td>350.00<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>525.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>787.50<\/td><td>13.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>400<\/td><td>533.33<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>800.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>1280.00<\/td><td>12.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>600<\/td><td>783.33<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>1175.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>1762.50<\/td><td>13.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>800<\/td><td>1100.00<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>1650.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>2400.00<\/td><td>13.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>1,200<\/td><td>1452.63<\/td><td>31.7<\/td><td>2300.00<\/td><td>20.0<\/td><td>3450.00<\/td><td>13.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>1,600<\/td><td>2204.44<\/td><td>28.1<\/td><td>3306.67<\/td><td>18.8<\/td><td>4723.81<\/td><td>13.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>2,400<\/td><td>2624.00<\/td><td>31.3<\/td><td>3936.00<\/td><td>20.8<\/td><td>5788.24<\/td><td>14.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>3,200<\/td><td>3637.89<\/td><td>29.7<\/td><td>5316.92<\/td><td>20.3<\/td><td>8640.00<\/td><td>12.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>4,800<\/td><td>4634.48<\/td><td>30.2<\/td><td>7073.68<\/td><td>19.8<\/td><td>10338.46<\/td><td>13.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>6,400<\/td><td>6231.58<\/td><td>29.7<\/td><td>9107.69<\/td><td>20.3<\/td><td>13929.41<\/td><td>13.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>9,600<\/td><td>7944.83<\/td><td>30.2<\/td><td>12126.32<\/td><td>19.8<\/td><td>17723.08<\/td><td>13.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>12,800<\/td><td>10207.59<\/td><td>30.9<\/td><td>15811.76<\/td><td>19.9<\/td><td>23040.00<\/td><td>13.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>19,200<\/td><td>14312.73<\/td><td>28.6<\/td><td>19200.00<\/td><td>21.4<\/td><td>31488.00<\/td><td>13.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>25,600<\/td><td>16960.00<\/td><td>31.3<\/td><td>27136.00<\/td><td>19.5<\/td><td>38765.71<\/td><td>13.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>38,400<\/td><td>22873.04<\/td><td>29.9<\/td><td>35072.00<\/td><td>19.5<\/td><td>52608.00<\/td><td>13.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>51,200<\/td><td>30037.33<\/td><td>29.3<\/td><td>42910.48<\/td><td>20.5<\/td><td>64365.71<\/td><td>13.7<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spending-budget\">Spending the Experience Budget<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to spend the additional experience budget added by\n\texpanding the party: Buff the existing threats, or add new ones.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buff-the-threats\">Buff the Threats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you get to the table and find yourself with extra players, there is no\n\tshame in throwing the Advanced Creature template on one or all of the enemies\n\tin an encounter. The players likely won&#8217;t even notice, but the encounter\n\tshould hopefully still be challneging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this approach can have very poor results for solo monster\n\tencounters. Because the party has so many more turns than the monster, it will\n\thave trouble defending itself, regardless of improved stats.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"add-new-threats\">Add new Threats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Multiple threats in an encounter is a very complex balance between too many\n\tdiluted threats and so few threats that the players can completely overwhelm\n\tthem with sheer numbers. For normal threats, I find that two monsters of 2 CR\n\tless than the party&#8217;s level is generally an ideal balance. The monsters are\n\tstill strong enough to give the party a moderate challenge, and won&#8217;t fall\n\tapart every time a player sneezes. If you have 5 players, you may be able to\n\tget away with applying the Advanced Template to one of the enemies. If you\n\thave 6 players instead of 4, you can just add a third monster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of solo monster encounters, you can scale the encounter by adding\n\tminions (a bunch of low level monsters),\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/gamemasters\/minions\">Minions<\/a> (note the capital\n\tM), or environmental hazards (traps).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using one or more lower-level monsters as minions is often problematic as it\n\tleaves you with a fairly small experience budget. This then leads to groups of\n\tlow level enemies who can&#8217;t hurt the players. This means that the encounter is\n\tessentially unchanged by these minions presence. Instead, take a look at my\n\trules for <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/gamemasters\/minions\">Minions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traps can serve very well to scale an encounter. Many traps have relatively\n\thigh attack rolls and damage for their CR because they only take effect once.\n\tFor example, the\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/environment.html#arrow-trap\">CR 1 Arrow Trap<\/a>\n\thas an impressive +15 attack bonus, which is high enough to have a good chance\n\tof hurting players well into mid level. The\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/environment.html#pit-trap\">CR 1 Pit Trap<\/a>\n\thas a similarly high DC 20 reflex save to avoid. While 2d6 damage might throw\n\tan encounter, falling 20 feet can take a character out of combat for a round\n\tor two, which goes a long way to handle the issue of too many players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article assumes that you have already read the section on Encounter Design in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game core rulebook, or on the Pathfinder SRD.
