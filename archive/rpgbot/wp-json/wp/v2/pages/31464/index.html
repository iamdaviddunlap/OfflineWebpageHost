Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think we can retrain it with Cantrip Versatility.<br><br>Our subclass spells get us Animal Friendship and Speak with Animals, giving us great ways to handle Beasts.

They can&#8217;t attack you or target you with hostile effects, but they&#8217;re not forced to listen to you. You&#8217;ll likely still need to make an Animal Handling check to convince them to do stuff. Fortunately, it&#8217;s a Wisdom check and you have Advantage, so it should be easy to convince a bunch of snakes to follow you around in exchange for free food.<br><br>Beyond those considerations, we&#8217;re a pretty typical Cleric at this level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (1\/rest)<br>&#8211; Charm Animals and Plants<br>&#8211; Turn Undead<br>Harness Divine Power<\/td><td>Charm Animals and Plants is basically AOE Animal Friendship with a 1-minute duration.

By this level you have (hopefully) befriended a whole bunch of animals, especially snakes which you have perpetually Charmed via Animal Friendship. We want the ability to bring them into combat, but a CR 1\/8 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/16982-poisonous-snake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poisonous snake<\/a> has just 2 hp. A stiff breeze will end it.<br><br>To that end, we&#8217;ll use Inspiring Leader to give our scaly little friends some Temporary Hit Points. The THP last until creatures complete a Long Rest, and you can make the speech as often as you like. Start with the other players, of course, but then start buffing your danger noodles. They will still only have around 10 hp total, but that&#8217;s enough that they might survive taking damage once before they need to flee to safety, and that will scale (lol) with your level.<br><br>Blessed Strikes is consistently better than Divine Strike until level 16 when Blessed Strike adds another d8 of damage, but by that point we probably haven&#8217;t swung a mace in an eternity. Blessed Strikes will be more consistently useful because we can use it with Cantrips.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Insect Plague is an excellent area control spell, dealing good damage in a big AOE with good scaling. It has the same 10-minute duration as Spirit Guardians, too. The choice between the two comes down to whether you need portability or distance. If you can keep enemies in the AOE from a safe distance, Insect Plague is great. If you need to chase your enemies around, Spirit Guardians remains the go-to option.<br><br>This level also brings Summon Celestial. The Defender option can distribute Temporary Hit Points when it attacks. It&#8217;s only 1d10, but some extra THP on your friendly beasts might keep them alive if you&#8217;ve convinced them to help you in combat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Divine Intervention<\/td><td>Ask your deity for a plague of snakes.

You can hope for a herd of dinosaurs which might be useful in combat, but your DM is unlikely to let you farm T-Rexes at a large enough scale to make this work.<br><br>This is why we brought the snakes. Use Channel Divinity (Charm Animals and Plants), then command your small army of snakes to Help you and your allies in combat. Easily-accessible Advantage is a nice benefit, provided that your reserve of snakes is big enough to keep it going. Prior to this you&#8217;ve been relying on the snakes to act independently, but Master of Nature lets you precisely control their actions.<br><br>If your DM gives you grief about this, the PHB lists the price of 1 chicken as 2 cp.

Nature Domain&#8217;s role within a party is unclear. Heavy armor makes you more durable, but you won&#8217;t have the &#8220;stickiness&#8221; to be a Defender.
