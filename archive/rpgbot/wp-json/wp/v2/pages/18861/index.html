Just reading down the subclass features, it would be very easy to dismiss it as not doing enough, but that is somewhat short-sighted. The Bard, after all, still has nine levels of spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Therein lies the strength of Valor Bard; instead of some class feature providing a damage boost, between the Bard spell list and Magical Secrets, there are any number of spells for making your own damage boost. Just do not forget that the party role of the Valor Bard does not change from the standard Bard. Even though we have features that allow us to do some damage and use better weapons than the base Bard, our main feature is still to give Inspiration dice to other creatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you lean too heavily towards martial prowess, you risk being worse at your core Bardic capabilities. A healthy balance could be kept, or one could defy conventional Wisdom and be lopsided by design. The core Bard chassis is versatile enough that both directions have merits. Our example below, Another Gish for the Pile, takes a somewhat balanced route to make use of both a Longbow and Bardic spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">College of Valor Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valor-ability-scores\">College of Valor Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valor-races\">College of Valor Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valor-feats\">College of Valor Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valor-magical-secrets\">College of Valor Magical Secrets<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valor-weapons\">College of Valor Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valor-armor\">College of Valor Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valor-multiclassing\">College of Valor Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-college-of-valor-build-another-gish-for-the-pile\">Example College of Valor Build &#8211; Another Gish for the Pile<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

With 14 or more Dexterity, a\n\t\tbreastplate, and a shield, you&#8217;re looking at a respectable 18 AC, enough to\n\t\tmatch a fighter in full plate (without a shield). Half-plate will get you\n\t\tmore AC, but you might prefer to avoid Disadvantage on Stealth checks. If\n\t\tyou eventually get to 18 Dexterity, consider switching back to light armor.\n\t\tYou also get access to all martial weapons, but you&#8217;re probably going to\n\t\twant to stick to a Rapier, and all Bards get proficiency with rapiers.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Inspiration<\/span>: The ability to add\n\t\tthe inspiration die to damage is wasteful (unless it gets used on a critical\n\t\thit, in which case it&#8217;s multiplied since it&#8217;s &#8220;extra damage&#8221; rather than an\n\t\tadditional source of damage). You&#8217;ll have much better results using\n\t\tinspiration to prevent attacks. This isn&#8217;t quite as good as the College of\n\t\tLore&#8217;s Cutting Words ability, but it allows your allies to make the decision\n\t\tto use the die themselves, which is a nice mental load off of your\n\t\tshoulders.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: A considerable improvement\n\t\tto your damage output with weapons. If you insist on using weapons instead\n\t\tof spells, this is crucial. Thanks to our access to full spellcasting as well as Magical Secrets, we can take full advantage of some unique buffs in place of a traditional martial\u2019s damage boost (Sneak Attack, Improved Divine Smite, etc.). Spells like Shadow Blade, Elemental Weapon, and Holy Weapon pair incredibly well with Extra Attack.\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, because you don&#8217;t have a damage boost like most martial classes do,\nif you can obtain a weapon\n\t\t\tcantrip like Booming Blade it will be considerably more effective to use\n\t\t\tBooming Blade instead of making two attacks when using the aforementioned buff spells is inconvenient (such as your Concentration being already occupied). Booming Blade can still do\n\t\t\tmore damage if the secondary damage triggers (see my article on\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Magic<\/span>: An excellent use of your\n\t\tBonus Action, but your Bonus Action is also used for Bardic Inspiration, so\n\t\tthere will frequently be turns where you can&#8217;t use Battle Magic.

However, the damage per attack it adds is smaller, not even factoring in the damage types, even when upcast beyond Holy Weapon\u2019s 5th-level slot. Despite the bonus to attack rolls, the DPR when cast at 5th level is 3 points behind Holy Weapon. Burning a 7th level slot for another +1\/+1d4 still only pulls us 2 points ahead of Holy Weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Holy Weapon<\/span>: While the damage per swing is ever so slightly lower than Shadow Blade when both are cast with a 5th-level slot, Holy Weapon lasts for an hour and can be applied to a ranged weapon. Holy Weapon is just useful in more situations than Shadow Blade, but you can still live out that Edgy Shadow Blade fantasy if you want; the numbers are fairly close. And most of all, we can cast this spell on somebody else\u2019s weapon if it makes sense to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Weapon<\/span>: Because we\u2019re talking about magical secrets there is no reason to consider this spell over either Elemental Weapon or Holy Weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Blade<\/span>: In the right lighting situation, having free advantage and doing several dice of Psychic damage per attack is nice. What really amps this spell up is having both Extra Attack and full slot progression so we can make great use of it when we get it. Just make sure to shore up that Concentration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swift Quiver<\/span>: Running some math in the most favorable conditions (using a musket so that a bigger portion of the damage was from the weapon), this spell is only 3 DPR ahead of Holy Weapon while spending your bonus action every turn and only lasting for 1 minute vs an hour. This spell just isn\u2019t worth using since we can just take Holy Weapon instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-valor-weapons\">College of Valor Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Unlike the base Bard, the College of Valor grants martial weapon proficiency.
