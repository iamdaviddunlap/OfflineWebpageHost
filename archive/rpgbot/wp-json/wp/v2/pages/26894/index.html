While their skill and tool\n\tproficiencies are extremely limited, Fighters excel in combat. They are\n\tdurable, have great armor, and provide plenty of damage output. Fighters get\n\tmore Improvements than any other class, allowing them to easily explore feats\n\twithout sacrificing crucial ability scores. They also get more attacks than\n\tany other class, which can be a lot of fun, and leaves lots of room to use\n\tWeapon Options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Fighters are a great example of &#8220;opt-in complexity&#8221; in DnD 5e. The core of\n\tthe class is very simple, but the complexity of the subclasses varies\n\tsignificantly, and you can add more complexity by adding Talents. This makes\n\tthe Fighter a great choice for players of all experience levels and for\n\tplayers with a broad range of preferences, allowing you to build a character\n\tthat you find mechanically appealing but without making it more work than you\n\tmight like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Talents and class options allow for Fighters to fill a variety of roles,\n\tincluding as a Defender and a Striker, and Fighters work with a variety of\n\tinteresting builds. You can also explore a role as a Scout if you&#8217;re built\n\taround Dexterity, allowing you to succeed with skills like Stealth and with\n\ttools like Thieves&#8217; Tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#changes-from-5e\">Changes from 5e<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Fighter Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#strengthbased-fighter-ability-scores\">Strength-Based Fighter Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dexteritybased-fighter-ability-scores\">Dexterity-Based Fighter Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Fighter Lineages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritages\">Fighter Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Fighter Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Fighter Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#talents\">Fighter Talents<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-talents\">Magic and Technical Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Fighter Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Fighter Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Fighter Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-rare\">Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-very-rare\">Very Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-legendary\">Legendary Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Fighter Example Build &#8211; Ghada Zayd, Valiant Six Weapon Master Fighter<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineage\">Lineage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritage\">Heritage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improvements-and-talents\">Improvements and Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Allows you to spend Hit Dice as a Reaction to taking damage and immediately heal yourself before you take the incoming damage. You can spend hit dice up your PB, but only add your CON modifier once, so it\u2019s more efficient to use this multiple times with 1 Hit Die or to save them for a Short Rest, but this gives you a great way to stay alive in tough fights.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Martial Action: Replaces Fighting Style. All of these are activated using a Bonus Action rather than granting a passive benefit, and most only apply to a single attack, making them fantastic for multiclass dips from classes like Cleric and Rogue, but make them less useful for high-level fighters than comparable Fighting Style options in the 2014 rules.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Aim: Double PB on your next ranged weapon attack. Comparable to Archery.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Guard: Impose Disadvantage on a creature\u2019s next attack (with some conditions). Comparable to Protection, but doesn\u2019t eat your Reaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quick Strike: Make two attacks as a Bonus Action when two-weapon fighting.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wind Up: First successful melee weapon attack against a chosen target within 10 feet takes +PB damage. Comparable to Dueling and Great Weapon Fighting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Action Surge: Now scales to 3 uses per rest<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multiattack: Extra Attack has been renamed. Fighters get their 3rd attack at level 9 instead of 11 and their 4th at level 17 instead of 20.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Indomitable: Gone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heroic Boon: Choose to succeed on a failed save a few times per long rest or end negative status conditions from a list a few times per day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Epic Boon: Once on each of your turns add +STR mod or +DEX mod and ignore resistance\/immunity when you hit with a weapon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 hit points is standard for\n\tmartial characters, and it&#8217;s plenty to keep you going, especially with heavy\n\tarmor and abilities like Last Stand.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Strength saves are fairly rare, but\n\tConstitution saves are common and typically very problematic.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: All weapons, armor, and\n\tshields, but you get no tool proficiencies, and only two skills.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1:\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Last Stand<\/span>: A great way to extend your hit\n\tpoints through a full adventuring day. Note that you only add your CON\n\tmodifier once each time you use this, so it&#8217;s most efficient to use Last Stand\n\tfrequently with only one Hit Die.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1:\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Martial Action<\/span>: Martial Action presents you with a consistent, reliable way to use your Bonus Action.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very easy to overlook that Martial Action also allows you to use a Weapon Option as a Bonus Action. This is a massive tactactical advantage, allowing you to control the battlefield, debuff foes, and otherwise do things that are more interesting than damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aim<\/span>: The attack bonus is excellent, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s frustrating that it only works once per turn. This is great for classes\n\t\twith few attacks per turn like the Rogue, but the Fighter gets more attacks\n\t\tthan any else, and it&#8217;s frustrating to only get to use this on one of\n\t\tthem.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Guard<\/span>: Frustrating, limited,\n\t\tunreliable. Use the Bash Weapon Option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Quick Strike<\/span>: Two attacks instead of one\n\t\tis helpful, but without an ability modifier on the attacks you&#8217;re rolling at\n\t\tmost a d6 for both of those attacks. This is unappealing until you get to level \nand can take Two Weapon Mastery. The ability to apply the +PB damage bonus twice in one turn\nmakes two-weapon fighting much more appealing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wind Up<\/span>: A modest damage boost.

Armor Master gives\n\t\t\t\t\tus +1 AC and advantage on some very specific saves.<br><br>Martial\n\t\t\t\t\tAction (Guard) allows us to defend our allies in melee. The\n\t\t\t\t\tpositioning is difficult, but if you have other allies fighting\n\t\t\t\t\talongside you in melee, it can work.<br><br>Guard requires us to\n\t\t\t\t\tuse a shield, so we&#8217;re going for sword-and-board for our whole\n\t\t\t\t\tcareer.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Action Surge (1\/rest)<\/td><td>Always excellent.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Subclass: Weapon Master<br>Mastery<br>&#8211; Handaxe<br>&#8211; Longbow<br>&#8211;\n\t\t\t\t\tLongsword<br>Stunts<\/td><td>The benefits of Mastery are excellent. The damage reroll is fine, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe ability to use a Weapon Option and still deal damage is the real\n\t\t\t\t\tprize here. That&#8217;s effectively the benefits of an additional attack\n\t\t\t\t\tonce per turn, including when we make an Opportunity Attack.<br><br>With\n\t\t\t\t\tWeapon Options therefore much more accessible to us, their benefits\n\t\t\t\t\tbecome even more important. Handaxe provides Hamstring, Longsword\n\t\t\t\t\tprovides both Disarm and Hamstring, and Longbow provides Pinning Shot,\n\t\t\t\t\tthough we&#8217;ll never use it. Choose Longbow as one of Ghada&#8217;s mastered\n\t\t\t\t\tweapons is a waste, but the Weapon Master doesn&#8217;t offer a way to\n\t\t\t\t\tretrain.<br><br>If you&#8217;re playing this build in a real game, pick\n\t\t\t\t\ta STR-based weapon instead of the Longbow. Javelin is a great choice.\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso, changing either Handaxe or Longsword to get different Weapon\n\t\t\t\t\tOptions will offer better tactical options. I really like Trip on this\n\t\t\t\t\tbuild, especially once we pick up Opportunist.<br><br>While we\n\t\t\t\t\thave access to any of the Weapon Master&#8217;s talents, we&#8217;re limited by\n\t\t\t\t\tour equipment. Ghada uses a shield and one-handed weapons, which tells\n\t\t\t\t\tus what Stunts we can use: Cheap Shot, Make it Count, Parry, Redirect,\n\t\t\t\t\tRiposte, and Tactical Retreat. Redirect and Riposte are likely to\n\t\t\t\t\tconsume most of your Stunt uses.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; STR 16 -&gt; 18<\/td><td>Not very exciting, but always helpful.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Multiattack (2)<\/td><td>Double our damage output.

This is intended to let you Ready to attack charging enemies, but RAW it also works when throwing a weapon. You can Ready to throw a handaxe, getting +PB to attack and damage, and then apply the benefits of Mastery on top of all of that.<br><br>Even better, the Make it Count Stunt should work with the Ready tactic here, adding +10 to the attack and your Fighter level to damage, making the attack basically impossible to miss and adding a pile of extra damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Deadly Flourish<\/td><td>The first bullet says &#8220;make a ranged weapon attack&#8221;, not &#8220;make an\n\t\t\t\t\tattack with a ranged weapon&#8221;, which means that technically you can\n\t\t\t\t\tthrow things. This probably won&#8217;t work with thrown weapons,\n\t\t\t\t\tunfortunately, so we won&#8217;t get much use out of this.<br><br>The\n\t\t\t\t\tsecond bullet is for melee builds like us.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; STR 19 -&gt; 20<br>&#8211; Talent: Opportunist<\/td><td>Our Opportunity Attacks are now very scary.
