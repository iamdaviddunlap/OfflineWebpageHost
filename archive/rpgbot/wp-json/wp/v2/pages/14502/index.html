The primary drawback of being an arcane magic user is being both frail and conspicuous. Arcane Trickster fixes one of those problems by making you much less conspicuous at the expense of not being a full caster. While that&#8217;s definitely a steep price, the unique abilities granted by the subclass are worth it for many players, especially the ability to do <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/mage-hand\/\">neat stuff with Mage Hand<\/a>. Veterans of 3.5 will also notice that the entire spellthief class has been rolled into the level 17 ability for Arcane Tricksters, which feels pretty appropriate for how little play that class saw.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This subclass will let you live out the fantasy of using magic on\n\tunsuspecting persons to perform both light-hearted shenanigans and also\n\tstraight up murder.

You&#8217;re limited almost exclusively to Enchantment and\n\t\tIllusion spells for your leveled spells, but both of those schools work very\n\t\twell for Arcane Tricksters. When selecting spells, remember that Sneak\n\t\tAttack requires Dexterity-based weapon attacks, so you can&#8217;t apply it to\n\t\tspell attacks. Instead, you&#8217;ll generally rely on spells like Booming Blade\n\t\tand Shadow Blade.\n\t\t<p>For help selecting spells, see our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/spells\/\">Rogue Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mage Hand Legerdemain<\/span>: Controlling the\n\t\thand as a Bonus Action means that you can pick locks and pick pockets while\n\t\tyou&#8217;re doing other things like fighting or casting other spells, and, since the\n\t\thand is invisible, you can send it off to do those things unnoticed while you\n\t\tand your allies are busy hiding, fighting, carousing, or whatever else you\n\t\tdo with your day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Ambush<\/span>: Since your spell DC likely\n\t\twon&#8217;t be as good as that of a dedicated spellcaster, this can really do a lot\n\t\tto improve the reliability of your spells. I&#8217;m still nervous to recommend\n\t\tspells which require saving throws as a go-to option for the Arcane\n\t\tTrickster, but mathematically it makes sense. Disadvantage works out to\n\t\tslightly more than a -3 penalty, so if your Intelligence is 14 or higher\n\t\tyour spells can be roughly as reliable as those of a wizard with 20\n\t\tIntelligence.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Versatile Trickster<\/span>: Advantage allows you\n\t\tto Sneak Attack the target, which is primary appeal of Versatile Trickster. However,\n\t\tit has some problematic limitations due to the limitations of Mage Hand.\n\t\t<p>Mage Hand takes an action to cast, and with a 1-minute duration you&#8217;re likely\n\t\t\tgoing to do that in combat or while at a safe distance before rushing the\n\t\t\tmove the hand into wherever you&#8217;re expecting a fight. This could be neatly\n\t\t\tsolved by allowing the Arcane Trickster to cast Mage Hand as a Bonus Action,\n\t\t\tbut that&#8217;s not the world we live in and a feat or class dip to get Quickened\n\t\t\tSpell is too expensive to justify.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Once your Mage Hand is up, you need to keep the hand\n\t\tin range of your target. You can use your Cunning Action to move the hand thanks to Legerdemain, and enemies won&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re doing so since the hand is invisible. However, this\nmeans not using Cunning Action, Steady Aim, or two-weapon fighting, and you also can&#8217;t activate the\nAdvantage effect the same turn. If your enemy moves even slightly, they&#8217;ll be out of range of your\nhand and you&#8217;ll be forced to move it again. In effect, your Bonus Action is monopolized by having\nyour hand chase enemies around so that you can <em>sometimes<\/em> get Advantage. And that&#8217;s to say\nnothing of the Mage Hand disappearing if it&#8217;s ever more than 30 feet away from you.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>At best, this is redundant with the Steady Aim class feature, and since most rogues only make one attack per turn, they\n\t\t\thave the same benefit. You could use Versatile Trickster with spell attacks like Scorching\n\t\t\tRay, but hitting with Sneak Attack is less expensive and deals comparable\n\t\t\tdamage so that&#8217;s generally a bad combination. You&#8217;re much more likely to\n\t\t\tuse your hand to get Advantage before attacking when you can&#8217;t be\n\t\t\tinvisible or hidden for whatever reason, and if your DM doesn&#8217;t allow you to use\n\t\tSteady Aim.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Thief<\/span>: The obvious use is to steal\n\t\tspells from enemy spellcasters, but, in a game when you might go several\n\t\tlevels without seeing a spellcaster, a better option may be to &#8220;steal&#8221; spells\n\t\tfrom your party&#8217;s other spellcasters. Unfortunately, this is difficult since\nthey&#8217;re unlikely to fail the save and it robs your ally of their known\/prepared spell for\n8 hours, so while it&#8217;s a more reliable source it&#8217;s also very difficult and costly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcane-trickster-ability-scores\">Arcane Trickster Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: The defining ability for Rogues.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Con<\/span>: As two of our best spells require\n\tmelee range, we&#8217;d like the hitpoints to not die when our penchant for removing\n\tvital organs makes things angry at us.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: This powers your spells and all the\n\tknowledge skills that you&#8217;ll be expected to take since your spells are keyed\n\toff it too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wis<\/span>: We&#8217;d love more of this, but Slippery\n\tMind will help later and we don&#8217;t have the budget for it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Standard Array<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcane-trickster-races\">Arcane Trickster Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Races with innate spellcasting are going to be useful both for expanding on\n\tyour limited spell list and for taking advantage of Magical Ambush.

The wording on Echo Knight is that <em>you<\/em> can make attacks\n\toriginating from its location. This means that if <em>you<\/em> are hidden from\n\tyour target but can still see them, the attack will have advantage, even\n\tthough this is intuitively nonsense because the Echo is right next to them and\n\tactually delivering the attack. But RAW, this makes delivering sneak attacks\n\tvery reliable without having to worry about party positioning or other\n\tfactors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple levels of Bladesinger is a good compliment. It will push your AC\n\tthrough the roof and help you pass Concentration saves, but it also delays\n\tyour already-slow spellcasting and the level you get access to Magical Ambush,\n\twhich is an incredible power spike for you. If you feel like your defenses are\n\treally struggling after level 9, though, this can help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re willing to dip 3 levels, you can become SAD as an Artificer by\n\tbecoming either an Armorer or a Battle Smith which would let you pump Int over\n\tDex, doubly so if you do\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/armorer\/\">Armorer<\/a>\n\tand choose infiltrator and wear a breastplate so you can leave Dex at 14\n\twithout feeling bad.
