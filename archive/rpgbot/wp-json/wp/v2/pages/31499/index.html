This companion is a durable fighting companion with some minor supportive abilities, and, over time, the drake grows in size and gains the ability to fly and serve as a mount. With the ability to serve as an essentially disposable front-line martial character, the drake is a powerful and effective pet welcome in practically any party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Unique among nearly all characters, the Drakewarden Ranger has an effective mount built into their features.

Drake Companion is modeled very similarly to the Primal\n\t\tCompanions introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything, and follows very\n\t\tsimilar rules for commanding it, summoning it, what happens if it &#8220;dies&#8221;\n\t\t(it&#8217;s a spirit that you summon back into physical form).\n\t\t<p>The drake is a decent tank with a starting AC of 16 and a decent pool of\n\t\t\thit points, and since you can replace with for the cost a spell slot of\n\t\t\tany spell level, you can afford to throw your drake in front of you to\n\t\t\tdefend you while you do things like archery.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>While the drake is already a decent combat pet, it also improves as you\n\t\t\tgain levels, adding additional damage, the ability to fly, and the ability\n\t\t\tto be used as a mount.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Infused Stikes notably uses the phrase &#8220;extra damage&#8221;, which means that\n\t\t\tthe additional die is multiplied on a critical hit.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Bond of Fang and Scale<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drake Mount<\/span>: This is the first class\n\t\t\t\tfeature we&#8217;ve gotten which provides a mount with scaling hit points. 5th\n\t\t\t\tedition has been out for 6+ years.\n\t\t\t\t<p>While this is obviously an amazing benefit, it has some serious\n\t\t\t\t\tchallenges if you&#8217;re eyeing a mounted combat build. The drake is\n\t\t\t\t\tintelligent, which means that it&#8217;s an uncontrolled mount. That means\n\t\t\t\t\tthat it acts on its own turn, which the Drake Companion feature\n\t\t\t\t\tspecifies is immediately after yours. Taking your full turn (or taking\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Ready action) then waiting for your drake to move somewhere\n\t\t\t\t\tconvenient for you isn&#8217;t helpful for melee builds, and even for ranged\n\t\t\t\t\tbuilds it&#8217;s often frustating because you can&#8217;t reposition to deal with\n\t\t\t\t\tcover or enemies who are slightly out of range. If you can make it\n\t\t\t\t\twork it&#8217;s great, but expect to spend many turns in a bad location to\n\t\t\t\t\tattack.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Because your can ride your drake, try to find a Saddle of the\n\t\t\t\t\tCavalier. It will dramatically improve your drake&#8217;s durability.\n\t\t\t\t\tMounted Combatant is also an option, but I wouldn&#8217;t bother getting\n\t\t\t\t\tboth since it&#8217;s so easy to re-summon your drake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Fang<\/span>: Confusingly, this doesn&#8217;t make\n\t\t\t\t\tyour drake&#8217;s attacks magical. Instead, you add a d6 damage of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttype chosen when you summon the drake. That d6 will get around\n\t\t\t\t\tresistance and immunity to non-magical weapon damage types, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthe flat damage bonus is still piercing damage so anything with\n\t\t\t\t\tresistance\/immunity is a huge problem for your drake.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resistance<\/span>: Persistent damage\n\t\t\t\tresistance for you, and since you can resummon your drake for the cost\n\t\t\t\tof a spell slot you can change the damage type whenever necessary.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Drake&#8217;s Breath<\/span>: The damage matches\n\t\tFireball. It&#8217;s a good AOE damage option, but it doesn&#8217;t magically make you a\n\t\tBlaster. Still, the Ranger is generally ill-equipped to handle crowds, so\n\t\tthis is a welcome addition.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-\">Perfected Bond<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Empowered Bite<\/span>: Another d6 damage,\n\t\t\t\tbringing the total to 3d6+5 at this level (3d6+6 very soon). That&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tnot a ton on a single attack, but it&#8217;s much more than most characters\n\t\t\t\tcan do with a Bonus Action.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Large Drake<\/span>: Aside from making it hard\n\t\t\t\tto fit your drake through doors, this is excellent. The ability to ride\n\t\t\t\tyour drake while flying makes flight easily accessible and puts archery\n\t\t\t\tbuilds safely out of enemy reach.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reflexive Resistance<\/span>: This is great\n\t\t\t\tif you or your dragon take a big hit from a single source of damage like\n\t\t\t\ta spell or a critical hit. Don&#8217;t burn your limited uses on every random\n\t\t\t\tattack; you&#8217;ll only get 5 or 6 per long rest.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Drakewarden Ranger Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2665\">typical Ranger<\/a>.
