They introduce a fun element of chaos when I find myself falling into a creative rut. Sometimes I like small random things like NPCs or plot hooks, but sometimes I want something big. Something world-wide. The following rules can be used to define a setting as part of a larger world, or they can be used to generate and entire world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The below rules are presented as a combination of world generation rules and ideas from games such Traveler, Dark Heresy, Dwarf Fortress, Spore, Stars Without Number, and from online sources like \/r\/WorldBuilding. I will continue to expand on this article as I discover or concoct new ideas to add.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stellar-cosmology\">Stellar Cosmology<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>A world is defined as much by the space around it as it is by its surface. Earth&#8217;s geography, climate, and society are significantly affected by the fact that the Earth has one sun and one moon. Tamriel, the world of The Elder Scrolls game franchise, has a moon, but the sun and stars are actually holes in the native plane caused by the departure of a demonic deity and his followers tearing holes in the border of the plane. Tatooine, the iconic desert world of Star Wars, has two suns but no moon. Eberron has a twelve small moons, but also has a ring made up of magical crystals which occasionally rain upon the world below, and are used for all sorts of religious, magical, and decorative purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"solar-bodies\">Solar Bodies<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>In the real world, planets revolve around suns. A planet large enough to be orbited by a star is physically impossible. But in your world, all bets are off. The sun may not be a sun at all; it might actually be a divine being flying around the earth on a chariot drawn by winged horses (looking at you there, Helios), or it may be the eye of some huge cosmic being gazing down upon the world below. Or, it might be completely mundane and the people of the world might lack the capacity to understand the mechanics of such a cosmic body, and invent some far-fetched myth to explain it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>1d6<\/th><th>Body<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><th>1<\/th><td>Single Sun<\/td><td>Nice and simple.

It&#8217;s interesting to note that binary star systems are more common than single-star systems, but planets in these systems may be less common (<a href=\"\/\/www.space.com\/1084-planets-suns-common.html\">Source<\/a>).<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>3<\/th><td>Super-bright Sun<\/td><td>The planet&#8217;s sun is either too large or too close compared to the Earth&#8217;s sun.

The planet&#8217;s occupants might have no concept of night and day, and likely occupy the planet&#8217;s twilight band almost exclusively. The planet&#8217;s day side is a roughly circular desert largely devoid of water and life.

Any notes will be in italics. If you just want to read about the setting, skip the italics and return to them later.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agooa is a world dominated by the open sea. The few islands of the world serve as the anchors of enormous floating cities occupied by the &#8220;wooded&#8221; elite. These islands are the only source of wood in the world, so they hold a position of power over the unwooded masses banished to the open waters of the world. Wood represents safety, opportunity, wealth. A single log could mean keeping your family afloat for another year. The unwooded travel all over the world, and trade whatever they can gather from the sea in hopes that the Wooded might see fit to sell them enough scraps to continue their meager existence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life on Agooa is harsh, and all men live and die by the whims of the sea. A sudden storm could capsize your ship, casting you and yours into the depths, and no one would ever know. Everything that the unwooded use must come from the sea. Clothing is made of the skins and scales of fish, rope from strands of seaweed, and weapons from the bones of great creatures of the sea. Metal is an extreme rarity, coveted by those who have seen it, and spoken of in whispers by those who have not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The skies of Agooa are barren, save for the enormous moon locked in place over the planet&#8217;s &#8220;Moon Side&#8221;. The scarred edges of the moon serve as the only permanent points of navigation for the planet below, and those sailors who dwell toward the Moon Side learn from a young age to navigate by the moonmarks. Those dwelling further toward the Moonless Side are left to wander the unmarked expanses of the sea endlessly, and might pass several generations without seeing the same island twice. The sky above shifts endlessly from night to day in perfect 12 hour increments without change, without season, without end. Time can be told perfectly by the colors of the sky at the horizons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far to the Moon Side, the seas grow wild and stormy. The waves rise upward as though reaching to the sky, then plunge back upon themselves. Sailors mad enough to brave these dangerous waters die violent deaths among the turbulent waters, their meager belongings are lost to the sea. What little scraps remain afloat are pulled deeper toward the Moon Side, pulled by the perpetual, gentle tide which exists below the churning storms. According to legend, a great land stands at the Moon Side, littered with the lost wealth of uncounted broken ships. If one could ever reach this fabled land, they could walk the earth for a lifetime and never again see the sea. If any have reached this land, they have not returned to share the tale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>History is largely lost to time and the sea, with nothing but oral history to spread what little knowledge of the world has been passed down. Some particularly successful families carve histories into the bones of great sea beasts in crude pictographs, but with wood so precious, justifying the space to store luxuries like carvings is hard to do. When traveling ships meet, they often meet and trade both goods and knowledge, but conflicting knowledge is common, and because these meetings are tense at the absolute best (violence is common), much of the traded knowledge is dismissed out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Here I need to deviate very slightly and add some additional world-defining stuff. While a water world might be cool to visit, it needs something more accessible and explorable to be viable for a long-term campaign in a game like Pathfinder.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below the waves, the world is very much alive. Fish and other sea life are more than sufficient to feed those clinging to life on the surface. In shallow waters, coral reefs can be seen just below the surface, home to dizzying varieties of species, and all manner of natural treasures. Much less common, unnatural structures of stone rise up from the depths, occasionally unburied by violent storms on the surface causing shifts in the sands below, or simply wandered upon among the infinite expanse of the open sea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many believe these structures to be strange rock formations, mirages, or the tricks of sea hags seeking to consume the unwary. Few can say for certain, because encountering more than one in a lifetime is nearly unheard of. Occasionally a few brave souls might venture to dive down and explore the structures, but those who do often find that they are guarded by sea-dwelling predators, or that their barren faces betray no sign of their purpose or origin.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-play\">Putting it into Play<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>One of the most important things about Water Worlds is that they are largely covered in huge, boring water. Agooa has several points of interest to break up this monotony which can provide adventure hooks. However, I wouldn&#8217;t want to run more than one or two campaigns in this world for fear of repetition.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mechanical-adjustments-for-pathfinder\">Mechanical Adjustments for Pathfinder<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The additional complication of metal scarcity has huge implications for game balance. Ultimate Combat includes rules for low-tech weapons. Most weapons will be Bone, and weapons composed of other materials are extremely rare. You might hand-wave this by making metal weapons take the place of Masterwork weapons, or you might choose to actually use the primitive materials rules. Personally, I like the idea of exploring the unusualy materials. I might also include Obsidian weapons forged from obsidian gathered from the sites of long-dead underwater volcanoes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because weapons and armor made of bone are considerably weaker than those made of metal, classes which depend on weapons are considerably weaker. This means that I need to adjust spellcasting classes in order to bring them in line with non-caster classes. I can take some ideas from my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/gamemasters\/classbalance\">Class Balance<\/a> article, and make some adjustments to bring everyone in line. Because paper is basically non-existent, I will either need to ban Magi andWizards, or provide them some other means of recording spells, like scrimshawing them onto fish bones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like the idea of this being a low fantasy setting, so I think that I would outright ban all full casters (Clerics, Druids, Wizards, etc.), and heavily nerf 2\/3 casters. I might even go so far as to completely remove deity-based divine spellcasters (Clerics, Paladins, Warpriests, Inquisitors), and say that there are no gods on Agooa. This would help to reinforce the superstitious, disconnected feeling of the world. Magic would become almost entirely from &#8220;primal&#8221; sources, and Druids would be NPCs with powers nearly worthy of worship. Further, I might limit the players to 15 point buy when determining their abilities to make them feel very vulnerable to the dangers of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-campaign-hook\">Example Campaign Hook<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your boat rests at anchor, the seaweed chords gently tugging against the boat as it rocks gently on the waves. You sit at the edge of the boat, your feet dangling in the warm water. Your brother, sitting beside you, looks down into the water, perplexed. &#8220;What is it? Some kind of giant turtle?&#8221; Your cousin, sitting on your other side, leans forward to look at your brother. &#8220;That&#8217;s no turtle, you idiot. Have you ever seen a square turtle?&#8221; Your brother frowns. &#8220;Well, what is it then?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You sit, uncertain. Below the waves, hugged by a great coral tree, a huge dark object rises from the dark waters below. It is roughly square in shape, but it is difficult to make out details from above the water. It is like nothing you have ever seen, and the curiosity eats at you. You reach behind you and grab your spear, four feet of sharpened whale bone. &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go find out.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Agooa would be a great setting in which to use all of those awful aquatic templates that I hate so much, and could be a great place for weird archetypes like the True Primitive Barbarian. Dungeons would be entirely underwater with rooms which range from flooded to generally damp. Think the Water Temple from Ocarina of Time. If that fills you with feelings of dread, then you should run this campaign.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I like randomly generated things.
