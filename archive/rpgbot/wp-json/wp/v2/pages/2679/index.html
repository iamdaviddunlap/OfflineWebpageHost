In\n\t\tparticular, even though all the smites are Bonus Actions (good for your\n\t\taction economy), they require Concentration to ensure that you&#8217;re able to\n\t\tactually get the effect off as long as you hit sometime during the next\n\t\tminute, but this prevents you from running other excellent Concentration\n\t\tbuffs like Blur and Elemental Weapon from the very same expanded list.\n\t\tFurthermore, since the smite spells don&#8217;t scale well (if they scale at all),\n\t\tthey&#8217;re often a poor use of your limited Warlock spell slots. Consider using\n\t\tthem for a level or two when you first get them, but replace them after that\n\t\twhen better spells become available (even if it&#8217;s just the next smite\n\t\tspell).\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Shield is\n\t\t\t\tfantastic&#8230; on any other spellcasting class. It costs a precious spell\n\t\t\t\tslot, and offers no benefits for upcasting, so it&#8217;s only helpful until\n\t\t\t\tyou get access to 2nd-level slots for Armor of Agathys. If you aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\trunning another Concentration spell, Wrathful Smite into Booming Blade\n\t\t\t\tis staggeringly good damage at low levels, assuming the target moves and\n\t\t\t\ttriggers the secondary damage. The Wisdom save for fear is a nice touch,\n\t\t\t\tthough your defenses aren&#8217;t really turned on yet so maintaining\n\t\t\t\tConcentration can be a challenge in melee. To summarize: tempting\n\t\t\t\toptions at low levels, but you&#8217;ll abandon them in favor of other options\n\t\t\t\talmost immediately.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Blur is just a\n\t\t\t\tsuperb spell. Turn it on if you have more than one thing attacking you\n\t\t\t\tand\/or your Armor of Agathys doesn&#8217;t look up to the job. Branding smite\n\t\t\t\tfills some excellent niches, but is not otherwise overly helpful. It&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tprobably the only way you&#8217;re going to be able to deal radiant damage\n\t\t\t\t(you&#8217;ll be very grateful if you ever come across zombies) and it also\n\t\t\t\tprevents invisibility if your party can&#8217;t cast Faerie Fire, Invisibility\n\t\t\t\tPurge, or something else along those lines.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Blink would be\n\t\t\t\tinteresting if it wasn&#8217;t random in the fashion it is. Elemental weapon&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tprimary benefit is making a weapon magical if for some reason you aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\trunning Pact of the Blade, and I&#8217;m not sure why you would skip Pact of\n\t\t\t\tthe Blade (and the Invocations which require it like Thirsting Blade)\n\t\t\t\tand still use a weapon. It still runs into the Concentration problem,\n\t\t\t\tinterfering with smites and defensive buffs, but it adds a small amount\n\t\t\t\tof extra damage (which will increase when your spell slot levels\n\t\t\t\tincrease). Keep in mind that the Pact Weapon granted by Pact of the\n\t\t\t\tBlade counts as a magic weapon\n\t\t\t\t<em>for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance and immunity<\/em>.\n\t\t\t\tIt&#8217;s technically not a magic weapon unless you bind a specific magic\n\t\t\t\tweapon, so you <em>can<\/em> use your Pact Weapon with Elemental\n\t\t\t\tWeapon.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Phantasmal Killer\n\t\t\t\tis still an excellent spell, although the fact that it never scales past\n\t\t\t\t5th level for warlocks is disappointing at higher levels. Staggering\n\t\t\t\tSmite would be much better if the effect lasted more than one round.\n\t\t\t\tBoth spells cause the creature to suffer Disadvantage on attack rolls,\n\t\t\t\tbut Phantasmal Killer works at range and lasts longer.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Banishing Smite is a\n\t\t\t\tbig pile of damage on a Bonus Action and the rider effect doesn&#8217;t allow\n\t\t\t\ta saving throw. 50 hit points is a reasonably large window, and\n\t\t\t\tbanishing the target could dramatically affect the outcome of an\n\t\t\t\tencounter. Cone of Cold is a helpful way for you to do area of effect\n\t\t\t\tdamage, but apart from being a big pile of damage does little else for\n\t\t\t\tyou.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hexblade&#8217;s Curse<\/span>: Are you ready to confuse\n\t\tliterally every new player by being the only thing that gets proficiency to\n\t\tdamage? Then Hexblade is for you. Note that you can both Curse and Hex\n\t\tsomeone if you like to track several effects at the same time. In all\n\t\tseriousness though, this is a fantastic ability.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You only get this once per Short or Long Rest, so be sure to use it where\n\t\t\tit will matter. You want to make as many attack rolls as possible while\n\t\t\tthis is running, so at high levels this will frequently work best when\n\t\t\tcombined with Eldritch Blast since Warlocks can&#8217;t get more than three\n\t\t\tattacks (assuming Thirsting Blade and either two-weapon fighting or\n\t\t\tCrossbow Expert). However, since this only works once per Short or Long\n\t\t\tRest, remember that you may still have better results focusing on other\n\t\t\tparts of your build, and focusing on being effective with weapons is often\n\t\t\ta better choice for the Hexblade than Eldritch Blast even though you may\n\t\t\tget fewer attacks.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since this comes in at 1st level and scales based on your proficiency\n\t\t\tbonus, it&#8217;s very tempting for class dips into Warlock, totally\n\t\t\tdisregarding how good Hex Warrior is.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Warrior<\/span>: This is probably why you\n\t\tpicked the subclass. You get medium armor and shields so that you&#8217;re able to\n\t\texist in the front line without dying immediately, but far more importantly\n\t\tyou get to be a melee character and still have Str and Dex be dump stats.\n\t\tYou do still need enough Dexterity to fill out Half Plate&#8217;s Dexterity cap,\n\t\tbut that&#8217;s not hard.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Using your Charisma for attack and damage rolls in place of Strength is\n\t\t\tcrazy powerful. Not only does it make Pact of the Blade considerably\n\t\t\teasier for the Warlock, it makes Paladin\/Warlock multiclass builds\n\t\t\tmassively more effective. Keep in mind that by default Hex Warrior&#8217;s\n\t\t\tweapon effect works on a weapon which you touch at the end of a long rest,\n\t\t\tbut if you later take Pact of the Blade the effect extends to that weapon\n\t\t\ttoo, so you can affect have two weapons with which to attack using\n\t\t\tCharisma. This is important if you plan to explore two-weapon fighting or\n\t\t\tif you want a backup weapon or something.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Accursed Specter<\/span>: Not only does it have\n\t\tto be a humanoid, but you personally have to get the killing blow. That\n\t\tsaid, if you can get one, Specters are a phenomenal companion to have with\n\t\tyou. They are effective in combat (although they never scalebeyond the tiny\n\t\tamount of temporary hit points and the attack bonus which you give them)\n\t\tand, while they can&#8217;t speak, they will follow your verbal commands allowing\n\t\ta creative person to use one for scouting and have it report back. However,\n\t\tthey have no ability to speak, to their ability to report their findings is\n\t\tlimited to gestures like nodding, pointing, and pantomime.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor of Hexes<\/span>: Take the already excellent\n\t\tHexblade&#8217;s Curse and put an astonishing and unique defensive buff on it.\n\t\tSomewhere, a 40k player is wondering how 4-up saves got into their D&amp;D.\n\t\tThis is a 50% miss chance on top of whatever other defenses you might have\n\t\trunning (Blur or Shadow of Moil, for example),<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master of Hexes<\/span>: The only problem with\n\t\tHexblade&#8217;s Curse was that it could feel wasted if you used it on something\n\t\tand then ran into something more threatening before your next rest. That is\n\t\tnow slightly mitigated by allowing you to chain it through a whole fight.\n\t\tYou do need to be able to see a new target creature when you move Hexblade&#8217;s\n\t\tCurse, so if you&#8217;re facing hidden or invisible enemies you may need to keep\n\t\tthat in mind before you finish off your current target.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Clever players might try to move the effect to an angry rat which you\n\t\t\tkeep in a sack (the old &#8220;bag of rats&#8221; trick) to allow you to carry one use\n\t\t\tof Hexblade&#8217;s Curse all day, but wise DM&#8217;s should explicitly disallow such\n\t\t\tshenanigans.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Hexblade Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other Warlocks, you will need to invest some into Dexterity to make\n\tbest use of that medium armor you&#8217;re now allowed to wear and boy will you need\n\tit.

Hex and Hexblade&#8217;s\n\t\tCurse both benefit greatly from additional attacks, and even Eldritch\n\t\tBlast+Agonizing Blast can&#8217;t keep up with Crossbow Expert, especially once\n\t\tyou add Lifedrinker. However, this requires your Bonus Action for two rounds\n\t\tto set up, and in that time other warlocks are happily doing other things\n\t\twhich don&#8217;t require resources that need a short rest to recharge. Since\n\t\tcombats generally last around three rounds, in most cases you can except to\n\t\tget your combo set up and start using the Bonus Action attack from Crossbow\n\t\tExpert an average of once per encounter.<\/li>\n        <li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elven Accuracy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is practically tailor-made for Warlocks, and Hexblades will be able to make great use of it, especially if you follow the melee build detailed below. Triple advantage on a Greatsword makes you very likely to proc Great Weapon Master&#8217;s bonus attack, and you have several ways to get that going like casting Darkness on a piece of your clothing and using the Devil&#8217;s Sight Invocation or just using Shadow of Moil as written which we discuss in this article.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Great Weapon Master<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Hexblades can make effective use of two-handed weapons, which makes this\n\t\ta possibility. Hexblade&#8217;s curse allows you to score a critical hit against\n\t\tthe target on a 19-20, which makes it more likely that you can trigger the\n\t\tfirst portion of the feat. If you use Darkness with the Devil&#8217;s Sight\n\t\tinvocation you can easily get Advantage, making the second half of the feat\n\t\ta safe and reliable option. However, the weapon which you touch with Hex\n\t\tWarrior can&#8217;t have the Heavy property, and all two-handed weapons have the\n\t\tHeavy property so you can&#8217;t use Great Weapon Master with that weapon. Once\n\t\tyou gain Pact of the Blade, your Pact Weapon can be two-handed, and Hex\n\t\tWarrior extends to your Pact Weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavily Armored<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Tempting for a Hexblade, but the Strength requirements for full plate\n\t\tmake heavy armor unappealing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Medium Armor Master<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Heavy armor isn&#8217;t appealing for Hexblades because of the Strength\n\t\trequirements to wear it, so medium armor master can allow you to match heavy\n\t\tarmor AC without caring about Strength.

I would probably stick to a\n\t\tquarterstaff or spear (spear was added in errata in 2018) so that you can\n\t\tuse a shield to compensate for the Warlock&#8217;s relatively poor AC and low\n\t\thitpoints, but maybe you&#8217;re braver than I am. The total damage output\n\t\troughly matches that of a Crossbow Expert build and will have higher AC, but\n\t\tyou give up the advantage of range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Proficiency in Constitution saves really helps with Concentration, not to\n\t\tmention how common Consitution saves are.

Hexblades get proficiency with shields, and since warlocks have\n\trelatively low hit dice and hexblades still only get medium armor I think a\n\tshield is a good idea most of the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also keep in mind that Hex Warrior doesn&#8217;t allow your touched weapon to have\n\tthe Two-Handed property, so if you want to use a two-handed weapon you&#8217;ll\n\tdefinitely need Pact of the Blade. Versatile weapons still work, though, and\n\tthe difference between a longsword and a greatsword isn&#8217;t huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crossbow, Hand<\/span>: The go-to for Crossbow\n\t\tExpert builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crossbow, Heavy<\/span>: A good ranged option\n\t\tuntil you get Crossbow Expert and\/or Extra Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glaive \/ Halberd<\/span>: Great for two-handed\n\t\tmelee builds, it has reach, and it works with Polearm Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greatsword<\/span>: Your go-to for two-handed\n\t\tmelee builds unless you want reach and or intend to take Polearm Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longbow<\/span>: A decent ranged weapon, but it\n\t\tcan&#8217;t come close to the damage output of a Crossbow Expert build so it&#8217;s not\n\t\ta good primary weapon. If you&#8217;re built for melee, the Longbow will be a good\n\t\tranged option once you pick up Extra Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longsword \/ Rapier<\/span>: Interchangeable if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re using Hex Warrior.

The damage difference of 1d4 vs. 1d8 from\n\t\tsomething like a longsword seems significant, but when you consider the flat\n\t\tbonuses added by your various class features, the difference of 2 damage on\n\t\taverage is negligible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Leather<\/span>: The Warlock&#8217;s starting armor\n\t\tunless you take the 100 gp starting equipment variant.
