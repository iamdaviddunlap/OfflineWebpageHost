It can cripple enemies, turn the caster or an ally into a ferocious beast, or provide you with utility options which are difficult to replicate without relying on numerous other spells at once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-polymorph-work\">How does polymorph work?<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Before you read this guide, read the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/spells\/polymorph\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Polymorph<\/a> spell description on the 5e SRD.

While polymorphed, &#8220;the target&#8217;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.&#8221; This means that when your wizard polymorphs themselves into a tyrannosaurus, their Intelligence drops from 20 to 2. But what about their personality?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer is that I have no idea, but I can make some suggestions. Jeremy Crawford confirmed that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/961395590486663173\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/961395590486663173\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you are still yourself<\/a>. I assume that means that allies are still allies, and enemies are still enemies. That target almost certainly can&#8217;t speak or understand speech unless it&#8217;s also under some other effect like Comprehend Languages. Unless the target was already animal-level intelligence (a familiar, a pet dog, etc.), it&#8217;s going to behave differently. Don&#8217;t expect the target to do math or make tactical decisions. Allies may need to use Animal Handling to direct the target (they are a best now, after all). Otherwise, the target likely attacks the nearest enemy in combat. Outside of combat, the target is likely friendly to their allies, but is likely driven by basic animal stuff. You know, animal stuff. Being hungry, and&#8230; animal stuff, I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, many groups will simply allow whoever got turned into a T-Rex to do as they please. It&#8217;s certainly simpler.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-does-polymorph-work\">How does polymorph work?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#what-do-you-get-when-you-polymorph\">What do you get when you polymorph?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#forms-by-cr\">Polymorph Forms by CR<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#cr-0\">CR 0<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-1\/8\">CR 1\/8<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-1\/4\">CR 1\/4<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-1\/2\">CR 1\/2<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-1\">CR 1<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-2\">CR 2<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-3\">CR 3<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-4\">CR 4<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-5\">CR 5<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-6\">CR 6<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-7\">CR 7<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cr-8\">CR 8<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

It retains its alignment and personality.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You effectively lose everything but your personality. You lose class abilities, feats, racial traits, etc. You can effectively put away your character sheet and replace it with the stat block out of the Monster Manual.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"forms-by-cr\">Polymorph Forms by CR<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Once you understand how the spell works the most important decision you make is what form to select. While True Polymorph allows any creature, Polymorph only allows beasts, so this section will analyze available beast forms. Unfortunately, the highest CR beast is currently the Tyrannosaurus Rex at CR 8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no &#8220;best&#8221; form; every problem requires a different tool. However, it may be helpful to pick a few &#8220;staple&#8221; forms which you use repeatedly. When every problem is a nail, it&#8217;s nice to have a good hammer. I suggest picking a form for disabling enemies by turning enemies into it, a form for scouting, and a general combat form. Your scouting and combat forms may change as new options become available, but since your disable form should generally be CR 0 it probably won&#8217;t change much. Keep in mind that the lowest level you will be able to cast Polymorph is level 7, so you generally won&#8217;t look for combat forms below CR 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that this guide currently only covers beasts presented in the monster manual. Expect updates periodically as additional sourcebooks are published.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cr-0\">CR 0<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t consider combat forms from CR 0; there are better options available the moment you get Polymorph. However, CR 0 provides the best disable forms and many of the best scout forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Baboon<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Too mobile to use as a\n\t\tdisable form, but not mobile enough to use as a scout form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Badger<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: By the time you get\n\t\taccess to polymorph you can use the Giant Badger, which is strictly\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bat<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Fantastic scout form.\n\t\tDecent fly speed and blindsight allow you to scout dark areas (including\n\t\tmagical darkness). However, echolocation tends to be a bit noisy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cat<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Too mobile to use as a\n\t\tdisable form, but not mobile enough to use as a scout form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crab<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: If you need to\n\t\tquickly move through both underwater and dry environments quickly, the crab\n\t\tis a useful choice for a scout. Blindsight is also useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cranium Rat<\/span><sup>VGtM<\/sup>: Visibly different\n\t\tfrom a rat. It&#8217;s telepathic, but the target also has 4 Intelligence when\n\t\tyou turn them into a Cranium Rat so they likely won&#8217;t have much to say.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deer<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: A tempting disable\n\t\tform since the deer is limited to movement on the ground and their only\n\t\tattack is pitiful. However, the high speed is a problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Eagle<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: A great scout form.\n\t\tWith very good fly speed and keen sight, the eagle is a good scout when\n\t\toutdoors, but the owl is strictly better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Frog<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Rat is a better disable\n\t\tform, and there are other scout forms which work better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant Fire Beetle<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: The attack\nis a bit higher than you want from a disable form, and while blindsight would allow you\nto sneak around in the dark to scout, illumination negates that benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Goat<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Similar to the deer and\n\t\tslightly slower, making it a potential disable form. However, the Charge\n\t\tattack does enough damage to be a potential problem and you&#8217;ll feel really\n\t\tsilly if your target manages to knock someone in your party prone.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant Fly<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: With 60 ft. fly speed, this is a great option if you need to travel long distances. At large size you can carry allies, and with Darkvision you can even fly in dark places like caves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hawk<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Functionally identical\n\t\tto the eagle for scouting purposes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hyena<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Probably the closest\n\t\tthing you will get to a combat form at this CR.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jackal<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Keen hearing and\n\t\tsmell are tempting, but with no special senses or movement modes it&#8217;s not a\n\t\tgo-to option for a scout form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lizard<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: A climb speed and\n\t\tdarkvision are tempting for a scout, and with such slow speed it&#8217;s a\n\t\tpossibility for a disable form despite the climb speed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Octopus<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Underwater the\n\t\toctopus is a great scout. Darkvision and camouflage make it easy to sneak\n\t\taround, and ink cloud provides a fantastic escape mechanism. Don&#8217;t be\n\t\ttempted to use this is a disable form, as it allows the target to\n\t\tintentionally suffocate themselves out of polymorph while out of water.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Owl<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Perhaps the best scout\n\t\toption. With astounding 120 ft. darkvision, great fly speed, and both keen\n\t\thearing and sight, it can handle anything except magical darkness and\n\t\twater.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quipper<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Faster than the\n\t\toctopus and with better darkvision, but not as sneaky. Don&#8217;t be tempted to\n\t\tuse this is a disable form, as it allows the target to intentionally\n\t\tsuffocate themselves out of polymorph while out of water.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rat<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: The perfect disable\n\t\tform. Bad speed, no special movement, and a pitifully weak attack. It&#8217;s also\n\t\ta passable scout form if only because rats are a common sight which many\n\t\tcreatures will ignore.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Raven<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Useful only for mimicry\n\t\tif you need it for some reason.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scorpion<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: The blindsight is\n\t\ttempting, but at such short range it won&#8217;t help much<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sea horse<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: A great disable\n\t\tform underwater because it has terrible speed and no attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spider<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Darkvision and\n\t\tspider climb are tempting, but flying works better than climbing and other\n\t\toptions have better darkvision.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vulture<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: The owl is strictly\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Weasel<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Rat is a better\n\t\tdisable form, and with no special movement types anything that can fly is\n\t\tlikely a better scout form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cr-1\/8\">CR 1\/8<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A difficult CR. CR 0 has better scout and disable forms, and nothing here is useful as a combat form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Hawk<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: For your\n\t\tpurposes the blood hawk isn&#8217;t notable than the eagle or the hawk. Pack\n\t\ttactics is neat, but doesn&#8217;t make this a combat form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Camel<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Good speed and your\n\t\tallies can ride you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dolphin<\/span><sup>VGtM<\/sup>: 60 ft. swim speed,\n\t\tand 60 ft. blindsight. A great aquatic scouting form, but remember\n\t\tthat dolphins can&#8217;t breath water, so you can&#8217;t go expecially deep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flying snake<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: A startlingly\n\t\tgood combat form despite its CR. Flight and swim speeds make it extremely\n\t\tmobile, it has blindsight for some reason (albeit with a tiny range), and\n\t\tthe combination of flyby and poison damage with no save makes it an effect\n\t\thit-and-run attacker. A fantastic option if you&#8217;re scouting and might also\n\t\tneed to kill something weak.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant crab<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Crab is a better\n\t\tscout despite lower speed simply due to the size difference. Blindsight is\n\t\ttempting, but not enough to make the giant crab useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant rat<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Not appreciably\n\t\tbetter than the rat as a scout.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant weasel<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Too big for a\n\t\tscout, and no special movement types.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mastiff<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: A good scout in\n\t\tpopulated environments.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mule<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Allies can ride you,\n\t\tbut camels are faster<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Poisonous snake<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: The flying\n\t\tsnake is strictly better by a large margin.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pony<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Mules are the same speed\n\t\tand have some other occasionally useful abilities.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stirge<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: The flying snake is\n\t\tstrictly better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cr-1\/4\">CR 1\/4<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Like lower CRs, CR 1\/4 is too weak for combat forms. However, it does offer useful forms that your allies can ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Axe beak<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Weak combat\n\t\tform.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Boar<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Weak combat form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Constrictor snake<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Weak combat\n\t\tform.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cow<\/span><sup>VGtM<\/sup>: Outright worse than the Elk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deep Rothe<\/span><sup>VGtM<\/sup>: A cow that can cast Dancing Lights.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Draft horse<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Slower than\n\t\tthe camel, but allies can still ride you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elk<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Faster than the draft\n\t\those and your allies mayt be able to ride you. The charge attack is also\n\t\tdecent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant badger<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Darkvision,\n\t\tkeen smell, and burrow speed. While it&#8217;s no combat mosnter and other scout\n\t\toptions will usually be better, it&#8217;s the best burrowing option available to\n\t\tyou.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant bat<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Better blindsight\n\t\tthan the bat and better fly speed, but at large size it will be easy to\n\t\tnotice and it will have trouble flying around in small areas where a bat\n\t\twould fit easily.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant centipede<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Climb speed\n\t\tand blindsight, but bats will make better scouts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant frog<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant lizard<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Not as fast\n\t\tother ridable options, but it&#8217;s the only ridable option with a climb\n\t\tspeed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Giant owl<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: All of the\n\t\tbenefits of the owl, but bigger. Personally I would still stick to owl for\n\t\tscouting purposes, but the extra durability may be worthwhile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant poisonous snake<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: The\n\t\tflying snake is more mobile and does more reliable poisons damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Giant wolf spider<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Fast\n\t\twith spider climb, but remember that spider climb is still worse than\n\t\tflying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hadrosaurus<\/span><sup>VGtM<\/sup>: Ridable, but\nnot especially fast, no special movement type.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ox<\/span><sup>VGtM<\/sup>: Worse than the Elk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Panther<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Weak combat form.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pteranodon<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Weak combat\n\t\tform.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Riding horse<\/span><sup>MM<\/sup>: Extremely fast\n\t\tand ridable.
