Selecting your invocations is as important as picking your\n\tpatron, and knowing what options are available and how to use them is crucial\n\tif you want to succeed as a Warlock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While most Eldritch Invocations are independent, a few form feat chains with the Pact Boon invocations: Pact of the Blade, Pact of the Chain, and Pact of the Tome. In the 2014 rules, these invocations were a separate feature which encouraged Warlocks to adopt a specific playstyle, focusing on weapon use, a familiar, or spellcasting, depending on your choice. In the 2024 DnD 5e rules, Pact Boons are now optional, but can still be very powerful choices. You can also pick more than one, which wasn\u2019t possible in the 2014 rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD Warlock.

Most of these were awful, so very little was lost. A surprising number of Invocations from Xanathar\u2019s and Tasha\u2019s were not updated for the 2024 rules, including options like Grasp of Hadar. Eldritch Adept didn\u2019t make it into the 2024 rules, either, but there are very few level 1 Invocation options which you could select with Eldritch Adept.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agonizing Blast. You now pick any one Warlock cantrip that deals damage. Repeatable to select more cantrips.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Devil\u2019s Sight. You can now see in dim light in addition to the previous effects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Devouring Blade. New! Bladelocks can now get 3 attacks per Attack Action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eldritch Spear. Now works with any Warlock cantrip that deals damage and has 10+ feet of range, and adds +30 feet per Warlock level to its range. Repeatable to select more cantrips.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fiendish Vigor. Now automatically gives you the max roll rather than requiring you to sit around and cast it repeatedly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gaze of Two Minds. Now targets any willing creature instead of a willing humanoid, now takes a Bonus Action to use and to maintain, and if you\u2019re within 60 feet of the target you can cast spells as if you were in its space. A massive buff. Warlocks are going to turn invisible allies into predator drones. Predator drones are Order of Scribes\u2019 thing. How dare you, WotC.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gift of the Depths. New. Cast Water Breathing once per day and get a permanent swim speed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Investment of the Chain Master. Now allows your familiar to change weapon damage types to necrotic or radiant, but otherwise the same as the version in Tasha\u2019s.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lessons of the First Ones. Gain an Origin Feat. Repeatable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lifedrinker. No more double-dipping Charisma to damage. Once per turn, deal 1d6 extra damage on hit with your pact weapon and spend a Hit Point Die to heal yourself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Master of Myriad Forms. Dropped from 15th level to 5th.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>One With Shadows. Now it just lets you cast Invisibility without a spell slot. An absolutely massive buff.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pact of the Blade.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create or bind a weapon as a Bonus Action.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can now use it as a spellcasting focus.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 or Hex Warrior, we now get Charisma to attack and damage.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can make it deal necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage, decided every time you hit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability increases provided by martial feats almost exclusively provide increases to Strength or Dexterity. This is going to make 1-level dips for Pact of the Blade much less appealing than Hexblade dips in the 2014 rules. It\u2019s also going to make Dexterity-based builds the go-to option for weapon-focused warlocks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pact of the Chain. Now a bunch of new forms! Otherwise, the same as 2014. The last Unearthed Arcana for the Warlock had a standalone stat block for familiars, but they apparently reversed that change.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pact of the Tome. Now includes 2 level 1 Ritual spells in addition to the cantrips.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repelling Blast. Now works with any one Warlock cantrip which requires an attack roll. Repeatable to select more cantrips.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Visions of Distant Realms. Dropped from level 15 to level 9\/.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whispers of the Grave. Dropped from level 9 to level 7.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Witch Sight. Upgraded to permanent Truesight within 30 feet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warlock-eldritch-invocations\">Warlock Eldritch Invocations<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-1-invocations\">Level 1 Invocations<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor-of-shadowsphb\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Armor of Shadows<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Take Magic Initiate. Mage Armor\u2019s duration is 8 hours, so one casting will\n\tget you through the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one use case for this is School of Abjurer wizards, who can use this to\n\trepeatedly cast Mage Armor in order to recharge your Arcane Ward without\n\tspending spell slots.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eldritch-mindphb\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eldritch Mind<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Excellent on nearly any spellcaster, but War Caster provides the same benefit plus some other stuff, and since War Caster can get you a +1 Charisma increase, it&#8217;s a very easy feat choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eldritch Mind is only appealing if there&#8217;s no way to fit War Caster into your build because you need other other feats instead. Remember that you can replace an Invocation each time that you gain a Warlock level, allowing you to take this temporarily and then replace it when you&#8217;re ready to take War Caster.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pact-of-the-bladephb\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Pact of the Blade<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Pact of the Blade is the primary way in which Warlocks are expected to use\n\tweapons. By using Charisma for attack and damage, you remove MAD (Multiple\n\tAbility Dependent) issues, allowing you to easily transition between weapons\n\tand spells. There is a clear progression of Invocations which will fill most\n\tof your Invocation slots and add scaling benefits which will make you feel a\n\tlot like a Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the reality of Pact of the Blade is a bit more complex. General\n\tFeats which improve your weapon use like Great Weapon Master and Piercer all\n\tprovide increases to Strength or Dexterity. This means that if you&#8217;re focusing\n\ton Charisma, you won&#8217;t want to take these feats until you hit 20 Charisma,\n\twhich may not be until you reach level 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is fine to build Pact of the Blade around Charisma, ignore weapon-focused Feat options, and rely on Invocations and spells. But if you want to lean heavily into weapon use, you&#8217;ll need to build around Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that until you can get Thirsting Blade at level 5, using Shillelagh and\/or True Strike is just as using Pact of the Blade, if not better in all respects except Opportunity Attacks. You don&#8217;t get Weapon Mastery (at least not from Warlock levels), so there&#8217;s little difference between the 1d8 damage of a Shillelagh and the 1d10 damage of a Longsword wielded in two hands. Strongly consider Pact of the Tome at least until level 5, then replace Pact of the Tome with Pact of the Blade if you want to go that route.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even then, using a weapon isn&#8217;t significantly better on its own. You&#8217;ll need to add the other Pact of the Blade cantrips before weapons start having more impact than Shillelagh+True Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pact-of-the-chainphb\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pact of the Chain<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Find Familiar is already a fantastic spell, and the added forms give you better options than those available to any other spellcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Imp<\/span>: CR 1 and a lot to like. Immunity to\n\t\tthe two most common non-weapon damage types, plus resistance to Cold damage,\n\t\tmagic resistance, and a respectable 21 hp make the Imp reasonably durable.\n\t\tWith Devil&#8217;s Sight, the ability to turn invisible, a Fly speed, and\n\t\tShape-Shift to both disguise itself and change movement types, it&#8217;s also\n\t\tvery effective as a scout. In combat, the Imp&#8217;s sting attack does a\n\t\trespectable 13 average damage, though poison damage is commonly resisted, so\n\t\tit&#8217;s not a fantastic option.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You may be better served by casting Darkness on an object, sending your\n\t\t\tfamiliar to carry the Darkness effect over your enemies, then using\n\t\t\tDevil&#8217;s Sight to attack them. If you&#8217;re worried about your familiar&#8217;s\n\t\t\tsafety, cast Darkness on an object hanging from a string, and have your\n\t\t\timp dangle it down from above like a weird, aggressive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mariowiki.com\/Lakitu#Super_Mario_64_.2F_Super_Mario_64_DS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lakitu<\/a>.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pseudodragon<\/span>: With only 10 hit points\n\t\tand no damage resistances, the Pseudodragon is extremely frail, though\n\t\tBlindsight and Sting offer some tempting options. The Pseudodragon&#8217;s Sting\n\t\tcan poison enemies for a full hour, and could even knock them unconscious.\n\t\tHowever, it targets a Constitution save, and Constitution saves are\n\t\tconsistently high. Even with Investment of the Chain Master. you can&#8217;t rely\n\t\ton it, and without an easy way for your pseudodragon to move in and out of\n\t\tmelee safely, it&#8217;s dangerous for your familiar to actually use. Despite how\n\t\teffective Sting can be if it works, the unreliability, the Pseudodragon&#8217;s\n\t\tpoor durability, and its comparably poor scouting options make it a poor\n\t\tchoice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quasit<\/span>: CR 1, and plenty durable. 25 hp,\n\t\tthree damage resistances, and immunity to poison. The Quasit can also change\n\t\tits movement options with Shape-Shift, making it fantastically versatile.\n\t\tWith +5 Stealth and the ability to turn invisible at will, it&#8217;s also an\n\t\texcellent scout. The Quasit isn&#8217;t an obvious combat threat since its single\n\t\tattack doesn&#8217;t deal much damage, but making a target Poisoned without a save\n\t\tis a huge debuff for many enemies, which is worth the relatively poor\n\t\tdamage, especially at high levels where other familiars&#8217; damage feels less\n\t\timpactful. The Quasit&#8217;s Scare feature won&#8217;t be much use without Investment\n\t\tof the Chain Master.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skeleton<\/span>: It can use equipment like\n\t\tweapons, it has Darkvision, and it&#8217;s immune to fatigue. But it also had 13\n\t\tgp and its attacks are underwhelming. This isn&#8217;t a combat pet, and it\n\t\tcertainly isn&#8217;t a scout. Its best advantages are its ability to use objects,\n\t\tto carry things for you, and to keep watch without getting tired.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slaad Tadpole<\/span>: With 5 damage resistances\n\t\tand Magic Resistance, the Slaad Tadpole seems very tanky until you notice\n\t\tits 7 hit points. The tadpole&#8217;s biggest advantage is that it&#8217;s the only\n\t\toption with a burrow speed. But with no hands, it can&#8217;t do much more than\n\t\tburrow to a place, look around, and maybe deliver touch spells.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sphinx of Wonder<\/span>: 24 hp, 3 damage\n\t\tresistances, one attack dealing 12 average damage, flight, 24 hp, and Magic\n\t\tResistance all make your sphinx an appealing combatant. It&#8217;s proficient in\n\t\tArcana and Religion, and can speak, making it a useful substitute for\n\t\tproficiency in those skills. On top of that, Burst of Ingenuity can help you\n\t\tand your allies pass crucial saving throws, thought it does need to be\n\t\tapplied when you make the saving throw rather than after you see the result.\n\t\tNo other familiar options ha similar proficiencies or support options,\n\t\tgiving the Sphinx of Wonder an exciting niche.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Where the Sphinx of Wonder falls short is as a scout. Despite proficiency\n\t\t\tin Stealth, without the ability to turn invisible, it can&#8217;t compete on\n\t\t\tscouting with options like the Imp or the Sprite. If your party has an\n\t\t\teffective scout already, that may not be an issue. Just be prepared to\n\t\t\thave your familiar run away and hide in combat if it takes any damage at\n\t\t\tall. 24 hit points doesn&#8217;t go very far beyond low levels.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sprite<\/span>: Flight, invisibility at will,\n\t\tgood Perception and Stealth modifiers, and it can speak three languages.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s notably the only option added by Pact of the Chain with proficiency in\n\t\tPerception. Heart Sight seems interesting, but you could arguably use an\n\t\tInsight check for the same purpose. The Sprite&#8217;s bow attack automatically\n\t\tcharms its target on hit, but that only prevents the target from attacking\n\t\tthe sprite. This is a great scout, but it is not a combat pet.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Venomous Snake<\/span>: 10 feet of blindsight, a\n\t\tswim speed, and a passable attack. If you want blindsight, get a bat.

Hex has some overlap with Bestow Curse,\n\tproviding a similar debuff to ability scores and a similar damage buff, but\n\tHex doesn&#8217;t allow the target a saving throw and allows you to move the spell\n\tbetween targets so you get considerably more benefit from your tiny number of\n\tspell slots.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tomb-of-levistusxgte\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tomb of Levistus<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n<p>This is a passable panic option, and at 10 temporary hit points per warlock\n\tlevel, it should be able to absorb basically anything that hits you unless\n\tyou&#8217;re fighting something with a CR well above your level.
