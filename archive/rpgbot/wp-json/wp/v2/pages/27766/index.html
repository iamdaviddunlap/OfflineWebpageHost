Unique among other classes, Monks usually fight unarmed and unarmored, using their incredible capabilities to perform superhuman acts of athleticism and skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Monks are excellent Strikers, and can serve as a Defender or a Scout depending on your build. Certain subclasses also introduce Blaster, Healer, and Support capabilities, allowing monks to thrive in new roles depending on your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Monk can be difficult to play compared to the Fighter or the Rogue. They are the most MAD (multiple ability dependent) class in DnD 5e, needing three high ability scores to function effectively with very little room to ignore any of them. Monks also lean heavily into using Bonus Actions right from level 1, which can be briefly confusing for new players who are still acclimating to the game&#8217;s mechanics. Subclasses can introduce additional complexity to the class, but that complexity also brings a lot of diversity and a lot of fun options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>You might also enjoy our other supporting content:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/monk\/monk-subclasses\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28275\">2024 DnD Monk Subclasses Guide<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dd-2024-phb-monk-changes-monks-are-scary-now-guys-and-i-love-that-rpgbot-podcast-s4e92\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28959\">D&amp;D 2024 PHB MONK CHANGES: Monks are scary now guys\u2026 And I love that! \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E92<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD 5e rules.

At high levels, Disciplined survivor gives you proficiency in all saves and lets you reroll any failed save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: No armor, no shields, and\n\tnot a lot of weapons. You&#8217;re expected to use &#8220;monk weapons&#8221;, which are defined\n\tunder the Martial Arts entry. Essentially you&#8217;ll be using a 1d6 weapon with\n\tVersatile until level 10 (which means either a quarterstaff or a spear), then\n\tyou&#8217;ll use Unarmed Strikes from then on unless you&#8217;ve found a magic weapon.\n\tMonks get the typical 2 skills, and the Monk skill list includes a lot of\n\tmediocre options which depend on abilities which Monks don&#8217;t generally need\n\tand therefore can&#8217;t afford to invest in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Martial Arts<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s signature feature.<\/strong>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Unarmed Strike<\/span>: Twice as many attacks as normal right from level 1, and, unlike two-weapon fighting, you get to add your ability modifier to the damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Martial Arts Die<\/span>: This scales slowly, but at high levels it&#8217;s pretty great. At low levels you&#8217;ll do more damage using a quarterstaff or a spear 2-handed for the 1d8 damage die, but that won&#8217;t help your Bonus Unarmed Strike.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dexterous Attacks<\/span>: Using unarmed strikes to Grapple and Shove enemies is a central tactic for the Monk. Be sure to consider the Grappler and Tavern Brawler feats, which makes Grapple\/Shove even easier.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmored Defense<\/span>: At low levels, having an AC of at most 16 is a major vulnerability for the Monk. You&#8217;ll need to rely heavily on Patient Defense and on Deflect Attacks to stay alive. At high levels, once your Dexterity and Wisdom have increased, you can match the AC of a character in full plate and using a shield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Monk&#8217;s Focus<\/span>: Focus Points are the Monk&#8217;s limited resource pool, fueling your most powerful class features. You get 1 per Monk level, and they recharge on a Short Rest, but it&#8217;s still very easy to feel starved for resources. You can&#8217;t afford to use a Focus Point every turn until you&#8217;re high level, so learn to use them when it will have a major mechanical impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Blows<\/span>: The go-to use for your Focus Points. Try to use this when you&#8217;ll get a lot of value, such as when you&#8217;ll have Advantage on your attacks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Patient Defense<\/span>: Disengage for free means that you can safely move through combat without provoking Opportunity Attacks. This will let you get out of dangerous situations and also let you reach high-priority enemies who are trying to hide behind their allies. Spending a FP to also Dodge is a powerful defensive option, especially when you&#8217;re expecting to draw more attacks than you can handle with Deflect Attacks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Step of the Wind<\/span>: Dash as a Bonus Action means that range will rarely be an issue for you, especially as Unarmored Movement scales. Also Disengaging for a FP allows you to move about the battlefield quickly and unimpeded.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmored Movement<\/span>: On its own, additional movement isn&#8217;t always impactful. It&#8217;s great for rushing into melee since the Monk is a nearly melee-only class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you lean into grappling, your exceptional movement speed offers another tactical option: dragging enemies out of combat. Once you&#8217;re grappling a creature, you can move the grapple at half speed, bringing grappled creatures with you. As your speed increases, the distance which you can drag enemies grows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding Step of the Wind doubles your distance at no resource cost, allowing you to move your full speed. You may be able to drag enemies so far out of combat that it will take them multiple turns to return, which you and your incredible speed can race back into battle on your next turn. If you have attacks remaining, you can Shove them prone, forcing then to spend half of their movement to stand before limping back toward the battle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding the Grappler feat removes the half speed issue, making this tactic even more powerful. If you get fast enough you can grab one or two foes, run them out of range, then run back into combat all on the same turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Uncanny Metabolism<\/span>: Once per day recover your FP and a few hit points. This is a huge help with managing your limited pool of Focus Points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Deflect Attacks<\/span>: This is crazy powerful. The scaling damage reduction will scale faster than the amount of damage dealt by most single attacks, but remember that this only affects a single attack per round. Creatures with Multiattack will be able to hit you multiple times. The ability to redirect damage is neat, too, but using that point for Flurry of Blows may be more impactful, especially once you get Heightened Focus at level 10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Monk subclasses are briefly summarized below.

Constitution saves are the highest saving throw on average, which makes them unreliable, but robbing a target of their turn at the cost of 1 FP is frequently worth that gamble. Consider which is more impactful: 1 more attack with Flurry of Blows, or a 50\/50 chance that the target won&#8217;t get their next turn and that your whole party can spend the next round attacking them with Advantage?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>6. <span class=\"rating-green\">Empowered Strikes<\/span>: Converting your unarmed strike damage to Force damage will let you bypass damage resistances, but it also locks you out of feats like Crusher which otherwise offer some really fun tactical options. Unfortunately, resistance to Bludgeoning\/Piercing\/Slashing damage becomes increasingly common as you gain levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>7. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: With proficiency in Dexterity saves and high Dexterity, you&#8217;ll hardly ever take damage from things like breath weapons and fireballs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>9. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Acrobatic Movement<\/span>: Running across water is very cool, but rarely matters. Running up walls isn&#8217;t quite a climb speed, but it&#8217;s pretty close, and it notably doesn&#8217;t require the use of your hands like climbing does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember our trick with dragging enemies out of combat? There&#8217;s nothing stopping you from doing that across water or up\/down a wall. You could run enemies 100 feet up a huge wall, drop them for 10d6 falling damage, then run back down the wall and wait for them at the bottom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Focus<\/span>: Monk&#8217;s Focus was already great, and now it gets even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Blows<\/span>: 3 attacks as a Bonus Action in a damage where most martial characters are excited to get 2 attacks as an Action.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Patient Defense<\/span>: Add some Temporary Hit Points when you spend a Focus Point. These points don&#8217;t have a listed duration, so they last until you finish a Long Rest. Make sure that you never walk into an encounter without THP, and if you go into a Short Rest with spare FP, spend them on Patient Defense to repeatedly reroll the dice to get as much THP as possible.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Step of the Wind<\/span>: Bring a friend along when you spend a Focus Point with Step of the Wind. If you grapple two allies, you could drag three friends along with you at once!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>10. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Self-Restoration<\/span>: Charmed, Frightened, and Poisoned are all very common debuffs. Many creatures&#8217; special abilities will make you Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned, then also apply other nasty effects while you&#8217;re under that effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13. <span class=\"rating-green\">Deflect Energy<\/span>: Attacks which don&#8217;t deal any Bludgeoning\/Piercing\/Slashing damage are rare, and they come almost exclusively from spellcasters. That said, they still exist, and spellcasters become increasing common as you reach high levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Disciplined Survivor<\/span>: A massive defense against anything that calls for a saving throw.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfect Focus<\/span>: This guarantees that you never go into combat without some points to spend. 4 isn&#8217;t much, but in low-difficulty encounters, it&#8217;s plenty. You can&#8217;t use this at the same time as Uncanny Metabolism, so save Uncanny Metabolism for more important fights. You can also use this as an excuse to spend leftover FP on Patient Defense to reroll repeatedly for Temporary Hit Points if you finish an encounter with 4 or fewer FP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>18. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Superior Defense<\/span>: If you&#8217;re expecting to take damage in any significant amount, this is great. It notably doesn&#8217;t cover Force damage, but Force damage is exceptionally rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Body and Mind<\/span>: A massive mathematical boost. +2 to attack and damage, +2 to your save DC&#8217;s, and +4 to AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-monk-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Monk Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Monk starting equipment makes a spear the monk\u2019s default weapon.

When you spend a FP, you can also bring a friend with you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Self-restoration. New. Mostly replaces Purity of Body, but notably doesn\u2019t affect diseases.

Allows Deflect Attacks to work against any damage type instead of just B\/P\/S.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Disciplined Survivor. Renamed from Diamond Soul.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>15. Perfect Focus.
