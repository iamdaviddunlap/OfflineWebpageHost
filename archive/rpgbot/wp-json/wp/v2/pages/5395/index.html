You\n\tmight also use the Unchained Rogue, which gives Rogues easy access to skill\n\tunlocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I recommend allowing both the Signature Skill feat and the\n\tUnchained Rogue. There is a huge variance in the quality of skill unlocks, and\n\tgranting them for free to everyone disproportionately rewards a subset of\n\tcharacters who frequently take the skills with the best unlocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"acrobatics\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/acrobatics#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Acrobatics<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The options for acrobatics are too situational to justify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">5 Ranks<\/span>: Moving around in combat,\n\t\tespecially by means of Acrobatics, isn&#8217;t something which is done frequently.\n\t\tPathfinder&#8217;s combat is very static, and there are extremely few builds which\n\t\tbreak that norm. Those builds rarely lean on Acrobatics, and instead tend to\n\t\tfocus on options like the Mobility feat or abilities which prevent attacks\n\t\tof opportunity without requiring a skill check.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">10 Ranks<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">15 Ranks<\/span>:Situational, but nice to\n\t\thave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">20 Ranks<\/span>: At level 20 options for permanent\n\t\tflight are cheap and abundant.

The\n\t\t-10 penalty sounds like a lot, but skills scale much faster than saving\n\t\tthrows, so your bonus may be decent the one or two times in your life that\n\t\tthis comes up.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">20 Ranks<\/span>: Only useful if your character\n\t\treally likes to steal from people, and even then your best bet is probably\n\t\tSleight of Hand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bluff\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/bluff#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Bluff<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Only bluff&#8217;s 20 rank ability is worth of consideration.

At mid and high levels flight becomes prominent and important, which makes climb functionally useless. Skill unlocks only manage to emphasize this disparity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5 Ranks<\/span>:Very situational.

There are options to make magic item crafting available to non-casters using Craft, but they&#8217;re all terrible compared to regular magic item crafting. Poison crafters might be able to make use of Craft&#8217;s skill unlocks, especially since Rogues make up a disproportionate section of the poison-using population. Poison is very expensive, which means that it takes a long time to craft, and combining the 5-rank and 15-rank unlocks effectively multiplies your craft speed by 14. Combined with the existing rule which allows you to willingly increase your craft DC by 10, you can churn out poisons at a dizzying rate. Unfortunately, none of the unlocks do anything to address the problematic cost of poisons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5 Ranks<\/span>: Functionally doubles your craft\n\t\tspeed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">10 Ranks<\/span>: By this level it should be nearly\n\t\timpossible to fail a craft check.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">15 Ranks<\/span>: Multiply your crafting speed by\n\t\t7.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">20 Ranks<\/span>: Blacksmithing, the most\n\t\tversatile craft skill in the game, now allows you to partially replace both\n\t\tCraft Magic Arms and Armor, Forge Ring, and big chunks of Craft Wondrous\n\t\tItem. Combined with the 5-rank and 15-rank abilities you can churn out magic\n\t\titems at a fair pace, possibly even faster than the normal 1000gp per day\n\t\tcraft speed typical of magic item crafting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"diplomacy\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/diplomacy#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Diplomacy<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Diplomacy enthusiasts like it because it&#8217;s a great way to get out of a potentially lethal situation. The 10-rank and 15-rank abilities both play to this very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5 Ranks<\/span>: This is generally something done\n\t\tin narrative time, so this will likely never matter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">10 Ranks<\/span>: Influencing a creature in one\n\t\tround is a good way to diffuse a combat, and reducing the penalty to do so\n\t\tfrom -20 to -19 is pretty great. The improve duration for a shifted attitude\n\t\twill rarely matter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">15 Ranks<\/span>: Removing the penalty entirely\n\t\tmeans that you can likely diffuse every combat with a sentient creature with\n\t\twhich you share a language. The improve duration for a shifted attitude will\n\t\trarely matter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">20 Ranks<\/span>: This will rarely have an\n\t\teffect on gameplay.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"disable-device\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/disable-device#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Disable Device<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The skill unlocks for Disable Device pertain exclusively to traps, which makes sense, but they&#8217;re really no good enough to make them interesting. The unlocks either allow you to disable traps faster or mitigate failure to disable a small subset of traps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5 Ranks<\/span>: Disarming a trap is typically done\n\t\tin narrative time, so this rarely matters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">10 Ranks<\/span>: If you don&#8217;t have Trapfinding but\n\t\tyou&#8217;re taking Disable Device ranks, you are wasting your skill ranks. If you\n\t\tdo have Trapfinding, you shouldn&#8217;t plan to fail checks to disable traps. If\n\t\tyou fail, suffer the consequences of failure and get on with your life.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">15 Ranks<\/span>: This is both dumb and bad. How\n\t\texactly does a Disable Device check protect you from things like arrows or\n\t\tdarts?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">20 Ranks<\/span>: The ability to disable a trap as\n\t\tan immediate action means that the most time-effective way to disable traps\n\t\twhich make attack rolls is to intentionally trigger them. This requires the\n\t\t15-rank unlock, so Rogues will likely want to skip this rather than spend\n\t\ttwo of their four free unlocks for a single situational ability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"disguise\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/disguise#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Disguise<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy a Hat of Diguise; it gets you nearly all of the same benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5 Ranks<\/span>: Creating a disguise is typically\n\t\tdone with magic in a single action or in narrative time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">10 Ranks<\/span>: See above.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">15 Ranks<\/span>: See above.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">20 Ranks<\/span>: See above.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"escape-artist\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/escape-artist#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Escape Artists<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you care about Escape Artist this much, you need to get Freedom of Movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">5 Ranks<\/span>: Situational.

You get a +8 bonus just for having a fly speed, so one rank and the class skill bonus gives you a comfortable +12 bonus (before your ability score), which will get you through most effects in the game which call for Fly checks. The Fly skill unlocks make you more able to change direction in the air, and allow you better resist pesky wind effects, so in games with a lot of flight and counter-flight effects, they can be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">5 Ranks<\/span>: Situational, and rarely\n\t\timportant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">10 Ranks<\/span>: Climbing faster is nice, but the\n\t\tability to better handle mid-air collisons is ridiculously situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">15 Ranks<\/span>: Being treated as one size\n\t\tlarger can be important when enemies start bringing spells which prevent\n\t\tenemies from flying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">20 Ranks<\/span>: Two sizes larger will make a\n\t\tmedium creature nearly immune to wind effects, and flying straight up at\n\t\tfull speed is a great way to get a tactical advantage over other flying\n\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"handle-animal\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/handle-animal#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Handle Animal<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Handle Animal is used almost exclusively for Animal Companions, and the skill unlocks reflect that.

Training\n\t\ttypically happens off-screen during narrative time, so doing it faster\n\t\trarely matters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">20 Ranks<\/span>: By this level Druids and Hunters\n\t\tcan cast Speak With Animals easily.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"heal\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/heal#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Heal<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 3.5 Heal was a joke skill on par with Use Rope. You took it to qualify for shitty feats and prestige classes. In Pathfinder the &#8220;Treat Deadly Wounds&#8221; option makes Heal a fantastic and cost-effective way to boost your party&#8217;s healing abilities. Heal&#8217;s skill unlocks further improve the Treat Deadly Wounds to provide additional healing. The max DC you need to hit is 25, which is fairly easy with a few ranks, decent Wisdom, and items. Beyond that, skill unlocks are the only reason to continue investing ranks. Each unlock provides a better version of the same effect, so I believe the intent is that they do not stack, though the rules don&#8217;t say so specifically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5 Ranks<\/span>: 2 hp per hit die, and 2 ability\n\t\tdamage off of each damaged ability.

Using Intimidate to demoralize a foe is standard action, which makes it hard to justify in most fights, but many abilities allow you to use it for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5 Ranks<\/span>: Beating the Intimidate DC by 10\n\t\twill be hard, especially at low levels, but 1 round of making an enemy\n\t\tfrightened will keep them from attacking you for a round. Fear stacking\n\t\tbuilds may be able to repeat this effect several times,\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">10 Ranks<\/span>: Panicked is fantastic. It causes\n\t\tenemies to flee, which frequently means free attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">15 Ranks<\/span>: Beating the Intimidate DC by 20\n\t\tis hard, but with a bit of optimization (items, skill focus, etc.) you may\n\t\tbe able to do it reasonably often. Cowering foes are considered helpless,\n\t\twhich means that they can be killed with a coup de grace. Unfortunately the\n\t\t1 round duration means that the effect ends at the start of your next turn,\n\t\tso you will need help from an ally.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">20 Ranks<\/span>: Cowering for 1d4 rounds means\n\t\tthat three fourths of the time you can coup de grace targets all by\n\t\tyourself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"knowledge\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/skills\/knowledge#Unchained-Skill-Unlock\">Knowledge<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important uses of Knowledge skills is the ability to identify enemies, and the Knowledge skill unlocks play to this very nicely. Unfortunately, selecting Knowledge with Signature Skill only applies to a single knowledge skill, and unless you face that creature type almost exclusively you&#8217;re not going to get a lot of use out of your Knowledge unlocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">5 Ranks<\/span>: It&#8217;s hard to rate this one because there is\n\t\tso little concrete guidance on what information to give when a player makes\n\t\ta knowledge check to identify a crature.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">10 Ranks<\/span>: This looks a lot like\n\t\tKnowledge Devotion from 3.5, which was a great feat for intelligent martial\n\t\tcharacters like the Duskblade, and works great in Pathfinder for the Magus.\n\t\tUnfortunately, since Signature Skill and Rogue&#8217;s Edge only work on a single\n\t\tskill, this is really only useful if your group allows everyone to use skill\n\t\tunlocks for free.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">15 Ranks<\/span>: Knowledge is very important,\n\t\tand failing to identify a monster can be the difference between life and\n\t\tdeath.

Even stealing items can be done as a Combat Maneuver, making Sleight of Hand that much less useful. The first unlock allows you to combine a Steal maneuver with a Sleight of Hand check for a paltry bonus, and the rest of the unlocks all pertain to quickly drawing hidden weapons, which only a handful of Rogues will ever care to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">5 Ranks<\/span>: I hate that there is both the\n\t\tSteal maneuver and the Sleight of Hand check to steal things from people.
