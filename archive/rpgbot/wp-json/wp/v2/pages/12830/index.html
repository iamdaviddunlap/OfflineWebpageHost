Most other subclasses are some kind of paragon of martial and physical excellence (Eldritch and Rune Knights aside, but they have very tangible, intuitive sources of their power). The Echo Knight is a wild departure. It\u2019s a very <em>fun<\/em> departure, however, and it\u2019s that very distinct flavor that has helped it capture the imaginations of players since its release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, Echo Knight is a powerhouse. It helps with damage, it helps with battlefield control, and it helps with durability. With a little optimizing, you can take these features and be a very strong performer in several fields, but I think the place it really shines is as a way to deliver melee attacks to something you aren\u2019t within reach of, a feature that largely isn\u2019t balanced for in DnD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Echo Knight Fighter Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#echo-knight-fighter-ability-scores\">Echo Knight Fighter Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#echo-knight-fighter-races\">Echo Knight Fighter Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#echo-knight-fighter-feats\">Echo Knight Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#echo-knight-fighter-weapons\">Echo Knight Fighter Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#echo-knight-fighter-armor\">Echo Knight Fighter Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-dioscuri\">Example Build &#8211; Dioscuri<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Get really comfortable using it, because\n\t\tit&#8217;s going to take your Bonus Action to recreate if need be for the rest of your career. You\n\t\tcan move your echo for free once per turn in addition to recreating it in a\n\t\tnew place or switching places with it, and unlike moving your own character,\n\t\tyour echo doesn&#8217;t have specific movement types so you can move it 30 feet in\n\t\tany direction,\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/1242507818986422272\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">including vertically into the air<\/a>!\n\t\t<p>Remember that your echo disappears if you move too far away, but it costs\n\t\t\tyou nothing except a Bonus Action to recreate, so in many cases it may be\n\t\t\tmore effective to intentionally walk away from your Echo and recreate it\n\t\t\tthan to try to move it along with you. You can also teleport to switch\n\t\t\tplaces with your echo, allowing you to escape grapples, difficult terrain,\n\t\t\tand bindings with little effort (though it does also cost part of your\n\t\t\tmovement for the turn). There is no limitation on how often you can create\n\t\t\tyour echo, so recreating it every round is basically expected\nif yours has been destroyed by an attack or moved too far away.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There is some confusion around how this works since the Grappled\n\t\t\tcondition reduces your speed to 0, which means that you don&#8217;t have 15 feet\n\t\t\tof movement to spend. I think RAI you&#8217;re intended to be able to teleport\n\t\t\tout of a grapple, but RAW you definitely can&#8217;t since the effect doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tspecify a rules exception around grapples the way that the spell Freedom\n\t\t\tof Movement does. That said, Jeremy Crawford had a\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/932413630305275904\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discussion on Twitter<\/a>\n\t\t\tin which he discusses Freedom of Movement&#8217;s interaction with the Grapple\n\t\t\trules. He points out that once you&#8217;re no longer grappled, your speed is no\n\t\t\tlonger 0, so it makes sense that you could pay the 5-foot cost to escape a\n\t\t\tgrapple using Freedom of Movement even though your speed is 0 when you do\n\t\t\tso. We can apply that same logic to the Echo&#8217;s teleportation, and so long\n\t\t\tas you will have 15 feet of movement to spend after teleporting you can\n\t\t\tpay the cost. However, the Echo Knight&#8217;s text doesn&#8217;t specify an exception\n\t\t\tto the grapple rules, so it&#8217;s not perfectly clear. Discuss this with your\n\t\t\tDM to see how they would like to handle things.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Manifest Echo doesn&#8217;t specify, but\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/1240669629661380609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the echo is an object<\/a>. It can be targeted by things like attacks and spells, but weirdly RAW\n\t\t\tthat means that it can&#8217;t be targeted or damaged by many spells. Even\n\t\t\toptions like Meteor Swarm RAW only damage creatures, but I think a\n\t\t\treasonable DM will rule that the echo qualifies as a valid target for such\n\t\t\tthings and takes damage appropriately. This thing is already insanely\n\t\t\tpowerful, and it doesn&#8217;t need broad immunity to damage to keep it\n\t\t\tpowerful.\nIf that&#8217;s the case though, it also makes it a valid target for beneficial spells like Shield of Faith, Blur, etc. That means that it&#8217;s a valid target for Sanctuary, which is busted because the Echo never actually attacks, it just allows you to use its location.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Unleash Incarnation<\/span>: Up to 5 extra\n\t\tattacks per day.

That\n\t\tmeans that you can&#8217;t send your Echo Avatar to attack people according to\n\t\tCrawford, but apparently it&#8217;s not enough of a problem that WotC actually\n\t\tcares to correct it, so RAW you can send your echo a few hundred feet into\n\t\tthe air and rain arrows on everything in range.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Martyr<\/span>: In many ways this is like\n\t\tthe Protection fighting style, but it works on any creature you can see.\n\t\tLimiting use to once per rest means that you need to be cautious about when\n\t\tyou use it, and save it for when it will be really impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reclaim Potential<\/span>: With just 1 hit point\n\t\tyour echo is going to die constantly if it&#8217;s targeted, so this is an easy way to get\n\t\ttemporary hit points whenever you don&#8217;t have them. 2d6+Con is a decent\n\t\tamount, too, and you get enough uses per day that it&#8217;s a significant\n\t\timprovement to your total capacity to endure damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Legion of One<\/span>: Two echos means that you\n\t\tcan fill two additional spaces on the battlefield, offering additional\n\t\tchances to make Opportunity Attacks, and creating more targets to draw\n\t\tattacks which would otherwise be directed at you and your allies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"echo-knight-fighter-ability-scores\">Echo Knight Fighter Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Likely your primary attack stat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: We should be wearing heavy armor unless you\u2019re choosing to use finesse weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: As Rocco is fond of saying, dying is suboptimal.

Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t allow this at my table because you can use the Echo as the location to attack from, and dragonborn breath can be used in place of an attack when you take the Attack action but is not, itself, an attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With those in mind, nothing different than any other Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"echo-knight-fighter-feats\">Echo Knight Fighter Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Since the echo allows us to make opportunity attacks when things leave its safety donut (note that this ability requires the target to be adjacent to your echo and then leave that area, regardless of your weapon\u2019s actual reach.

The wording on Echo Knight is that <em>you<\/em> can make attacks originating from its location. This means that if <em>you<\/em> are hidden from your target but can still see them, the attack will have advantage, even though this is intuitively nonsense because the Echo is right next to them and actually delivering the attack.

If something tries to walk away from it, use your maul as a kneecap buster.<br><br>Unleash Incarnation is already good, but it will get even better in a few levels.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4- Fighter 4<\/td><td>Crusher (+1 Str)<\/td><td>Alright, step one online. Our Echo is next to something. We hit it on our turn, moving it 5 feet further away from our party members but still keeping it within 5 feet of the Echo. Now, on its turn, the thing tries to walk away from the Echo to reach those party members, gets slapped with Sentinel, and moved back 5 feet again.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5- Fighter 5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<\/td><td>Whack, Whack.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6- Fighter 6<\/td><td>ASI- Str 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>As mentioned above, getting ahead of the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">fundamental math<\/a> since otherwise we\u2019d be behind for three levels and accuracy is about to get a whole lot more important.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7- Barbarian 1<\/td><td>Rage<br>Unarmored Defense<\/td><td>By now, you should have been able to afford the switch from chainmail to half plate so that we can use Rage without losing any AC.<br><br>Rage is an excellent feature, even if we don\u2019t use it to the fullest. The resistance is nice, although hopefully we\u2019re still locking the scariest things down with the tactics described above. We do very much appreciate the damage bonus, because we make all the attacks, even if they come from the Echo\u2019s location. We don\u2019t really make a ton of Strength checks, but that\u2019s ok.<br><br>Unarmored defense, on the other hand, does nothing for us at all.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8- Barbarian 2<\/td><td>Reckless Attack<br>Danger Sense<\/td><td>Ok, so here\u2019s the pedantic wording starting to come into play. <em>You<\/em> have advantage on strength-based attacks. <em>You<\/em> make the attacks, but from the Echo\u2019s location. Attacks made against <em>you<\/em> (your Echo is not you) have advantage. Swing Recklessly, safe in the knowledge that whatever your Echo is next to will have to either get Sentineled when it tries to walk to you, or maybe won\u2019t even get the chance. Because the cost of breaking the 30ft distance to your Echo is so low, if your target has a lot of attacks and could afford to put a small one into the Echo before moving over and delivering the rest into you, you can just put it in a place to attack, attack, then simply walk out of its range.<br><br>Another great thing about Reckless Attack is that, if we crit, which now has about a 19% chance of happening on any given turn, we\u2019ll grant advantage on attacks against the target to our whole team.<br><br>Advantage on (most) Dexterity saves is almost as good as proficiency.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9- Barbarian 3<\/td><td>Ancestral Protectors<\/td><td>The culmination of all of our arts. Now, when you attack through your Echo while raging, the target has disadvantage on attacking anything that isn\u2019t you, including said Echo. If it tries to walk away to get to the real twin, it gets attacked and held in place by Sentinel. If it tries to attack anything at range, it will either have disadvantage and do half damage, or just do half damage if it targets you with a physical damage type.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10- Fighter 7<\/td><td>Echo Avatar<\/td><td>No combat effects, but we described its utility for scouting, etc. above under the subclass features. With that said, the wording on the ability to swap places with the Echo should still work when you&#8217;re inhabiting it so this could be a way to walk your Echo hundreds of feet up a mountain and then trade places with it, overcoming most of the need for flight in non-tactical situations. Do keep in mind, though, when you do this, you&#8217;re still using the Echo&#8217;s senses. This means you either need to end the inhabit as soon as you teleport so you can see what&#8217;s going on around you (which also strands you there) or deal with the fact that you&#8217;re deaf and blind in this new location.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11- Fighter 8<\/td><td>Great Weapon Master<\/td><td>Probably avoid taking the penalty until you hit on any given turn so that you make sure you\u2019re applying the Ancestral Protectors. After that, though, go nuts. Since you\u2019re permanently advantaged, you have much less of a problem with taking the -5 to hit. Also, on any turn where you don\u2019t have to resummon the Echo, you have a 1\/5th chance of critting and getting to attack again as a bonus action (or if you kill something).<br><br>For a little bit of math on that, a regular attack against the fundamental math has a 65% chance to hit. An attack with the penalty and advantage from Reckless Attack is nearly identical, 64% or so. But if you don\u2019t take the penalty and just swing with advantage, it\u2019s an 88% chance to hit.<br><br>Now, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/great-weapon-master-sharpshooter\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/great-weapon-master-sharpshooter\/\">as Rocco pointed out<\/a>, the DPR still goes up in this case but not by an enormous amount, and we\u2019re really interested in making sure at least one attack lands so we get the Ancestral Protectors debuff going.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12- Fighter 9<\/td><td>Indomitable<\/td><td>Try to save it for something that would end your Rage like a movement-impairing\/charm\/banish effect.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13- Fighter 10<\/td><td>Shadow Martyr<\/td><td>Do you really need to give your friend a way to evade an attack? Throw your Echo under the bus. It\u2019s ok, your sibling is already in limbo, bouncing in and out for a second shouldn\u2019t phase them much.<br><br>This is also a good way to move your Echo across the battlefield outside your turn if, for example, the thing it was next to died and you want to apply its Sentinel aura somewhere else.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14- Fighter 11<\/td><td>Extra Extra Attack<\/td><td>Whack, Whack, Whack. Now our chance of getting a crit in a turn is up to 26.5%. This will apply the Crusher debuff to the target and let us swing again. If we cleave something to death and get an opportunity attack trigger, that goes up to a staggering 40% chance of a crit in a round.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15- Fighter 12<\/td><td>Gift of the Chromatic Dragon<\/td><td>Need help killing a troll? Got a round with nothing to do with your bonus action? Found a monster that\u2019s vulnerable to an energy type? Throw on a buff and have at.<br><br>Also useful is the reaction if we don\u2019t think anything is likely to try to walk away from our Echo, or if something hits us with so big a damage source that we need it anyway.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16- Fighter 13<\/td><td>Indomitable (2 uses)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17- Fighter 14<\/td><td>Chef (+1 Con)<\/td><td>Getting Con up to a round number while also gaining the ability to protect and heal your party a little bit out of combat. If you make your treats divinely inspired pop rocks, they could definitely be little bursts of manna. Just don\u2019t leave them around for so long that they become ancient.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18- Fighter 15<\/td><td>Reclaim Potential<\/td><td>Speaking of temporary hit points, your twin\u2019s light fading from the material world for a moment can now aid you, providing a measure of protection before you get the Echo out again so it can keep being area denial.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19- Fighter 16<\/td><td>Resilient (Wis)<\/td><td>Here, have a +7 on wisdom saves. It\u2019s not all the way to proficiency on the big 3 because Dex still just has advantage, but it\u2019s pretty close.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20- Cleric 1<\/td><td>Cantrips<br>&#8211; Guidance<br>&#8211; Light<br>&#8211; Thaumaturgy<br>Spells Prepared<br>&#8211; Bless<br>&#8211; Detect Poison and Disease<br>&#8211; Healing Word<br>Emboldening Bond<br>Implement of Peace<br>&#8211; Performance<\/td><td>It turns out that, if your capstone wouldn\u2019t be great, but you\u2019re already a fighter so you can\u2019t just take two levels for Action Surge, there\u2019s another good option.<br><br>For your final ascension, you pick up the holy grail of multiclass features: something that only cares about proficiency bonus. Emboldening Bond at this level will let you take your whole party and get swole for 10 minutes at a time, and you can use it more times than you\u2019re likely to have fights in a day. Throw it on some social interactions too for good measure.<br><br>Sadly, neither Sanctuary or Shield of Faith can be used on your Echo because, again, it\u2019s an object, not a creature. You\u2019ve been enjoying the benefits of this all game where it can\u2019t be targeted with many spells, but now it\u2019s slightly inconvenient. So, instead, we take a detect spell no one else is going to bring and just ritual cast it as needed. But also Bless. If you\u2019re running both at once (which is pretty easy given Bond\u2019s many uses per day and long duration), and with Reckless Attack, you have a staggering literal 99% chance to hit against the expected average AC for a CR 20 creature. This could easily be accomplished by walking around with Bond up, using Bless on turn one of combat, Action Surge, walk your Echo into position and go to town. Between proficiency in Con saves and your +4 bonus, you\u2019re incredibly likely to be able to carry that bonus all the way through a fight.<br><br>Also, increase your performance bonus. Maybe it\u2019s a quick performance. Maybe it\u2019s an arts performance. Whatever the case may be, you get a +6 to it now.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Echo Knight almost feels out of place as a fighter subclass, but then again I can\u2019t really think of a better place to put it beyond making a new class and sticking every Gish flavor there.
