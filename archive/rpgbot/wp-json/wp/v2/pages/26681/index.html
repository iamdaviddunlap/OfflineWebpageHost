You will want Boosts to either Strength or Dexterity and to\n\tConstitution, but otherwise your needs will be determined by your specific\n\tbuild. Intelligence and Charisma both make fine dump stats for the Fighter,\n\tbut watch out for Wisdom Flaws, as your Will saves are one of your biggest\n\tweaknesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For melee builds, look for high Ancestry hit points, damage resistances, and\n\tother options to improve your durability.
