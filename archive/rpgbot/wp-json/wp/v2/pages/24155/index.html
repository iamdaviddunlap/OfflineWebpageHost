An Intelligence Boost is a must, but otherwise you can be very flexible, allowing you to explore a wide variety of Ancestry options. Boosts to Attributes which support your saves are also helpful since the Witch&#8217;s defenses are poor. If an Ancestry doesn&#8217;t provide an Intelligence Boost or provides an Intelligence Flaw, remember that you can use the Alternate Ancestry Boosts rule to choose two Free Boosts instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because witches are so ineffective with weapons or unarmed attacks, avoid\n\tAncestry and Heritage options which provide or improve those options. No\n\tamount of familiarity with unusual weaponry or tusks or claws will solve the\n\tWitch&#8217;s proficiency challenges. Witches get access to the Witch&#8217;s Armaments\n\tfeat, and it&#8217;s still not a good idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Like other spellcasters, innate spellcasting can do a great deal to diversify\n\tyour spell options, especially if your innate spellcasting comes from a\n\tdifferent spell list than the one proviced by your Patreon. The remaster rules\n\tupdated spellcasting proficiency so that it&#8217;s no longer separated by\n\tTradition, but innate spellcasting is almost always Charisma-based, so\n\toffensive spells should still be avoided in most cases. Instead, look for\n\tbuffs, utility options, and other spells that don&#8217;t care about your\n\tspellcasting ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic -

An Intelligence Boost is a must, but otherwise you can be very flexible, allowing you to explore a wide variety of Ancestry options. Boosts to Attributes which support your saves are also helpful since the Witch&#8217;s defenses are poor. If an Ancestry doesn&#8217;t provide an Intelligence Boost or provides an Intelligence Flaw, remember that you can use the Alternate Ancestry Boosts rule to choose two Free Boosts instead. Because witches are so ineffective with weapons or unarmed attacks, avoid Ancestry and Heritage options which provide or improve those
