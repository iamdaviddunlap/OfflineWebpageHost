Understanding Wild Shape mostly boils down to understanding what form to take; which forms work, which forms work in specific situations, and which forms just never work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that you can only Wild Shape twice per short rest, and the DMG&#8217;s expectation of a normal adventuring day is 6-8 encounters per day with 2 short rests (See DMG Page 84: &#8220;The Adventuring Day&#8221;), so a single use of Wild Shape often needs to be able to last at least an entire fight on average. You can heal yourself as a bonus action by burning spell slots, which helps, but it&#8217;s very expensive compared to what you can get from casting a spell with that slot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of confusion around the rules of Wild Shape and its interaction with your racial traits and class features.

All of the Elementals in the Monster Manual are CR 5, making them the highest-CR options available to Druid until level 18. However, this option consumes both of your Wild Shapes uses, which can make it a risky choice if you&#8217;re not planning to rest soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Air<\/span>: The Air Elemental&#8217;s biggest draw\n\t\t\tis its ability to fly. The damage is on par with other elementals, and\n\t\t\tWhirlwind is fun but not terribly powerful, so the primary appeal is the\n\t\t\tadditional mobility, and while flight is excellent, it&#8217;s not exactly new\n\t\t\tfor Circle of the Moon.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth<\/span>: Offensively underwhelming, but\n\t\t\tthe highest AC and hit points of the four elemental forms. The Earth\n\t\t\tElemental&#8217;s biggest draws are durability, tremorsense and a burrow speed.\n\t\t\tIt won&#8217;t outshine other elementals in most situations, but it&#8217;s the best\n\t\t\toption if you just need to withstand a bunch of attacks.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire<\/span>: Want to murder everything? Fire\n\t\t\telemental. You can spend your movement walking through enemies to ignite\n\t\t\teverything in the room, then Dash to ignite whatever you didn&#8217;t have\n\t\t\tenough movement to walk over or Slam something that&#8217;s already on fire. If\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;e worried about Opportunity Attacks, Disengage instead and you can run\n\t\t\taround as much as you like.\n\t\t\t<p>If your enemies don&#8217;t douse the fire, they take damage and you win. If\n\t\t\t\tthey spend an Action to douse the fire, you used your movement to cost\n\t\t\t\tthem an action, and you win. There&#8217;s not save to avoid the ability or\n\t\t\t\tanything. This is a mountain of flaming bullshit. Drop it on your foes.\n\t\t\t\tOh, and if they attack you in melee (including by making Opportunity\n\t\t\t\tAttacks when you&#8217;re running around) they take fire damage (unless they\n\t\t\t\thave reach).<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Water<\/span>: Not quite as murdery as the Fire\n\t\t\tElemental, but the ability to grapple, restrain, and drown two creatures\n\t\t\tat the same time while still attacking makes the Water elemental a serious\n\t\t\tthreat. The DC 15 save isn&#8217;t especially high, but it&#8217;s high enough that\n\t\t\tenemies not built around Strength will frequently struggle to pass the\n\t\t\tsave.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unarmored-defense\">Unarmored Defense and Wild Shape<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>A level of Barbarian or Monk to pick up Unarmored Defense goes a long way for Moon Druids because it applies while Wild Shaped, according to <a href=\"\/\/twitter.com\/Acr0ssTh3P0nd\/status\/446889985497903104\">Mike Mearls<\/a>. However, remember that you use the Unarmored Defense calculation in place of your animal form&#8217;s default calculation, so your form&#8217;s &#8220;natural armor&#8221; won&#8217;t stack (again according to <a href=\"\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2015\/06\/01\/unarmored-druid-monk\/\">Sage Advice<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally I like the Monk&#8217;s Unarmored Defense better for a single-level dip because it works on your 20 Wisdom (a consistent +5 to AC) instead of whatever Constitution score your Wild Shape form has, which will range anywhere from 10 to 20, but typically hangs around 15-16. If you plan a single level dip, go for Monk. If you&#8217;re willing to go for 2-3 levels, there&#8217;s a lot to be said for Barbarian.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>AC by Source<\/th><th>&nbsp;<\/th><\/tr><tr><th>Form<\/th><th>CR<\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Brb<\/th><th>Mnk<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Owl<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>11+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Flying Snake<\/td><td>1\/8<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Constrictor Snake<\/td><td>1\/4<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Frog<\/td><td>1\/2<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>11+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ape<\/td><td>1\/2<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Wasp<\/td><td>1\/2<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Reef Shark<\/td><td>1\/2<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>11+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dire Wolf<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Octopus<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>11+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Vulture<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>10+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Constrictor Snake<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Elk<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ankylosaurus<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>11+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Scorpion<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>11+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Spotted Lion<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>12+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Elephant<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>9+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Crocodile<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>9+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Giant Shark<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>10+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Titanothere<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>10+wis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mammoth<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>9+wis<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the Monk&#8217;s version of Unarmored Defense will exceed the Barbarian&#8217;s in almost every case with as little as 16 Wisdom. With 20, it matches or exceeds every AC on the table. However, Barkskin sets your AC to a minimum of 16, which will exceed the AC of almost every form on the table, even with 20 Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>How feats affect you while using Wild Shape can be a bit difficult to interpret. When you use Wild Shape, &#8220;you retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.&#8221; So long as you comply with the other mechanics of Wild Shape (no casting spells, etc.) that&#8217;s really broad. A feat fits into &#8220;other source&#8221; so it works in Wild Shape, again assuming it complies with the other rules of Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some feats have clear effects: Tough increases your own hit points, but Wild Shape specifically says &#8220;When you transform, you assume the beast&#8217;s hit points and Hit Dice.&#8221; Polearm master still works, but unless you Wild Shape into something with hands you&#8217;re not getting much use out of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-164\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n\n\n\n<p>Other feats are less clear. The Dragonborn racial feat Dragon Hide gives you an ability score increase (overriden by Wild Shape; that part is clear), but it&#8217;s not totally clear how the rest of the feat works. The text of the second bullet specifically mentions toughening your scales, so maybe it works for scaled creatures like fish, lizards, and dinosaurs, but not for animals without scales like birds and mammals. The third bullet allows you to grow claws from your fingers, but most animals don&#8217;t have fingers. Do apes and other primates get claws? It&#8217;s not clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, anything which is part of your character&#8217;s body like claws, natural armor, or damage resistances doesn&#8217;t work while in Wild Shape. Anything your character knows, like proficiency in something, specific training granted by a feat like Mobile or Actor, or something inherent to your character&#8217;s personality, culture, or anything else non-physical like the Lucky feat or the halfling Lucky trait should still apply in Wild Shape. But, as in any case where there is a question, your Dungeon Master makes the final decision. Be sure to talk to your DM before making any decisions about your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a few cases we&#8217;ve gotten answers on whether or not feats operate in Wild Shape:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14c - incontent_14 -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-165\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14c - incontent_14 -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Grappler<\/strong>: It works, but it&#8217;s still terrible.\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2016\/11\/22\/does-grappler-feat-work-with-wild-shape\/\">Source.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Tough<\/strong>: Doesn&#8217;t affect your beast form&#8217;s hit points.\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2015\/10\/31\/does-the-tough-feat-have-an-affect-on-shifting-druid\/\">Source.<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Mobile<\/strong>: Probably works.
