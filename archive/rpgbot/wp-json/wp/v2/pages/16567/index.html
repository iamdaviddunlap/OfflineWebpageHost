When Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything was later published, the Artificer and those subclasses were reprinted along with a new fourth subclass. It has remained as such since then: four official subclasses, the least of any class. But did you know that Keith Baker, the original author and creator of Eberron, published a third party supplement not long after Rising from the Last War? This book, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/product\/315887\/Exploring-Eberron?affiliate_id=389627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exploring Eberron<\/a>, contains two new subclasses for the Artificer (as well as one each for Bard, Cleric, Druid and Monk).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In this handbook, we\u2019ll be exploring the Forge Adept subclass for the Artificer, a frontline support combatant. This subclass is similar to the Battle Smith but gives up the go-go dog person sidekick for more personal power with a subclass exclusive Infusion, the Ghaal\u2019Shaarat. While any Artificer can use the Enhance Weapon Infusion to get a magical weapon, this feature does not take up a daily Infusion slot for the Forge Adept.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>One extra Infusion might not sound big, but avoiding the tax that a Battle Smith has to pay by Infusing a weapon to use Intelligence&nbsp; to hit and damage is a big deal. We like to talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math<\/a> quite a lot around here, but we don\u2019t usually explore just how much that math can be tilted sideways with even a +1 weapon. Assuming a four person party with three weapon users, a Forge Adept can get magic weapons on all of them from third level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The math is a little messy, but at lower levels the DPR increase from those weapons is ever so slightly higher than the average +2.5 attack bonus increase from Bless because of the +1 to both hit and damage. With enough other added damage the calculation does swing back into Bless\u2019 favor, but by the time that happens it might be reasonable to spend slots on Bless throughout an adventuring day. Not like anything is stopping you from stacking the pair either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Bill of Materials<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Forge Adept Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#forge-adept-ability-scores\">Forge Adept Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#forge-adept-races\">Forge Adept Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#forge-adept-feats\">Forge Adept Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#forge-adept-weapons\">Forge Adept Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#forge-adept-armor\">Forge Adept Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-forge-adept-build-arsenal\">Example Forge Adept Build &#8211; Arsenal<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

There are plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/tools\/\">nice tools<\/a> to choose from so you\u2019ll find something useful here.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Forge Adept Spells<\/span>: A good mix of Paladin and Cleric spells, with a few Warlock exclusives mixed in as well. These spells lean onto the defensive and supportive side of things, with a few damage options thrown in. This pairs nicely with other Forge Adept features that provide damage elsewhere.<\/li>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: A pair of defensive spells that work well for us, providing either Temporary Hit Points or an increase to AC. These spells would rank higher, but our half slot progression inhibits our ability to upcast.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th Level<\/span>: These spells are ranked orange not because they are bad spells but because they are somewhat more situational options. We could get some mileage out of the damage spell, but it eats up our bonus action for the duration and by this level the damage output is already starting to lag.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: More defensive and restorative spells. In particular, one of these buffs makes us a healer\u2019s best friend, not only for the effect it brings but also that they don\u2019t have to be the one Concentrating on it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th Level<\/span>: A couple of non-Concentration longer duration defensive buffs, the spells at this level are nice but we have so few high-level spell slots. Like before, these are not bad spells, they are just harder to justify using.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">17th level<\/span>: We come to a pair of very strong control options that work well even at this level. It helps that one of these spells is a 5th-level Paladin spell and those were all balanced around being only available at higher levels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battle Ready<\/span>: Exactly the same as the Battle Smith feature of the same name. As long as your weapon is magical, you can use Intelligence instead of Strength or Dexterity. This opens up plenty of possibilities by itself, but it pairs really well with the other 3rd level Forge Adept feature.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghaal&#8217;Shaarat<\/span>: Goblin for \u201cmighty blade.\u201d Put very simply, Ghaal\u2019Shaarat is a special Infusion available to Forge Adepts that gives a weapon a scaling +X bonus as well as the Returning property if it happens to be a Thrown weapon. Where it differs from other Infusions is that it does not count against our Infusion limit and it only functions when held by the Forge Adept. This feature means we don\u2019t sacrifice one of our Infusion choices every day just so Battle Ready can function. Because this eventually reaches +3, which is the value we use when talking about Advantage, it\u2019s somewhat on par with a Reckless Raging Barbarian who can still cast spells.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Because a Forge Adept focuses on fighting with their Ghaal\u2019Shaarat, extra attack is very helpful. Unlike the Battle Smith, the Forge Adept does gain on-hit damage bonuses, but we still have to wait till we\u2019re 9th level to get the first one.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Runes of War<\/span>: AoE Elemental Weapons. While it does use our Concentration, this is a powerful effect in many parties and usable often enough to be available in most fights for the average adventuring day. This is more effective as your party makes additional weapon attacks, so in parties with classes like fighters, monks, and rangers this is great. In parties which rely on big single attacks (rogues, most casters) you will see less benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfect Weapon<\/span>: This has two features. The first benefit is like a reverse Reckless Attack, taking a penalty to our offense to boost our defense. Players of 3.x may recognize this as the Defending magic weapon property or Combat Expertise. The second benefit is one of two persistent upgrades to the Ghaal\u2019Shaarat that can be changed every morning after a long rest, one defensive and one offensive. Both are welcome additions that help keep us relevant at this level of combat.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"forge-adept-ability-scores\">Forge Adept Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Forge Adept doesn\u2019t stray from the typical spread laid out in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/#ability-scores\">Artificer Handbook<\/a>.

Armor of Agathys can give us temporary hit points to increase our durability. Temporary hp is nice to have even as a ranged build.<br><br>Shield of Faith is an extra +2 AC that can be placed on a target. Good for all kinds of situations.<br><br>We can switch from Shortbow to Maul now thanks to the martial weapon proficiency. We\u2019ll also be ahead of Fundamental Math because of the Ghaal\u2019Shaarat.<br><br>Our Maul DPR with a +3 Intelligence Modifier and +1 Magic Modifier is 8.05. But that\u2019s just our Maul (or Greatsword if you prefer that).<br><br>We can upgrade two allies\u2019 weapons to +1s as well, but keep in mind we can\u2019t have the same Infusion twice so while Enhanced Weapon can be anything, we have the option of Returning Weapon and Repeating Shot to get a second weapon.<br><br>Across a range of weapons (at third level and assuming 16-17 in primary ability score), the DPR increase of becoming a +1 weapon is between 1 and 2 DPR. For the sake of extra simplicity we won\u2019t even factor in that these weapons bypass non-magical BPS damage resistance, but they do that too.<br><br>The higher end values were achieved by taking Crossbow Expert or Polearm Master as bonus feats at first level while the lower end of the range were traditional options like Greatsword or Longsword.<br><br>Average that out to +1.5 because we\u2019re not going to be toxic by telling our party how to play their characters. Then add that +1.5 once or twice depending on how many other weapon users we hand Infusions to.<br><br>That gives us a total DPR contribution of 9.55 or 11.05.<br><br>For comparison, a VHuman Fighter with the Archery Style and the CBX feat is doing 10.10 DPR under these same assumptions. Coincidentally, this same example Fighter goes up to 12.35 and no longer needs a free hand to reload with our Repeating Shot Infusion, enabling the use of a shield.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Psionic Egoist+1 Intelligence<\/td><td>The Psionic Egoist feat out of Chronicles of Eberron has a fairly unique effect.

For example, if we were subject to Heroism or the Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary of a Twilight Cleric, the bonus would apply every time the THP refreshed.<br><br>If you can\u2019t use that book or don\u2019t expect to get a lot of THP, Elven Accuracy will work just as well for us, increasing our offense instead of our defense.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-2nd-level spells<br>\u2013Spiritual Weapon<br>\u2013Web<\/td><td>Extra Attack: for when you want your Attack Action to Attack Twice.<br><br>Spiritual Weapon: for when you want to swing a third time but with magic.<br><br>Web: for when you want to restrain a whole group of foes and get Advantage against them at the same time and Faerie Fire\u2019s AOE isn\u2019t big enough.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Tool Expertise<br><br>Infusions<br>-Cloak of Elvenkind<br>-Spell Refueling Ring<\/td><td>Double Proficiency with tools.

We\u2019re slightly behind on spell save DC\u2019s and spell attacks, but that\u2019s fine since our primary offensive option is our weapon.<br><br>Our Maul Attack DPR at this level is now 18.90 (1d8+4+2 and hitting on a 7) or 21.40 using Great Weapon Master.<br><br>But like before, we can analyze the effects of our Infusions on the DPR of others. It might not seem like much should change but the ideal allies to use Infusions would all have Extra Attack by now.<br><br>My Standard Reference Human Crossbow Expert Sharpshooter Fighter is doing 28.28 DPR before the +1 and 32.70 after, a difference of 4.42. That\u2019s our high end.<br><br>The low end as far as Extra Attack users was Longsword Duelist going from 15.40 to 17.95, which is still a 2.55 DPR difference from the +1.<br>These average out to 3.485 DPR per Infused ally. Round to 3.5 for easier math and with two allies that\u2019s +7 to our DPR contributions.<br><br>I hyped up the Web spell a few levels ago, but how about we look at the DPR with our best pal, Standard Reference Human CBX SS Fighter?<br><br>We lose out on the 18.90 to 21.40 DPR on the round we cast Web because we can\u2019t attack. However, by granting Advantage to our example ally, their DPR jumps from 32.70 to 47.68, a gain of 14.98 DPR. Without trying to calculate anything from the rest of the party, we\u2019ve already made up most of our one turn. We can\u2019t always use Web, not enough spell slots to spam it and sometimes we\u2019ll be hard pressed to keep foes in the web, but when we can it\u2019s a great boost.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Runes of War<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-3rd-level spells<br>\u2013Beacon of Hope<br>\u2013Haste<br>\u2013Revivify<\/td><td>Runes of War has potential for doing a good amount of damage, but that depends heavily on the number of weapon-using allies we can apply it to.

Because we\u2019re assuming Repeating Shot as the Infusion we\u2019re sharing, the bonus is still a +1. That\u2019s not bad, though. We\u2019re looking at 37.70 DPR before the +1 and 43.60 after, an increase of 5.9 DPR.<br><br>But Fighter is not the only class we could be boosting. What does it look like if we apply the Enhanced Weapon to a Longsword Duelist Paladin since they have Improved Divine Smite at this point? This puts the damage calculation at [1d8+5+2+1d8] and we\u2019ll say that they use a 2nd-level Smite on crits.<br>It starts with 24.40 DPR and bumps up to 30.60 DPR. While the total DPR is smaller than the reference fighter, the difference in DPR is 6.2 likely due to the +2 attack\/damage bonus vs. +1 for the fighter.<br><br>If instead this same Paladin was using Polearm Master with a Spear or Quarterstaff, we would get a before value of 33.80 and 42.70 DPR after a +2, an increase of 8.9 DPR.<br><br>For the record, applying the +2 to the Fighter instead gives us 49.90 DPR, which is an increase of 12.2. Conversely, applying only a +1 instead to the PAM Paladin, perhaps by applying Returning Weapon to a Spear, gives us a 38.10 total DPR, an increase of 4.3.<br><br>This gives us either a +14.8 contribution if we keep Repeating Shot on the Fighter, which allows it to still wear a Shield for at least +2 AC (magic shields and infusions would give more still), or we can contribute +16.5 DPR at the price of less AC on the Fighter.<br><br>There is yet a third option we could pursue where both get +1s. Our calculated DPR contribution lowers to +10.2 but in addition to the Fighter having better AC, the Paladin\u2019s Spear gains Returning, opening up ranged attacking as an option for them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Magic Item Savant<br><br>Infusions<br>-Ring of Protection<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-Cantrip<br>\u2013Prestidigitation<\/td><td>Attune five items and ignore item restrictions.<br><br>Ring of Protection is +1 AC, +1 to all Saves, and stacks with the Cloak of Protection.
