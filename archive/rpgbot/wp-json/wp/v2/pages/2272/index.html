Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: d4 hit points is basically nothing. A stiff breeze could kill many wizards.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 1\/2 BAB, but fortunately Wizards don&#8217;t need it.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Will is the Wizard&#8217;s only good save, but since Wizards only need one save you can afford to invest a bit in your other saves to compensate.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The worst proficiency list of any heroic class.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Despite getting a puny 2+ skill points, the Wizard&#8217;s dependence on Intelligence will give you a hefty pile of skill points. Unfortunately, enhancement bonuses to Intelligence don&#8217;t give you extra skill points, and permanently increasing your Intelligence doesn&#8217;t retroactively grant skill points. Access to every Knowledge skill is extremely useful, and with such high Intelligence, a Wizard makes a fantastic Librarian.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Familiar<\/span>: Many players make the mistake of letting their familiar be an occasional piece of flavor for your character. A smart player knows that a familiar is a helpful companion and an extremely potent tool. For help with Familiars, see my <a href=\"\/dnd35\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Scribe Scroll<\/span>: Scrolls are great for wizards, and giving you the feat for free is nice. Use it to prepare scrolls of spells that you need infrequently so that you can cover all of your bases.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: 4 extra feats over the course of 20 levels isn&#8217;t game-breaking, but the Wizard would still be king if he didn&#8217;t get any of these.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: Wizards have the best spell list in the game, and every new book makes it better. Spells are why you play a Wizard.\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wizard-schools\">Wizard Schools<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Wizards have the ability to specialize in one school to get additional spells per day by losing access to to two other schools, which can be a very potent option for many Wizards. The two schools (three with Devoted Specialist) define the Wizard as much as the Wizard&#8217;s choice of specialization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abjuration<\/span>: The majority of protective spells are Abjuration spells. Many of these spells are also available to Clerics, making it less important if you have a Cleric to fill in as a Support caster.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Conjuration<\/span>: Summoning, direct damage without spell resistance, and teleportation are all available from Conjuration.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divination<\/span>: Divination spells are more important than mechanics can define. Even if you don&#8217;t want to use them, you&#8217;re not allowed to give up Divination.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enchantment<\/span>: Save or suck spells define the Enchantment school, making it one of the most powerful.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Evocation<\/span>: Evocation is the blunt hammer of magic. Most powerful Wizard builds give up Evocation because direct damage is easier to do with Conjuration if you&#8217;re not investing a lot of effort.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusion<\/span>: Illusions can be very powerful, especially with the Shadow spells, but they also require that your DM is both creative and permissive.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Necromancy<\/span>: Primarily defined by the ability to create undead, but also contains several excellent save or die spells.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Transmutation<\/span>: Transmutation contains many excellent buffs, as well as Polymorph spells. Polymorph spells are so powerful that WotC tried (unsuccessfully) to nerf them with a complete rewrite at least twice in 3.5.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Abyssal Specialist<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DotU<\/a><\/sup>: A bit like specializing in parts of both Enchantment and Illusion at the same time.<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Granted Power<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: This opens up a lot of options, and the ability to take it at will in place of any of your Wizard bonus feats means that you could potentially select it more than once. Domain powers grant lots of interesting abilities, including bonus feats which aren&#8217;t normally available to Wizards. The &#8220;special&#8221; section of the ability is somewhat ambiguous, so I&#8217;m not sure exactly what you get if you take a level of Cleric. If I&#8217;m reading it correctly, it means that you get the full benefits of the domain selected with Domain Granted Power in addition to the two domains you gain for being a Cleric, making this an interesting option for Mystic Theurges. Note that the rules for bonus feats allow you to select any feat for which you qualify if you get a bonus feat which you already have, so you can abuse this ability to open up your Wizard bonus feat slot to other options.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Abyss<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Strength is not for Wizards.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arborea<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Only works on weapon damage.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Baator<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">SC<\/a><\/sup>: Magical darkness is a great way to get a leg up over enemies without allowing saves, but the ability to see in magical darkness is generally limited to Demons\/Devils.

Giving up all of your Wizard bonus spells for this is absurd.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spontaneous Dispelling<\/span> (Ex): This requires that you give up your bonus spells for being a specialist. You will be better served by using those slots to prepare Dispel Magic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"\">Conjurer Variants<\/span>:\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapid Summoning<\/span> (Ex): If you want to focus on summoning, this is a great option. Who needs a pet familiar when you summon a bunch of stuff? Reducing the casting time to a Standard Action means that you can cast the spell and have your summoned creature act in the same round.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhanced Summoning<\/span> (Ex): Augment Summoning is hard to get at first level for anyone but humans, so this is a welcome benefit. The 5th-level bonus is crap, and the 10th and 15th-level bonuses will be less relevant when you start summoning things that rely on Spell-Like Abilities. You give up the Wizard bonus feats, but it appears that you get to keep Scribe Scroll.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spontaneous Summoning<\/span> (Ex): You give up your bonus spell slots for the ability to cast weak summoning spells.

Get a pet Cleric to heal your party and carry your treasure.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Social Proficiency<\/span> (Ex): A great option if you need to be a Face, but giving up your Wizard bonus feats seems like a difficult trade.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Extended Enchantment<\/span> (Su): Limited uses per day, and it removes your bonus spells slots. A metamagic rod of Extend Spell is a much better option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"\">Evoker Variants<\/span>:\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Energy Affinity<\/span> (Ex): Specializing in one type of energy damage is a good choice for blasters, and adding +1 to your caster level with your favorite element means a whole lot of extra damage over the course of your career. Giving up a familiar doesn&#8217;t really seem like a fair trade, but getting a bunch of caster level buffs on a blaster is a great idea.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Energy Substitution<\/span> (Ex): The ability is great for an Evoker, but it&#8217;s not good enough to justify giving up your Wizard bonus feats. Instead, get rods of Elemental Substitution. You will get more uses per day, and the rods are fairly cheap.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Overcome Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Learn some spells of different elements to cover your bases, and carry rods of Energy Substitution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"\">Illusionist Variants<\/span>:\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chains of Disbelief<\/span> (Ex): Very useful when casting illusions against groups of enemies.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Shaper<\/span>: The bonuses are nice for stealthy illusionists, but you may get more use out of the Wizard&#8217;s bonus feats.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Illusion Mastery<\/span> (Ex): You can essentially buy knowledge of new spells, so free additions to your spellbook don&#8217;t really matter.

Definitely not worth your bonus spell slots.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"\">Necromancer Variants<\/span>:\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skeletal Minion<\/span>: Thematic and very useful, especially at low levels before you can create undead.

Bonus feats will be considerably more useful.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhanced Undead<\/span> (Ex): If you plan to summon a bunch of undead and march them against your problems, this is essential. If you plan to actually cast spells at things, skip this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"\">Transmuter Variants<\/span>:\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Enhance Attribute<\/span> (Ex): Just buy the 4000 gp item. Or craft it.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Versatility<\/span> (Ex): This hugely reduces the cost to give up other schools, especially if you only want one or two spells from that school. If you don&#8217;t particularly want spells from the schools which you sacrificed, stick to the Wizard bonus feats.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Transmutable Memory<\/span> (Ex): This may seem like a bad trade at first, but the ability to give up your lower level spells to prepare more of your highest level spells is a fantastic option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Variant Sorcerer\/Wizard<\/span>: Animal Companions lack the versatility of Familiars, but they tend to be much better in combat.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Variant Wizard<\/span>: Improved Initiative is <em>always<\/em> good for a Wizard, but not every Wizard uses Scribe Scroll. If you don&#8217;t plan to make use of your Wizard bonus feats, or if you&#8217;re building a Gish, Fighter bonus feats might be a better choice for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Intelligence is everything. Saves are a secondary concern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump. Make the Fighter do the lifting.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Important for saves, and for the occasional touch attack.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Your hit points are garbage, and Fortitude saves will be a problem for you.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: You get magic, skills, and a bonus to knowledge skills (which you will have a ton of). Max at start, boost early, boost often.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: You get high Will saves, but with no other real ability dependencies, bumping Wisdom to at least 12 for additional saves is wise.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: dump and keep your mouth shut until its time to throw some spells around or spout some knowledge.\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to normal ability considerations, Wizards can also make excellent use of the aging rules. Being middle-aged gives you a -1 penalty to your physical abilities, but gets you a pleasant +1 to your mental ability scores. However, this can be a problem for your already low reflex and fortitude saves.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately there are no core races which provide Intelligence bonuses, so look for other benefits or look outside of the PHB. Small size is nice for Wizards because it makes you harder to notice and murder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: Dwarfs are very durable, but they don&#8217;t offer anything useful to the Wizard.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The Elf Wizard is an iconic character, but the Elf doesn&#8217;t actually offer anything interesting to the Wizard. Proficiency with bows is tempting for new players, but with dumped Strength you will do better with a crossbow when your spells run dry. If you want to play an Elf, crack open your Monster Manual and play a Gray Elf.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: The Gnome&#8217;s biggest draw for Wizards is their bonus to Illusion DC&#8217;s. The Constitution bonus is also nice.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Awful.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Penalty to Intelligence.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Small size, and a bonus to Dexterity make the Halfling great for stealthy Wizards.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Despite a lack of ability bonuses, an extra feat is fantastic, and the extra skill point can be one more Knowledge skill. An Intelligence bonus would be better, but this is the best you can do in the PHB.\n<h4 id=\"non-core-races\">Non-Core Races<\/h4>\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Gray Elf<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MM<\/a><\/sup>: Largely identical to Elf, but with an additional +2 to Intelligence and -2 to Strength.

Make sure you can hit 15 + your highest spell level on a natural 1.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Decipher Script<\/span> (Int): Hugely situational. I have seen this used exactly once in over a decade of play.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Arcana)<\/span> (Int): Identify constructs, dragons, and magical beats. Fairly few classes get access to this, so you need to step up here.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (Architecture and Engineering)<\/span> (Int): I&#8217;ve been playing for the better part of two decades and I&#8217;ve never rolled this skill once.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Dungeoneering)<\/span> (Int): Identify aberrations and oozes. If you spend any time underground or in dungeons, this is worth maxing. Otherwise, spend one rank and ride your intelligence bonus.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (Geography)<\/span> (Int): One rank <em>maybe<\/em>.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (history)<\/span> (Int): Situational, and very dependent on the campaign.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge (Local)<\/span> (Int): Definitely worth a rank, maybe more if you don&#8217;t have a rogue putting ranks in this.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Nature)<\/span> (Int): Identify animals. Unless you have a druid or ranger, you may be the only one in the party with this skill.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (Nobility and Royalty)<\/span> (Int): Situational, and very dependent on the campaign.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Religion)<\/span> (Int): Identify undead. More easily available than Knowledge (Arcana), but still very useful, especially since your cleric probably dumped intelligence.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (The Planes)<\/span> (Int): Identify outsiders. Outsiders are diverse and strange, and knowing stuff about them will help your survival greatly.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Craft items and identify spells and magic effects. Max this every time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Wizards certainly aren&#8217;t feat starved, which leaves a lot of room for dipping into metamagic, item crafting, and other fun things. This section does not cover metamagic feats or item creation feats feats. For help with metamagic feats, see my <a href=\"\/dnd35\/characters\/metamagic\">Practical Guide to Metamagic<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Alacritous Cogitation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: All the best parts of the Sorcerer, but the Wizards infinite list of spells known.

You will need a bit of Wisdom to get access to the higher level spells, but a Periapt of Wisdom isn&#8217;t an awful choice for a Wizard anyway, and at high levels the cost is manageable.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Mastery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Spell Resistance can really shut down a Wizard, so the ability to reliably overcome spell resistance can be very helpful. Typically enemies will have spell resistance somewhere around 8+CR, which means that Arcane Mastery allows you to constantly overcome the SR of any enemy up to 2 CR&#8217;s above your level.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Thesis<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Very powerful for some schools, but it requires that pidgeon-hole yourself very heavily.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Combat Casting<\/span>: A +4 bonus to your concentration checks when casting defensively is tempting, but you should not be casting defensively often enough to justify spending a feat on it. Optimizing Concentration is very easy, and you can do it with traits and items instead of wasting a feat.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eschew Materials<\/span>: Not a lot of spells have material components which are covered by this feat, and you can buy a spell component pouch for the rest.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Extra Slot<\/span>: Just buy a Pearl of Power<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Extra Spell<\/span>: You can pay gold to add new spells to your spellbook.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span>: Go first, and get control of the combat early.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Innate Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Very few 2nd-level spells are good enough to want an infinite supply of them, but a few gems like Create Magic Tattoo continue to be viable at every level, and options like these are likely more effective than Reserve Feats. Unfortunately, Silent and Still Spell tend to be terrible choices for Wizards, and you can&#8217;t get this until extremely high level.<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-orange\">Point-Blank Shot<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Wizards devoted to rays and ranged touch attacks may find the Point-Blank Shot tree useful, but most Wizards will never need any of it.\n<ul>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-orange\">Precise Shot<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Ranged touch attacks are reliable enough that you can typically live with the -4 penalty to fire into melee.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Precise Shot<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Cover won&#8217;t matter much, but the ability to ignore concealment is nice.

Generally a go-to for everyone but Conjurers, but Arcane Mastery is considerably more effective.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Spell Penetration<\/span>: Spell Penetration is likely plenty, but another +2 never hurts if you have a free feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"reserve-feats\">Reserve Feats<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Reserve feats a tempting way to stretch your magic abilities throughout the day. Many of them are very useful, but don&#8217;t expect to take more than one or two, or you may not be able to use them often enough to justify a feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Acid Splatter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: +1 CL for Acid spells, and the reserve ability work on a touch attack, making it very reliable.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Aquatic Breath<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: If your campaign requires you to be underwater enough to justify this, you should probably be an aquatic race.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blade of Force<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Unless you <em>really<\/em> like force spells, you can skip this.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Borne Aloft<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Nice for getting over obstacles, but by the time you can get this you should be running Overland Flight.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Clap of Thunder<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: There aren&#8217;t enough Sonic damage spells to justify this. If you use Born of Three Thunders this is on par with Storm Bolt.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Clutch of Earth<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: There aren&#8217;t enough damaging Earth damage spells to justify this.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dimensional Jaunt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Awful as a standard action.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dimensional Reach<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Drowning Glance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Allows a save and only lasts 1 round.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Face-Changer<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Buy a Hat of Disguise.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fiery Burst<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: The AOE is nice.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hurricane Breath<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Bull rush is very situational.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Invisible Needle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Great for fighting incorporeal enemies, but the damage is poor.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Disruption<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: The effect is very minor, and it uses your immediate action.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Sensitive<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: You can make Detect Magic permanent for very little gold.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Minor Shapeshift<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Temporary hit points as a swift action as often as you like. Fantastic for gishes and for polymorph builds.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mystic Backlash<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Only useful against enemy spellcasters with whom you are already in melee.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shadow Veil<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Allows a will save, and concealment won&#8217;t be nearly as good as what you could do with a spell.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sickening Grasp<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: You may be able to apply this effect as part of a normal touch attack with a spell (&#8220;any living creature you hit with a melee touch attack&#8221;), which would make it potentially useful. Sickened applies a penalty to saves, which makes enemies more susceptible to your spells.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Storm Bolt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: +1 CL for Electricity spells, and the ability is basically a tiny lightning bolt.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Elemental<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: A disposable elemental is a great scout and can trigger traps. In a pinch is can help allies flank.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sunlight Eyes<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational unless someone in your party likes to abuse darkness spells.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Touch of Distraction<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: The effect is puny.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wind-Guided Arrows<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: You can do much better things with an immediate\/swift action.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Winter&#8217;s Blast<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: +1 CL for Cold spells, but a 15-foot cone is a very dangerous AOE for such poor damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Stop. Put that down. You&#8217;re going to hurt yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dagger<\/span>: Carry one or two for utility purposes, but don&#8217;t plan to pull them out in combat.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Crossbow<\/span>: A decent backup weapon at low levels when you run low on spells, but you will be more reliable with cantrips because your attack rolls will be so low.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Armor is presented in the order in which you should acquire it, rather than alphabetical order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mithral Buckler<\/span>: At just over 1000gp, a mithral buckler has no ACP or spell failure, making it a cheap and effective boost to your AC, should you decide that you want to invest in AC. If you don&#8217;t care about AC (high level Wizards have much more effective defenses), it&#8217;s an extra space for an armor\/shield crystal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armorshields\">Armor\/Shields<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Caster&#8217;s Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A trap for Wizards. The 5% spell failure seems negligible, but when it comes up it will be a huge problem. If your DM is nice, they might let you craft a mithral version of this which will remove the spell failure chance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Not as important for the Wizard as it is for the Rogue, but you can cast a lot spells while invisible without breaking invisibility that can win fights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rods\">Rings<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Extend<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Nice for low-level spells with extremely long durations like Mage Armor and Craft Magic Tattoo.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quickening<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Among the most expensive of metamagic rods, a Rod of Quickening deserves its price. The ability to cast a second spell in one turn opens up a lot of great options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Benign Transposition<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">: Sometimes you find yourself in a bad position in combat. Use this on your party&#8217;s Defender to switch places, and you have saved the Defender a lot of walking.<\/a><\/li>\n<a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">\n<\/a><\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span><sup><\/sup><\/a><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a>: Vest of Resistance is identical and takes up a much less useful slot.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circlet of Intellect<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Buy it early, and buff it as fast as you can.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gloves of Dexterity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Dexterity adds to AC and saves, so a cheap pair of gloves isn&#8217;t a bad idea.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heward&#8217;s Handy Haversack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: If you use scrolls, wands, staves, or other magic items in combat, accessing them as a move action is fantastic. Remember that retrieving an item from your backpack is typically a Standard action, which means you probably won&#8217;t be able to do anything else of interest that round.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ioun Stone (Orange)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Caster level fuels a lot of what the Wizard does. If you aren&#8217;t a save or suck caster, the bonus to caster level means welcome boosts to spell durations and damage.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pearl of Power<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Somewhat expensive, but many spell levels have disproportionately high numbers of important spells. At the very least, you can get a bunch of level 1 pearls, and fall back on low-level spells like Magic Missile and the lesser elemental orb spells when you need to do a bit of damage and you&#8217;re out of fireballs.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tunic of steady spellcasting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: +5 to Concentration is great, especially if your Consitution is low.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot. Once you can cast Greater\/Superior Resistance, dump it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reduce Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Reducing your size gets you a total of +2 to AC, +1 to Reflex saves, and +1 to attacks. You never needed Strength for anything, so the penalty is irrelevant. For 2960gp (450 for Permanency, 10 for Reduce Person, 2500 for the xp cost to cast Permanency), you get quite a bit. You can cast it yourself, but for so little gold why would you waste your own experience points?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige
