You could use this to intimidate a creature into fleeing,\n\t\tbut in most cases you&#8217;ll probably be using this quickly talk your way past a\n\t\tcreature blocking your way like a guard at a gate. You generally won&#8217;t need\n\t\tthis; between high Charisma and a long list of skill proficiencies it&#8217;s easy\n\t\tto cover all of the Face skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Disposable magic light is fantastic, but if you don&#8217;t have room for the\n\t\tcantrip you&#8217;ll do fine with torches.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Hand<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The ability to move objects at a safe distance is profoundly useful. Use\n\t\tit to pull levers, open doors, sort your laundry, and all manner of other\n\t\timportant but potentially hazardous tasks where you wouldn&#8217;t want to risk\n\t\tyour own hands.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mending<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational. Short of Rust Monsters and a few oozes, nearly nothing in 5e deals damage to your equipment.\nIf you&#8217;re playing Spelljammer this is essential, but otherwise you can skip it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Message<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Bards built for stealth can do a lot of sneaking around, which frequently\n\t\tinvolves being separated from your party. Use this to send messages without\n\t\trevealing your position. Of course, the spell requires Verbal components and\n\t\tit&#8217;s not clear how loud verbal components are intended to be, so take\n\t\tprecautions if possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Minor Illusion<\/span>:<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Room for plenty of creative, deceptive uses. The 5-foot cube is easily\n\t\tenough to create something to hide behind, provided that your enemies don&#8217;t\n\t\tsee you create the illusion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prestidigitation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Whenever you want to do something small and magical that&#8217;s not covered by\n\t\tanother spell, it&#8217;s usually covered by prestidigitation. This spell is\n\t\texceptionally versatile. For suggestions on how to use Prestidigitation to\n\t\tits fullest, see our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/prestidigitation\">Practical Guide to Prestidigitation<\/a>.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderclap<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Damaging every creature within 5 feet of you is great if you&#8217;re in melee\n\t\tfacing numerous enemies. Even with Extra Attack you will deal more damage\n\t\twith this against three or more foes than you could with a weapon. See our\n\t\tarticle on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">True Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Typically you&#8217;ll get better results from attacking twice rather than\n\t\tusing this then attacking once.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vicious Mockery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Easily the most iconic bard spell, Vicious Mockery is unique, flavorful,\n\t\tand mechanically fantastic. The damage is relatively small, but the debuff\n\t\tis absolutely worth the poor damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Friendship<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Arguably easier than proficiency in Animal Handling, but it will become\n\t\tobsolete once beasts disappear around CR 10.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bane<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: I would only use this in encounters where you&#8217;re vastly outnumbered, and\n\t\teven then it&#8217;s typically better to use area damage or control spell spells\n\t\tto eliminate enemies rather than debuffing them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Charm Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you can cast this on a target outside of combat without them noticing,\n\t\tthis can be a great way to defuse a potentially hostile situation. However,\n\t\tthe spell has some complications. Charm Person has no visual effect like a\n\t\tball of fire, so there&#8217;s no visual indication that the spell succeeded or\n\t\tfailed. The target doesn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;ve been targeted by the spell if\n\t\tthey succeed on the saving throw, but you don&#8217;t know if they succeeded or\n\t\tfailed unless your DM decides to tell you (and they are under no obligation\n\t\tto do so). So generally your best bet is to cast this once or twice and hope\n\t\tfor the best before presenting yourself to your target. Remember:\n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#charmed\">charmed<\/a> is not\nmind control\/<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Color spray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): The effect is\n\t\tnot powerful enough and the duration is not long enough to justify the spell\n\t\tslot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Command<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): Enough\n\t\teffects to be useful in some situations, but it&#8217;s a single-target spell so\n\t\tat low levels you can&#8217;t afford to spend a spell slot on this. Consider\n\t\tpicking this up a few levels into your career.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Comprehend Languages<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You can&#8217;t learn every language in 5e. It&#8217;s simply not possible.\n\t\tEventually you will want to replace this with Tongues, but Comprehend\n\t\tLanguages does fine until then.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cure Wounds<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: More healing than Healing Word, but the action economy is considerably\n\t\tworse. Save this for when you need hit points and you&#8217;re either out of hit\n\t\tdice or don&#8217;t have time to rest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Someone needs to have it in every party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise Self<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Learning a single spell is cheaper than proficiency in a Disguise\n\t\tKit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Distort Value<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">AI<\/a><\/sup>: If your DM allows you to trade magic items, this might be incredibly\n\t\tuseful. However, your DM might also find this incredibly annoying and punish\n\t\tyou for using it by having angry traders track you down after an unfair\n\t\ttrade. Discuss this spell with your DM before you consider learning it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dissonant Whispers<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Surprisingly good crowd control. This only requires verbal components, so\n\t\tyou can use it while grappled to force the creature grappling you to run\n\t\taway. The damage isn&#8217;t spectacular, but honestly you don&#8217;t need it to\n\t\tbe.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth Tremor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Not nearly enough damage, and being prone isn&#8217;t enough of a problem in\n\t\t5e. The difficult terrain effect is the real draw. It only works on &#8220;loose\n\t\tearth or stone&#8221;, but that covers nearly anything you&#8217;ll stand on except\n\t\twood, so it&#8217;s an easy way to create difficult terrain. Unfortunately, it\n\t\talso effects you so be careful not to trap yourself among enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Faerie Fire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The lowest-level option to deal with invisible creatures, and Advantage\n\t\ton attacks against creatures which fail their save means that this remains a\n\t\tpowerful support option well into high levels, especially against big bulky\n\t\tenemies with high AC but poor Dexterity saves. Hopefully you won&#8217;t run into\n\t\tany invisible creatures at 1st level, but but it&#8217;s important to have some\n\t\tway to deal with invisibility just in case.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feather Fall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You don&#8217;t need to get this at 1st level, but eventually you&#8217;ll want it.\n\t\tYou may only use it a couple times in your character&#8217;s whole career, but\n\t\twhen you do it will save someone&#8217;s life.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Word<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: More important than Cure Wounds, especially at low levels. As a bonus\n\t\taction you can heal an unconscious ally enough to get them back into the\n\t\tfight, and you still have your action for Vicious Mockery.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heroism<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: At low levels where your tank might only have 12 hp and enemies are only\n\t\tdoing something like 5 damage per turn, this is a big enough buff to win a\n\t\tfight for you. At higher levels it will be less appealing due to the\n\t\tConcentration requirement, but it will always remain a solid use of a\n\t\t1st-level spell.\n\t\t<p>Compare Heroism to Cure Wounds: Cure Wounds will heal at most 11 hp\n\t\t\t(1d8+Cha with a +3 Charisma modifier). If you have 16 Charisma and can\n\t\t\tkeep Heroism running for four rounds you can prevent up to 12 damage\n\t\t\t(remember that temporary hp doesn&#8217;t stack, but the hit points refresh\n\t\t\tevery round) and still have 6 rounds to enjoy the spell. When you use\n\t\t\thigher-level spell slots, Heroism continues to outpace Cure Wounds. At\n\t\t\t2nd-level, Cure Wounds heals 2d8+Cha (maximum 19 with 16 Charisma), while\n\t\t\tHeroism can prevent 18 hit points of damage in just three rounds,\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. All that you need to\n\t\t\tmake Heroism more effective than Cure Wounds is to know who is going to\n\t\t\ttake damage for the next several rounds. Considering that most parties\n\t\t\thave one or two characters drawing the vast majority of attacks, that&#8217;s\n\t\t\tusually easy to figure out.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Identify<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Illusory Script<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Longstrider<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Even with a hour-long duration, this isn&#8217;t especially appealing. Movement\n\t\tin 5e is really easy, and you can use other options to get away from enemies\n\t\tor to get enemies away from you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silent Image<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: While not nearly so powerful as Major Image, if you just want an object\n\t\tor a visual effect, Silent Image does the job just as well. Throw up a fake\n\t\twall, door, or portcullis to slow pursuers. Create a piece of furniture like\n\t\ta box or a chest, then hide inside it and stab people when they try to open\n\t\tit like a pointy jack in the box. Illusions are limited more by your\n\t\tcreativity (and your DM&#8217;s willingness to play along) than by the spell&#8217;s\n\t\ttext.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silvery Barbs<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a><\/sup>: \nExtremely powerful, but also very complicated. See our\n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\">blog post on Silvery Barbs<\/a>\nfor details on the numerous abuse cases which the spell allows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sleep<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: At an average of 22.5 hp worth of creatures, you won&#8217;t be able to affect\n\t\tmany creatures while they&#8217;re at full hit points, but you can wait to wear\n\t\tdown their hit points before finishing them off with Sleep. Sleep notably\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t require a saving throw, making it a powerful and reliable way to\n\t\tincapacitate enemies with relatively few hit points even at high levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Speak with Animals<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but sometimes the only witnesses are wild animals and you\n\t\tjust need a clue from your local family of squirrels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Single-target save-or-suck. It won&#8217;t work on unintelligent creatures, but\n\t\totherwise you can easily compare this to Hold Monster. Both have the same\n\t\tduration, require Concentration, and allow Wisdom saving throws both to\n\t\tresist the initial effect and to end the effect at the end of the target&#8217;s\n\t\tturn. Paralysis is a more lethal effect, but if you just need a creature to\n\t\tsit out of combat for a while they&#8217;re functionally interchangeable. The only\n\t\tproblems are that it can&#8217;t be cast on unintelligent creatures and it can&#8217;t\n\t\tbe up-cast to affect multiple targets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thunderwave<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is one of your very few options for pushing enemies away from you.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s especially appealing if you can push an enemy into an area control\n\t\teffect, but otherwise it&#8217;s not a good go-to option for damage output in\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unseen Servant<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This has very limited utility in combat or in dangerous situations, but\n\t\tthat doesn&#8217;t mean that it has none. With a 1-hour duration you can get a lot\n\t\tdone with a single casting. Interacting with items can mean opening doors\n\t\tand chests, carrying items, using potions on allies, and other things which\n\t\tyou might not have time or patience to do. 2 Strength isn&#8217;t enough to carry\n\t\tanything heavy or to break down a door, but it&#8217;s often enough to trigger\n\t\ttraps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aid<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): With an\n\t\t8-hour duration and three targets, this is a staple buff that&#8217;s worth\n\t\tcasting literally every day. Keep in mind that this actually increases the\n\t\ttargets&#8217; hit point maximum, so temporary hit points can be added, too.\n\t\t<p>Aid&#8217;s casting time allows it to be used in combat, which is unusual but\n\t\t\toffers an interesting option. With three targets and a 30-foot range, you\n\t\t\tcan cast it to both buff and heal your allies during combat. Targets\n\t\t\tcurrent hit points and hit point maximum both increase, so allies at 0 hit\n\t\t\tpoints are healed in addition to having their hit point maximum raised,\n\t\t\tthereby allowing Aid to serve a similar function to Mass Healing Word.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>However, since spells don&#8217;t stack with themselves, it&#8217;s hard to repeat\n\t\t\tthis trick. You&#8217;ll need to cast Aid again using higher-level spell slots,\n\t\t\twhich can get expensive quickly, so Mass Healing Word is probably better\n\t\t\tif Aid is already running and if Mass Healing Word is an option for your\n\t\t\tparty.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Messenger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness\/Deafness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#blind\">Blind<\/a> is a great debuff, and a 1-minute duration is usually longer than an encounter. Targeting big\n\t\tmelee enemies seems like an obvious use, but the best targets for this are\n\t\tactually enemies who rely on spellcasting. Many spells simply don&#8217;t function\n\t\tif the caster can&#8217;t see the target, and the Constitution save is more\n\t\teffective against relatively frail enemies like spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Borrowed Knowledge<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a><\/sup>: Jack of All Trades makes this only half as effective as it is for other characters, and with\nmore skills than most classes and Expertise, there&#8217;s little benefit to taking Borrowed Knowledge\nwith your limited number of spells known. Cast Enhance Ability instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Calm Emotions<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Two situational but frequently useful effects. First, you can use this to\n\t\ttemporarily suppress effects which charm or frighten your allies. Both\n\t\teffects are common, and many enemies can apply them to your whole party.\n\t\tCharm effects often include mind control effects, and suppressing them for a\n\t\tminute on a willing ally can easily buy you enough time to deal with\n\t\twhatever is trying to mind control your friends. Fear effects are often area\n\t\teffects, such as a dragon&#8217;s Frightful Presence, so suppressing them for a\n\t\tminute can bring whichever portions of your party failed their saves back\n\t\tinto the fray.\n\t\t<p>Second, you can use this to make enemies not be hostile toward you and\n\t\t\tyour allies for one minute. That will at least pause most encounters for\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s duration, which is enough time to either heal and buff the\n\t\t\tparty or escape. I wouldn&#8217;t try to negotiate a truce in one minute,\n\t\t\tespecially since the targets can go right back to hostile the moment that\n\t\t\tthe spell ends. Note that this effect intentionally uses the\n\t\t\t&#8220;Hostile\/Indifferent\/Friendly&#8221; scale referenced in the\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/basic-rules\/adventuring#SocialInteraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social Interaction<\/a>\n\t\t\trules in the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<li\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloud of Daggers<\/span\n\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t>: 4d4 damage (average 10) isn&#8217;t great, and a 5-foot cloud is not a big AOE,\n\tbut this applies the damage without a save, and you can apply it repeatedly\n\tover the spell&#8217;s duration. If you can force enemies into the cloud repeatedly,\n\tyou can abuse it using many of the same tactics as Spirit Guadians. But, if\n\tyou if you can&#8217;t manage that, 10 guaranteed damage and blocking one square is\n\tnot worth the spell slot.\n\t<p\n\t\t>An ally who likes to grapple will do a lot to make this effective. Holding\n\t\tan enemy in place will guarantee damage every round, but dragging the enemy\n\t\tout and then back in will also trigger the damage, effectively doubling your\n\t\tdamage output.<\/p\n\t>\n<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Crown of Madness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This spell is borderline unusable. The creature must attack before it\n\t\tmoves, so you may be able to make it attack an ally once immediately after\n\t\tthe spell is cast, but it retains control over its movement so it&#8217;s free to\n\t\twalk away from its allies. On top of that, you need to spend your own action\n\t\tto maintain the spell rather than simply concentrating, so you&#8217;re eating\n\t\tyour own turns for the remote chance that the target will wander up to\n\t\tanother of its allies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Thoughts<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but a clever player can use this to gather crucial\n\t\tinformation from enemies unwilling to share it. However, the checks to\n\t\tcontinue focusing on a single creature&#8217;s thoughts are Intelligence checks\n\t\tand bards rarely have enough Intelligence to succeed reliably at opposed\n\t\tIntelligence checks. If you can, have an ally cast buffs like Guidance or\n\t\tEnhance Ability (Intelligence) on you to give yourself an edge.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhance Ability<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Fantastic and versatile. Eagle&#8217;s Splendor on your party&#8217;s Face make\n\t\tsocial interactions much easier, and Bull&#8217;s Strength provides a huge edge\n\t\twhile grappling. Enhance your spellcasting ability (or that of an ally) to\n\t\tget Advantage on the ability checks to counter spells and to dispel\n\t\tmagic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enlarge\/Reduce<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): A great\n\t\toption both as a buff for melee allies and as a utility option, though I\n\t\twould rarely try using this to shrink enemies. You can use this on a small\n\t\tally to make them small enough to smuggle in a pocket, or you can use this\n\t\ton and ally to give them an edge against enemies that rely on grappling. The\n\t\tbonus damage for being enlarged is nice, but not really worth the spell slot\n\t\tunless the target is making a huge number of weapon attacks like a\n\t\thigh-level fighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Enthrall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational, too limited, and the duration is too short. The best\n\t\tusage I can think of for this is to distract a bunch of creatures while your\n\t\tallies move past them or move into place to ambush them. But in most cases\n\t\twhere you&#8217;re resorting to violence you&#8217;ll have better results with a\n\t\tdifferent spell like Calm Emotions. In situations where you need to move\n\t\tpast people, cast Invisibility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Gift of Gab<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">AI<\/a><\/sup>: Another hilarious entry from Acquisitions Incorporated with dubious use\n\t\tin a typical game. The intent of having mechanics in place for social\n\t\tinteractions is to detach your real-world social skills from your\n\t\tcharacter&#8217;s social skills. If you say something foolish in real life, your\n\t\tDM should generally be kind enough to filter that through your character\n\t\tinto something that would make sense for them to say. But if they don&#8217;t,\n\t\tthis is a perfectly fine way to clean up a mistake. Keep in mind that it\n\t\tonly resets six seconds of conversation, so a short sentence is all that you\n\t\tcan cover. You can&#8217;t spend an hour berating someone than say &#8220;Gift of Gab&#8221;\n\t\tand have everything forgotten.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heat Metal<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design, but against nearly any humanoid in metal armor,\n\t\tthis spell is a death sentence. The damage will be slow, but disadvantage on\n\t\tattack rolls and ability checks makes martial characters (the ones typically\n\t\tin metal armor) basically useless. Upcasting the spell is surprisingly\n\t\tefficient since the additional damage applies every round, so if you&#8217;re\n\t\tfortunate enough to encounter a suitable enemy, use this to its fullest.\n\t\tUnfortunately, since the Bard learns spells permanently, it may be hard to\n\t\tjustify selecting this unless you know that your campaign will feature\n\t\tabundant suitable targets. It also monopolizes your Bonus Action, which can\n\t\tbe hard for the Bard since you need your Bonus Action for Bardic\n\t\tInspiration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hold Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You can get most of the same benefits from Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter, and\n\t\tTasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter isn&#8217;t limited to humanoids. But Tasha&#8217;s Hideous\n\t\tLaughter can&#8217;t be up-cast to affect multiple targets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An essential scouting and infiltration tool, and as you get higher-level\n\t\tspell slots you can affect more of your party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Kinetic Jaunt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a><\/sup>: Bards don&#8217;t get Misty Step, and Kinetic Jaunt is a great way to remove yourself from melee. However,\nit requires Concentration and doesn&#8217;t remove you from grapples, so it&#8217;s not a universally effective\nsolution, especially with the Bard&#8217;s limited number of spells known. It may be more effective to\nuse offensive spells like to inhibit whatever is grappling you or to use Invisibility to avoid\nOpportunity Attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knock<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The primary reason to have proficiency with Thieves&#8217; Tools is to handle\n\t\tlocks. Knock doesn&#8217;t require a check. It just works. Make aggressive eye\n\t\tcontact with your party&#8217;s rogue while you cast this just to rub it in.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lesser Restoration<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but a situation that comes up often. If you don&#8217;t have a\n\t\tcleric in the party you may be the only one with access to this spell, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll want to take it at some point.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Locate Animals or Plants<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Locate Object<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational, and too easy to counter.

Set the trigger to &#8220;when the paper is unfolded&#8221;. Leave\n\t\tthe paper for someone to find, or use mage hand to open it at a distance.\n\t\tInstant distraction. The material component is inexpensive by the time you\n\t\tcan cast this, and the duration is &#8220;until dispelled&#8221;, so you can carry about\n\t\ta big stack of pre-cast Magic Mouth spells for all sorts of shenanigans.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mirror Image<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): A great\n\t\tdefensive option, and it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration so you can easily use\n\t\tit alongside other great options like Fly. However, since its usefulness\n\t\tdiminishes quickly it works best against enemies making small numbers of\n\t\tattacks with high damage. Also, the 1-minute duration can be challenging\n\t\twhen it&#8217;s an Action to cast.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nathair&#8217;s Mischief<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">FToD<\/a><\/sup>: Amusing, but unpredictable and unreliable. Since the effect and the save\n\t\tchange every round, you can&#8217;t choose the targets&#8217; weak saves, and even if\n\t\ttargets do fail their save they might still be able to fight unhindered.\n\t\tTargets do need to save every round (unless your roll the molasses option),\n\t\tbut the effects simply aren&#8217;t powerful enough.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phantasmal Force<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Adventuring tends to involve running into a lot of things that aren&#8217;t\n\t\tvery smart. Beasts, ogres, etc. all have terrible Intelligence saves. This\n\t\tspell is a great counter to those creatures, and its flexible nature gives\n\t\tyou a lot of room to really mess with the target. Unfortunately, it also\n\t\trequires that your DM be creative enough to simulate how a creature would\n\t\trespond to whatever nonsense you come up with. If your DM has trouble with\n\t\tillusions, this spell may not work out well for you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pyrotechnics<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, slightly annoying to set up, and when it does\n\t\twork the effects aren&#8217;t good enough. The flame doesn&#8217;t need to be especially\n\t\tlarge, so a torch or even a candle will suffice. Drop a torch on the ground,\n\t\trun out of range, and cast the spell. The <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/status-conditions\/#blind\">blinding<\/a> effect isn&#8217;t spectacular\n\t\tbecause it only lasts on round and it&#8217;s on a Constitution save. The\n\t\tsmoke cloud option is objectively worse than similar options like Fog Cloud\n\t\tor Darkness, but it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration which allows you to more\n\t\teasily combine Pyrotechnics with other powerful spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With a 1-hour duration and no concentration requirement, See Invisibility\n\t\tis a great way to handle invisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shatter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The poor man&#8217;s fireball. 3d8 damage in a 10-foot radius is enough to hit\n\t\tseveral targets and deal decent damage. However, the save is Constitution so\n\t\tmany creatures will be able to resist easily. Disadvantage for creatures\n\t\tmade of inorganic materials is really neat, but how often do you fight a\n\t\tgroup of animated armors or iron golems?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silence<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Verbal components are extremely common in spells, including many that\n\t\tspellcasters frequently use to escape dangerous situations. If you can trap\n\t\tan enemy spellcaster in place (such as by having an ally grapple them) and\n\t\tdrop Silence around them, they&#8217;re usually trapped with no hope of\n\t\tescape.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skywrite<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spray of Cards<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a><\/sup>:\n\tPoor damage (though doing force damage is really nice), short range, and the blindness doesn&#8217;t last long enough that you can benefit in any way except moving out of melee.

You can use this to accomplish a lot of things. This\n\t\tis more effective, reliable, and immediate than Geas. However, the 8-hour\n\t\tduration requires Concentration, so if you want to use this while\n\t\tadventuring you&#8217;re committing a significant resource for a full day to get\n\t\tthe full duration of the spell. This spell benefits greatly from your own\n\t\tcreativity, so the more thought you put into its use the more effective it\n\t\twill be.\n\t\t<p>You may also need a patient, permissive DM, so try not to abuse this too\n\t\t\tmuch or your DM may grow tired of your shenanigans and instill some sort\n\t\t\tof consequences. Strangely, the spell doesn&#8217;t state that the target knows\n\t\t\tthat they were charmed, so much like a &#8220;Jedi Mind Trick&#8221;, the target will\n\t\t\tcarry out the specified action as though it made sense to do so even if\n\t\t\tthey&#8217;ll regret it later.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Warding Wind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: A decent buff for melee bards. Making the area around you difficult\n\t\tterrain makes it hard for enemies to move toward or away from you, and\n\t\tdisadvantage on ranged weapon attacks keeps enemies with ranged weapons from\n\t\tpicking you off from afar while you&#8217;re closing the distance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Zone of Truth<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestow Curse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The effects are versatile enough that you can easily bring this into play\n\t\tin a variety of situations, and the scaling mechanism works well enough that\n\t\tthis remains a viable option for higher-level spell slots. Use the third\n\t\toption against big tanky enemies with poor Wisdom, or use the first option\n\t\tagainst enemies that like to grapple. If you&#8217;re ever uncertain, use the\n\t\tthird option. Robbing a creature of their turn on a failed saving throw is\n\t\tdebilitating, and can take creatures almost completely out of a fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catnap<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: A Short Rest is typically one hour. In most campaigns, that will be fine\n\t\tmost of the time unless the DM is deliberately creating a time crunch which\n\t\tprevents resting or otherwise sitting about wasting time. In those cases you\n\t\tmight be able to squeeze in a Catnap, but more than likely the 10 minute\n\t\tduration will still be problematic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clairvoyance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With a 1-mile range and the ability to place the sensor in place you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t see, this is a fantastic way to safely scout dangerous places. If you\n\t\thave enough time to sit around and cast the spell repeatedly you can scout\n\t\twhole structures from the outside by gradually learning about more interior\n\t\tlocations through previous castings.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Essential. Someone in every party should always have this handy.\n\t\tDispelling spells of a higher level than Dispel Magic requires an ability\n\t\tcheck, so you can cast Dispel Magic at a higher spell level if you absolutely\n\t\tneed to end a spell effect, but you can also use Enhance Ability to boost\n\t\tyour spellcasting ability to make the ability check more reliable.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enemies Abound<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: Astoundingly few enemies have good Intelligence saves, especially big\n\t\tscary melee monsters. Throw this on something tanky and horrifying that&#8217;s\n\t\tthere to protect squishy enemies from you and your friends, and watch it\n\t\tfreak out and kill its buddies for you. The duration is only a minute, and\n\t\tobviously this only works in an encounter with multiple enemies, but that\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t make the spell less awesome.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Friends<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">AI<\/a><\/sup>: A fantastic non-lethal option for handling single targets, but it has\n\t\tsome limitations. The target needs to be able to understand you, so you\n\t\tlikely need to share a language. The spell requires Concentration, so you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t want to maintain this during combat if you can avoid it. And of\n\t\tcourse, you don&#8217;t want to try casting this during combat. Still, if you can\n\t\tisolate a single enemy outside of combat you may be able to ply them for\n\t\tinformation or send them on errands which will save you trouble later.\n\t\tTragically, the spell only lasts an hour so just as you&#8217;re getting really\n\t\tattached to your new best friend the effects end, and the targets knows that\n\t\tyou charmed them. You may be able to cast this repeatedly or you may be able\n\t\tto negotiate the situation peacefully even after the spell ends, but many\n\t\tpeople don&#8217;t take kindly to being charmed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fear<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to disable groups of opponents, but it fear immunity is\n\t\tcommon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Feign Death<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glyph of Warding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Depending on how your DM handles it, this is either a situationally useful defensive measure or a reality-bending way to break the game from the comfort of your own home.

Unlike racial\n\t\ttraits like the Gnome&#8217;s Cunning or the Satyr and Yuan-Ti Pureblood&#8217;s Magic\n\t\tResistance, this applies to <em>all<\/em> Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\n\t\tsaving throws, providing broad and effective protection against many of the\n\t\tmost dangerous save-or-suck effects in the game. You also get resistance to\n\t\tpsychic damage, which is nice if you&#8217;re fighting mind flayers, aboleths, or\n\t\tbards who enjoy Vicious Mockery. With a 1-hour duration, the Concentration\n\t\trequirement can be problematic, but it also means that you can carry this\n\t\tthrough multiple encounters at low cost, so in situations where you need\n\t\tthis it&#8217;s not going to eat all of your spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leomund&#8217;s Tiny Hut<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With an 8-hour duration and the ability to cast it as a ritual, Leomund&#8217;s\n\t\tTiny Hut is useful both as an option for resting, and as a surprising\n\t\tutility and combat option. The hemisphere (the effect is a hemisphere, but the flavor\ntext confusingly describes it as a done) which it creatures is impenetrable and\n\t\timpassable like a wall of force, except for creatures which are inside the\n\t\tsphere when you cast the spell (your party, usually). Since it&#8217;s opaque,\n\t\tmost low-level teleport effects like Misty step can&#8217;t be used to get inside\n\t\tit. Your allies can use it for cover, then dart in and out to attack or cast\n\t\tspells. You as the caster are\n\t\tstuck inside the hut since the spell ends if you leave, but\n\t\tthat doesn&#8217;t stop you from summoning something to go fight on your\n\t\tbehalf.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Major Image<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you don&#8217;t like to use illusions frequently, consider picking this up\n\t\tlater when you can cast 6th-level spells so that you can create permanent\n\t\tillusions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Healing Word<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): You never\n\t\twant to need this. It heals exactly as much as standard Healing Word at a\n\t\tmuch higher cost, but the ability to heal multiple targets means that you\n\t\tcan bring multiple allies back into the fight and you still have your Action\n\t\tthat turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Motivational Speech<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">AI<\/a><\/sup>: This makes the Inspiring Leader somewhat obsolete. Inspiring Leader will\n\t\tprovide considerably more temporary hit points, but this doesn&#8217;t require a\n\t\tfeat and takes one tenth the time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nondetection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Good, but not totally essential. Divination spells include things like\n\t\tSee Invisibility, so if you or your party relies on invisibility of any kind\n\t\tthis protects from several magical countermeasures to both stealth and\n\t\tinvisibility. However, most enemies aren&#8217;t spellcasters and won&#8217;t have\n\t\taccess to those divination options, so you can&#8217;t justify casting this every\n\t\tday. The spell also has an expensive material component specifically to\n\t\tdeter you from casting this all the time. Still, with an 8-hour duration, if\n\t\tyou need this spell it&#8217;s going to do exactly what you need it to do.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Plant Growth<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational. Outside of normal adventuring activities, the ability to\n\t\tenrich land to double crop yields is very useful. But DnD is a game\n\t\tprimarily about adventuring, and the option to make an area of plants\n\t\tovergrown is the more important option for most adventurers. In most cases,\n\t\tEntangle will work fine if you just need to slow your enemies down, but\n\t\tPlant Growth doesn&#8217;t expire, so those plants remain difficult to walk\n\t\tthrough until someone clears the plants (which may requires hours of\n\t\tchopping and\/or burning). The spell also doesn&#8217;t specify that the plants\n\t\tgrow along the ground or surfaces, so RAW it can create a sphere of plants,\n\t\tcreating super-difficult terrain extending 100 feet into the air,\n\t\tpotentially engulfing flying enemies.\n\t\t<p>The math on Plant Growth&#8217;s speed reduction is impressive. Since most\n\t\t\tcreatures have a speed of around 30 feet, moving at 1\/4 speed means that\n\t\t\tthey can move one 5-foot square and be left with 10 feet of movement that\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t get them anywhere (unless they dash or something). Jeremy Crawford\n\t\t\thas clarified that Plant Growth\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/811643729966530560\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn&#8217;t create difficult terrain<\/a>, so it&#8217;s possible that difficult terrain would stack with Plant Growth,\n\t\t\tbut I personally think that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s intended to work. Plant Growth\n\t\t\tspecifies that &#8220;a creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of\n\t\t\tmovement for every 1 foot&#8221; while the difficult terrain rule specifies that\n\t\t\t&#8220;moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed&#8221;, and since\n\t\t\tthose two statements conflict I think you&#8217;re intended to use whichever\n\t\t\teffect is greater rather than stacking them or multiplying them or\n\t\t\tsomething.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>While it&#8217;s not discussed in the text of the spell, it seems likely that\n\t\t\tPlant Growth would also impede vision. If you turn a nicely-tended hedge\n\t\t\tinto a 100-foot-radius hemisphere of super-difficult terrain, there&#8217;s\n\t\t\tclearly enough stuff in the way that seeing through it is difficult. This\n\t\t\twould necessarily mean that creatures inside the area would likely be\n\t\t\tconcealed to some degree, so don&#8217;t expect to drop Plant Growth on and\n\t\t\tenemy and then spend the next several turns spraying them with cantrips\n\t\t\tuntil they fall down.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Plant Growth&#8217;s problematic limitation is that it requires plants to be in\n\t\t\tthe area. However, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any restriction on how many or\n\t\t\thow large these plants must be (just that they must be &#8220;normal&#8221;, whatever\n\t\t\tthat means), and where there&#8217;s lack of clarity there&#8217;s room for\n\t\t\tshenanigans. For example: you might carry around a potted plant and throw\n\t\t\tit into the area to provide the necessary plant life to support the spell.\n\t\t\tPlants like mint or clover can fit into a small pot, and when you make\n\t\t\tthem grow you get a pretty and pleasant-smelling field of super-difficult\n\t\t\tterrain. If your DM scoffs at the idea of 100-foot-tall clover patches,\n\t\t\tconsider carrying a bonsai tree or some other plant which would normally\n\t\t\tbe very tall (though a bonsai might not qualify as &#8220;normal&#8221; since we don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tknow what that word means here).<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sending<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Not especially glamorous, but messaging over massive distances has a\n\t\tnumber of uses. Also, due to the wording of the spell, you can use it on\n\t\tcreatures that don&#8217;t understand your speech and they&#8217;ll still understand\n\t\tyour meaning, allowing you to use Sending in place of Tongues if you only\n\t\tneed to convey brief messages.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Slow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): Slow is a\n\t\tgreat debuff, but it has to compete with other Wisdom save options at the\n\t\tsame spell level.

Hypnotic Pattern&#8217;s targets can&#8217;t act\n\t\tat all until they&#8217;re released from the effect, but it&#8217;s also a Charm effect\n\t\twhich some creatures are immune or resistant to.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Speak with Dead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.

Your best bet is to use this on an ally with\n\t\tinformation that you can&#8217;t get otherwise.

Against big burly foes which\n\t\toften have poor mental stats, the save will be hard to pass and Frightened\n\t\twill make their attacks and ability checks much less effective. How the\n\t\tFrightened condition works is somewhat confusing because there&#8217;s no\n\t\tindication where the &#8220;illusory manifestation&#8221; appears, if it has a location\n\t\tat all. I think that the intent is that the target is Frightened, but their\n\t\tmovement isn&#8217;t hampered like it would normally be by the Frightened\n\t\tcondition. Because casting Phantasmal Killer increases the damage by a d10\n\t\tevery time (rather than just the on the first damage roll like many spells),\n\t\tthis remains an effective option well beyond its spell level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Polymorph<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Fantastic and versatile, but also very complicated.

The damage is low for a spell of this level,\n\t\tespecially for one that&#8217;s single-target, but the damage alone isn&#8217;t why\n\t\tyou&#8217;re here. The save is Intelligence, and those tend to be among the lowest\n\t\tsaves, even at very high levels, and the target is Incapacitated on a failed\n\t\tsave, robbing them of a turn, so despite it being single-target with\n\t\tlackluster damage it&#8217;s a powerful tool against single foes. Even better, if\n\t\tyou know the target&#8217;s name (often easy for named antagonists), you can cast\n\t\tthis without line of sight, allowing you to hide behind walls, in areas of\n\t\tmagical darkness, or somewhere else safe.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Animate Objects<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Provided that there is sufficient fodder for the spell, this can work in\n\t\ta variety of encounters.

If it\n\t\twere easier for the Bard to change their spells known this would be fine,\n\t\tbut you get an extremely limited number of spells known and you want those\n\t\toptions to be consistently useful.

With the exception of undead,\n\t\tthis works on any creature type, and paralysis takes a creature out of a\n\t\tfight almost as much as killing them. If you have an ally who fights in\n\t\tmelee, send them to follow up with melee attacks. Automatic critical hits\n\t\tare too hard to pass up many melee allies. Keep in mind that targets get\n\t\tanother save at the end of each of their turns, so you need to act quickly\n\t\twhile targets are still affected.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Legend Lore<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to justify on a class with a limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Cure Wounds<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You shouldn&#8217;t need this. It doesn&#8217;t do enough healing to justify the\n\t\tspell slot, so the best use case is to cast it when you have more than one\n\t\tally at 0 hit points. If you reach that point, things have gone very\n\t\tseriously wrong. Healing Word is a much more efficient way to get people\n\t\tconscious, and considering how little healing you&#8217;re getting out of Mass\n\t\tCure Wounds your allies will probably go down again anyway if anything looks\n\t\tat them funny.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mislead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational. Not a great option in combat, but out of combat this\n\t\tprovides a passably safe way to scout an area or to trick other\n\t\tcreatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Modify Memory<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The actual intent of the spell is very situational, but this spell is\n\t\taccidentally a really effective save-or-suck spell. Compare it to Hold\n\t\tMonster against a single target, which is the same level. Hold Monster\n\t\tallows additional saves every round, though admittedly Paralyzed is more\n\t\tlethal than Incapacitated. The target is unaware of its surroundings, so you\n\t\tcan reasonably get Advantage on attack rolls against it, but as long as it\n\t\tisn&#8217;t damage you could also fully restrain the target before the spell&#8217;s\n\t\tduration expires. However, the target gets Advantage on their save if you&#8217;re\n\t\tfighting it, so you need to hit them with this before fighting starts. That\n\t\ttypically means before Initiative is rolled, but your DM may let you do it\n\t\tif the creature is Surprised.\n\t\t<p>If you need to incapacitate a creature in an encounter with multiple\n\t\t\tenemies, your enemies likely won&#8217;t know how to break the effect (except by\n\t\t\tkilling you), and once you&#8217;ve defeated everything else you can use Modify\n\t\t\tMemory to convince the target that the other creatures attacked them and\n\t\t\tyou came to their rescue. Then you&#8217;ve won a fight, and earned the real\n\t\t\ttreasure: the friends that you made along the way, and whatever their\n\t\t\tprevious friends had in their pockets.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Planar Binding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Extremely situational and very expensive. If you learn this, wait until\n\t\tyou&#8217;re high level, can easily afford the 1,000gp material cost, and can cast\n\t\ta spell of sufficiently high level to summon something extremely powerful.\n\t\t<p>For more help, see our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/summoning#planar-binding\">Practical Guide to Summoning Spells<\/a>.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raise Dead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is an odd thing to find on the Bard spell list. Death is part of the\n\t\tgame, so eventually you&#8217;ll need this, but it&#8217;s no fun to spend one of your\n\t\tlimited spells known on a spell you might cast once or twice ever.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rary&#8217;s Telepathic bond<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): If you have\n\t\ttime to cast this, you should always have this running while you&#8217;re\n\t\tsomewhere dangerous. Speaking aloud is a great way to alert enemies to your\n\t\tpresence and to give away clever plans. The fact that this has no range\n\t\tlimit once it&#8217;s in effect means that you can use it to communicate with\n\t\tallies while they scout around, potentially including beasts, familiars, and\n\t\tsummoned creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scrying<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Technically situational, but it&#8217;s a situation that comes up frequently.\n\t\tAny time that you want to know what the BBEG is up to, cast Scrying and take\n\t\ta look. The spell gets easier the more you know the target, and after one\n\t\tface-to-face encounter you could easily make off with something tying you to\n\t\tthe target to penalize their saving throw.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Seeming<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational.

Very few creatures\n\t\tare good at intelligence saves, so expect most creatures to fail the save.\n\t\tThe 8d6 damage feels underwhelming at this spell level, but subtracting a d6\n\t\tfrom from attack rolls and ability checks for a full minute is a significant\n\t\tdebuff. This is a good option to start a fight with a large number of\n\t\tmartial enemies because they&#8217;ll be impacted most by debuff and most martial\n\t\tenemies have poor Intelligence saves.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Teleportation Circle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but generally one of the safest long-distance teleportation\n\t\toptions, especially since it doesn&#8217;t have a cap on the number or size of\n\t\tcreatures affected.

This is a great way to\n\t\t\tsneak past Legendary Resistances, and if you&#8217;re positioned well in the\n\t\t\tinitiative order your allies might get to spend their turns attacking the\n\t\t\ttarget with Advantage.\n\t\t\t<p>In many situations, Hold Monster will be just as effective, if not more\n\t\t\t\tso.

The 25gp material component is nothing by this level, so you can\n\t\tthrow up programmed illusions all over the place for a pittance. As far as I\n\t\tcan tell, you can cast the spell with overlapping areas, so you could cast\n\t\tit three times to make the illusions trigger each other and have a perpetual\n\t\tillusion running. Unfortunately, the spell&#8217;s language restricts what you can\n\t\tdepict to &#8220;an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon&#8221;, so you\n\t\tprobably couldn&#8217;t create a room of illusory guards.

You can see and hear into the material\n\t\tplane (albeit at limited distance), allowing you to spy on other creatures\n\t\tin person without their knowledge. The spell lasts 8 hours, which is\n\t\tsufficient to do a lot of things potentially including a Long Rest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Forcecage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An absolutely amazing way to isolate either your party or your enemies.\n\t\tThe duration is long enough to take a short rest, and there&#8217;s no save for\n\t\tenemies to resist it. Have an ally drop an AOE damage over time spell like\n\t\tHunger of Hadar, then drop a Force Cage on top of it and you&#8217;re playing a\n\t\tmagical game of &#8220;Will it Blend?&#8221;.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mirage Arcane<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a difficult spell. The affectable area is huge, the distance is\n\t\tSight (go climb a mountain on a clear day), and the effects of the illusion\n\t\tare tangible enough that you can physically interact with them, including\n\t\tpicking up sticks or stones. But it&#8217;s unclear how far that goes: Can you\n\t\tburn the illusory wood to keep yourself warm? Can you smooth over difficult\n\t\tterrain in the same way that you can make smooth terrain difficult? Could\n\t\tyou place stairs in the side of a clear cliff face? How far up and down does\n\t\tthe effect stretch? The closest we have is these\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2018\/06\/03\/if-i-used-mirage-arcane-to-transform-a-lake-of-water-into-a-lake-of-lava\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two<\/a>\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2016\/04\/12\/could-i-stand-at-the-top-of-an-illusory-tower\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweets<\/a>\n\t\twhich indicate that you have a lot of leeway, and that the effects are real\n\t\tenough that a creature could drown in illusory water, burn in illusory lava,\n\t\tand climb illusory trees. Your DM will be the arbiter of exactly what you can\n\t\tget away with, but the spell itself is a wildly versatile toolbox.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mordenkainen&#8217;s Magnificent Mansion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: In the real world, learning to cast this spell would mean that you could\n\t\tcomfortably retire. Each day you would walk out of the mansion, cast the\n\t\tspell again to recreate the house for 24 hours, then you would return to\n\t\tyour invisible extraplanar abode to enjoy another 24 hours of abundant\n\t\tfood, comfort, and nearly-invisible servants. The size of the mansion\n\t\tamounts to 5000 square feet, which is plenty to accommodate a party of\n\t\tadventurers and a sizeable retinue. The suggested 100 banquet guests would\n\t\teach have 50 square feet (a 5&#215;10 area) of space to themselves, but a\n\t\tcleverly laid out mansion could easily turn that space into a large common\n\t\tarea for feasting and a collection of small rooms with bunk beds for\n\t\tsleeping off a magical 9-course meal. However, in purely mechanical terms\n\t\tthis is a spell that the Bard can&#8217;t afford to learn. There are many less\n\t\tcostly options for solving the same problems, and you&#8217;re strictly limited in\n\t\tthe number of spells which you can learn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mordenkainen&#8217;s Sword<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is an objectively bad spell. Compare it to Bigby&#8217;s Hand, and it&#8217;s\n\t\tpretty clear. Bigby&#8217;s Hand isn&#8217;t on the Bard spell list unfortunately, but\n\t\tthat&#8217;s what Magical Secrets is for.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Prismatic Spray<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tUnpredictable. The AOE is great, and effects 6, 7, and 8 are all great (any\n\t\ttwo rays would be spectacular), but the spell is unpredictable and I&#8217;m\n\t\talways reluctant to recommend unpredictable spells because unpredictable\n\t\toften means unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Project Image<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Mislead with a longer duration and better range. The language used to\n\t\tdescribe the copy&#8217;s capabilities is nearly identical. The extra range makes\n\t\tit a bit more versatile, but it&#8217;s still fairly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Regenerate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational to select as a spellcaster with a limited number of\n\t\tspells known. DnD doesn&#8217;t have injury rules which lead to limb removal\n\t\texcept in very specific circumstances, so it&#8217;s not like characters are\n\t\tlosing fingers and toes despite spending potentially years being sliced and\n\t\tdiced by all manner of opponents.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resurrection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you learned Raise Dead you might replace it with Resurrection, but I\n\t\tdon&#8217;t think Resurrection is a meaningful improvement over Raise Dead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Symbol<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: While many of the effects are wonderful, the inability to move the symbol\n\t\tand the high casting cost are prohibitive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Teleport<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With a 10-foot range and up to 8 targets you can easily teleport your\n\t\tentire party, and without the need to hold hands and form a circle you can\n\t\toften rescue the whole party in the midst of combat without too much\n\t\ttrouble. However, Teleport has a complicated mechanic related to how\n\t\tfamiliar you are with the target destination and there&#8217;s often a possibility\n\t\tof mishap. Be sure to borrow a souvenir from new places so that you can\n\t\teasily return if necessary without the risk of a mishap.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Antipathy\/Sympathy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): Difficult to\n\t\tuse because it targets a single type of creature, but if you&#8217;re facing a\n\t\thomogenous group of enemies you can greatly hinder them with either option.\n\t\tEven against single creatures, using Sympathy to force an enemy to approach\n\t\tone of your party members (sympathy on a paladin to attract a lich) can\n\t\tforce enemies into a situation which will end in their death. Still, it&#8217;s a\n\t\tsituational spell that you can&#8217;t guarantee will be useful, so it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\trecommend for a class that permanently learns their spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dominate Monster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Arguably the best save-or-suck spell in the game. You can do a lot with\n\t\tperfect control over a creature for such a long period of time. Using the\n\t\ttarget as a thrall in combat is obviously tempting, but the target gets to\n\t\trepeat their saving throw every time that they take damage, so be very\n\t\tcautious if you choose to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Feeblemind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Casters are extremely vulnerable to\n\t\tFeeblemind. Even creatures who cast spells as a supplement to their other\n\t\tabilities can be seriously inhibited by suddenly being less intelligent than\n\t\tmany animals.\n\t\t<p>Beyond losing the ability to cast spells, I&#8217;ve always found this spell difficult to\n\t\t\tmanage for other enemies. 1 Intelligence and 1 Charisma is obviously very\n\t\t\tpoor, but what is the victim capable of? Could a character use class features\nother than spellcasting? What are they smart enough to do in combat? There&#8217;s a\n\t\t\tlot of room for the DM to interpret how this works and which abilities\n\t\t\tcreatures can still use. While that could be fun and very effective, it\n\t\t\talso makes the spell&#8217;s effect totally dependent on the DM and their\n\t\t\tinterpretation of what an affected creature is mentally capable of\n\t\t\tdoing.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glibness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Charisma checks include skills like Persuasion, but they also include\n\t\tthing like the ability checks for Counterspell and Dispel Magic. Throw this\n\t\tup before going into a fight with an enemy spellcaster and enjoy countering\n\t\teverything that they cast with minimal effort.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mind Blank<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but hilarious if you have a Berserker Barbarian in the\n\t\tparty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Word Stun<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Gambling on a creature&#8217;s current hit point total is hard, especially\n\t\tsince you get so few spell slots at this level, but if you can time this to\n\t\thit a wounded enemy (or an enemy with a low hit point maximum like many\n\t\tspellcasters) it can take them out of the encounter long enough for you to\n\t\twin largely unopposed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Foresight<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is, without a doubt, the best buff in the game. With an 8-hour\n\t\tduration you can throw it on the lucky recipient and watch them laugh their\n\t\tway through nearly any challenge for a full day worth of adventuring.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Polymorph<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: You sacrifice the absolute power of True Polymorph for the ability to\n\t\taffect up to 10 creatures. The rules for handling creatures with no CR (your\n\t\tparty) are written to make this really unappealing compared to True\n\t\tPolymorph. Compared to turning one ally into a CR 17+ dragon, turning up to\n\t\t10 of your allies into Tyrannosauruses (Tyrannosaurs? Tyrannosauri?) simply\n\t\tisn&#8217;t as effective, even if the phrase &#8220;I turn us and our horses into\n\t\ttyrannosauruses&#8221; is one of the coolest things I can think to say during a\n\t\tgame. Tragically, the targets assume the beast&#8217;s mental statistics, so\n\t\tturning your party of adventurers into toothy lizards may actually make them\n\t\tweaker.\n\t\t<p>You can use the spell offensively and the targets don&#8217;t get saving throws\n\t\t\tbeyond the first, so turn your enemies into slugs or something and pitch\n\t\t\tthem into the plane of fire or somewhere equally unpleasant.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Word Heal<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Full healing and removing a bunch of status conditions in one spell is\n\t\treally tempting, but preventing all of that damage and all of those\n\t\tconditions with Foresight will work much better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Word Kill<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: 100 hit points is a very low cap, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with how\n\t\teffective it is to outright slay a creature with no rolls involved. As an\n\t\texample, a 20th-level wizard with 12 Constitution will have 102 hit points\n\t\t(6+19*4+20), so basically nothing which is scary at this level will be\n\t\timmediately vulnerable, but if your allies can deal a bunch of damage\n\t\tquickly you may be able to use this in round 1 of a fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Prismatic Wall<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): The ultimate\n\t\tarea control spell. 10-minute duration, you and your allies can pass through\n\t\tit unharmed, and if enemies move through it they can take up to 50d6 damage,\n\t\tbe turned to stone, and be sent to another plane. The wall can be destroyed,\n\t\tbut the process to do so is so laughably obnoxious that I doubt anyone would\n\t\tactually try it (it&#8217;s a relic of early editions of DnD).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Scream<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: \nUp to 10 creatures within 90 feet of you in any direction. Intelligence\n\t\tsaves are the weakest save on average, even for high-CR monsters, so in many cases you can\n\t\tStun enemies and keep them stunned for an incredibly long time. There&#8217;s no duration on the stun effect, so enemies with poor Intelligence may be <em>permanently stunned<\/em>. The damage\n\t\tis fine, but that&#8217;s absolutely an after-thought compared to the stun\n\t\teffect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Polymorph<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Powerful, versatile, and it lasts an hour. This is a spell that really\n\t\trewards thorough knowledge of 5e&#8217;s monsters, so go sit down with the Monster\n\t\tManual etc. and do some reading. You&#8217;ll want a go-to combat form at CR 17,\n\t\t18, 19, and 20 for when you need to turn yourself or an ally into a monster,\n\t\tbut you should also look for a good CR 9 in case you need to polymorph an\n\t\tobject into a pet.\n\t\t<p>Remember that the spell becomes permanent if you keep it running for an\n\t\t\thour, so you can also use this to permanently turn yourself or someone\n\t\t\telse into a monster or a dragon or something. You&#8217;ll lose all of your\n\t\t\tclass stuff because you assume the creature&#8217;s statistics, but honestly a\n\t\t\tCR 20 dragon is much more powerful anyway.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The spell&#8217;s final option allows you to turn a creature into an object\n\t\t\t(which allows a Wisdom save). Turn them into a flower pot, then either\n\t\t\tdrop them from high enough to deal maximum fall damage (the extra damage\n\t\t\tcarries over to their regular hit points when they revert), throw them\n\t\t\tinto a demiplane, plane shift them somewhere unpleasant, or dispose of\n\t\t\tthem in some other permanent and irrevocable fashion like a bag of\n\t\t\tdevouring.<\/p>\n<p>For more, see
