But it&#8217;s a lot of fun, so, if your group can survive\n\tyou not min-maxing, this adds an element of zany fun to your game. Just be\n\tsure that your DM is willing to play along or you&#8217;ll have trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest problem with Wild Magic is that the use of the Wild Magic table\n\tis left up to the DM. The DM can choose to make you roll when you cast a\n\tleveled spell, and they can choose to make you reroll to recharge Tides of\n\tChaos, which is your subclass&#8217;s only useful feature at first level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The DM might decide that Wild Magic is too annoying, or they might simply\n\tforget. Or they might go crazy and have a regular Wild Magic Surge occur (this\n\trequires rolling a 1 on a d20 to see if anything happens) as well as\n\ttriggering Tides of Chaos&#8217;s recharge mechanic because those two outcomes\n\taren&#8217;t mutually exclusive. You could roll twice on the Wild Magic table for\n\tcasting a single spell.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>To fix the Wild Magic bloodline, you don&#8217;t even need to change the rules of\n\tthe subclass: you just need an established agreement on how often Wild Magic\n\trolls will occur. Here&#8217;s what I recommend: The sorcerer <em>always<\/em> rolls\n\tthe d20 for a wild magic surge when they cast a leveled spell. If Tides of\n\tChaos is not recharged, instead the sorcerer will automatically roll on the\n\tWild Magic table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows Wild Magic to occur often enough to feel meaningful, but likely\n\tnot every round. Similarly, Tides of Chaos has a very clear risk when it&#8217;s\n\tused. Yes, you can use it frequently, but you&#8217;re going to roll for Wild Magic\n\talmost immediately after that, which imposes an exciting risk-reward mechanic.\n\tThat risk diminishes considerably when Controlled Chaos comes online at level\n\t14, but by then the dangerous effects have largely become minor annoyances\n\tanyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On our RPGBOT.Podcast episode about\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/sorcerers-levels-1-4-good-to-evil-a-guide-to-building-a-magical-being-rpgbot-podcast-s4e22\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26097\">optimizing sorcerers<\/a>, Ash suggested starting from a DC of 20 and reducing the number every time\n\tthe Sorcerer rolls a d20 to possibly trigger a surge, then when they roll a\n\tsurge, reset the number to 20.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Wild Magic Sorcerer Build &#8211; Maximum Chaos<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\"><\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

But it&#8217;s a core component of the\n\t\tsubclass, so, as a DM, I would make you roll every time you cast a qualifying\n\t\tspell (unless we were trying to get through an encounter quickly). The\n\t\teffects range from comedic to catastrophic to fantastic, so there&#8217;s really\n\t\tno way to rate this.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Roughly 7 of the 50 options on the table are potentially harmful to you\n\t\t\tor your allies in some way, so most of the effects are benign. Perhaps the\n\t\t\tmost iconic option on the table is casting Fireball centered on yourself,\n\t\t\twhich will almost certainly kill an entire low-level party. Fortunately,\n\t\t\tthere&#8217;s only a 1 in 50 chance of that occurring when you roll on the\n\t\t\ttable. (although it has happened to me and made several party members unconscious, as well as nearly getting us kicked out of the inn).<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tides of Chaos<\/span>: How useful this is depends\n\t\tentirely on how often your DM will call for a Wild Magic roll to let you\n\t\trecharge Tides of Chaos. Your DM is absolutely allowed to never trigger the\n\t\trecharge mechanic, limiting you to just one use per day. Or, they might\n\t\tallow you to recharge Tides of Chaos after every time you cast a leveled\n\t\tspell, allowing you to use Tides of Chaos frequently.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The safest bet is to assume that you will get this once per day, and\n\t\t\tpossibly more if your DM is feeling whimsical. In that case, using this\n\t\t\tfor attack rolls is an absolute waste, but using it for saving throws can\n\t\t\tsave your life.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Bend Luck<\/span>: When your allies fails a save\n\t\tagainst death by 1 or two, it&#8217;s heart-breaking. Spend the Sorcery Points and\n\t\tbe everyone&#8217;s best friend. Two Sorcery Points is expensive, but your allies&#8217;\n\t\tlives are worth it. If your group is using magic items, strongly consider a\n\t\tBloodwell Vial so you have extra points to spend.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Controlled Chaos<\/span>: This considerably\n\t\treduces the threat of the Wild Magic table and makes it more of a source of\n\t\tunpredictable buffs and comic relief.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Bombardment<\/span>: This is a little bit\n\t\tof extra damage on many of your damage-dealing spells. Spells which use\n\t\tlarge dice like Toll the Dead are less likely to trigger the benefit, but\n\t\tthe extra damage is higher on average. Spells which roll a ton of small dice\n\t\t(like Meteor Swarm&#8217;s small mountain of d6s) are more likely to benefit, but\n\t\tthe additional 3.5 damage feels really insignificant for such a high-level\n\t\tclass feature. More damage is nice, of course; it&#8217;s just not very exciting\n\t\tsince Empowered Spell has been an option for 15 levels.\n<p>Keep in mind that this applies whenever you roll damage for a spell, rather than the first\ntime that you roll damage for that spell like most damage boosting features. This means that\nyou can reapply this benefit multiple times for spells which deal damage multiple times. It&#8217;s\nonly once per turn, of course, but most spells that would benefit this way will only roll damage\nonce per turn. For example: Tasha&#8217;s Caustic Brew deals damage at the beginning of the target&#8217;s\nturn. This may be enough to justify picking spells that specifically benefit.<\/p>\n<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#races\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\"><\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>:\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#sorcerer\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#multiclassing\" data-type=\"page\">typical sorcerer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Wild Magic Sorcerer Build &#8211; Maximum Chaos<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>While the Wild Magic Sorcerer does have some mechanics which we can use to optimize, they&#8217;re all gated behind the absolute chaos that is Wild Magic Surge, so we&#8217;re going to lean into the chaos and build the most chaos-inducing sorcerer we possibly can.

Twinned Chaos Bolt deals 4d8+2d6 damage and might jump to additional targets for a smaller resource cost. Two bolts raises your chances of jumping from 12.5% (1\/8) to 23.44% (almost 1\/4).
