Wizards can do nearly anything with spells, and leaning hard into spellcasting is a consistently effective choice. Beyond supplementing your spellcasting, also consider ways to make your wizard more durable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>For wizards, Intelligence increases are crucial, and nothing else is strictly necessary. Increases to Dexterity and Constitution can also be helpful, though they&#8217;re less important. The custom origin rules or the post-Tasha&#8217;s changes to race design make that easy to achieve, so if you&#8217;re using more recent rules its easy to achieve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The wizard&#8217;s biggest liability is their lack of durability. Traits which improve your AC like the Tortle&#8217;s natural armor or resistance to common damage types will go a long way to help you stay alive until you have magical answers to those problems. Natural flight can put you safely out of enemies&#8217; reach and won&#8217;t consume Concentration like the spell Fly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Traits which expand your spellcasting are very helpful, especially at low levels. Additional cantrips are great because wizards don&#8217;t get very many, and innate spellcasting can offer access to spells. Races published after Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything allow you to re-cast innate spells with spell slots, effectively adding those spells to your spell list and automatically preparing them. This can give you access to spells from other class&#8217;s spell lists, such as the Fairy giving you access to Faerie Fire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read my <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2685\">Wizard Handbook<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Wizard Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dragonmarks\">Dragonmarks<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Lineages<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"app-root\">\n\t<p>Filter controls are loading.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/js\/dnd5RacesPageFilters.js?version=12\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Wizard Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that not all races will be available in every game.

Wizards can do nearly anything with spells, and leaning hard into spellcasting is a consistently effective choice. Beyond supplementing your spellcasting, also consider ways to make your wizard more durable. For wizards, Intelligence increases are crucial, and nothing else is strictly necessary. Increases to Dexterity and Constitution can also be helpful, though they&#8217;re less important. The custom origin rules or the post-Tasha&#8217;s changes to race design make that easy to achieve, so if you&#8217;re using more recent rules its easy to achieve.
