Most of the time. Polymorph is still generally better than Wild Shape, but your possible uses of Polymorph don\u2019t catch up to your likely number of uses of Wild Shape until level 10, by which point many campaigns are done. Additionally, Moon Druids get many neat tricks they get to add onto Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Having huge defensive capabilities makes them very survivable Defenders if they use their forms and tactics right or just durable Strikers if they optimize for that instead. The key to this subclass is always going to be figuring out what you maintain Concentration on while in animal form to maximize whatever tactic you\u2019re trying to accomplish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If the fantasy of turning into powerful animals appeals to you, this is the best way to do it repeatedly at low levels. It also has full Druid spellcasting to fall back on if those tactics don\u2019t work, making it an exceptionally versatile character to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 rules.

Wild\n\t\tShape is mostly a utility feature for most Druids, but for Circle of the\n\t\tMoon it&#8217;s a powerful combat option. Expect to spend most encounters fighting\n\t\twhile in Wild Shape.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge Rating<\/span>: The CR of your\n\t\t\t\tbeast forms will range from CR 1 at level 3 to CR 6 at level 18. This is\n\t\t\t\ta big boost compared to other Druids, but you still need to use spells\n\t\t\t\tto buff yourself in order to keep pace in combat.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>the capacity for higher-level animal forms is both fun and\n\t\t\t\t\tfrustrating as the number of beasts that are of a relevant CR, are\n\t\t\t\t\tmechanically interesting, but also don&#8217;t have a fly speed is pretty\n\t\t\t\t\tsmall and is covered in our\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\/\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a\n\t\t\t\t\t>.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>This is especially true because, in this edition, you&#8217;re limited to a\n\t\t\t\t\tset number of known forms which can only be changed one per Long Rest.\n\t\t\t\t\tWith the overwhelming majority of play done between levels 3 and 10,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis means you will get to primarily use a combination of 6 forms\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween CRs 1 and 3. That said, there are barely 6 optimal choices at\n\t\t\t\t\tthose levels anyway, so that&#8217;s not a huge drawback and (in my opinion)\n\t\t\t\t\tmostly exists to prevent people from trying to pull out some random\n\t\t\t\t\tmonster stat block and getting stuck for minutes looking for it.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Class<\/span>: Beasts have notoriously\n\t\t\t\tpoor AC, which makes fighting as a beast dangerous for other Druids.\n\t\t\t\tThis keeps your AC consistently high throughout your career. At high\n\t\t\t\tlevels when monster attack bonuses start overpowering your anyway, the\n\t\t\t\tpile of THP is large enough to keep up the defensive side.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Temporary Hit Points<\/span>: Three times as\n\t\t\t\tmuch temporary hp as other Druids, but still rarely enough to get you\n\t\t\t\tthrough a difficult encounter. Do not dump Constitution.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\">Circle of the Moon Spells<\/span>: No longer are you\n\t\tlocked out of performing the healing role by being in Wild Shape. Every form\n\t\thas a ranged attack that&#8217;s actually quite good. Summon your own crowd to\n\t\tblend in with. It&#8217;s a great time.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrip<\/span>: A reliable ranged attack\n\t\t\t\toption, which is great since beasts almost universally can&#8217;t attack at\n\t\t\t\trange.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 1 Spells<\/span>: Decent healing, but\n\t\t\t\tyou want to avoid using it in combat as much as possible. It also can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\trestore THP, so you won&#8217;t need to heal yourself until enemies have cut\n\t\t\t\tthrough the THP granted by Wild Shape.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 2 Spells<\/span>: Passable area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol, but it monopolizes your Action, the AOE is small, the damage is\n\t\t\t\tpoor, and it&#8217;s a Con save.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3 Spells<\/span>: Basically\n\t\t\t\tremote-controlled spirit guardians. It doesn&#8217;t need to stay within the\n\t\t\t\tspell&#8217;s range, just within sight, so you can drive this away from you\n\t\t\t\thuge distances with the 10-minute duration. If you can have a way to see\n\t\t\t\tthrough another creature&#8217;s eyes (use Wild Companion to summon a\n\t\t\t\tdisposable familiar), you can drive this across huge distances,\n\t\t\t\tpotentially clearing entire encounters without any risk to your\n\t\t\t\tparty.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 4 Spells<\/span>: This spell is designed\n\t\t\t\talmost entirely to be a buff for Circle of the Moon. Pick a form with\n\t\t\t\tMultiattack, and you can apply the +2d6 damage boost repeatedly each\n\t\t\t\tturn.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 5 Spells<\/span>: Only situationally\n\t\t\t\tuseful, but it does save you the trouble of walking over to whoever\n                needs healing.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><strong>Improve Circle Forms<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lunar Radiance<\/span>: Essential for\n\t\t\t\tovercoming common resistances to weapon damage types.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Increased Toughness<\/span>: Essential for\n\t\t\t\tmaintaining Concentration. You use your beast form&#8217;s Constitution, but\n\t\t\t\tbetween this and potentially Resilient (Con) and War Caster, you can\n\t\t\t\tmake Concentration very reliable.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Moonlight Step<\/span>: Basically Misty Step, but\n\t\tslightly shorter range. It&#8217;s notably not a spell, so it doesn&#8217;t conflict\n\t\twith casting a spell with a spell slot on the same turn. You can use it both\n\t\tin and out of Wild Shape, too! This is easily worth a level 2 spell slot to\n\t\trecharge if you run out of uses.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><strong>Lunar Form<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Lunar Radiance<\/span>: The extra\n\t\t\t\tdamage amounts to roughly 7 DPR which, while not irrelevant, doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tfeel hugely impactful at this level. It does say once per turn instead\n\t\t\t\tof once on each of your turns, so look for places you might be able to\n\t\t\t\tmake Opportunity Attacks.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shared Moonlight<\/span>: Interesting, but it\n\t\t\t\teither means you&#8217;re removing yourself (probably a Defender to some\n\t\t\t\tdegree) from a fight to protect someone or putting someone close to a\n\t\t\t\tfight that presumably already has their own means of getting there if\n\t\t\t\tthey&#8217;re playing an optimized character.

Armor of Agathys ends early if you have no Temporary Hit Points, but it doesn&#8217;t care where those THP come from, and Wild Shape gives you a huge pile of THP to work with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Circle of the Moon Build &#8211; Cassie, the Woman Who Morphs Into Animals<\/h2>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Sometimes, all you need in the dark is a wolf and a light.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As described above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Adjusted<\/th><th>Level 20<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Sage gets us some fun tricks and a pair of proficiencies, one of which we\u2019re likely to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"species\">Species<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Human gets us the Musician Origin Feat to up our quantity of Heroic Advantage even higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skill-and-tool-proficiencies\">Skill and Tool Proficiencies<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Sage gets us Arcana and History, we pick up Perception, Survival, and Herbalism Kits from Druid, and Nature from our Species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats-and-ability-score-increases\">Feats and Ability Score Increases<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At level 1 we get Magic Initiate (Wizard) from our Background and Musician from our Species<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 4 we\u2019ll take Telepathic and increase Wisdom to 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 8 we\u2019ll take an ASI to increase Wisdom to 20, keeping on track with <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 12 we\u2019ll take Grappler and increase Dexterity to 14.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 16 we\u2019ll take Speedy and increase Constitution to 16.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 19, for our Epic Boon we take Boon of the Night Spirit and increase Wisdom to 21.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-164\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Druidcraft<br>&#8211; Guidance<br>&#8211; Prestidigitation<br>&#8211; Thorn Whip<br>&#8211; True Strike<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Entangle<br>&#8211; Faerie Fire<br>&#8211; Find Familiar<br>&#8211; Healing Word<br>&#8211; Thunderwave<br><br>Primal Order:<br>&#8211; Magician<\/td><td>Like some kind of arcane hierophant, we walk out as a Druid\/Wizard hybrid.

What I haven\u2019t done is mention the wording of Wild Shape and how it causes a problem. In this edition, Wild Shape says you pick something \u201cchosen from among Beast <strong><em>stat blocks<\/em><\/strong> that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1\/4 and that lack a Fly Speed.\u201d<br><br>Why is this a problem? In the 2014 rules, it said \u201cany Beast.\u201d Now that it specifies Stat Blocks, Swarm of Poisonous (sic) Snakes is a perfectly valid choice by RAW. This gives you a huge list of condition immunities, resistance to physical damage types (that isn\u2019t bypassed by magic), and Blindsight. Circle Forms still sets our AC to 17 and gives us 18 THP (which you can choose to gain before becoming the form because those effects happen simultaneously and you can choose which order to apply simultaneous effects in if it&#8217;s your turn). It does have the drawback of not being able to be healed, but we can always shift out on a later turn if you\u2019re getting worried.<br><br>We can also use this as a sort of \u201cimproved human form\u201d and hang back, concentrating on Conjure Animals and firing Starry Wisps which have just improved to 2d8 damage. If your DM allows this, take this instead of one of the forms you picked up at level 4.<br><br>At this level, Wild Shape now lasts for 3 hours. Somehow, being in another body for more than 2 feels inherently problematic, but there\u2019s nothing mechanically wrong with it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Fire Shield<br><br>Elemental Fury:<br>&#8211; Primal Strike<\/td><td>At this level we can now cast Fount of Moonlight while in Wild Shape, a spell they seem to have explicitly made for Moon Druids and Dance Bards. It\u2019s really good for Dance Bards. Is it any good for us?<br><br>Let\u2019s say we\u2019re in Polar Bear form for the best multiattacking creature available to us right now. Its attack bonus is on par with fundamental math (until next level), so Fount adds 10.5 DPR, but not on the turn we cast it. If we\u2019re assuming a 3-round fight as per the guide to building encounters, that means it\u2019s actually 7 DPR. Compare that to Conjure Animals: also takes Concentration, also can be used while in Wild Shape, can be used at range, does an average of 22 damage per target if cast at the same spell level as Fount (possibly more than once per round if maneuvered correctly), and targets Dex saves which is much more reliable than making attack rolls.<br><br>We should never use Fount of Moonlight.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: Wis 18 -&gt; 20<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">Polymorph<\/a><br><br>Forms Known:<br>&#8211; Quetzalcoatlus<br>&#8211; Giant Scorpion<\/td><td>AC in form caps at 18.<br><br>Sometimes being a huge snake, a swarm of snakes, or even a flying dinosaur snake isn\u2019t enough.
