Mechanically, it&#8217;s a pool of dice that works very similarly to the Battle Master&#8217;s maneuvers, but you get a predefined set of powers on which you can spend your dice. The abilities provide an interesting mix of offensive, defensive, and utility options, resulting in a capable, versatile fighter. You&#8217;re still primarily a combat monster, but it&#8217;s a bit more versatile than trading hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Psi Warrior shares some capabilities with the Eldritch Knight, and uses a resource pool similar to the Battle Master&#8217;s Superiority Dice. Unlike those two subclasses, the Psi Warrior has no decision points within the subclass, instead using a fixed set of built-in options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This lack of decision doesn&#8217;t mean that the Psi Warrior is ineffective. The Psi Warrior is much easier to build and play than either the Battle Master or the Eldritch Knight, and, if you manage your Psionic Energy Dice to last through the day, you can be very effective. The options are generally very good, and the scaling of both the number and size of the dice makes progression feel significant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the 2024 Psi Warrior Fighter.

You get from 4 to 12 dice over your career,\n\t\tand the size goes from d6 to d12 over the course of your career. That sounds\n\t\tlike a big pool, but they mostly recharge on a Long Rest, and between Long\n\t\tRests you can recharge just one die per Short Rest.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If your DM adheres to the Adventuring Day rules in the DMG, that means\n\t\t\tyou can recharge just two dice per day. Across a full day of adventuring,\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s a small pool to work with. You need to be cautious about spending\n\t\t\tyour dice rather than burning through them in the first encounter. The\n\t\t\tinitial options for spending your Psionic Energy Dice are easy ways to\n\t\t\tquickly burn through your dice for modest amounts of damage or\n\t\t\tprotection.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protective Field<\/span>: Preventing some or\n\t\t\t\tall of the damage from an attack can keep you or an ally fighting, and\n\t\t\t\tcan help allies maintain Concentration on spells. Save this for when hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints are low or when an ally&#8217;s Concentration is crucial, otherwise you\n\t\t\t\trisk running through your Psionic Energy dice in a hurry.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Psionic Strike<\/span>: A modest burst of\n\t\t\t\tdamage. The damage is a separate source from your attack (it deals\n\t\t\t\tdamage on its own rather than adding damage to the attack), so it&#8217;s not\n\t\t\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>I wouldn&#8217;t consider this a go-to option until you add Telekinetic\n\t\t\t\t\tThrust at level 7 because your pool of dice is too small and too\n\t\t\t\t\tprecious to spend on something as mundane as a tiny bit of damage.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, you might make an exception in cases where the extra damage\n\t\t\t\t\tcould kill the creature or cause it to lose Concentration (since it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\ta separate source of damage it forces a second saving throw).<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Movement<\/span>: Situational.\n\t\t\t\tYou get it once per Short Rest, which is often be enough, but you can\n\t\t\t\tuse it again for a Psionic Energy Die if you need to. This is forced\n\t\t\t\tmovement (even though the target is willing), so you can use it to pull\n\t\t\t\tallies out of melee (even if they&#8217;re grappled) without provoking\n\t\t\t\tOpportunity Attacks.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-none\">Telekinetic Adept<\/span>: Two new options for\n\t\tusing your Psionic Energy Dice.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Psi-Powered Leap<\/span>: Even though the\n\t\t\t\tflight only lasts until the end of your current turn, that&#8217;s enough to\n\t\t\t\tget into melee with flying enemies and beat them up (consider using\n\t\t\t\tAction Surge to maximize the benefits) or Shove them prone to force them\n\t\t\t\tto fall. You can also use this to fly over pits, high walls, and other\n\t\t\t\tbarriers. You get this once for free, but if you need it again you can\n\t\t\t\trecharge it with a Psionic Energy Die.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Thrust<\/span>: Unarmed Strikes\n\t\t\t\tand Topple mastery weapons are typically sufficient for Strength-based\n\t\t\t\tfighters who want to knock enemies prone, but this is a great counter to\n\t\t\t\tflying enemies for Dexterity-based builds. Flying creatures that are\n\t\t\t\tknocked Prone fall, which can both cause a lot of damage and bring them\n\t\t\t\tinto melee range.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>While this doesn&#8217;t consume a Psionic Energy die on its own, this is\n\t\t\t\t\tan optional rider effect that you add to Psionic Strike, which does\n\t\t\t\t\tconsume a die.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Guarded Mind<\/span>: Charm and Fear effects are\n\t\tcommon and annoying across the full level range, and can take you out of a\n\t\tfight. They&#8217;re especially good counters to martial characters (like you)\n\t\tbecause they tend to require Wisdom saving throws which martial characters\n\t\tare usually bad at. Indomitable does make this somewhat redundant, but in a\n\t\tlong adventuring day you might prefer to dip into your Psionic Energy Dice\n\t\trather than spending precious Indomitable uses.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Resistance to psychic damage is nice, but only situationally useful\n\t\t\tbecause psychic damage is rare.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bulwark of Force<\/span>: +2 AC and +2 on\n\t\tDexterity saves to you and possibly the rest of your party for 1 minute,\n\t\tactivated as a Bonus Action. This is a great buff at any level, but remember\n\t\tthat it won&#8217;t stack with other sources of cover. You only get to use this\n\t\tonce per day, but you can recharge it with a Psionic Energy Die, and I\n\t\trecommend doing so. The +2 AC to your whole party will mitigate a huge\n\t\tamount of damage in a typical fight. +2 on a 20-point scale is 10% of the\n\t\tscale, so a +2 AC bonus will negate roughly 10% of all attack damage to your\n\t\tparty in that encounter.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Master<\/span>: By this level it&#8217;s\n\t\tentirely possible that you have raised both your Strength\/Dexterity and your\n\t\tIntelligence to 20, so your Intelligence checks may be very good. That makes\n\t\tTelekinesis a useful option in combat, especially against foes with poor\n\t\tStrength like many spellcasters. You can use this to lift foes into the air\n\t\tand drop them, to move them over pits or into hazards, or just to pull them\n\t\tinto melee range.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The ability to make a weapon attack as a Bonus Action while concentrating\n\t\t\ton Telekinesis is very exciting. The obvious intent is that you use your\n\t\t\tAction to use Telekinesis, and that can be a powerful combination: lift\n\t\t\tyour target into the air and shoot them, or drop them to force them to\n\t\t\tfall prone before attacking them in melee.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, you&#8217;re under no obligation to actually use Telekinesis while\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re concentrating on it. The spell has a 10-minute duration, so you can\n\t\t\teasily use it as a buff to add an attack as a Bonus Action. If you enjoy\n\t\t\tthis strategy, I think you&#8217;ll agree that spending a Psionic Energy Die to\n\t\t\trecharge this ability is well worth the cost to get an additional attack\n\t\t\twith little effort.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Psi Warrior Fighter Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With the Psi Warrior&#8217;s need for Intelligence, our Background choices shift a bit compared to most Fighters.

Graze ensures that we do damage even on a miss, so we&#8217;re always making an impact, even if it&#8217;s a small one.<br><br>The trident is for dropping flying enemies out of the sky. Our other slot is free. I recommend a Sap weapon like a Longsword or a War Pick.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Action Surge (1)<br>Tactical Mind<\/td><td>Action Surge is great.<br><br>Tactical Mind is great outside of combat, especially on days when you don&#8217;t expect to be in a combat situation.

Both are 1d6+2 at this level, so it&#8217;s not doing anything crazy, but if you can keep an ally conscious or kill an enemy that would otherwise be left at pitifully low hp, it&#8217;s worth the dice. You do get your dice back every Short Rest, but don&#8217;t rush to burn through them by adding Psionic Strike to every attack.<br><br>Use Telekinetic Movement to rescue allies. Enemies will rarely drop important items, so it&#8217;s very difficult to use it offensively. Outside of combat, this can be <br><br>At this level our Githyanki Psionics allow us to cast <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/spells\/2618991-jump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jump<\/a> once per long rest. This allows us to jump 30 feet once per turn (horizontally, vertically, or at an angle), allowing us to easily traverse many obstacles.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Heavy Armor Master (Str 17 -&gt; 18)<br>New Weapon Mastery<\/td><td>A consistent and reliable reduction to most incoming damage. This will provide good protection for our entire career. Between this, Tough, and Fighting Style (Defense), we can comfortably focus all of our other resources on offense.<br><br>We add yet another weapon mastery. Consider the Maul. Remember that you can draw or stow one weapon with each attack during the Attack action, so once you get Extra Attack you can attack, stow a weapon, draw a weapon, then attack again.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br>Tactical Shift<br>Energy Dice (6d8)<\/td><td>Double our damage output, and Tactical Shift gives us another great mobility option.<br><br>At this level our Githyanki Psionics allow us to cast <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/spells\/2619133-misty-step\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Misty Step<\/a> once per long rest, allowing us to bypass obstacles that we can&#8217;t simply jump over.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Feat: Great Weapon Master (Str 18 -&gt; 19)<\/td><td>Great Weapon Master provides an easy, consistent bonus to our damage output. We don&#8217;t need to think about it much, but if we manage to crit we can make an additional attack as a Bonus Action.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Telekinetic Adept<br>Psi-Powered Leap<br>Telekinetic Thrust<\/td><td>Psi-Powered leap fills a very similar to casting Jump, but the ability to fly means that we can change direction in the air. Use Jump when you can, but don&#8217;t hesitate to use Psi-Powered Leap if it suits the situation better.<br><br>Telekinetic Thrust is fun. It works with Topple weapons in an especially fun way: You choose to use Psionic Strike after your attack deals damage, while Weapon Mastery applies immediately when you deal damage. You can hit with a Topple weapon, see if the target passes the save, then use Psionic Strike if they do. You won&#8217;t need this all the time, but it&#8217;s fantastic when you&#8217;re throwing a trident at flying enemies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: Mage Slayer (Str 19 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>Max out our Strength, Concentration Breaker to stop troublesome spellcasters, Guarded Mind to protect us from the <a href=\"https:\/\/bg3.wiki\/wiki\/Ghaik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ghaik<\/a> since our mental saves are poor.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Indomitable (1)<br>Tactical Master<br>Energy Dice (8d8)<\/td><td>Indomitable gives us another option for when we fail saves. Use Mage Slayer&#8217; Guarded Mind first if you can since it&#8217;s a guarantee and it only applies to some saves.<br><br>Tactical Master lets us change Weapon Mastery without changing weapons. Hit an enemy with Sap to debuff their first attack, then revert to Graze for reliability unless their AC is low enough that you&#8217;re not worried about missing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Guarded Mind<\/td><td>If something manages to get past both Mage Slayer <em>and<\/em> Indomitable, you can use Guarded Mind to end the effect.

At the cost of one Psionic Energy Die, that&#8217;s pretty great.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Epic Boon: Boon of Irresistible Offense<\/td><td>Boon of Combat Prowess feels like it&#8217;s on theme for this build, but our primary weapon has Graze and we have Studied Attacks if we do miss an attack. Irresistible Offense makes our damage reliable when we do hit, and with 4 attacks per turn (assuming Telekinetic Master) we have a good chance to roll a natural 20 on any given turn.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Three Extra Attacks<\/td><td>This is a lot of damage. Even if we miss, we&#8217;re still doing 5 damage, and then we get Advantage on our next attack. When we hit we&#8217;re dealing 2d6+11 damage, which we can boost by 1d12+5 by spending a die, which then might knock our target prone. If we get a foe on the ground, we can Action Surge and pile on the damage in a hurry, potentially adding +21 damage on a natural 20 since we&#8217;re rolling a mountain of d20s for all of those attacks.<br><br>Defensively, we shave 6 damage off of every source of B\/P\/S damage, which is still common even at this high level. For saves we have Mage Slayer to handle one mental save per rest, plus Indomitable 3 times per day. Our AC hasn&#8217;t changed since we got full plate (unless you got magic items), but we can buff our whole party&#8217;s AC with Bulwark of Force.
