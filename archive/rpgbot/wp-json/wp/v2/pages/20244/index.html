Unfortunately, that means that it can often be difficult to target a creature&#8217;s lowest saves. Be sure to pick up Glyph of Warding since it&#8217;s one of the Bard&#8217;s only Dexterity save spells, and be sure that your other party members can handle enemies with high Wisdom saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cantrips\">Bard Cantrips<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#1st-level\">1st-Level Bard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#2nd-level\">2nd-Level Bard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#3rd-level\">3rd-Level Bard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#4th-level\">4th-Level Bard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#5th-level\">5th-Level Bard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#6th-level\">6th-Level Bard Spells<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses a color coding scheme to rate individual character options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Bards learn 2 cantrips at level 1, then another at levels 4 and 10. You generally cannot replace cantrips expect by respeccing your entire build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blade Ward<\/span>: In a game where Dodge isn&#8217;t\n\t\tan action, Blade Ward is one of the only ways to spend your action just\n\t\tprotecting yourself. The 2-round duration lasts until the end of your next\n\t\tturn, so you&#8217;re effectively protected for just one round; you can&#8217;t\n\t\talternate turns casting Blade Ward, then doing something fun. The best use\n\t\tcase for this is to keep yourself alive while you finish a fight using Bonus\n\t\tActions or summoned creatures, and even then you should only use this if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re expected to draw several attacks in a single round. Usually it&#8217;s more\n\t\teffective to spend your action trying to end the fight faster.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Dancing Lights<\/span>: The appeal of Dancing\n\t\tLights is that you can place the light at a distance to handle enemies who\n\t\tare in Darkness so that your party doesn&#8217;t suffer Disadvantage to attack\n\t\tthem. But Darkvision is widely available, actual darkness is rare (at least\n\t\tuntil Darkvision is accessible via spells), and this requires Concentration\n\t\twhich is much better spent on almost anything else.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Friends<\/span>: Basically easy mode for social\n\t\tsituations, giving you Advantage on Persuasion checks in most conversations.\n\t\tThis is good, but on high difficulties some creatures will accuse you of\n\t\tmagically charming them, which can cause problems for you. When it becomes\n\t\tavailable at level 3 (when you get 2nd-level spells), Enhance Ability makes\n\t\tthis obsolete.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Light<\/span>: Environmental light sources are\n\t\tabundant, actual darkness is rare, and Darkvision is easily accessible. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re really that desperate, you can usually have someone carry a torch.\nHaving a source of light is rarely useful, but there are rare enemies that are invisible unless\nexposed to light, so either bring a light source or cast See Invisibility.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mage Hand<\/span>: Usable just once per short\n\t\trest, and it only lasts 1 minute (10 rounds). The hand can open doors, interact\n\t\twith some items, and throw light objects, but its strength is poor and it\n\t\tcan&#8217;t carry items, so its usefulness is limited. In combat, it can throw\n\t\titems at enemies, including offensive items like Alchemist&#8217;s Fire.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Minor Illusion<\/span>: Fantastic in a party\n\t\twhich is relying on Stealth in any meaningful way, but otherwise skip it.\n\t\tSee our\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/spells\/minor-illusion\/\">Practical Guide to Minor Illusion<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\tfor more specific advice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">True Strike<\/span>: This allows you to spend your\n\t\tAction to get Advantage on one attack, which will typically come from your\n\t\tAction on the following turn. In nearly every case, it makes more sense to\n\t\tspend both of those actions attacking because you&#8217;re rolling just as many\n\t\tattack rolls, plus you might hit with both attacks. The appeal here is for\n\t\tspellcasters planning to make a single attack with a high resource cost,\n\t\tsuch as Chromatic Orb or Melf&#8217;s Acid Arrow, but bards don&#8217;t get any of those\n\t\tspells.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vicious Mockery<\/span>: A bard staple and the\n\t\tonly damage-dealing cantrip on your spell list. The damage dealt is tiny,\n\t\tbut Disadvantage on your target&#8217;s next attack can mitigate a huge amount of\n\t\tdamage dealt to your party.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1st-level\">1st-Level Bard Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Friendship<\/span>: Almost always\n\t\treplaceable by Speak with Animals.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bane<\/span>: A good debuff against powerful\n\t\tenemies in an extended fight, but it only targets three creatures, requires\n\t\tConcentration, and competes for space with options like Faerie Fire which\n\t\twill help your party win a fight quickly rather than putting you at an\n\t\tadvantage during a long attrition fight.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Charm Person<\/span>: Basically the same effect\n\t\tas the Friends cantrip with all of the same problems. Upgrade to Enhance\n\t\tAbility as soon as possible.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Charm Person can be used in combat, but it&#8217;s hard to do so because\n\t\t\tenemies get Advantage on their save. If you cast this against neutral\n\t\t\tcreatures before combat starts, you can remove them from combat ahead of\n\t\t\ttime. When you&#8217;re ready to deal with them, break your Concentration to\n\t\t\tforcibly end the effect.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Cure Wounds<\/span>: Bards can&#8217;t afford to learn\n\t\tthis when Healing Word is an option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise Self<\/span>: Not always useful, but\n\t\tyou can fool creatures that don&#8217;t like you into thinking that you&#8217;re a\n\t\tdifferent person. This can get around things like dead enemies not wanting\n\t\tto talk to their killer when you use Speak With Dead.\n<p>If you have the Enhanced Edition, you get an item in your camp chest that provides infinite uses of this spell and shouldn\u2019t take it on any character. While the item uses a head slot, it can be taken off after casting without breaking the illusion.<\/p> <\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dissonant Whispers<\/span>: A bit of psychic\n\t\tdamage and the target is Frightened for one turn, which prevents them from\n\t\tmoving and gives them Disadvantage on Ability Checks and Attack Rolls. Good\n\t\tfor freezing a melee enemy in place so that they can&#8217;t move up to your party\n\t\tand attack them.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Experienced players will notice a difference from the tabletop version:\n\t\t\tDissonant Whispers does not force enemies to flee, which is normally a\n\t\t\tgood way to forcibly trigger Opportunity Attacks. Instead, you&#8217;ll need\n\t\t\tCommand (Flee) for that.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Faerie Fire<\/span>: Counters invisibility and\n\t\tgrants allies Advantage on attacks against affected creatures. If your party\n\t\trelies heavily on attack rolls (rather than saving throws via spells), this\n\t\tputs your party at a massive advantage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Feather Fall<\/span>: Rarely useful, and you can\n\t\tfind both potions and scrolls easily.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Word<\/span>: Among the most important\n\t\tspells in the game, the ability to heal at range with a Bonus Action means\n\t\tthat you can rescue dying allies mid-combat and still spend your Action and\n\t\tyour movement doing something exciting.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroism<\/span>: 5 temporary hit points each turn\n\t\tcan mitigate quite a bit of damage, so putting this on your party&#8217;s Defender\n\t\tcan make a huge difference. On a barbarian who will resist a lot of damage,\n\t\tthis is doubly effective. However, it requires Concentration, which means\n\t\tnot using spells that could bring a fight to a swift conclusion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Longstrider<\/span>: A great buff, but it can be\n\t\tcast as a ritual by several other classes who can then un-prepare the\n\t\tspell.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sleep<\/span>: At low levels, this is an easy win\n\t\tin many fights. Put a few enemies to sleep, kill whatever&#8217;s still conscious,\n\t\tthen work through the sleeping enemies one at a time. The duration isn&#8217;t\n\t\tlisted in the spell, and I have had enemies wake up a few turns later, so\n\t\twork quickly. Unlike the tabletop version, the number of hit points that you\n\t\tcan affect is a fixed number and scales by 8 per spell level, so the spell\n\t\tis much more reliable. As you gain levels, you might even put big enemies to\n\t\tsleep after your party has damaged them enough.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Speak with Animals<\/span>: A ton of fun and a very\n\t\tuseful spell in a game where the designers put so much into what animals\n\t\thave to say, but you can get it from potions that you can craft, so it&#8217;s not\n\t\tworth learning permanently with the Bard&#8217;s limited number of spells\n\t\tknown.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter<\/span>:\n\t\tLow-budget, single-target save-or-suck. If you&#8217;re not planning for your party\nto pile in on your target to quickly kill them, this is as good at taking a target out of combat\nas Hold Person.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderwave<\/span>: Not much damage, and\n\t\tConstitution saves are often high for many enemies, but you can launch\n\t\tenemies off ledges or into pits, which can often win a fight for you. While\n\t\thigh-Strength characters can rely on Shove, most spellcasters don&#8217;t have the\n\t\tStrength or Athletics to make that work. You can also launch objects,\n\t\tallowing you to launch a bunch of objects at your enemies if you set up\n\t\tbeforehand.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2nd-level\">2nd-Level Bard Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness<\/span>: A fantastic debuff with no\n\t\tConcentration, especially against enemies that rely on fighting at range. However, Constitution saves tend to be high, so this may prove to be unreliable. If available to your party, the rat familiar&#8217;s Infectious\n\t\tBite can impose Disadvantage on Constitution saves, making this spell much\n\t\tmore reliable.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Calm Emotions<\/span>:\n\t\tAffected creatures are immune\n        to Charmed and Frightened, which is helpful if you&#8217;re facing enemies\n        like dragons which have fear effects because you can prevent allies from\n        becoming frightened. Otherwise, it&#8217;s totally useless. Probably too situational for a bard.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloud of Daggers<\/span>:\n\t\tCreates a small area of ongoing damage. Ideally you can force enemies to stay within the are and quickly grind them down, but if they do escape, have your party Shove them back in. The upcasting scales\nat a decent rate, too, so this can remain an effective tactic through the whole game.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Crown of Madness<\/span>: In a fight against multiple enemies, this is a great way to tip things in your favor. The target is forced to move toward the nearest creature and make a melee attack, consuming the vast majority of their action economy. Melee enemies will deal more damage, but you can also target enemy spellcasters which forces them to waste their Actions making melee attacks instead of casting spells.\n\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that this forces the target to move toward and attack the nearest creature, but it does not force it to attack its own allies. It\u2019s entirely possible that your party members may be the nearest creatures.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Thoughts<\/span>:\n\t\tGet it from a consumable. This is a great way to get more conversation options, but the Bard can&#8217;t afford to spend one of their limited spells known on this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhance Ability<\/span>: Absolutely crucial. Outside of combat, this is one of the most important spells in the game. Advantage on Charisma checks without the risk of Friends or Charm Person means that you have an edge in social situations without the risk. Advantage on Dexterity checks covers both Stealth and Sleight of Hand for easy pickpocketing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\">Enthrall<\/span>:\n\t\t<!-- --><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heat Metal<\/span>: In a game where most enemies\n\t\tare humanoids using weapons and wearing armor, Heat Metal is amazing. The\n\t\ttarget doesn&#8217;t get a save, and imposing Disadvantage on their attacks and\n\t\tability checks trivializes a martial enemy relying on metal equipment.\n\t\tSure, they can drop their weapon (which you should then immediately pick up\n\t\toff the ground), but then what are they going to do? Punch you? I mean, yes,\n\t\tthat&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;ll do, but unless they&#8217;re a monk they&#8217;re basically\n\t\tslapping you with a wet noodle.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Person<\/span>: Humanoid enemies are abundant\n\t\tin Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3, making Hold Person a spectacularly powerful save-or-suck\n\t\tspell. Paralyze something, then have your party pile in on it until it&#8217;s\n\t\tdead. Upcasting this spell to add more targets keeps it powerful for a very\n\t\tlong time. However, since enemies get to repeat their saves, you need to\n\t\twork quickly.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Invisibility<\/span>:\n\t\tInvisibility requires concentration, which means you should really only be using it out of combat, and it only lasts 10 turns instead of the pen and paper version\u2019s hour, so it\u2019s not useful for long-term scouting. This renders the number of things you can usefully do with it very minimal, especially since they explicitly broke one of the most important things. Looting items from a container breaks invisibility, thus removing the remaining primary purpose. It\u2019s also readily available on scrolls and potions. Don\u2019t spend a spell known on it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Knock<\/span>: It&#8217;s stupidly easy to get past locks\n\t\tin this game, and locks are too frequent to waste a spell slot on them.\n\t\tThrow Enhance Ability (Dexterity) on whoever in your party is good at\n\t\tSleight of Hand and make it their problem.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Lesser Restoration<\/span>: Not on a bard. Have a\n\t\tcleric or druid prepare this when you need it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantasmal Force<\/span>:\n\t\tEven if you manage to get this turned to a damage type the enemy is vulnerable to, 2d6 damage per turn is not worth concentration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">See Invisibility<\/span>: A great counter to\n\t\tinvisible enemies, but I&#8217;m not sure if those are common enough that Faerie\n\t\tFire wouldn&#8217;t solve the problem. This only affects the caster, so\n\t\tunfortunately you can&#8217;t get it from\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t>.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shatter<\/span>: Low-budget fireball. The damage\n\t\tand AOE are decent, but Constitution saves tend to be high, so enemies will\n\t\toften pass the save. If you just desperately need AOE damage, upgrade to\n\t\tGlyph of Warding as soon as possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silence<\/span>: Completely shut down\n\t\tspellcasting (Minor Illusion is an exception) inside the area of effect. A\n\t\tgreat way to counter enemy spellcasters, but since the area is small they\n\t\tcan often just exit the area in order to cast spells. Put a Sussur weapon on your martial instead if you can get one.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3rd-level\">3rd-Level Bard Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3rd-level spells are a major power jump for full spellcasters, bringing\n\theavy-hitting spells like Fireball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bestow Curse<\/span>: Single-target, touch\n\t\trange, and the target gets a Wisdom save. The effects are diverse, which is\n\t\tgreat for a bard, but there&#8217;s almost always a good spell that does the same\n\t\tjob better.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dread<\/span>: 50% chance for the target to\n\t\t\t\tskip its turn. That&#8217;s very tempting, but against humanoids Hold Person\n\t\t\t\twill be much more effective since it targets the same save, allows a\n\t\t\t\trepeated save the same way, allows automatic critical hits, and robs the\n\t\t\t\ttarget of their turn 100% of the time rather than 50%.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Additional Damage<\/span>: This is basically\n\t\t\t\tHex&#8217;s damage boost, but everyone gets it. The target doesn&#8217;t get\n\t\t\t\tadditional saves to remove the effect, which is kind of nice. This could\n\t\t\t\tbe good against big enemies with a ton of hit points, but there will\n\t\t\t\talmost always be a better spell for that same enemy.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attack Disadvantage<\/span>: This isn&#8217;t a\n\t\t\t\tbad effect, but it can be done better by several other spells. On the\n\t\t\t\tsame Wisdom save, you can paralyze humanoids with Hold Person. You can\n\t\t\t\tuse Heat Metal to make enemies using metal weapons either drop their\n\t\t\t\tweapon or suffer Disadvantage to attacks. You could also use Dissonant\n\t\t\t\tWhispers or Feat to impose Disadvantage on both attacks and ability\n\t\t\t\tchecks, though those only last for one turn. Bestore Curse (Attack\n\t\t\t\tDisadvantage)&#8217;s advantage over those spells is that it lasts a full\n\t\t\t\tminute and the target can&#8217;t do anything about it. I&#8217;m not convinced\n\t\t\t\tthat that&#8217;s enough.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\"\n\t\t\t\t\t>Ability Disadvantage (Pick an Ability Score)<\/span\n\t\t\t\t>: Disadvantage on both checks and saving throws with the targeted\n\t\t\t\tability can make the target much more vulnerable. Strength will make it\n\t\t\t\teasy to Shove them, Constitution or Wisdom will make them vulnerable to\n\t\t\t\tmany save-or-suck spells. But you&#8217;re already trying to make them fail a\n\t\t\t\tsave, so why not just use one of those save-or-suck spells in the first\n\t\t\t\tplace?<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fear<\/span>: Make enemies Frightened in a cone\n\t\tand force them to drop their weapons. Most humanoid enemies rely on a\n\t\tweapon, and grabbing them off the ground while they&#8217;re still frightened\n\t\tmakes them nearly harmless.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Feign Death<\/span>: Why? I can&#8217;t think of a single\n\t\tpractical use for this spell. Sure, they get Resistance to almost all\n\t\tdamage, but since they&#8217;re unconscious your enemies crit them for free.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glyph of Warding<\/span>: You can lay this as a\n\t\ttrap, but if enemies are in the area, it triggers immediately, so you can\n\t\tuse it like any other AOE spell. Weirdly, all of the saves are Dexterity\n\t\tsaves, including the Sleep effect.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><strong>Sleep<\/strong>: Put enemies to sleep without worrying about\n\t\t\t\ttheir hit point total.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><strong>Detonation<\/strong>: Launch enemies away, potentially pushing\n\t\t\t\tthem into pits, off ledges, etc. Targets are pushed directly outward from\n\t\t\t\tthe center, so you&#8217;ll need to be precise with your placement.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><strong>Acid \/ Cold \/ Fire \/ Lightning \/ Thunder<\/strong>: Not as much\n\t\t\t\tdamage as Fireball, but you get to pick the damage type, which means\n\t\t\t\tthat you can capitalize on Wet enemies or other damage\n\t\t\t\tvulnerabilities.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hypnotic Pattern<\/span>:\n\t\tIt\u2019s so exceedingly good that they had to nerf the duration to a paltry two rounds. Even so, it\u2019s still one of the better openers for a fight as it covers a large area and magic items can stack your save DC very high, essentially shutting down a large fraction of an encounter while you deal with the rest of it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Plant Growth<\/span>: A good way to prevent\n\t\tmelee-only enemies from approaching you, and it doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\tConcentration. However, fire damage removes the effect, and creatures can\n\t\tjump over it (though I don&#8217;t know if the AI is that smart), so it won&#8217;t\n\t\talways be reliable.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Speak with Dead<\/span>: Wonderful, extremely\n\t\tuseful, and tons of fun. But with the Bard&#8217;s extremely limited number of\n\t\tspells known, you really can&#8217;t afford space for it. Get this from another\n\t\tmember of your party or from an item. You don&#8217;t need to make Charisma checks\n\t\tof any kind, so it&#8217;s fine to have your party&#8217;s low-Charisma characters do\n\t\tthe work here.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that once you\u2019ve cast this, you\u2019re free to speak with corpses until your next long rest. Just be aware that each corpse can answer a maximum of 5 questions, and many won\u2019t be willing to talk to their killer. Once a corpse has been targeted with Speak with Dead, it can never be targeted again. Quicksave if you\u2019re not sure how it will go.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stinking Cloud<\/span>: Can prevent enemies from\n\t\ttaking Actions, but they can still move and use their Bonus Action, so they\n\t\tmay just move out of the cloud.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4th-level\">4th-Level Bard Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Confusion<\/span>:\n\t\tIt&#8217;s no better than it is in the tabletop version. Optimization usually relies on consistency, and something inherently inconsistent is a hard sell when you could spend that concentration on Hypnotic Pattern instead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dimension Door<\/span>: Line of sight teleportation for you and one ally, though it does have a maximum distance. A good way to get into or out of places that are hard to reach by other methods like jumping or flying, and it can also get you out of bad places in a flight.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Freedom of Movement<\/span>: Not always useful, but\n\t\tagainst enemies that rely on Paralyzed or Restrained, this can be huge. But\n\t\twith the Bard&#8217;s limited number of spells known you can&#8217;t afford to learn\n\t\tthis. Get it from\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t>.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Invisibility<\/span>:\n\t\tOnce you&#8217;re done concentrating on your opening Hypnotic Pattern, this can be a great way to give someone permanent advantage on attacks for a fight. It\u2019s melee range though, so your primary targets will be people in a backline who like attacking; make sure you have a ranged dps around to get the best value from this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Polymorph<\/span>: Not at all what tabletop players\n\t\tare familiar with, Polymorph turns the target into a sheep for 5 turns. The\n\t\tsheep is harmless, and your party&#8217;s stronger characters can do things like Shove or\n\t\tthrow it great distances, allowing you to toss the target into a pit. But\n\t\tfor the same Wisdom save, other spells like Hold Person or Crown of Madness\n\t\tmay be just as effective at taking a target out of a fight without costing\n\t\tsuch a high-level spell slot.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5th-level\">5th-Level Bard Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dominate Person<\/span>: In a game where the\n\t\tmajority of enemies are humanoids, Dominate person is very powerful. You\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get to control the target&#8217;s turns, but it still becomes fully allied to you for the duration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Restoration<\/span>: Very helpful, but\n\t\tnot useful often enough to justify learning it on a bard. Get a cleric or a\n\t\tdruid to do it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hold Monster<\/span>: An upgrade to Hold Person, this\n\t\tcan take any creature out of a fight and let your party get automatic\n\t\tcritical hits while they rush to bring your target down before they get\n\t\tanother save.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Cure Wounds<\/span>: Only useful if you\n\t\thave multiple allies dying and they&#8217;re too far apart to hit them both with a\n\t\tsingle thrown potion of healing and you don&#8217;t have a way to hit them all\n\t\twith Healing Word before their turns roll around. Spending a spell to heal\n\t\tmid-combat is rarely a good idea.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Planar Binding<\/span>: Basically Dominate Person\n\t\tfor Celestials, Elementals, Fey, and Fiends.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Seeming<\/span>: Basically Disguise Self, but\n\t\tfor your whole party. If you&#8217;re getting a lot of use out of Disguise Self,\n\t\tthis lets you drag your party of non-casters along with you.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6th-level\">6th-Level Bard Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>With a level cap of 12, 6th-level spells are the highest that we see in\n\tBaldur&#8217;s Gate 3, making them the most powerful spells that you can get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eyebite<\/span>: Exceptionally powerful. Turn it on and get a free save-or-suck every turn for a full minute.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Panicked<\/span>: The target drops their\n\t\t\t\tweapons, has Disadvantage on attacks and checks, flees, and can&#8217;t take\n\t\t\t\tActions. This will provoke Opportunity Attacks from your allies, plus\n\t\t\t\tyou can grab your target&#8217;s weapon(s) off the ground. The target does get\n\t\t\t\tto make additional saves to end the effect, but if they come back you\n\t\t\t\tcan hit them with this again.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sickened<\/span>: A gamble with a good\n\t\t\t\tpayoff. Constitution saves tend to be high, but if this works your\n\t\t\t\ttarget is debuffed for a full minute.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Asleep<\/span>: Asleep for 10 rounds means\n\t\t\t\tthat the target is done fighting until you decide to wake them up,\n\t\t\t\tusually with a big critical hit or by Shoving them off a cliff. If your\n\t\t\t\ttarget still isn&#8217;t dead, hit them with this again and put them back to\n\t\t\t\tsleep.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Otto&#8217;s Irresistible Dance<\/span>: Turns\n\t\tmelee-only enemies into easy targets. With a 10-round duration and no\n\t\tadditional saves, this can completely remove the target from a fight. Hold\n\t\tMonster will frequently be sufficient and targets the same save, but not\n\t\tallowing repeated saves makes it easier to take an enemy out of a fight so\n\t\tthat you can focus on other problems and have ample time to do so. Of course,\nthis can&#8217;t compete with Eyebite.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Bards learn spells permanently, their number of spells known is extremely limited, and changing your spells known is difficult (unless you count completely rebuilding your character, which is always an option). This means that picking spells which work for you is absolutely crucial, and that you can&#8217;t afford to select spells which won&#8217;t be consistently useful. Bard spells overwhelmingly focus on mind-affecting spells, which means that most of their spells call for a Wisdom saving throw. Unfortunately, that means that it can often be difficult to target a creature&#8217;s lowest saves.
