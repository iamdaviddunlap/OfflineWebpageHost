We can only use it on\n\t\thumanoids, and the target will get a wisdom saving throw at the end of each\n\t\tturn. Against many humanoid enemies, it is worth upcasting to have the\n\t\topportunity to take multiple creatures out of the fight for at least one\n\t\tround.

It works identically to Hold Person except that it can affect\n\t\tall creatures except undead. I would expect that a level 9 caster has better\n\t\topportunities for doling out damage than using Hold Monster to allow the\n\t\tmartial characters to beat on a creature, but the defensive benefits of\n\t\tremoving a high-value target are incredible, too. It may be worth it to take\n\t\tone or more creatures out of the fight for at least one round. Remember that\n\t\tthe Sorcerer can use Twin Spell to target two creatures as long as they\n\t\thaven&#8217;t upcast the spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"petrified\">Petrified<\/h5>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span id=\"flesh-to-stone\" class=\"rating-orange\">Flesh to Stone<\/span>:\n\t\tFlesh to Stone is available to Warlocks and Wizards at 11th level. Again, I\n\t\twould expect that you have better opportunities for damage, but the spell\n\t\tmay be worth the spell slot if removing a creature from the fight for a\n\t\tperiod of time would be useful. The spell allows a Con save, and\n\t\tunfortunately, Con saves are statistically the strongest saves for monsters.\n\t\tThe great news is that if the creature fails the initial Con save, they are\n\t\tRestrained for a minimum of three rounds while they accumulate either enough\n\t\tsaving throws to end the spell or become Petrified. That makes it an\n\t\tespecially juicy choice for disadvantage mechanics like Heighten metamagic\n\t\tand\/or\n\t\t<a id=\"silvery-barbs\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\">Silvery Barbs<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stunned\">Stunned<\/h5>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span id=\"stunning-strike\" class=\"rating-green\">Stunning Strike<\/span>:\n\t\tStunning Strike is a 5th-level Monk feature. Unfortunately, it grants a Con\n\t\tsave, but on a failed save the target will be Stunned into the end of the\n\t\tMonk&#8217;s next turn. Stunning Strike isn&#8217;t one of the best features in the\n\t\tgame, but it is one of the best features available to Monks!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"divine-word\" class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Word<\/span>: A\n\t\t7th-level spell available to Clerics. It allows the Cleric to target any\n\t\tnumber of creatures that the caster can see within range. Each creature\n\t\tmakes a Cha save. On a failed save the creature will potentially suffer a\n\t\tnegative effect based on their current HP. If the HP is less than 30 then\n\t\tthe creature will be stunned for an hour. Less than 20 they instantly die.\n\t\tNote that extraplanar creatures are cast back to their home plane instead.\n\t\tThis spell is situationally useful against mobs or\n\t\tnot-quite-mob-but-still-large groups of enemies that have been softened up\n\t\twith a Fireball.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"divine-word\" class=\"rating-orange\">Power Word Stun<\/span>: An\n\t\t8th-level spell available to Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards. If the\n\t\ttarget has 150 HP or less, it is stunned. At the end of each of its turns it\n\t\tgets a Con save. I&#8217;m not certain that one almost-guaranteed round of Stunned\n\t\tmakes this worth the high cost. I suppose you could view this 8th-level\n\t\tEnchantment as an expensive way to ask if the target has over 150 HP\n\t\tleft.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"psychic-scream\" class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Scream<\/span>: A\n\t\t9th-level spell available to Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards. It\n\t\tgrants an Int save with guaranteed damage. Allowing for the opportunity to\n\t\tstun up to ten targets, I view the potential 14d6 as lagniappe. Any stunned\n\t\tcreature gets another Int saving throw at the end of its turn, but the stun\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t have a duration, so it&#8217;s technically possible for targets to be\n\t\tpermanently stunned, and since Int saves are consistently the weakest save\n\t\ton average, you can often expect enemies to be stunned for a long time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unconscious\">Unconscious<\/h5>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span id=\"sleep\" class=\"rating-green\">Sleep<\/span>: A 1st-level spell\n\t\tavailable to Bards, Sorcerers, Twilight Clerics, and Wizards.

This gives attackers within 5 feet Advantage to attack them until the\n\tcreature can break the grapple and stand up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"restrained\">Restrained<\/h5>\n\n\n<p>Restrained is superior to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"9129\">grapple\/shove combo<\/a> if you can induce the condition.

It allows you to\n\t\tmake an additional grapple check against a creature you are currently\n\t\tgrappling. On success you are both now restrained. Generally, it would be\n\t\tbetter for the party to use the grapple\/shove tactic rather than allow\n\t\tyourself to become restrained.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"net-weapon\" class=\"rating-red\">Net<\/span>: On a successful ranged attack roll, you restrain your target. Any creature within reach can make a DC 10 strength check to free the restrained creature. Alternatively, 5 slashing damage on an AC 10 attack will free the creature AND destroy the net. You&#8217;re also stuck with near-perpetual Disadvantage when attacking with nets due to their frustrating range. Nets aren&#8217;t great.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And the spells<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span id=\"ensnaring-strike\" class=\"rating-blue\"><\/span>Ensnaring Strike: A\n\t\t1st-level Conjuration available to Rangers. It allows a Str save to avoid\n\t\tbeing restrained and take 1d6 damage each turn. Once restrained, the\n\t\tcreature or another creature nearby must use their action to attempt to free\n\t\tthe creature with a strength check.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"web-spell\" class=\"rating-green\">Web<\/span>: A 2nd-level\n\t\tConjuration available to Artificers, Sorcerers, and Wizards. It allows a Dex\n\t\tsave to avoid being restrained, then a Str check to escape restraint.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"black-tentacles\" class=\"rating-green\">Black Tentacles<\/span>: A\n\t\t4th-level Conjuration available to Wizards. It creates an area of difficult\n\t\tterrain that restrains creatures that fail a Dex save.

The\n\t\tcaster may turn mud into rock or rock into mud. Both transmutations have the\n\t\tcapacity to leave creatures restrained. In the rare condition where your\n\t\topponents are knee deep in mud, encasing their feet in rock is a more\n\t\teffective restraint.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"for-the-dm\">For the DM<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>As a DM, anytime we are looking to grapple our player characters, we should\n\tlook to bring the players somewhere they don&#8217;t want to be: into the murky\n\tabyss of the swamp, into the lava flow, or perhaps off that nearby ledge.\n\tGrappling can also be effective for keeping a player character out of the fray\n\twhile other monsters deal with the rest of the party.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tier-1\">Tier 1<\/h5>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/16834-crocodile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crocodile<\/a> &#8211;\n\tCR \u00bd &#8211; Monster Manual<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crocodile has the ability to grapple upon a successful bite.

I\n\t\tbelieve this makes Assassin&#8217;s blood the most expensive shot in the game.\n\t\tSure, it might kill a house cat, but so would 6 shots of tequila at a\n\t\tsignificant savings. Given the high likelihood of failure it might be more\n\t\tcost effective to hire an actual assassin.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"drow-poison\" class=\"rating-orange\">Drow Poison<\/span>: 200 GP.\n\t\tThe poison must be applied to any object that deals piercing or slashing\n\t\tdamage.

If they fail by 5 or more, they are also\n\t\tunconscious.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a handful of spells:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span id=\"ray-of-sickness\" class=\"rating-green\">Ray of Sickness<\/span>: A\n\t\t1st-level of spell available to sorcerers and wizards.

On a hit, the target must make a Con save or\n\t\tbe poisoned until the end of the caster&#8217;s next turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span id=\"contagion\" class=\"rating-green\">Contagion<\/span>: A 5th-level\n\t\tspell available to Clerics and Druids. On a hit, the target creature is\n\t\tpoisoned. It makes a Con save at the end of each turn; on three successes\n\t\tthe creature is no longer poisoned. On three failures things get\u2026 worse.\n\t\tGiven that combat is expected to last about three rounds, ideally the\n\t\tcreature will be poisoned for the rest of its life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exhaustion\"><em>Exhaustion<\/em><\/h6>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span id=\"sickening-radiance\" class=\"rating-blue\">Sickening Radiance<\/span>: Sickening Radiance is a 4th level Evocation spell available to Sorcerers,\n\t\tWarlocks, and Wizards. Sickening Radiance creates a 30 ft radius sphere.\n\t\tWhen a creature first enters the sphere or at the beginning of a turn\n\t\tstarting in the sphere, they must pass a constitution saving throw or take a\n\t\tlevel of exhaustion. Sickening Radiance is best used when you can either\n\t\tcorner and close the door on a creature or group of creatures or when your\n\t\tparty can block the exits.
