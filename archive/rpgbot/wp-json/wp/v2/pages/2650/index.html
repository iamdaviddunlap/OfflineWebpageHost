It has a similar skill set, both in and out of combat, and building a Blood Hunter feels very similar. You could easily take any Ranger and replace all of their class levels with Blood Hunter levels and have a perfectly functional character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the Blood Hunter is a complicated class. It has several resource pools to track, and Crimson Rite allows you to temporarily alter your own hit point maximum. If you&#8217;re intimidated by math, or if you find spellcasters difficult to play, you may not enjoy the class. But if you&#8217;re comfortable managing resource pools and like making life-or-death risk-reward decisions in the thick of combat, the Blood Hunter has a lot to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the flavor of the class is interesting and the abilities are thematic and exciting, the text of the class is somewhat rough and may be difficult to interpret at times.

Alchemist&#8217;s Tools are nice if you enjoy using\n\talchemical items, and you still get the usual 2 skills, though the skill list\n\tis small, doesn&#8217;t fit well with good ability scores for the class, and is\n\tmostly composed of highly situational skills.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunter&#8217;s Bane<\/span>: The Blood Hunter is a class\n\tthat looks for any excuse to track a monster, so Advantage of Wisdom\n\t(Survival) checks to track some monsters is helpful. Being unable to be\n\tsurprised by what you&#8217;re tracking is nice, especially since Perception isn&#8217;t\n\ton the Blood Hunter skill list. The extra feature at 11th level is\n\tinteresting, but with dumped Charisma Advantage isn&#8217;t enough to make you good\n\tat Intimidation.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Crimson Rite<\/span>: The wording of the ability is\n\tvery specific to ensure that you always lose X hit points and can&#8217;t regain\n\tthem until you end the effect, but you also don&#8217;t lose a total of twice your\n\tlevel in hit points. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the bonus damage is\n\tmagic, but it doesn&#8217;t make attacks with the weapon magic, so creatures which\n\tyou attack might resist your weapon damage but not the bonus damage from\n\tCrimson Rite. The damage bonus scales with level, and it feels really good on\n\ttop of Extra Attack. The ability is also worded to disadvantage two-weapon\n\tfighting, thrown weapons, and Polearm Master users, but it works really well\n\tfor Crossbow Expert users.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Primal Rites<\/strong>: You eventually get all three Primal Rite\n\t\toptions, so the biggest decision point is what order in which to take them.\n\t\tBlood Hunters typically face evil creatures like fiends, so you want to take\n\t\toptions which aren&#8217;t commonly resisted by those creatures.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rite of the Flame<\/span>: Nearly all fiends\n\t\t\t\thave resistance to fire damage, and it&#8217;s commonly resisted by other\n\t\t\t\tcreatures too.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rite of the Frozen<\/span>: Many fiends have\n\t\t\t\tresistance to cold, but not so many as have resistance to fire.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rite of the Storm<\/span>: Fiends usually\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t have resistance to lightning damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Esoteric Rites<\/strong>: You only get one, and Rite of the Roar is\n\t\tconsiderably better than the other options.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rite of the Dead<\/span>: Most things don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tresist necrotic damage, but the things that do resist it are evil\n\t\t\t\tcreatures which blood hunters can expect to face.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rite of the Oracle<\/span>: Psychic damage\n\t\t\t\tis resisted by very few creatures, but many undead and constructs are\n\t\t\t\toutright immune to it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rite of the Roar<\/span>: Almost nothing\n\t\t\t\tresists sonic damage. The only better option is Force damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Style<\/span>: Fighting Style is a welcome\n\taddition for any martial character. The Blood Hunter gets all of the offensive\n\toptions, but no defensive options.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The obvious choice for ranged builds. +2 to hit is a big deal in a game\n\t\twhere a 20th-level character can expect a maximum of +11 to hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Note that this works while using a shield. 2 damage closes the damage gap\n\t\tbetween a longsword and a two-handed weapon (4.5-&gt;6.5 vs. 6.5\/7).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Weapon Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This adds\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/rpg.stackexchange.com\/questions\/47172\/how-much-damage-does-great-weapon-fighting-add-on-average#answer-47173\">an average of just over 1 damage per attack on average<\/a>, and even then the only with a greatsword. Tragically, the Blood Hunter\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get a better option if you plan to use two-handed melee weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The Blood Hunter&#8217;s attacks more closely resemble the Ranger&#8217;s than the\n\t\tFighter&#8217;s. You only get two attacks, and you can apply Crimson Rite to both\n\t\tweapons to get the on-hit damage boost. However, beware the stacking costs\n\t\tof Crimson Rite.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Maledict<\/span>: Blood Maledict feels a\n\tlittle bit like spellcasting. It&#8217;s not spellcasting, but it certainly feels\n\tthat way. You get a maximum of 3 uses per short rest, so when you resort to a\n\tBlood Curse it needs to be a situation that really justifies it.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Curses<\/span>: Most of the options are\n\tsituational, and the ones that are useful constantly are bad. Think of these\n\tless like hammers of various sizes, and more like a belt of single-task tools.\n\tYou get to learn a total of 5 curses by 20th level, which is exactly enough to\n\tskip the worst of the 8 options.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Curse of Binding<\/span>: Reducing a\n\t\tcreature&#8217;s speed to 0 can be very effective. Prone enemies can&#8217;t stand, and\n\t\tflying enemies begin to fall. If you amplify the effect, you might be able\n\t\tto keep melee enemies out of a fight for several rounds. However, if your\n\t\tWisdom is poor the DC will be unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Curse of The Eyeless<\/span>: Imposing\n\t\tDisadvantage as a reaction is really nice. Amplifying it is easily worth the\n\t\tcost because even at low levels enemies will routinely deal more damage than\n\t\tyour Crimson Rite dice in a single attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blood Curse of The Fallen Puppet<\/span>:\n\t\tSituational. Unless you&#8217;re fighting something that relies on big single\n\t\tattacks, this won&#8217;t do a lot of damage. The amplification is tempting, but\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t make this great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blood Curse of The Fending Rite<\/span>:\n\t\tSituational by design. Definitely tempting if you&#8217;re built with poor\n\t\tDexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Curse of The Marked<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get\n\t\tenough uses of Blood Maledict to waste them on such a small boost to damage\n\t\toutput. Even with the enhancement it&#8217;s not worthwhile. If your enemy is\n\t\tresistant to your rite damage, change damage types.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Curse of Mutual Suffering<\/span>: There is\n\t\tno cap on how many times you can have this running at once. Use all of your\n\t\tdaily uses of Blood Maledict, then go stand in front of the BBEG and watch\n\t\tthem explode when they touch you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Curse of Purgation<\/span>: The normal\n\t\tversion is too situational, and even the amplified effect is worse than\n\t\tLesser Restoration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blood Curse of Spell Sunder<\/span>: Too\n\t\tsituational, and the amplified version is bad because your Wisdom can&#8217;t keep\n\t\tpace with spell levels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"\">Blood Hunter Order<\/span>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Blood Hunter\n\tOrders&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: A crucial feature of almost\n\tany martial class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Grim Psychometry<\/span>: Situational and poorly\n\tdefined. This is greatly dependent on your DM&#8217;s willingness to reveal plot\n\tdetails that might otherwise not be accessible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dark Velocity<\/span>: Darkvision is really good,\n\tbut most creatures have Darkvision so you&#8217;re hardly unique in that capacity.\n\tExtending existing Darkvision range is really good because creatures relying\n\ton Darkvision are effectively blind beyond their Darkvision range. The extra\n\tmove speed is nice, too. The text says &#8220;Attacks of Opportunity&#8221;, which is a\n\tterm from 3rd Edition\/Pathfinder. In 5e they&#8217;re called &#8220;Opportunity\n\tAttacks&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hardened Soul<\/span>: Fear and Charm effects become\n\tcommon at high levels, and many effects that don&#8217;t make you frightened and\n\tdon&#8217;t charm you are also considered &#8220;fear&#8221; and &#8220;charm&#8221; effects, so resistances\n\tlike this are much more effective than they appear at first glance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanguine Mastery<\/span>: Falling below 1\/4th hit\n\tpoints usually means that it&#8217;s time to run away, but now it&#8217;s time to step up\n\tand deal some damage. The ability to recharge Blood Maledict is really nice,\n\tbut the ability doesn&#8217;t limit how you score the critical hit so you can easily\n\tuse this to recharge Blood Maledict by repeatedly striking unconscious enemies\n\tor by stabbing a bag of rats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Blood Hunter Orders<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-of-the-ghostslayer\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Order of The Ghostslayer<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the baseline for the Blood Hunter. It&#8217;s a solid archetype that broadens the Blood Hunter&#8217;s possible targets, and its still effective in a variety of situations that don&#8217;t directly pertain to killing undead creatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rite of the Dawn<\/span>: This is fantastic. Halve\n\t\tthe cost of Crimson Rite, and Radiant damage is a better damage type than\n\t\tyou can get until you can get Rite of the Roar. The bonus damage is great\n\t\ttoo, and adding it against all creatures at 11th level means that radiant\n\t\tdamage remains your best option against anything that isn&#8217;t resistant to\n\t\tradiant damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hallowed Veins<\/span>: Blood Curses work on\n\t\tmost creatures, and you get so few uses per rest that you&#8217;ll have plenty of\n\t\ttargets. However, incorporeal undead like banshees and shadows don&#8217;t have\n\t\tblood, and for a subclass clearly out to hunt ghosts it&#8217;s nice to be able to\n\t\taffect ghosts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Supernal Surge<\/span>: At the same level that\n\t\tRite of Dawn applies bonus damage against all enemies, you get to make three\n\t\tattacks several times per short rest. The ability to walk through enemies\n\t\tand walls is nice, too. Usually you can&#8217;t do that without high-level spells\n\t\tlike Etherealness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vengeful spirit<\/span>: Magical Darkness is a\n\t\tserious problem for nearly any adventurer. If you have an ally who can cast\n\t\tDarkness, have them case it on your while you murder your blinded\n\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-of-the-lycan\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Order of The Lycan<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Order of the Lycan is objectively overpowered. It&#8217;s a horrifying melee threat with too much AC, damage resistance that&#8217;s too good, damage output that&#8217;s too good and too reliable, limited resources that will well outlast the rest of your party, and pointlessly minor drawbacks that are further mitigated as you gain levels. This subclass combines all of the best mathematical parts of the barbarian, the fighter, and the monk, and outdoes all three of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Senses<\/span>: Detecting creatures\n\t\tsneaking around often relies on sound, so advantage on Wisdom (Perception)\n\t\tchecks involving hearing is useful frequently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hybrid Transformation<\/span>: This is your\n\t\tsignature ability. The 10-minute duration is long enough to last through a\n\t\tfight or two if you move quickly, and you get two uses per rest so you can\n\t\teasily use this in every fight in a day. The biggest risk is going into a\n\t\tfight unprepared and being forced to spend an action to transform. Even the\n\t\tability&#8217;s drawbacks are extremely\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feral Might<\/span>: The damage bonus is small\n\t\t\t\tand scales very slowly, but more damage is always great. Advantage on\n\t\t\t\tStrength checks and Strength saving throws will help compensate for your\n\t\t\t\tdumped Strength.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resilient Hide<\/span>: With 20 Dexterity you\n\t\t\t\tcan match the AC of full plate, and you also get damage resistance.\n\t\t\t\tThrow on a shield and you have 20 AC.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Predatory Strikes<\/span>: The scaling damage\n\t\t\t\tdice honestly don&#8217;t matter that much, but getting another attack as a\n\t\t\t\tbonus action is absolutely fantastic.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"\">Cursed Weakness<\/span>: I suppose in a game with Order\n\t\t\t\tof the Lycan Blood Hunters it would make sense that some enemies might\n\t\t\t\tuse silvered weapons, but in a typical campaign the only people with\n\t\t\t\tsilvered weapons will be the PC&#8217;s. Even in those cases, you can revert\n\t\t\t\tto your normal form and grab a sword.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"\">Bloodlust<\/span>: Problematic, but not insurmountable.\n\t\t\t\tPosition yourself carefully, and always keep an enemy between yourself\n\t\t\t\tand your allies. Remember that opportunity attacks only occur when you\n\t\t\t\tleave a creature&#8217;s reach, so you&#8217;re free to run into melee then run\n\t\t\t\taround behind an enemy to make them the target of your Bloodlust.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stalker&#8217;s Prowess<\/span>: An extra 10 ft. of\n\t\tspeed is really great for a character so strictly locked into melee.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Predatory Strikes<\/span>: By this\n\t\t\t\tlevel you really need your weapon attacks to be magical, and if you\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t have Crimson Rite running constantly you&#8217;re giving up easy access\n\t\t\t\tto a lot of damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Transformation<\/span>: Transforming as a\n\t\tbonus action means that you can handle being surprised more easily, but\n\t\tremember to activate Crimson Rite long beforehand so that your bonus action\n\t\tis less in demand.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lycan Regeneration<\/span>: Any amount of hit\n\t\t\t\tpoint regeneration is great. If your Dexterity is maxed out, consider\n\t\t\t\ttaking the Tough feat to dramatically raise your hit point maximum, but\n\t\t\t\tremember that the healing is based on your Constitution modifier so its\n\t\t\t\ta trade between healing quickly or healing to a higher threshold.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beastly Precision<\/span>: This is amazing. In\n\t\t\t\ta campaign with magic items, a +1 weapon is a significant boost to\n\t\t\t\tdamage output because a +1 to attacks is a huge benefit in a game where\n\t\t\t\ta character&#8217;s attack bonus typically maxes out at +11. When you get\n\t\t\t\tthis, it&#8217;s already a +2 bonus to attacks, and combined with Feral Might\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re getting +2 to both attack and damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Volition<\/span>: Bloodlust is already easy\n\t\tto mitigate, but Advantage on the save is still nice to have.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pack Hunter<\/span>: At this point I think\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s fair to say that the Order of the Lycan is overpowered. You&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\talready getting +3 to attacks on top of your normal proficiency\n\t\t\t\tbonus+dex and a huge pile of damage (something like 2d8+8) on three\n\t\t\t\tattacks per turn with an AC of 20. And now you can get Advantage on\n\t\t\t\tthose attacks by having another ally in melee. Do you have an ally with\n\t\t\t\ta familiar?

Adding Warlock spellcasting to a martial character opens up some really interesting character concepts, and despite some issues in the design Order of the Profane Soul is easily my favorite of the Blood Hunter orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Otherworldly Patron<\/strong>: Matt Mercer has done a great job\n\t\tkeeping up with the new patrons. Unfortunately, few of the patrons are\n\t\tactually worthwhile. Remember that these benefits are fairly minor; the real\n\t\treason you&#8217;re here is for the spellcasting.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Archfey<\/span>: Starts with a\n\t\t\t\tsituational option and never really recovers.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Fiend<\/span>: Primarily focuses on doing\n\t\t\t\tfire damage, but doesn&#8217;t do it especially well.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Great Old One<\/span>: Decent, with a\n\t\t\t\tweird combination of crowd control, utility, and buffs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Undying<\/span>: Starts strong then\n\t\t\t\ttapers off almost immediately.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Celestial<\/span>: For a class with no\n\t\t\t\tother healing options, this is surprisingly good.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Hexblade<\/span>: Nothing good until 15th\n\t\t\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pact Magic<\/span>: Order of the Profane Soul\n\t\tgives you the Warlock&#8217;s Pact Magic in the same way that Eldritch Knight\n\t\tgives the Fighter the Wizard&#8217;s spellcasting. See the Spells section, below,\n\t\tfor help selecting spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Rite Focus<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Archfey<\/span>: Situational, but a\n\t\t\t\tgreat option if your party can&#8217;t easily handle invisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Fiend<\/span>: Rite of the Flame is the\n\t\t\t\tworst choice for Crimson Rite.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Great Old One<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using\n\t\t\t\ttwo-weapon fighting or Crossbow Expert, you might score critical hits\n\t\t\t\tfairly often. However, the target also gets a saving throw and requiring\n\t\t\t\tboth a critical hit and a failed save means that this will essentially\n\t\t\t\tnever work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Undying<\/span>: Regaining hit points when\n\t\t\t\tyou kill a creature is great, but remember that you need to reduce it to\n\t\t\t\tzero hit points and kill it at the same time, so you can&#8217;t farm dying\n\t\t\t\tenemies for hit points.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Celestial<\/span>: Roughly on par with\n\t\t\t\tHealing Word.

Using either Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade\n\t\tin conjunction with the extra attack from Mystic Frenzy deals more total\n\t\tdamage than a fighter making normal attacks at any level (provided that you\n\t\tcan trigger the secondary damage from either cantrip). Crimson Rite will be\n\t\tless important, but you&#8217;ll net more total damage. See my article on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Revealed Arcana<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Archfey<\/span>: A fantastic defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Fiend<\/span>: You will be more effective\n\t\t\t\twith weapons.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Great Old One<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Undying<\/span>: A great debuff, but\n\t\t\t\tyour spell DC can&#8217;t compete with a full spellcaster so you may find that\n\t\t\t\tthe spell is unreliable.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Celestial<\/span>: Lesser Restoration is a\n\t\t\t\tcrucial spell, but by this level someone else in your party should be\n\t\t\t\table to cast it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Hexblade<\/span>: Situational, but a\n\t\t\t\tgreat option if your party can&#8217;t easily handle invisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Diabolic Channel<\/span>: This is a complex\n\t\tability, and there are a lot of important complications buried in the\n\t\twording. First, using this takes your action, so you can&#8217;t combine it with\n\t\tMystic Frenzy. However, if you activate Crimson Rite as a bonus action this\n\t\tis a great way to spend your first turn in combat.\n\t\t<p>Second, you can only use this will spell slots, which means that it won&#8217;t\n\t\t\twork with cantrips, so no piling Eldritch Blast on top of your weapon\n\t\t\tattack. Instead, you&#8217;ll be using one of your two spell slots per rest.\n\t\t\tThis is likely the best way for you to use an offensive spell, so consider\n\t\t\tlearning one or two damage spells for use with Diabolic Channel.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Third, all attacks that you would normally make as part of the spell hit\n\t\t\tautomatically, provided that your weapon attack hits, but any spells which\n\t\t\tcall for saving throws still allow saving throws. So Witch Bolt would hit\n\t\t\t(provided that your weapon attack hits) and go into effect, but the target\n\t\t\tstill gets a save against Shatter.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Fourth, if the attack is made with Advantage,\n\t\t\t<em>the target of the attack<\/em> takes Disadvantage on any initial saving\n\t\t\tthrow. Other targets make their saves normally.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Fifth, area spells center their area on the target. If you&#8217;re using a\n\t\t\tmelee weapon, that means that you&#8217;re setting of Shatter or whatever else\n\t\t\timmediately in front of you. This can work for cone spells or for spells\n\t\t\twith a small AOE like Cloud of Daggers, but generally you&#8217;ll want to save\n\t\t\tAOE spells for making ranged attacks.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Finally, there is an additional paragraph on the next page of the PDF\n\t\t\twhich specifies requirements for the spell used with the ability. However,\n\t\t\tthe grammar of this paragraph directly conflicts with the earlier text of\n\t\t\tthe ability which specifies that you need to use a spell slot. It&#8217;s hard\n\t\t\tto guess Matt Mercer&#8217;s original intent for this text, but as it&#8217;s worded a\n\t\t\tspell must satisfy any one of the three requirements listed. Under the\n\t\t\twording of this paragraph, you could cast a cantrip like Eldritch Blast\n\t\t\tbecause it takes an action to cast. I think the intent was that the spell\n\t\t\tmust be a spell of 1st level or higher, and must meet either the second or\n\t\t\tthird requirement (cast as an Action, or an ongoing spell which allows you\n\t\t\tto activate it as an action like Witch Bolt). This would disallow spells\n\t\t\tcast as a Reaction like Hellish Rebuke.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Unsealed Arcana<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Archfey<\/span>: Slow is a fine spell, but\n\t\t\t\tby this level your Wisdom is far enough behind that your spell save DC\n\t\t\t\tis really poor.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Fiend<\/span>: The Blood Hunter isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tgreat at handling crowds, so Fireball is a great addition, but your\n\t\t\t\tspell save DC is still terrible. If you&#8217;re using a ranged weapon you can\n\t\t\t\tthrow this into Diabolic Channel and shoot something with it, but unless\n\t\t\t\tyou have Advantage on the attack I wouldn&#8217;t bother.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Great Old One<\/span>: Haste is a\n\t\t\t\tfantastic buff, and you have very few spells which require\n\t\t\t\tConcentration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Undying<\/span>: A great debuff, but\n\t\t\t\tyour spell save DC is still poor. But if you can get Advantage on an\n\t\t\t\tattack and use Diabolic Channel it could work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Celestial<\/span>: Revivify is one of the\n\t\t\t\tbest spells in the game.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Hexblade<\/span>: A fantastic defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuff.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Soul Syphon<\/span>: Considering Matt Mercer\n\t\ttypically forgets the &#8220;bag of rats&#8221; trick, I&#8217;m surprised to see that Soul\n\t\tSyphon has a CR requirement. Due to the wording of the ability you need to\n\t\treduce the creature to 0 hit points <em>and<\/em> kill it at the same time,\n\t\tso you can&#8217;t execute a target that&#8217;s already at 0 hit points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-of-the-mutant\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Order of The Mutant<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the numerous Mutagen options, Order of the Mutant is boring and not terribly the effective. The best thing you can get from the subclass is a scaling numeric bonus to Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Formulas<\/span>: See &#8220;Mutagens&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mutagen Craft<\/span>: The phrasing of the\n\t\tability is abnormal, but this works like identifying a magic item. You spend\n\t\ttime while taking a short rest to craft your mutagen, but you still get all\n\t\tof the normal benefits of a short rest (hit dice, etc.). You only get one\n\t\tmutagen at a time until you get Advanced Mutagen Craft at 7th level, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll generally want to prepare you favorite mutagen unless you know that\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going to need something specific.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Mutagen Craft<\/span>: Having only one\n\t\tmutagen means that you need to guess what you&#8217;ll need or you need to stick\n\t\tto a favorite mutagen that always works.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Strange Metabolism<\/span>: Most of the good\n\t\tmutagens have fairly gentle side effects, but sometimes they&#8217;re still a\n\t\tproblem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Robust Physiology<\/span>: Poison damage is really\n\t\tcommon, so immunity is really helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exalted Mutation<\/span>: The only way to get two\n\t\tmutagens simultaneously. Choose Celerity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Mutagens<\/span>: You get just 7 choices from the 15 options,\n\t\tbut since you can never have more than 2 mutagens prepared you&#8217;ll probably\n\t\tnever use most of the options you learn.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Aether<\/span>: You can&#8217;t learn this until 11th\n\t\t\t\tlevel and it <em>still<\/em> has frustrating side effects. By this level\n\t\t\t\tyour party&#8217;s spellcasters will have multiple means of magical flight and\n\t\t\t\tcan probably share them with you.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celerity<\/span>: Blood Hunters are\n\t\t\t\tDexterity-based, so adding up to 5 to your Dexterity is a significant\n\t\t\t\tbuff both offensively and defensively. This is a great go-to mutagen at\n\t\t\t\talmost any level, but depending on how your ability scores line up you\n\t\t\t\tmay not want to use this until it gives you at least +2 Dexterity. The\n\t\t\t\tpenalties to Wisdom are annoying and will handicap your Blood Maledict\n\t\t\t\tDC, but your DCs were already terrible and you should pick your Blood\n\t\t\t\tCurses with that in mind.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Conservant<\/span>: Useful if you&#8217;re doing a\n\t\t\t\tlot of knowledge checks or something, but definitely not a\n\t\t\t\tmust-have.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cruelty<\/span>: Only useful for two-handed\n\t\t\t\tweapon builds and archery builds that don&#8217;t want to use Crossbow Expert.\n\t\t\t\tThe side effects are brutal, and neither of those builds should\n\t\t\t\texist.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Impermeable<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mobility<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nighteye<\/span>: Not very exciting, but\n\t\t\t\textremely useful if you don&#8217;t have Darkvision naturally.

You&#8217;ll get very slightly better spellcasting, and if you take\n\t\tWarlock as your first level you&#8217;ll get to use the Warlock&#8217;s skill list.\n\t\tCombined with Hex Warrior, you can easily build yourself as a Face. However,\n\t\tthe rules for Blood Hunter Multiclassing With Warlock presented at the end\n\t\tof the document mean that you&#8217;ll be using your Wisdom as your spellcasting\n\t\tability once your Blood Hunter levels exceed your Warlock level(s), so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll be splitting your resources between four ability scores (Dex, Con,\n\t\tWis, Cha) instead of three.<\/li>\n\t<!--\n\t\t<li><span class=\"\">Wizard<\/span>: <\/li>\n\t\t-->\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Variant Human Blood Hunter (Order of Ghostdlayer)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>Twang.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My primary example builds are typically &#8220;staple builds&#8221; which use the options from the SRD and the Basic Rules to provide mechanically simple examples of how to build an iconic version of the class.

Spend some of the gold from your background on additional bolts because you&#8217;re going to go through them quickly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our signature combo starts right at level 1. If you are conscious, you should have Crimson Rite running on your crossbow. At this level it costs just 1 hit point, and even at level 1 you can afford 1 hit point. In a typical turn you can attack twice between your action and your bonus action, dealing a total of 1d6+1d4+3 damage (avg. 9) per attack. That&#8217;s exceptionally high damage for first level.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Fighting Style: Archery<\/li>\n<li>Blood Maledict (1\/rest)<\/li>\n<li>New Blood Curse Known: Blood Curse of the Eyeless<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Fighting Style: Archery provides a big boost to our DPR by putting us two points ahead of the Attack vs. AC progression.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This level also brings our first Blood Curse. Similar to Shield, Blood Curse of the Eyeless allows us to mitigate enemy attacks. You get to use it once per rest, so don&#8217;t hesitate.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Order of the Ghostslayer<\/li>\n<li>Rite of the Dawn<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been using lightning damage for two levels, and while you probably haven&#8217;t had any issues, Radiant is still better.

If you&#8217;re in an encounter with multiple enemies, you may occasionally be able to use this to get some extra damage when one of those enemies dies. You still only get one use of Blood Maledict per rest, but if you haven&#8217;t been using Blood Curse of the Eyeless frequently, you may get more use out of Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Primal Rite: Any<\/li>\n<li>Blood Maledict (2\/rest)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Your second primal rite is largely pointless: between radiant and lightning damage, you can hurt nearly anything. A second use of Blood Maledict is much more interesting.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Hallowed Veins<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Hallowed Veins allows you to use Blood Maledict on any creature. Plants, constructs, undead, whatever. You also get to reroll the damage you take if you amplify a Blood Maledict. I would only use that option if you roll significantly above average, but it could still save you a few hit points every day.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Improvement (Dexterity 18 -&gt; 20)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At 20 Dexterity you&#8217;re now at our max AC of 17. If your first thought is &#8220;but wait, 17 AC isn&#8217;t very high&#8221;, you&#8217;re right. Fortunately, you&#8217;re fighting at range and you can use Blood Curse of the Eyeless to hamper attacks against you.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Grim Psychometry<\/li>\n<li>New Blood Curse Known: Blood Curse of Mutual Suffering<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Blood Curse of Mutual Suffering is a difficult prospect. To use it, you&#8217;re making a conscious decision to plan to take damage instead of shooting a creature to death. This is a good option for creatures with impossibly high AC or whose damage resistances you can&#8217;t overcome for some reason, but it&#8217;s absolutely not a go-to option in every encounter.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Dark Velocity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Darkvision is absolutely fantastic in a game which often involves exploring caves and dungeons.

This makes fighting at long range simpler, mitigates the benefits of cover so that you can more easily fire past allies or obstacles, and allows you to trade some attack bonus for a big pile of damage.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>New Blood Curse Known: Blood Curse of the Marked<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>By this level you have every Blood Curse which works especially well for us. Anything which consumes your bonus action will cut into your damage output at least temporarily, so it needs to be a beneficial trade. If you&#8217;re facing a single tough enemy, Blood Curse of the Marked may be a good option for a long fight. Start the encounter with Blood Curse of the Marked, then follow up with Supernal Surge so you can get four attacks<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Esoteric Rite: Rite of the Roar<\/li>\n<li>Hardened Soul<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Esoteric Rite may never matter for you, but pick Rite of the Roar because almost nothing resists thunder damage.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Gravesight<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>The ability to see in magical darkness is a rare and powerful advantage. If you have an ally who can cast Darkness, it becomes a significant tactical advantage over foes who can&#8217;t see in magical darkness.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Improvement \/ Feat: Any<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At this point we have everything that we absolutely need. If you want more hit points, take Tough. Otherwise, strongly consider increasing your Wisdom. Wisdom will improve your skills, add to your damage thanks to Rite of the Dawn, and gives you extra uses of Supernal Surge.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood Maledict (4\/rest)<\/li>\n<li>New Blood Curse Known: Any<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Our Blood Maledict uses cap at 4 per rest, which is plenty to get you to your next short rest.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Vengeful Spirit<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Vengeful Spirit is really cool, but it&#8217;s definitely a gamble. Use Blood Curse of the Eyeless as often as possible, and be sure to amplify it because it&#8217;s free to do so since your spirit form takes no damage from Crimson Rite.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Improvement \/ Feat: Any<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Another ASI where we don&#8217;t need anything specific.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanguine Mastery<\/li>\n<li>New Blood Curse Known: Any<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Sanguine Mastery is really exciting. When you fall below one fourth of your hit point maximum, you get really scary. If you manage to get Blood Curse of the Marked running, you&#8217;re dealing 20 extra damage per attack on your three (four with Supernal Surge) attacks. Oh, and you can abuse the rules for critical hits on helpless creatures to recharge your Blood Maledict
