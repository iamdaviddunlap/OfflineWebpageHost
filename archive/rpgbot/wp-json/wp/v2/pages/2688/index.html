Unfortunately, you&#8217;re burdened with\n\tMAD since you now need three ability scores to use all of your capabilities\n\teffectively, and you&#8217;ll struggle constantly to make Bladesong more useful than\n\tjust being a generic wizard. Surviving in melee with d6 hit points is hard,\n\teven with the wizard&#8217;s spell list to protect you, and no matter what spells\n\tyou cast to support using a weapon, it&#8217;s nearly always more effective to do\n\tsomething other than using bladesong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bladesong is a tempting prize for Dexterity\/Intelligence-based &#8220;gish&#8221; builds\n\tlike a Dexterity-based Eldritch Knight Fighter. However, since it&#8217;s a\n\tshort-duration buff with a low daily usage cap, I recommend waiting to\n\tmulticlass until you&#8217;re high enough level that your Proficiency Bonus will\n\tmake Bladesong a meaningful part of your tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are reading the version of Bladesinging published in the Sword Coast\n\tAdventurer&#8217;s Guide, please note that an updated version was published in\n\tTasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything.

Mage Armor works great, but it eats one of\n\t\tyour precious prepared spell slots for the day, which can be a hard trade at\n\t\tlow levels when the AC difference is only +1 and your prepared spells are\n\t\tprecious. Still, at higher levels when you&#8217;re using Bladesong regularly,\n\t\tthat +1 to AC is worth the spell unless you can guarantee access to magic\n\t\titems. +1 is a big bonus in 5e.\n\t\t<p>You also get free proficiency with a one-handed melee weapon (Rapier,\n\t\t\tShortsword, or Whip is your best bet), which is great since the Wizard\n\t\t\tgets literally the worst list of weapon proficiencies in the game.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bladesong<\/span>: While Bladesong is active, it&#8217;s\n\t\tan incredibly powerful effect allowing the Wizard to thrive in melee with a\n\t\tboosted AC and boosting Concentration rolls so that you can maintain\n\t\tcritical buffs like Elemental Weapon or Tenser&#8217;s Transformation.\n\t\t<p>Bladesong, combined with high Dexterity and buffs like Shield, allows the\n\t\t\tBladesinger to boost their AC to heights that most classes simply can&#8217;t\n\t\t\tmatch without without magic items. However, you&#8217;re still vulnerable to\n\t\t\tother sources of damage like spells and area of effect damage, so bring\n\t\t\tother defensive options like Absorb Elements and Counterspell. Also\n\t\t\tremember that a single critical hit could easily take you out of combat\n\t\t\tunless you can also use Song of Defense to reduce the damage enough to\n\t\t\tkeep yourself going.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Since your uses of Bladesong per day are tied to your Proficiency Bonus,\n\t\t\tat low levels you need to think of this more as an occasional buff than\n\t\t\tyour go-to option in combat. Use this as-needed primarily as a defensive\n\t\t\tbuff and pretend that you&#8217;re any other type of wizard until you pick up\n\t\t\tExtra Attack and your Proficiency Bonus increases.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: One of your attacks can be a\n\t\tcantrip, so you can use Booming Blade\/Green-Flame Blade\/Swordburst and make\n\t\tan additional weapon attack using one Action. You get all the effectivenesss\n\t\tof using an attack cantrip without giving up the multiple attacks made by\n\t\tusing Extra Attack so you get the best of both options. Short of the\n\t\tEldritch Knight&#8217;s War Magic feature (which notably uses a Bonus Action), no\n\t\tother &#8220;gish&#8221; subclass can match this capability.\n\t\t<p>Extra Attack notably works even while you&#8217;re not using Bladesong.\n\t\t\tConsider carrying a decent ranged weapon like a crossbow so that on turns\n\t\t\twhen you plan to use a ranged attack cantrip you can make a ranged weapon\n\t\t\tattack in the same turn. Even if your Dexterity is still at a +3 bonus\n\t\t\tthat attack is still a chance at some extra damage for very little\n\t\t\teffort. This is also compatible with both two-weapon\n\t\t\tfighting and Crossbow Expert.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Song of Defense<\/span>: This is a great way to\n\t\tpad your d6 hit points, but it will eat through your spell slots very\n\t\tquickly. Consider Absorb Elements and Shield as your go-to options for\n\t\tmitigating damage, but if Shield won&#8217;t negate an attack you might use this\n\t\tinstead if you expect the damage to be more than you&#8217;re willing to take.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Song of Victory<\/span>: A bit late to the game,\n\t\tbut by now you should easily have 20 Intelligence, so 5 bonus damage per\n\t\tmelee weapon attack (yes, only melee) is pretty nice. Since Extra Attack can\n\t\tget you two attacks without giving up the benefits of a cantrip like Booming\n\t\tBlade, this can be a noteworthy boost to your damage output on turns where\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not throwing around leveled spells. Combine this with Tenser&#8217;s\n\t\tTransformation, and a mundane rapier could deal 1d8+10+2d12 damage per\n\t\tattack, which is pretty great. But, while the damage bonus is nice, at this\n\t\tlevel a +5 damage bonus on your weapon attacks is frequently less impactful\n\t\tthan upcastinf Fireball, which any wizard can do.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chronurgy\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#ChronurgyMagic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chronurgy Magic<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EGtW<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Chronal Shift and Convergent Future feel very similar in function to the\n\tSchool of Divination&#8217;s Portent feature, and if you want that feature but don&#8217;t\n\tshare my love for divination spells, Chronurgy Magic is a great option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chronurgy Magic subclass gains access to the Dunamancy spell list.

The target can be you, an\n\t\tally, or an enemy, so you can use this to divert critical hits, to offer\n\t\tanother attempt on failed saves, or if you&#8217;re not worried about your own\n\t\tsafety you could use this to let allies reroll missed attacks. Generally you\n\t\tshould save this to be used defensively. Rerolling one ally&#8217;s missed attack\n\t\twill rarely save a life, but rerolling saves will save lives constantly.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Temporal Awareness<\/span>: A sizable bonus to\n\t\tInitiative. Going first is incredibly useful for spellcasters who can place\n\t\tarea control effects to shape the rest of the fight.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Momentary Stasis<\/span>: Taking a creature out\n\t\tof a fight for a turn is great, but Constitution saves tend to be high, and\n\t\tthe effect only lasts until the end of your next turn so you&#8217;re giving up\n\t\tyour Action on your turn to <em>possibly<\/em> deny the target their own\n\t\tturn. It&#8217;s a fine trade if your party outnumbers your enemies, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\toutnumbered you should be fireballing things rather than trading turns with\n\t\ta single enemy.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Abeyance<\/span>: I see four ways to use\n\t\tthis:\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>You can have an ally cast a spell which typically affects the caster so\n\t\t\t\tthat you can share powerful effects like Shadow Blade.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>You can have an ally cast a concentration spell and hold the\n\t\t\t\tconcentration for you. This is especially useful for familiars who can\n\t\t\t\tcast the spell then run and hide without cutting into your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\teffectiveness significantly.\n<p>If you\u2019re especially cheeky and have access to the Ravnica backgrounds, being Orzhov and handing Spirit Guardians to your fighter is pretty fun.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>You can use it to let another creature cast a spell for you so that you\n\t\t\t\tcan get an extra spell off in a hurry. A familiar is a fantastic choice\n\t\t\t\tin this case. They&#8217;re prohibited from making attacks, but nothing stops\n\t\t\t\tthem from casting Fireball.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Cast a spell with a long casting time, then freeze it upon completion.\n\t\t\t\tCarry the bead around for a bit, then activate it to deliver the\n\t\t\t\tspell.<\/li>\n<li>Give every member of the party their own Familiar. Give your Familiar a Familiar. Give that Familiar a Familiar.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Convergent Future<\/span>: Rerolls are great, but\n\t\tthey&#8217;re still a roll. Take the risk out of it and just decide that a roll\n\t\tsucceeds or fails. The cost is high, however, and it gets worse the more\n\t\ttimes you use this in a day. Few creatures can give you levels of\n\t\texhaustion, so it&#8217;s usually not a problem, but the one time you encounter an\n\t\tenemy which inflicts Exhaustion you&#8217;re in serious trouble if you&#8217;ve used\n\t\tthis at all that day. Also avoid things like starving, sleep deprivation,\n\t\tand forced marches. Dying at level 14 because you&#8217;re tired is hardly the way\n\t\tyou want to go out.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"graviturgy\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#GraviturgyMagic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Graviturgy Magic<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EGtW<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Graviturgy is a really cool concept, but the abilities are simply too\n\tsituational and difficult to use to make it effective. The only reliably\n\tuseful ability is Event Horizon, which you get once per day starting at level\n\t14, and even then it&#8217;s incredibly dangerous to use because you need to be so\n\tclose to your enemies and because it doesn&#8217;t exclude your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some abuse cases which can make Graviturgy Magic work well, such as\n\tthrowing enemies into low-hanging AOE damage effects with Gravity Well, and\n\tcooperating with allies who like to grapple in order to capitalize on Adjust\n\tDensity, but unless your party has abundant options to force enemies to either\n\tmove or not move at your wthem, you may struggle to make the subclass features\n\tconsistently impactful. The Dunamancy Spell List offers perhaps the most\n\tcrucial options for the Graviturgy Magic Wizard, so if those spells are not\n\tavailable to you, I strongly encourage you to look elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Graviturgy Magic subclass gains access to the Dunamancy spell list.

Your allies\n\t\tmight enjoy the extra speed from time to time, and Advantage on Strength\n\t\tchecks is great for allies who are grappling, but the 1-minute duration and\n\t\tConcentration requirement mean that you can usually find something better to\n\t\tdo. Still, you can use it as often as you like and there&#8217;s no save, which is\n\t\tgreat if your allies like to Shove or Grapple.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Gravity Well<\/span>: 5 ft. of positioning is\n\t\toccasionally very useful. Since this is forced movement, it doesn&#8217;t provoke\n\t\tOpportunity Attacks, so you can use this to cast a spell on yourself or an\n\t\tally to move the target out of melee without provoking an opportunity\n\t\tattacks, and potentially breaking grapples. Tragically, it only applies when\n\t\tyou cast the spell so you can&#8217;t repeatedly reposition targets to keep them\n\t\tinside areas of effect. This also doesn&#8217;t specify which directions you can\n\t\tmove the target, so theoretically you could move targets 5 feet into the air\n\t\tto force them into conveniently-positioned effects like Wall of Fire.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Violent Attraction<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t many\n\t\toptions which can force enemies to fall, so either you need to\n\t\t<em>really<\/em> like Reverse Gravity and Gravity Sinkhole, or your DM likes\n\t\tto put a lot of pits and cliffs on the map. Regardless, it&#8217;s at most 10d10\n\t\tdamage per day (assuming you can somehow cause falling damage on 5 separate\n\t\trounds) and you have to spend your Reaction to activate it each time,\n\t\tmeaning that you don&#8217;t have your Reaction for Shield or Absorb Elements.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Event Horizon<\/span>: A great area control\n\t\teffect hampered only by the fact that you need to be in the middle of it.\n\t\tWith a radius of just 30 feet, you&#8217;re easily within reach for attacks and\n\t\tabilities with any sort of range, and since you need to Concentrate on this,\n\t\tyou might lose your signature feature for the day if you take even a tiny\n\t\tamount of damage.\n\t\t<p>Fortunately, this doesn&#8217;t appear to care about cover, so you can do\n\t\t\tthings like casting Stone Shape or Wall of Ice to erect a dome over\n\t\t\tyourself for cover, then lie prone inside it to impose Disadvantage on\n\t\t\tranged attacks against you. If cover isn&#8217;t a option, try to keep moving\n\t\t\tenemies at bay by hitting them with things like Thunderclap to push them\n\t\t\taway or Ray of Frost to reduce their speed.

If you know enough spells and know your enemies&#8217;\n\t\tresistances, you may go your entire career without dealing damage to a\n\t\tcreature which has resistance to that damage type. But, again, you need to\n\t\tlearn as many spells as possible to get the most out of this feature, so if\n\t\tyour DM doesn&#8217;t give your access to more spells you may struggle to make\n\t\tthis work.\n\t\t<p>The third benefit lets you cast a ritual more quickly once per day.\n\t\t\tThat&#8217;s great for options like Detect Magic and if you need them in a\n\t\t\thurry, but hopefully you won&#8217;t need it often.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Manifest Mind<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\tArcane Eye, though certainly less subtle since it&#8217;s not invisible. This\n\t\tallows you to examine distant objects, peek around corners, keep watch in\n\t\ttwo places at once, and even explore small spaces where you can&#8217;t physically\n\t\tfit. It even has Darkvision even if you don&#8217;t, so it can mostly serve in place of\n\t\tyour own eyes in dark places. Think of it like one of those quadcopter\n\t\tdrones, but your controls only work out to a range of 300 feet and you can\n\t\tshoot fireballs through it.\n\t\t<p>You also gain the ability to cast spells using your spectral mind as the\n\t\t\torigin point. This allows you to cast spells while you&#8217;re safely behind\n\t\t\tcover, or to deliver short-range spells like Burning Hands or Thunderclap\n\t\t\twithout the risk of being in near-melee range and potentially even without\n\t\t\tthe targets being aware of your presence. However, the number of times you\n\t\t\tcan do this per day is small so look for other ways to solve the same\n\t\t\tproblems if you can.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Master Scrivener<\/span>: Since you can&#8217;t share\n\t\tthis (the scroll is unintelligible to anyone else), this is basically just\n\t\ta free spell per day. Find your favorite 2nd-level spell with a decent\n\t\teffect for being upcast to 3rd level. You don&#8217;t need to have the spell\n\t\tprepared, so this is good for spells with long durations which you know you\n\t\twill cast, but which you won&#8217;t cast more than once.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">One with the Word<\/span>: Advantage on Arcana\n\t\tchecks is really nice, especially if you&#8217;re using the rules for identifying\n\t\tspells presented in Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything and if your DM allows you\n\t\tto use skill checks to identify monsters and their weaknesses.\n\t\t<p>The second benefit of this feature allows you to entirely negate sources\n\t\t\tof damage. However, this comes with a steep cost and a gamble. First, it\n\t\t\teats your Reaction, so consider using Shield or Absorb Elements if either\n\t\t\tof them will suffice. Second, it dismisses your Spectral Mind, so you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\tneed to re-manifest it as a Bonus Action on a later turn.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Third, and most important, you temporarily lose access to some of the\n\t\t\tspells in your spellbook. This is honestly a pain to track, but it&#8217;s also\n\t\t\teasy to mitigate this cost. By learning a huge number of spells, you can\n\t\t\taccumulate enough spell levels worth of unused spells that you may be able\n\t\t\tto use this numerous times in succession. Just keep in mind that at an\n\t\t\taverage of 10.5 spell levels, you need to spend an average of 525gp\n\t\t\tlearning the spells to fuel a single use.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Finally, if you roll the 3d6 and roll more spell levels than you can\n\t\t\tspend, you&#8217;re immediately reduced to 0 hit points. This can prevent you\n\t\t\tfrom immediately dying due to massive damage because the original damage\n\t\t\tis still prevented, but if the original damage wasn&#8217;t going to knock you\n\t\t\tdown to 0 you&#8217;re going to feel silly for knocking yourself out because you\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t know enough spells.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#SchoolofAbjuration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School of Abjuration<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>School of Abjuration&#8217;s signature mechanic is Arcane Ward, which provides a\n\tpool of not-quite-hit-points that you can use to mitigate damage to yourself\n\tand eventually to your allies. Improved Abjuration makes the Abjurer the\n\tuncontested champion of Counterspell, allowing you to defend your allies both\n\tfrom mundane damage with your ward and from spells with abjuration options\n\tlike Counterspell and Dispel Magic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Abjurer is an easy option for players new to the game, or players who might be intimidated by managing the Wizard&#8217;s spellcasting. Because School of Abjuration&#8217;s features are primarily reactive in nature, it allows the player to focus on using their spells offensively while falling back on their subclass features to defend themselves. However, experienced players who are comfortable managing complex characters may find that the reactionary nature of the subclass frustrating because you may go long periods without your features being impactful unless you&#8217;re facing an abundance of spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/abjuration\/\">School of Abjuration Wizard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Abjuration Savant<\/span>: Standard for PHB wizard\n\t\tsubclasses. Strangely, this feature incentivizes you to use your two free\n\t\tspells learned per level to learn literally anything except spells from your\n\t\tfavorite school.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Ward<\/span>: A great source of what\n\t\tessentially amounts to temporary hit points, but since they aren&#8217;t\n\t\ttechnically temporary hit points the two effects stack. The Ward itself begins at full HP the first time you cast an Abjuration spell each day, even if all you do is spend eleven minutes to Ritual cast Alarm on nothing important. It then lasts until you finish your next Long Rest.\n\t\t<p>Since the ward can take damage in your place, you may even be able to avoid saves to maintain Concentration when you take damage. This additional overshield is a resource and resources are meant to be spent, but don\u2019t be reckless and overextend. Be sure to take all the normal defensive precautions and the Ward will help mitigate when the dice just don\u2019t go in your favor.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to charge the ward, consider the\n\t\t\tEldritch Initiate feat to get Armor of Shadows. Armor of Shadows allows\n\t\t\tyou to cast Mage Armor on yourself at will, allowing you to fully charge\n\t\t\tthe ward whenever you have a few minutes to repeatedly cast Mage Armor in\n\t\t\torder to charge it.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Projected Ward<\/span>: Your party&#8217;s Defender\n\t\tlikely takes a lot more damage than you, so soaking some of it with your\n\t\tward can really cut down on how many resources your party must devote to\n\t\thealing. Just be aware that you\u2019ll be unable to cast Shield, Absorb Elements, and Counterspell in response to future triggering events should you block some damage to an ally.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Abjuration<\/span>: Situational by\n\t\tdesign, but very powerful in games which feature enemy spellcasters.\n\t\tCounterspell is an off-switch for those enemy spellcasters. Adding your\n\t\tproficiency bonus dramatically improves its effectiveness, making you able\n\t\tto easily prevent enemy spellcasters from doing anything at all without the\n\t\tneed to burn your highest-level spell slots. If you can also cast Enhance\n\t\tAbility (Intelligence) on yourself before walking into a fight with enemy\n\t\tspellcasters, you can counter spells with very little risk of failure.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Resistance<\/span>: Resistance to spells is\n\t\tgreat for resisting dangerous save or suck spells, and resistance to spell\n\t\tdamage makes you greatly resistant to direct damage spells which typically\n\t\tdon&#8217;t require saves (Eldritch Blast, Fire Bolt, etc.). Both halves of the\n\t\tfeature apply at the same time, so against spells which allow you to save\n\t\tfor reduced damage (Fireball, etc.), this is extremely effective because on\n\t\ta successful save you&#8217;ll often take just a quarter of the game. However,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re expected to counter spells rather than try to resist them, so this is\n\t\tmostly a redundant defense for when you&#8217;re outnumbered or surprised.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#SchoolofConjuration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School of Conjuration<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Conjuration does a lot of things, and school of conjuration gives you a taste of all of them.

At the very least you can summon cylindrical\n\t\tobjects and roll them around in dungeons to set off traps, or create a\n\t\tsturdy object to use as cover.\n\t\t<p>If your DM allows it, creating a weapon with Conjuration Creation may be\n\t\t\tenough to overcome resistance to damage from non-magical attacks since the\n\t\t\tobject is &#8220;visibly magical&#8221;. You may even be able to create weapons made\n\t\t\tof special materials like adamantine or cold iron. Unfortunately, the size\n\t\t\tconstraints may limit your weapon options, so stick to stubby weapons like\n\t\t\taxes rather than long weapons like spears and longswords. Also note that\n\t\t\tthe weapon will disappear if it deals damage once, so it&#8217;s a single-use\n\t\t\tweapon. Maybe useful for rogues or if you just need one hit, but this\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t totally replace real weapons. It&#8217;s not clear if you can create expensive\n\t\t\titems like Alchemist&#8217;s Fire, but I don&#8217;t think doing so would cause problems\n\t\t\tbeyond very low levels where your available gold is limited.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Benign Transposition<\/span>: A great way to get\n\t\taround when there are enemies present, especially if you switch places with\n\t\tyour party&#8217;s Defender and drop them in the middle of a bunch of surprised\n\t\tenemies. Of course, the biggest benefit of Benign Transposition (getting you\n\t\tout of somewhere dangerous) can be entirely replaced by Misty Step, which\n\t\tcan be used as a Bonus Action at the cost of a 2nd-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Focused Conjuration<\/span>: This is great for\n\t\tkeeping your summoned creature around even if you take damage, but at this\n\t\tlevel you have plenty of ways to keep yourself out of trouble. Spells like\n\t\tShield, Absorb Elements, and Mirror Image are staple defensive options which\n\t\tdon&#8217;t require Concentration, and if you have a summoned creature there&#8217;s one\n\t\tmore ally on the field drawing attention away from you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Durable Summons<\/span>: 30 temporary hit points\n\t\tprovides as many additional hit points as casting a &#8220;Summon Creature&#8221; spell\n\t\ttwo or three spell levels higher (it varies by spell). That&#8217;s a huge\n\t\tincrease in durability, which means that you&#8217;re getting more mileage out of\n\t\tyour summon spells.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#SchoolofDivination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School of Divination<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Forewarned is fore-armed, and Divination is all about forewarning. If you\n\tever walk into a room without knowing who and what is inside it, you aren&#8217;t\n\tcasting enough Divinations. The biggest problem with relying heavily on\n\tdivinations is that they can quickly eat your spell slots, often with little\n\ttangible effect. Fortunately, Expert Divination dramatically reduces the cost\n\tof casting divination spells. Portent provides a wonderful mechanic to\n\tinfluence rolls, allowing you alter the outcome of critical roles in\n\tsignificant and powerful ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As great as Portent is, if you plan to play a diviner, you and your DM need\n\tto be prepared to handle divinations and how they work. The DM may be forced\n\tto predict the future for you, to offer cryptic hints, or to improvise the\n\tidle activities of creatures who are generally just sitting in a room waiting\n\tfor your party to come fight them. You need to remember to use your\n\tdivinations to mitigate risk and to solve problems that can&#8217;t be solved using\n\tFireball and the like. But if you put in the work, School of Divination will\n\treward you for your efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/divination\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15155\">School of Divination Wizard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Divination Savant<\/span>: Standard for PHB wizard\n\t\tsubclasses.

Save it for important\n\t\tsaving throws or attacks. Roll low? Use it to replace an enemy attack roll\n\t\tor an enemy saving throw. There is no way for this to be bad unless you\n\t\tforget to use it. Portent is School of Divination&#8217;s signature trait, and\n\t\tmastering it will have a massive impact on your game.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Divination<\/span>: This dramatically\n\t\texpands the number of spells you can cast in a day. If you ever think &#8220;is it\n\t\tworth a spell slot to cast a Divination right now?&#8221;, the answer should\n\t\talways be &#8220;yes&#8221;. Throw them around like confetti. You can even use Mind\n\t\tSpike (the only damage-dealing divination spell in the game) to get big\n\t\tpiles of single-target damage at minimal cost whenever you might normally\n\t\tuse a cantrip.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">The Third Eye<\/span>: Darkvision isn&#8217;t a\n\t\tDivination, so this is a good way to get it for free if you don&#8217;t get it\n\t\tfrom our race, an item, or an ally who can cast Darkvision. The other\n\t\teffects are replicated with See Invisibility and Comprehend Languages, which\n\t\tcost next to nothing to cast thanks to both Expert Divination and the\n\t\tWizard&#8217;s ability to cast rituals, but having See Invisibility running at all\n\t\ttimes is a helpful defense since See Invisibility only lasts for an\n\t\thour.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Portent<\/span>: Not a game changer, but\n\t\tPortent is fantastic, and this makes it 50% more powerful.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#SchoolofEnchantment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School of Enchantment<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>School of Enchantment has some amazing save-or-suck options and can function as a Face with a little bit of effort, but the over-reliance on the Charmed condition does create a weakness in your capabilities since resistance and immunity to Charmed are so common.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/enchantment\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"17704\">School of Enchantment Wizard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Enchantment Savant<\/span>: Standard for PHB\n\t\twizard subclasses.

But if you find yourself\n\t\tface to face with something unfriendly, flash those baby blues and hit it\n\t\twith your Hypnotic Gaze. This allows you to indefinitely lock down a single\n\t\ttarget, provided that you remain within range and that the target\n\t\tconsistently fails the initial saving throw. In an encounter where your allies\n\t\toutnumber the enemies (or at least the significant ones) this is a great way\n\t\tto tilt the balance of the encounter in your favor, even if this also takes\n\t\tyou out of the encounter. Using this to incapacitate enemies also means that\n\t\tthey release you if they were grappling you, and you can safely move away\n\t\twithout provoking Opportunity Attacks if you don&#8217;t want to stand there until\n\t\tyour party can come tie up whatever you&#8217;ve hypnotized. You can use this once\n\t\tper target per long rest, so a brave wizard might use this as a go-to tactic\n\t\tin place of expensive resources like spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Instinctive Charm<\/span>: This is a great way to\n\t\tmake enemy ranged attackers hit their own allies (or at least your more\n\t\tdurable allies if the enemy doesn&#8217;t have friends nearby). Since you can use\n\t\tthis repeatedly on the same target until they pass a save, you can expect to use this repeatedly in\n\t\tencounters where enemies are relying on ranged attacks. However, since this\n\t\tis difficult to use against melee attacks, you may still want Shield unless an\nally is willing to stand next to you to take the hits for you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Split Enchantment<\/span>: Many of the best\n\t\tEnchantment spells are single-target, which is a problem in encounters with\n\t\tmore than one enemy. This functionally doubles your spell output with your\n\t\tbest spells, including powerful options like Dominate Monster and Power Word\n\t\tKill.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Alter Memories<\/span>: This is the only Wizard\n\t\tfeature anywhere which cares about your Charisma, and it&#8217;s both extremely situational\n\t\tand disappointingly ineffective. The ability to erase part of the creature&#8217;s\n\t\tmemory of its time spent Charmed means that you can hit the creature with\n\t\tCharm Person or Charm Monster, spend an hour or more questioning it, then\n\t\tmake it forget that your conversation. Unfortunately, the spells which\n\t\tbenefit from Alter Memories are extremely few in number, so expect to lean\n\t\theavily on Charm X\/Dominate X. Even the spell Friends doesn&#8217;t actually make\n\t\tthe target Charmed, so your options are pitifully small.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#SchoolofEvocation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School of Evocation<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Evocation is the blunt hammer of magic. It&#8217;s rarely subtle or elegant, and it&#8217;s often imprecise. But hey, when 90% of problems are nails, the hammer is the king of tools. Evocation is a great option for players who are new to spellcasters because many of the Evoker&#8217;s best spells are mechanically simple, require little tracking if any, and usually leave little room for interpretation of their effects. Beyond the simple instantaneous damage options, Evocation spells also include powerful offensive options like Wall of Fire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While School of Evocation is one of the simpler wizard subclasses,\n\texperienced players shouldn&#8217;t overlook it simply because of its relative\n\tsimplicity. It&#8217;s an effective set of tools for effectively using go-to\n\toffensive spell options, and it works reliably in any game where a blaster\n\tcaster can be effective. Players new to the game will enjoy being able to\n\tsagely fireball enemies without murdering their own party, and as players get\n\tcomfortable they can explore more complex aspects of spellcasting confident in\n\tthe knowledge that they can always revert to Fireball if more complex options\n\tprove difficult or ineffective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/evoker\/\">School of Evocation Wizard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Evocation Savant<\/span>: Standard for PHB wizard\n\t\tsubclasses.

Creatures are protected from the spell&#8217;s effects for\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s full duration. This means that your allies can comfortably\n\t\t\twalk around in the areas of spells like Sickening Radiance,\n\t\t\tpotentially dragging enemies about inside the area to force them to\n\t\t\ttake damage. You could even cast Otiluke&#8217;s Freezing Sphere, designate your\n\t\t\tallies as protected by Sculpt Spells, then send them off with pockets full\n\t\t\tof frozen spheres to smash at their feet in a room full of enemies.\n\t\t\tHonestly, I don&#8217;t think this was intended when WotC wrote School of\n\t\t\tEvocation. Much like Empowered Evocation, I think that they meant for\n\t\t\tSculpt Spells only to apply to the initial effects. But it&#8217;s been 5+ years\n\t\t\tand we haven&#8217;t gotten errata or tweets from Jeremy Crawford, so it appears\n\t\t\tthat Sculpt Spells works as I&#8217;ve described it until someone tells us\n\t\t\totherwise.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Potent Cantrip<\/span>: Acid Splash and Poison\n\t\tSpray are the only damaging Wizard cantrips in the PHB which require a\n\t\tsaving throw, but other supplements have dramatically increased your\n\t\toptions.\nAdditionally, this feature is not limited to Wizard cantrips, in case you happen to have something from another class, feat, or a racial feature.\n This is nice insurance, and it encourages you to use saving throw\n\t\tcantrips like Frostbite instead of attack cantrips like Fire Bolt because\n\t\tthe guaranteed half damage means that your DPR is calculated with the formula ([Dice Average]*([Chance to Fail Save]+0.5*(1-[Chance to Fail Save]))). This formula applies to any save for half effect, so it&#8217;s also relevant to a lot of leveled spells.\n<p>An example at the level we get this: with Toll the Dead (2d12, avg. 13) and a 60% Chance the target fails: (13*(0.6+0.5*(0.4)))=10.4 Expected DPR. If instead the target only failed the save 50% of the time: (13*(0.5+0.5*(0.5)))=9.75 Expected DPR. That\u2019s only a difference of 0.65 DPR.<\/p>\n<p>A firebolt at the same level, following the expected math for an attack roll with 2d10 damage on a hit, comes to 7.7 DPR and does nothing on a miss.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Empowered Evocation<\/span>: A bonus to damage\n\t\tlike this is a considerable boost, especially for your low-level spells like\n\t\tBurning Hands, which can still be decent damage sources at a low spell slot\n\t\tcost.\n\t\t<p>According to\n\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2015\/06\/28\/scorching-ray-dd-errata\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeremy Crawford<\/a>\n\t\t\tback in 2015, this bonus applies to each missile of magic missile and to\n\t\t\tall targets of an AOE, but only to one attack for multi-attack spells like\n\t\t\tScorching Ray. If Empowered Evocation applies to each missile, Magic\n\t\t\tMissile becomes very powerful. This conflicts with Crawford&#8217;s more recent\n\t\t\trulings, where he has ruled that each missile from Magic Missile is a\n\t\t\tseparate damage roll, so similar damage bonuses only get applied to one of\n\t\t\tthe missiles. Personally I think the more-recent ruling makes more sense,\n\t\t\tbut discuss it with your DM.\nFor the magic missile case, see our Practical Guide to \n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/magic-missile\/\">Magic Missile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Overchannel<\/span>: This is a great way to get\n\t\tmore mileage out of reliable lower-level spells like Magic Missile and\n\t\tFireball at a level where your higher-level spells would generally eclipse\n\t\tthem. Just be sure to have a Cleric handy when you start taking damage. RAW,\n\t\tthe damage is maximized every time that the spell deals damage, which makes\n\t\tspells like Wall of Fire especially powerful. However, according to\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2016\/12\/17\/if-i-overchannel-bigbys-hand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeremy Crawford<\/a>\n\t\tthe effect was intended to only apply to the first damage roll for the\n\t\tspell, so sticking to Fireball is likely your best choice.

Creating an\n\t\tillusion of a pot lying on the floor accompanied by the sound of a pot\n\t\tfalling, or an illusion of a small animal accompanied by appropriate sounds\n\t\t(I&#8217;m fond of chickens for this purpose) can be excellent distractions, and\n\t\tcreatures don&#8217;t get a save or a skill check to disbelieve the illusion until\n\t\tthey spend an Action to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Malleable Illusions<\/span>: Most illusion spells\n\t\twhich create an ongoing illusory effect (Minor Image, Hallucinatory Terrain,\n\t\tetc.) do not allow you to change the illusion once it&#8217;s in place. Minor\n\t\tImage and Major Image allow you to move and animate the illusion, but that\n\t\tcan turn a red ball into a rolling or bouncing red ball, but nothing more.\n\t\tMalleable Illusions could turn your red ball into a statue of a dragon or\n\t\tsomething, effectively replacing your existing illusion without re-casting\n\t\tthe spell. This adds a ton of flexibility to such spells.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Self<\/span>: Infallibly ignore one\n\t\tattack against you for free, once per Short or Long Rest.

Sadly,\n\t\tMalleable Illusions likely doesn&#8217;t let you change the object which you&#8217;ve\n\t\tchosen to make real because Illusory Reality only applies when you cast the\n\t\tspell.\n\t\t<p>You can&#8217;t directly harm creatures with Illusory Reality, but the rules\n\t\t\tsay nothing about impeding, restraining, blocking, or even dropping them.\n\t\t\tThrow up a Silent Image to create a wall of stone between you and your\n\t\t\tfoes, or to put a cage around them. Create an illusory bridge with a\n\t\t\tconvenient trap door (or just time it so that they&#8217;re on the bridge when\n\t\t\tthe 1-minute duration expires) and drop your enemies into a pit.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#SchoolofNecromancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School of Necromancy<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Necromancy is a cool school.

The lowest-level option is Ray of Sickness.\n\t\t<p>For maximum efficiency, cast leveled spells with long durations and ongoing\n\t\tdamage like Vampiric Touch, then kill one rat per turn. Vampiric Touch also heals\non its own, so you can combine it with the bag\n\t\t\tof rats trick to double-dip on healing (though Vampiric Touch can&#8217;t heal\n\t\t\tyou more than the target&#8217;s hit points, and rats have 1 hp).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There is some ambiguity about how this works with the spell Summon\n\t\t\tUndead. Summon Undead is a necromancy spell, and the summoned creature is\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s &#8220;effect&#8221;, so killing a creature with your summoned undead may\n\t\t\tqualify to trigger Grim Harvest. As a DM, I would not allow this because\n\t\t\tthe creature&#8217;s attacks are not the spell itself and because allowing it\n\t\t\twould immediately become a problem. Along the same lines: the effect of\n\t\t\tAnimate Dead is to create an undead creature. That creature killing\n\t\t\tsomething is not part of the spell&#8217;s effect and therefore doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tqualify.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Undead Thralls<\/span>: Additional hit points and\n\t\tdamage will make your pet undead considerably more lethal. Remember that\n\t\thaving more undead will require you to spend more spell slots every day to\n\t\tkeep them under control, so don&#8217;t have too many. Instead, try to focus on\n\t\thaving a few undead that you can rely upon and move about without\n\t\ttoo much trouble. See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/animating-the-dead\/\">Practical Guide to Animating the Dead<\/a>\nfor help with the relevant spells.\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t appear to work with the Summon Undead spell.\n\t\t\tSummon Undead <em>summons<\/em> an undead creature, and Undead Thralls only\n\t\t\tapplies if you <em>create<\/em> the undead creature.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inured to Undeath<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\tthematically appropriate. There aren&#8217;t spells that let you take control of\n\t\tundead that you stumble across or reassert control of undead which you\n\t\tcreate after you&#8217;ve lost control of them, so sometimes you&#8217;ll run into a\n\t\tshadow or something and need to actually fight them. Command Undead reduces\n\t\tthis risk somewhat, but you can only use it to control one undead at a time,\n\t\tso undead which can reduce your hit point maximum remain a risk.\n\t\t<p>The immunity to hit point reduction, while intended to address a common\n\t\t\tside-effect of attacks by undead creatures, isn&#8217;t limited to those attacks:\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re still immune to hit point reduction from other sources. For\n\t\t\texample, the spells Create Homunculus and Create Magen both require you to\n\t\t\treduce your hit point maximum as part of the spells.<\/p>\n<p>Immunity to hit point\n\t\t\treduction removes that cost, so your Homunculus can perpetually have half\n\t\t\tof your hit dice at no cost to your hit point maximum, and so long as you\n\t\t\thave the gold, you can create a small army of magens to serve you where\n\t\t\tundead might not do the job (i.e. almost anywhere with living people). I\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t think that this was an intentional rules interaction, so your DM\n\t\t\tmight not be thrilled about it. Please be careful not to abuse it too\n\t\t\theavily.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Command Undead<\/span>: This is a very useful\n\t\tability if you have enemies which command undead or which are undead\n\t\tthemselves, but the fact that intelligent undead (very common by this level)\n\t\tget Advantage on the save makes this ability hard to use effectively. Some\n\t\thigh-CR undead like the Nightwalker are tempting targets, but unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tactively seeking them out (and your DM is silly enough to let you find and\n\t\tenslave one) you can&#8217;t count on just stumbling upon a suitable target.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/wizard#SchoolofTransmutation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">School of Transmutation<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Transmutation gets you very little which you couldn&#8217;t already get more easily from other places, often at a lower level.

Power Surge (and\n\targuably Deflecting Shroud) are the only truly offensive abilities, and the\n\tdamage provided is fairly small. War Magic has a lot of overlap with School of\n\tAbjuration, but where School of Abjuration focuses more on countering spells\n\tand defending your allies, War Magic focuses more on defending yourself and\n\tkeeping yourself in a fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>War Magic&#8217;s focus on your own durability helps solve the Wizard&#8217;s biggest\n\tproblem: their frailty. Wizards get no armor except Mage Armor and have just\n\td6 hit dice, making them the least durable class in the game.

Consider\n\t\t\tthat casting leveled spells is your primary function as a wizard, that&#8217;s a\n\t\t\tlot to give up. When you use Arcane Deflection, you need to be ready to\n\t\t\tspend your next turn using cantrips or something. At low levels where your\n\t\t\tspell slots are few in number that&#8217;s not a problem, but as you gain levels\n\t\t\tthe opportunity cost grows considerably. You can&#8217;t even use items like\n\t\t\twands to get around this because those items still cause you to cast a\n\t\t\tspell.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There may still be times where Absorb Elements or Shield make more sense\n\t\t\tso that you can cast leveled spells on your turn, and fortunately as the\n\t\t\topportunity cost to use Arcane Deflection increases, the opportunity cost\n\t\t\tto prepare Absorb Elements and Shield is reduced as your number of\n\t\t\tprepared spells increases.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tactical Wit<\/span>: Initiative bonuses are\n\t\talways great, and getting to go early means that you can quickly cast buff\n\t\tor control spells which will determine how the fight plays out.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Surge<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t great, and\n\t\tunless you&#8217;re facing a lot of enemy spellcasters it will be hard to charge\n\t\tyour power surges. You could ask your allies to waste low-level spells\n\t\t(ideally a cantrip with a non-instantaneous duraiton like Guidance or\n\t\tShillelagh) so that you can dispel or counterspell them, but it&#8217;s probably\n\t\tnot worth your spell slots do this in order to recharge your Power Surge\n\t\tpool.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Durable Magic<\/span>: If you&#8217;re not maintaining\n\t\tConcentration on a spell, you should be casting a spell that requires\n\t\tConcentration. There are too many good Concentration spells for you to not\n\t\thave one running. The bonus to saves notably applies to your save to\n\t\tmaintain Concentration, and combined with Arcane Deflection you&#8217;re very\n\t\teffective at maintaining Concentration.\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re worried about the cost to constantly cast and maintain\n\t\t\tConcentration, look at summoning spells. They typically have a 1-hour\n\t\t\tduration and many are very effective, so it&#8217;s easy to fit them into your\n\t\t\ttactics. Another useful option is running Enhance Ability (Dexterity) so that when combat starts you or another party member, or both if upcast, have Advantage on the Initiative check.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deflecting Shroud<\/span>: You only get to use\n\t\tArcane Deflection if you&#8217;re hit by an attack or if you fail a saving throw,\n\t\tbut Deflecting Shroud works even if Arcane Deflection doesn&#8217;t negate the\n\t\teffect which triggered it, so you&#8217;re always guaranteed the damage.\n\t\t<p>The damage from Deflecting Shroud isn&#8217;t great, but there&#8217;s no usage\n\t\t\tlimitation and since it hits three targets at range it can easily\n\t\t\tout-damage cantrips. If you&#8217;re facing groups of weak enemies they might\n\t\t\thit you sheerly by making a large number of attacks or by including you in\n\t\t\tan area damage effect, and this will allow you to thin their numbers\n\t\t\twithout spending expensive spell slots.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The damage also helps justify using Arcane Deflection at high levels by\n\t\t\ttaking some of the sting out of giving up leveled spells for a turn. By\n\t\t\tthis level your pool of spell slots is enormous, so limiting yourself to\n\t\t\tcantrips in many circumstances means that your turn is reduced to a tiny\n\t\t\tsplash of damage where you could instead throw a leveled spell like\n\t\t\tFireball or Chain Lightning.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you want to trigger this easily, there&#8217;s an ally can make an unarmed\n\t\t\tstrike to hit you for 1+Strength damage to set this off, allowing you to\n\t\t\tget a bunch of extra damage before a turn where you may have already\n\t\t\tplanned to cast a cantrip. If you don&#8217;t have an ally handy, keep an angry\n\t\t\trat in a sack, stick your hand into the sack, and wait for the rat to bite\n\t\t\tyou.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-pale\">3rd-Party Publishers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT has covered some 3rd-party content from our favorite creators.
