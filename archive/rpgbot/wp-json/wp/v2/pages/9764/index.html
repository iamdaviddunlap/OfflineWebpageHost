No longer are bard players left feeling like they can&#8217;t enjoy the upper echelons of absurd spellcasting enjoyed by their friends. But, like every other Charisma caster, they have to lock in the spells they pick and, even though they have access to more and higher level spells now than in previous editions, there are still places where they could absolutely use some help. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WotC decided to give them something unique to do just that: magical secrets.

To boil the entire premise of this entire article down to a single sentence I will pose a question: what do you need? Take that. If you&#8217;re in a party with many spellcasters you may have everything covered and may want to fill in your own solo capabilities or lean into your specialization. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If (more likely), you aren&#8217;t, look at the spell list of a caster not in your group and see what unique capacities you can pull from there to cover something. Magical secrets are usually best spent acquiring utility that is otherwise inaccessible to your party, and we particularly want to look at spell lists that are intended to provide power later than when we can get access to it: paladins and rangers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Half casters have some great options that aren&#8217;t intended to be accessed by\n\tthese classes until levels 13 or 17 that you can take immediately at level 10.\n\tThese also tend to be the most unique spells as they&#8217;re balanced for just\n\tthose classes and can therefore do some interesting things when taken at lower\n\tlevels. Let&#8217;s get into some of the best options in my opinion for our first\n\tsecrets. For this first section, I will cover every cantrip and spell up to\n\tspell level 5 since this is the first time most bards will be able to take\n\tthem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-10\">Level 10<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"interesting-options-from-the-cleric-list\">Interesting options from the Cleric list:<\/h4>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sacred Flame<\/span>: The best reliable Radiant\n\t\tdamage in the game<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bless<\/span>: Stacks with, but is also a little\n\t\tredundant to, Inspiration. If you find yourself running out of that\n\t\tfrequently, consider this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sanctuary<\/span>: Something about an ounce of\n\t\tprevention worth being a pound of Cure Wounds. Especially useful if you have\n\t\tanother healer\/primary buff caster to put it on.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Aid<\/span>: Cheap, low level Mass Healing Word.\n\t\tAlthough, by this point you already have Mass Healing Word so I would really\n\t\tonly go for this if you don&#8217;t know what to do with your 2nd level spell\n\t\tslots or if you find everyone dying a lot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Augury<\/span>: A fabulous low-level divination,\n\t\tbut this isn&#8217;t going to fundamentally change how your character works.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spiritual Weapon<\/span>: Incredible added damage\n\t\tif you don&#8217;t already use your bonus action often.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Vitality<\/span>: This is a 3rd level\n\t\tspell that averages the same amount of healing as Heal. Really nothing else\n\t\tneeds be said.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revivify<\/span>: Not nearly as restrictive as it\n\t\twas in 3.5, making it probably the best res spell out there, especially as\n\t\tit has the lowest cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Banishment<\/span>: One of the best\n\t\tsave-or-sucks, but bards already have several good ones.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Death Ward<\/span>: It&#8217;s an amazing safety net,\n\t\tbut it does leave the target at just 1hp.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stone Shape<\/span>: This is one of those \u201conly\n\t\tlimited by your imagination\u201d in how good it is spells, assuming you&#8217;re near\n\t\tstone.

But unless you have a cantrip like Booming Blade or Green-Flame\n\t\tBlade to boost the damage, there&#8217;s really no reason to use this instead of\n\t\tanother offensive cantrip like.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Absorb Elements<\/span>: One of the best\n\t\tdefensive reactions in the game.

If you&#8217;re adventuring through a\n\t\tnormal forest full of normal animals, consider it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wall of Fire<\/span>: A great option for area\n\t\tcontrol, but bards already have several of those. This one does come with\n\t\tdamage, but it&#8217;s a commonly resisted type.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Maelstrom<\/span>: A great option for area\n\t\tcontrol, but bards already have several of those.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Antilife Shell<\/span>: Like Sanctuary but\n\t\tbetter, but also worse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Conjure Elemental<\/span>: None of the\n\t\tSummon\/Conjure spells will get a blue rating from me because they&#8217;re\n\t\tcompeting with Find Greater Steed.

But if you don&#8217;t want to have a pegasus for some reason and\n\t\tneed another body, just pick the flavor and spell slot level you like best.\n\t\tThis one is a little better because it&#8217;s more flexible in how many things\n\t\tyou summon, but I&#8217;d still call it green\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Summon Draconic Spirit<\/span>: None of the\n\t\tSummon\/Conjure spells will get a blue rating from me because they&#8217;re\n\t\tcompeting with Find Greater Steed.

Being a\n\tbard, you&#8217;re probably replacing either a traditional arcane caster like a\n\tsor\/wiz\/warlock or a traditional divine caster like a cleric\/druid given that\n\tyou can fill either role. I&#8217;m going to therefore recommend that you mostly\n\tlook at the list for whatever role you&#8217;re replacing and pick some utility that\n\tis missing from the group. There are some exceptions that are just fantastic\n\tand need to be called out however.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably spent most of your life using your cantrips to insult people for psychic damage. It&#8217;s a fabulous damage type, it applies a great debuff, and it&#8217;s thematically hilarious. With that said, sometimes you&#8217;re going to want something other than psychic damage, and this presents us with two great options: Eldritch Blast and Sacred Flame. If your party is lacking in radiant damage, Sacred Flame will go a <em>long<\/em> way towards making sure you can deal with the undead and evil outsiders effectively. Meanwhile, Eldritch Blast is so good that people will often wander into a level of warlock for little other benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re the primary healer in the group, Aura of Vitality is\n\t<em>ludicrous<\/em> amounts of healing for a level 3 spell, with the caveat\n\tthat you should basically never use it in combat. With the optional rules\n\tadding it to the cleric list, this becomes less mandatory to take on a bard,\n\tbut it&#8217;s still incredibly strong as it was one of those spells balanced around\n\tnot being available until character level 9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have anything else to do with your bonus actions yet, Spiritual\n\tWeapon remains king among spells that should be concentration but aren&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revivify is so good that you should take it even if someone else in the party\n\talready has it because, if they die, you can use it on them. I would honestly\n\tonly not consider this a priority if your party already has two instances of\n\tit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to say that, especially if you&#8217;re light on bodies in your party,\n\tpicking one of the Summon\/Conjure [x] spells will help quite a bit. With that\n\tsaid though, you may want to instead look into Find Greater Steed. A Paladin\n\texclusive that normally wouldn&#8217;t see play until level 13, get yourself a\n\tCelestial\/Fey\/Fiendish pegasus.They&#8217;re fast on the ground, they&#8217;re\n\t<strong>very <\/strong>fast in the air, and they may well be smarter and wiser\n\tthan you are. They also speak three languages you probably don&#8217;t and can\n\tcommunicate with you telepathically so expect to suddenly have a great\n\ttranslator, and with their passive perception of 16 they&#8217;re more observant\n\tthan most characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pass Without Trace is one of those things that feels like someone forgot they\n\twere trying to create a bounded system. If you think you, your party, or\n\tanyone you&#8217;re friendly with might ever want to sneak somewhere, you should\n\ttake this spell.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bards are one of only two things that get to add a bonus to the roll for Counterspell, which makes it incredibly frustrating that they don&#8217;t get it natively. Per<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeremyecrawford\/status\/717062972007260160?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> this Crawford tweet<\/a> (which isn&#8217;t really surprising, it&#8217;s completely RAW and just something people overlook), Jack of All Trades applies to the Charisma check you would make to counterspell something that you didn&#8217;t beat by slot level.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misty Step and Fly are both some of the best movement options in the game and\n\tgetting access to them, even now, is still good. Especially if multiple\n\tmembers of your party haven&#8217;t figured out how to fly yet themselves. If you&#8217;re\n\tthe only one by this point though, I&#8217;d probably skip it and just take your\n\tpegasus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-14\">Level 14<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"interesting-options-from-the-cleric-list-1\">Interesting options from the Cleric list:<\/h4>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span>: Is someone missing a lot of\n\t\thitpoints and needs them back <em>right now?<\/em>\n\t\t<strong> <em> <\/em> <\/strong>There is rarely a better option.

This frees you up to be a little more selfish with your spells. One of the reasons I mention this is that, if you take Find Greater Steed (which you really should), you should pay special note to the line \u201cWhile mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.\u201d This means that several of the buff spells listed above you can get double value out of, especially Armor of Agathys. Applying a ton of temp hp to your mount is a great way to increase its survivability, and getting free damage back on it is an amazing bonus. Woe betide any creature that tries to melee your pegasus out from under you. It&#8217;s also not concentration so you can run something else on both of you too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the wording \u201cany spell that targets only you\u201d is frustratingly vague.\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/1021074364832231424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This Crawford tweet<\/a>\n\tcalls out smite spells as being explicitly disallowed because they target\n\tanother creature. Fair enough (although they also require a weapon so the\n\tpoint is rather moot). But the semantics around \u201ctarget\u201d leaves a lot open to\n\tinterpretation. Does Spirit Guardians target? Does it only target if you\n\tchoose people to be unaffected? Is Investiture of Stone disallowed because\n\tyour earthquakes could conceivably interact with other people? Does making the\n\tground around you difficult terrain mean that Guardian of Nature is no good?\n\tIs Armor of Agathys even technically disallowed because the retributive damage\n\t\u201ctargets\u201d someone else? By his wording in the followup tweet, probably. Before\n\tyou go this route you should definitely talk to your DM about how pedantic\n\tthey&#8217;re going to be about this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Back to our regularly scheduled content. Speaking of Guardian of Nature,\n\tGreat Tree form is <em>really good<\/em> for a dex-based melee bard (which will\n\tbe nearly all melee bards).

If you&#8217;ve decided to play a bow bard (board?), Swift Quiver gives you two extra bow attacks as a swift action which means you can hit 4 attacks per round like a fighter.
