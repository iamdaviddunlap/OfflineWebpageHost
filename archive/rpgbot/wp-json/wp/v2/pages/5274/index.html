What you get is thematic, but mostly useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Kami Channeler<\/span> (Su): Giving up an options\n\tis annoying, and you don&#8217;t get to give your party members the Archmage Seane\n\tbenefit with Marshal, but Archmage isn&#8217;t great so it&#8217;s no big loss.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Natural Taboo<\/span> (Ex): Avoiding metal armor\n\tis fine. Just get some studded leather (wood or bone studs) and you&#8217;re set.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ofuda<\/span> (Su): For those unfamiliar with the\n\tterm (like me), and Ofuda is a small strip of paper with text on it. It&#8217;s\n\tabout the size of a book mark. So your Medium creates these little strips of\n\tpaper and they stick to the targets of your spells. Removing the paper ends\n\tthe spell, so anything you cast with a duration other than instantaneous can\n\tbe ended in a gesture.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shikigami<\/span> (Ex): Familiars are fantastic.\n\tInitially you get an animal familiar, but at 5th level it becomes a\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary3\/kami.html#kami,-shikigami\">Shikagami<\/a>. Shikagami are small humanoid-shaped outsiders that can speak, so they can\n\tdo a lot of things that humans can do, like using a wand. They also have some\n\texcellent spell-like abilities, including at-will Invisibility on themselves.\n\tBe sure to read the\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary\/creatureTypes.html#kami-subtype\">Kami Subtype<\/a>\n\tto get an idea of what your familiar can do.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ask the Kami<\/span> (Su): Useful, but nowhere\n\tclose to as good as Ask the Spirits. Also, your Shikagami can cast Commune\n\twith Nature once per day as a Spell-Like Ability, so you&#8217;ve probably been\n\tdoing this for 8 levels before you get this ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ward<\/span> (Su): This grants you very little.\n\tYou can meld with your ward to spy on creatures or to reappear somewhere\n\tunexpected, but that&#8217;s really all you get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Spirit (altered), taboo (altered), spellcasting (altered), haunt channeler, location channel, connection channel, ask the spirits, astral journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"reanimated-medium\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/medium\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-medium-archetypes\/reanimated-medium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reanimated Medium<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you die once? Are you planning to die a few more times? Do you tend to die a lot and want to minimize the penalties for doing so? Reanimated Medium is for you. What? People don&#8217;t expect their characters to die frequently? Huh, weird, it&#8217;s almost like there&#8217;s a ton of ways to avoid dying and most players will choose to take them instead of rolling onto enemy&#8217;s weapons to use Ease Passage and Lingering Spirit. This archetype is a cool theme, but the way it was implemented is pointless. You give up some of the Medium&#8217;s few useful abilities in exchange for being better at dying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Self<\/span> (Su): This ability is weird and\n\tbad. You have a maximum of 6 on your Influence pool, but only get 3 per day,\n\tso you generally only want to go adventuring every other day. Other than that,\n\tyou count backwards for Influence compared to other Mediums.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Nothing Is Taboo<\/span> (Ex): Taboo was a minor\n\tannoyance in exchange for two free uses of Spirit Surge. Spirit Surge is\n\texcellent, so giving up those free uses is disappointing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ease Passage<\/span> (Su): I hope you never need this\n\tenough for it to matter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lingering Spirit<\/span> (Su): This gives your\n\tallies time to move to you, which is important becuase Breath of Life takes a\n\tfull round action to cast. Even better, then can use cheaper healing spells to\n\tsave you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Warding<\/span> (Su): Death saves and\n\tnegative energy become gradually more common at higher levels, so bonuses to\n\tresist them and then immunity are both amazing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Living Legend<\/span> (Su): With the exception of\n\tSpirit Surge, I don&#8217;t think your allies are going to be very excited to borrow\n\tany of your abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Spirit (altered), taboo, haunt channeler, location channel, connection channel, spacious soul, astral beacon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"relic-channeler\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/medium\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-medium-archetypes\/relic-channeler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Relic Channeler<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Relic Channeler makes it even easier to lose access to your spirits, but if you plan to use the Champion mystery exclusively, Powerful Bond improves it by getting you an extra exotic weapon proficiency and an extra feat from Legendary Champion. Otherwise, this archetype just robs you of the utility of changing spell lists when you channel an Archmage or Hierophant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Relics<\/span> (Su): So now you have to carry around\n\tsome nice stealable trinkets to summon your spirits, you&#8217;re permanently locked\n\tinto any choice you make regarding a specific spirit. So your spells from\n\tArchmage Arcana are fixed, almost totally removing what tiny bit of useful\n\tutility the spirit provides. If a relic is destroyed it costs a truly\n\tastounding amount of gold to fix it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Powerful<\/span>\n\t<span class=\"rating-red\">Bond<\/span> (Su): You get more choices with the\n\tspells, feats, and weapons that you need to select. For feats this is usually\n\tbetter because you&#8217;re probably going to pick the same feats every time anyway.\n\tFor everything else, this is worse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Object Reading<\/span> (Su): I like Object Reading\n\tbetter than Haunt Channeler. It&#8217;s more useful in more types of campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Apport Relic<\/span> (Su): Was your relic stolen?\n\tIs the person who stole it still within about 50 feet of you? Apport the\n\tobject back to you. Otherwise, just walk over to it an pick it up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Connection Specialty<\/span> (Sp): Basically no\n\tchange to the original ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Spirit (altered), haunt channeler, connection channel (altered).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Spirit Dancer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"spirit-dancer\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/medium\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-medium-archetypes\/spirit-dancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spirit Danger<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spirit Dancer improves the versatility of the Medium by allowing them to change spirits on the fly, but it massively diminishes their usefulness as a support character by handicapping Shared Seance. It also discourages you from emphasizing a favored spirit, so you&#8217;ll never be good at anything specific.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Dance<\/span> (Su): You no longer pick a\n\tsingle spirit at the beginning of the day. Instead, you plan out all 6 and can\n\tswitch into one by dancing, similar to how Bardic Music works. While this\n\toffers excellent utility, it also flies in the face of the Medium&#8217;s need to\n\tfocus on one spirit to actually be good at something. You could still focus on\n\tone spirit, but doing so will be difficult because you get so few rounds per\n\tday in which to dance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Nothing Is Taboo<\/span> (Ex): Taboo was a minor\n\tannoyance in exchange for two free uses of Spirit Surge. Spirit Surge is\n\texcellent, so giving up those free uses is disappointing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Aura<\/span> (Su): You still get Shared\n\tSeance&#8217;s benefits, but only while dancing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Troika<\/span> (Su): Very powerful, but\n\tthis will eat through your daily dancing rounds very quickly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Attacca<\/span> (Su): This makes it much easier to\n\tstart and stop your dance without crippling yourself.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dance of Infinite Forms<\/span> (Su): The Supreme\n\tspirit abilities are excellent, but many once-per-day limitations. This lets\n\tyou use all of them every day, opening up some truly spectacular options. The\n\timprovements to Spirit Dance are also nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: spirit bonus, spirit surge, taboo, shared seance, trance of three, spacious soul, astral beacon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Relic Channeler<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"storyteller\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/occult-adventures\/occult-classes\/medium\/archetypes\/paizo-llc-medium-archetypes\/storyteller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Storyteller<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You give up Seance Boon, which is one of the Medium&#8217;s most useful contributions to a party, but in exchange you get Bardic Music. That&#8217;s a huge improvement to the Medium, offering a clear way to make yourself a Support character. Unfortunately, it also gives way to more comparisons between the Medium and the Bard, and Mediums are clearly worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Diminished Spirits<\/span> (Ex): Seance boons are\n\treall useful, especially when shared with your allies, <em>and<\/em> you give\n\tup one of the very few Influence points that you can safely spend in a day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge of Tales<\/span> (Ex): Intelligence is\n\tthe Medium&#8217;s only dump stat, and you only get three knowledge skills as class\n\tskills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Versatile Surge<\/span> (Su): Spirit Surge is best\n\tused for important saving throws, and no matter which spirit you choose as a\n\tvanilla Medium you will always have saving throws which you can&#8217;t use Spirit\n\tSurge upon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Storyteller&#8217;s Performance<\/span> (Su): You get all\n\tof the Bard&#8217;s most important Bardic Music abilities, giving you a clear role\n\tas a support character.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Learn the Story<\/span> (Sp): Access to some\n\texcellent divinations, but they cost a ton of music rounds per day, greatly\n\tdiminishing your usefulness in combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Living Story<\/span> (Sp): Perform a 9th-level save\n\tor suck spell at the cost of one round of music. Creatures with 16 or more hit\n\tdice can&#8217;t be affected for 24 hours if they save, but against creatures with\n\tless hit dice you can use this every round until it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Spirit (altered), spirit bonus (altered), spirit surge (altered), shared seance, taboo, haunt channeler, propitiation, trance of three, connection channel, spirit mastery, astral beacon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Archetypes Mediums are in desperate need of a clear function in a party, and unfortunately none of the Medium Archetypes do that without making the Medium just a worse version of an existing class.
