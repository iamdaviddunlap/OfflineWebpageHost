The Spell School Traditions each dig down to find something special for one school of magic, while the Bladesingers and Scribes attempt more esoteric ways of Wizardry, but War Magic focuses on making sure that in the middle of a fight, the Wizard can actually do Wizard things; mostly through a combination of enhanced defenses and boosted Initiative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Initiative, if you have ever wanted to try a character that always gets to go first, have a look at our example build down below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">War Magic Tradition Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#war-magic-tradition-ability-scores\">War Magic Tradition Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#war-magic-tradition-races\">War Magic Tradition Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#war-magic-tradition-feats\">War Magic Tradition Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#war-magic-tradition-weapons\">War Magic Tradition Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#war-magic-tradition-armor\">War Magic Tradition Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#war-magic-tradition-multiclassing\">War Magic Tradition Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-war-magic-tradition-build-trigger-discipline\">Example War Magic Tradition Build &#8211; Trigger Discipline<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Consider\n\t\t\tthat casting leveled spells is your primary function as a wizard, that&#8217;s a\n\t\t\tlot to give up. When you use Arcane Deflection, you need to be ready to\n\t\t\tspend your next turn using cantrips or something. At low levels where your\n\t\t\tspell slots are few in number that&#8217;s not a problem, but as you gain levels\n\t\t\tthe opportunity cost grows considerably. You can&#8217;t even use items like\n\t\t\twands to get around this because those items still cause you to cast a\n\t\t\tspell.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There may still be times where Absorb Elements or Shield make more sense\n\t\t\tso that you can cast leveled spells on your turn, and fortunately as the\n\t\t\topportunity cost to use Arcane Deflection increases, the opportunity cost\n\t\t\tto prepare Absorb Elements and Shield is reduced as your number of\n\t\t\tprepared spells increases.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tactical Wit<\/span>: Initiative bonuses are\n\t\talways great, and getting to go early means that you can quickly cast buff\n\t\tor control spells which will determine how the fight plays out.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Surge<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t great, and\n\t\tunless you&#8217;re facing a lot of enemy spellcasters it will be hard to charge\n\t\tyour power surges. You could ask your allies to waste low-level spells\n\t\t(ideally a cantrip with a non-instantaneous duraiton like Guidance or\n\t\tShillelagh) so that you can dispel or counterspell them, but it&#8217;s probably\n\t\tnot worth your spell slots do this in order to recharge your Power Surge\n\t\tpool.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Durable Magic<\/span>: If you&#8217;re not maintaining\n\t\tConcentration on a spell, you should be casting a spell that requires\n\t\tConcentration. There are too many good Concentration spells for you to not\n\t\thave one running. The bonus to saves notably applies to your save to\n\t\tmaintain Concentration, and combined with Arcane Deflection you&#8217;re very\n\t\teffective at maintaining Concentration.\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re worried about the cost to constantly cast and maintain\n\t\t\tConcentration, look at summoning spells. They typically have a 1-hour\n\t\t\tduration and many are very effective, so it&#8217;s easy to fit them into your\n\t\t\ttactics. Another useful option is running Enhance Ability (Dexterity) so that when combat starts you or another party member, or both if upcast, have Advantage on the Initiative check.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deflecting Shroud<\/span>: You only get to use\n\t\tArcane Deflection if you&#8217;re hit by an attack or if you fail a saving throw,\n\t\tbut Deflecting Shroud works even if Arcane Deflection doesn&#8217;t negate the\n\t\teffect which triggered it, so you&#8217;re always guaranteed the damage.\n\t\t<p>The damage from Deflecting Shroud isn&#8217;t great, but there&#8217;s no usage\n\t\t\tlimitation and since it hits three targets at range it can easily\n\t\t\tout-damage cantrips. If you&#8217;re facing groups of weak enemies they might\n\t\t\thit you sheerly by making a large number of attacks or by including you in\n\t\t\tan area damage effect, and this will allow you to thin their numbers\n\t\t\twithout spending expensive spell slots.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The damage also helps justify using Arcane Deflection at high levels by\n\t\t\ttaking some of the sting out of giving up leveled spells for a turn. By\n\t\t\tthis level your pool of spell slots is enormous, so limiting yourself to\n\t\t\tcantrips in many circumstances means that your turn is reduced to a tiny\n\t\t\tsplash of damage where you could instead throw a leveled spell like\n\t\t\tFireball or Chain Lightning.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you want to trigger this easily, there&#8217;s an ally can make an unarmed\n\t\t\tstrike to hit you for 1+Strength damage to set this off, allowing you to\n\t\t\tget a bunch of extra damage before a turn where you may have already\n\t\t\tplanned to cast a cantrip. If you don&#8217;t have an ally handy, keep an angry\n\t\t\trat in a sack, stick your hand into the sack, and wait for the rat to bite\n\t\t\tyou.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"war-magic-tradition-ability-scores\">War Magic Tradition Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing too different from other Wizards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: No muscles.

Might as well just use it when we can.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8-Wizard 7<\/td><td>4th level<br>-Phantasmal Killer<br>-Polymorph<br>-Sickening Radiance<br>-Wall of Fire<\/td><td>Phantasmal Killer is a great damage spell for tough foes with weaker minds.<br><br>Polymorph is so complicated it <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">has a guide all to itself<\/a>.<br><br>Sickening Radiance will always kill anything that fails 6 saves because of Exhaustion.<br><br>Wall of Fire is just a nice way to split up the room at the start of a fight.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9-Wizard 8<\/td><td>ASI: Intelligence +2 (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>Capped intelligence and another proficiency bump. This puts us at +12 Initiative. We might even want to start putting that Dexterity Advantage on allies instead because we\u2019re already this far ahead.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10-Wizard 9<\/td><td>5th level<br>-Hold Monster<br>-Wall of Force<br>-Wall of Stone<\/td><td>Hold Monster is like Hold Person but for everybody. Except Undead.<br><br>Walls for Days. Having an assortment of wall spells is great because they each do something different. Wall of Force is more or less impenetrable, even to ethereal travel. Wall of Stone on the other hand becomes permanent if you keep Concentration for the ten minute duration.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11-Wizard 10<\/td><td>Durable Magic<\/td><td>Now this is just ridiculous. We were always going to have something to Concentrate on anyway, but now we get a +2 to AC and a +2 to saving throws. Concentration is a Saving throw. Thanks to proficiency in Constitution saves from that level of Artificer, we now have a +9 bonus to Concentration saves, and we can add another +4 with Arcane Deflection. With half plate and a shield, our AC is 21 and we can add +2 with Arcane Deflection.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12-Wizard 11<\/td><td>6th level<br>-Contingency<br>-Disintegrate<br>-True Seeing<\/td><td><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/contingency\/\">Contingency<\/a>. The guide linked here is a very good read about how to get the most from this spell.<br><br>That impenetrable forcefield we talked about last spell level is weak to Disintegration so it\u2019s nice to have around in case we have to fight one of those.<br><br>True Seeing is just helpful all around.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13-Wizard 12<\/td><td>Feat: Alert<\/td><td>Taking Alert is just being abusive at this point. PB also increases at this level so that\u2019s a +18 to Initiative.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14-Wizard 13<\/td><td>7th level<br>-Forcecage<br>-Reverse Gravity<\/td><td>Forcecage. Go first and cut every fight in half, go have lunch, and come back to finish off your foes.<br><br>Or just put things in the air for a bit. It\u2019s rather silly.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15-Wizard 14<\/td><td>Deflecting Shroud<\/td><td>It\u2019s just adding free damage onto Arcane Deflection. But to use that we have to get hit or fail a save, and we keep winning the fights on round one so that\u2019s not really going to happen.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16-Wizard 15<\/td><td>8th level<br>-Illusory Dragon<br>-Maze<\/td><td>Pretend Dragon. Real Breath Weapon.<br><br>Or just lock a target in a demiplane until they pass a DC 20 Intelligence check.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17-Wizard 16<\/td><td>ASI: Dexterity +2 (16=&gt;18)<\/td><td>+20 Initiative.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18-Wizard 17<\/td><td>9th level<br>-Foresight<br>-Wish<\/td><td>I\u2019m contractually obligated to recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/wish\/\"><em>that spell<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><br><br>However, because Wish is boring, cast Foresight instead. No no, not on us. We\u2019re already incredibly likely to win every Initiative. Put it on whichever martial is your glass cannon or benefits the most from Advantage.
