With\n\thigher BAB, characters gain additional attacks when making a full attack\n\taction. Fighter type classes with full BAB progression get their first\n\titerative attack at 6th level. The addition of a second attack vastly improves\n\tthe character&#8217;s effectiveness in combat, and can potentially double the\n\tcharacter&#8217;s damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Using your iterative attacks typically requires a Full Attack action. If you\n\tneed to move to reach your enemy, this means you must sacrifice your attacks\n\tin order to move. This tactical limitation is one of the biggest shortcomings\n\tof melee fighter characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Vital Strike. Vital Strike allows you to forego additional attacks in\n\tfavor of making a single attack with high damage. Because Vital Strike only\n\tmultiplies the weapon&#8217;s base damage (just the dice; no enhancements), Vital\n\tStrike seems like a poor tactical option. However, with some focus, Vital\n\tStrike can be an excellent option around which to center your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Vital Strike Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#benefits\">Benefits of Vital Strike<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#drawbacks\">Drawbacks of Vital Strike<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapon-size\">Weapon Size Chart<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#choosing-your-weapon\">Choosing Your Weapon<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#crossbows\">A note on Crossbows<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#other-feats\">Other Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells\">Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-dependent-damage\">Class-Dependent Damage Dice<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#brawlerunchained-monk\">Brawler\/Unchained Monk<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk\">Monk<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#warpriest\">Warpriest<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#beyond-the-pale\">Beyond the Pale<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

However, if you still want to build with critical\n\t\t\t\t\t\thits in mind (and you will have the feats to do so), the +6\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonus is better than what you get from Critical Focus, and the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbonuses stack. However, you&#8217;ll still need Critical Focus to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpick up Critical Feats.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Winter&#8217;s Strike<\/span>: Fatigued is worthless,\n\t\t\t\tand the duration is pitiful, but it appears that you can stack the\n\t\t\t\teffect with itself to make creatures Exhausted.

Critical threat range and multipliers can generally be ignored, as the bulk of your damage will not be multiplied by Vital Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because weapon die is so critical to Vital Strike, it is not recommended for small creatures. All weapons below are assumed medium unless otherwise noted. Weapons at larger sizes are included to account for effects like Enlarge Person, Gravity Arrow, and Lead Blades. Keep in mind that Enlarge Person can be stacked with Gravity Arrow, Lead Blades, or the Impact weapon enhancement to do damage as though you were using a weapon two sizes larger than your character&#8217;s normal size, but Gravity Arrow, Lead Blades, and Impact do not stack with each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already using a weapon one size larger than your character, you can effectively wield a one-handed weapon three sizes larger, and I encourage you to do so.

The Aklys was originally published\n\t\twith 1d8 damage, making it the most damaging light weapon in the game. That\n\t\tpositioned it nicely for use with vital strike, making it among the most\n\t\tpowerful options available. However, errata corrected the damage die to 1d6,\n\t\tplacing it on par with other light weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bastard Sword<\/span>: The gold standard of melee,\n\t\tthe Large Bastard Sword is the biggest damage die that a medium creature can\n\t\twield, at 2d8. The -2 size penalty to attack is annoying, but won&#8217;t matter\n\t\tmuch because you are always attacking at your full BAB. Medium size Bastard\n\t\tSwords are intentionally not listed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crossbow, Double<\/span>*: The Double Crossbow\n\t\tis an odd case. The damage from the second bolt isn&#8217;t multiplied, and\n\t\twithout Crossbow Mastery the reload time is crippling. However, if you&#8217;re\n\t\tstarting at high enough level to get Crossbow Mastery without cutting into\n\t\tmore important feats, there&#8217;s room to make the Double Crossbow work. The\n\t\tsmaller damage die means that the Double Crossbow&#8217;s single-bolt damage will\n\t\tlag behind the Heavy Crossbow, but if you have other non-precision damage\n\t\tbonuses (flaming weapon, Weapon Specialization, Deadly Aim, Weapon Training,\n\t\tInspire Courage) you can make the Double Crossbow deal more damage than the\n\t\tHeavy Crossbow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crossbow, Light<\/span>*: With the exception of\n\t\treload speed, the light crossbow is strictly worse than the heavy crossbow.\n\t\tBecause Vital Strike only takes a Standard Action, Rapid Reload moves the\n\t\tHeavy Crossbow&#8217;s reload speed down to a move action, which means you can\n\t\tfire as frequently with a Heavy Crossbow as you can with a Light\n\t\tCrossbow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crossbow, Heavy<\/span>*: With the Rapid Reload\n\t\tfeat, the Heavy Crossbow is strictly better than Light Crossbows. The\n\t\tdifference in damage die size is negligible at low level, but the gap widens\n\t\tas you gain additional Vital Strike feats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elven Curve Blade<\/span>: The Elven Curve blade\n\t\tis a step up from the Falchion. With a considerably better damage die, the\n\t\tdamage is slightly better than the Falcion, even at Medium size. As you\n\t\tincrease the effective size of your weapon, the damage gap becomes\n\t\tconsiderable. A better choice for comparison is the Katana. The Large Katana\n\t\twill deal more damage, but at a -2 penalty, while the Elven Curve Blade\n\t\trequires a feat. Because that -2 penalty is fairly gentle, the Katana is\n\t\ttypically a better option if you want something with a large threat range\n\t\tfor some reason. However, because the extra damage from Vital Strike is not\n\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit, I don&#8217;t recommend going this route.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Falchion<\/span>: Because the base damage dice are\n\t\tso small, the Falchion doesn&#8217;t work well for Vital Strike. The threat range\n\t\tis great, but Vital Strike doesn&#8217;t work well with critical hits, and the\n\t\tdamage gap between the Falchion and other weapons is immense.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greataxe<\/span>: Once you factor in effects like\n\t\tEnlarge Person and Impact, the Greataxe is functionally identical to the\n\t\tgreatsword.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greatsword<\/span>: Good, but not as good as the\n\t\tLarge Bastard Sword in most cases. The one exception is the Titan Mauler\n\t\tBarbarian, which can use a greatsword one size larger than they are. Coupled\n\t\twith Impact and Enlarge person, a human could use a greatsword that is\n\t\teffectively Gargantuan, dealing an impressive 6d6 base damage. This\n\t\tprogression is omitted from the table above because it only applies to the\n\t\tTitan Mauler, and including it in the table would be confusing for everyone\n\t\telse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Katana<\/span>: A close competitor with the Large\n\t\tBastard Sword, the Katana gets an increased critical threat range instead of\n\t\tbigger damage dice. At medium size, the damage gap is small, but when you\n\t\tEnlarge Person yourself, the damage will will grow larger. Medium size\n\t\tKatanas are intentionally not listed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Longbow<\/span>: Because you can&#8217;t use a weapon\n\t\tlarger than your size, the Longbow falls behind crossbows in damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rapier<\/span>: Normally a terrible option for\n\t\tVital Strike enthusiasts, rapiers are included here primarily as a reference\n\t\tfor my other guides, and for exceptionally rare builds which might use Vital\n\t\tStrike one-handed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"crossbows\">A note on Crossbows<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Depending on GM interpretation, you may or may not be able to use crossbows which are larger than your size. The Light and Heavy crossbows both say &#8220;you can shoot, but not load, a [light\/heavy] crossbow with one hand at a [-2\/-4] penalty on attack rolls.&#8221; Because you can fire them one-handed, it stands to reason that you could use a weapon one size larger at the normal -2 penalty, just as you can use a Large longsword at the same penalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some GMs may rule than you can fire an oversized crossbow, but cannot reload it because it requires two hands to reload. I have always thought that you need two hands to reload a crossbow because you need to hold the crossbow while drawing back the string. This requirement isn&#8217;t changed by the weapon&#8217;s size relative to the player: you still need two hands to load a crossbow too small for you, so why should you need more than two hands to load a crossbow too large for you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two major problem with using crossbows (and any ranger weapon) are that Enlarge Person doesn&#8217;t affect projectiles, and that the Impact weapon property only applies to melee weapons. You may be able to convince your DM to allow an Impact-equivalent property based on the spell Gravity Arrows, and you can buy larger ammunition once permanently enlarged which you would need to do anyway since you&#8217;re likely not carrying an infinite supply of arrows when you first become permanently enlarged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-feats\">Other Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Expertise<\/span>: If you need AC, Combat\n\t\tExpertise can really help. You will always be attacking at your best BAB, so\n\t\tyou will be very accurate, and you can afford to sacrifice attack bonus for\n\t\tdefense.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Unfortunately, Vital\n\t\tStrike provides no benefit when making attacks of opportunity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dodge<\/span>: More AC certainly never hurts.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mobility<\/span>: Because you have the\n\t\t\t\tability to move without losing damage output, you may find yourself\n\t\t\t\tdrawing attacks of opportunity. Mobility will help if you don&#8217;t have the\n\t\t\t\tresources to devote to Acrobatics.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spring Attack<\/span>: Vital strike\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspecifically says &#8220;when you take the Attack action&#8221;. The &#8220;Attack&#8221;\n\t\t\t\t\t\taction is a Standard Action allowing you to make one attack. Spring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAttack is a Full Round Action, so it can&#8217;t be used in conjunction\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Vital Strike.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power Attack<\/span>: Essential. Because you are\n\t\talways attacking at your full BAB, the penalty for Power Attack won&#8217;t hurt\n\t\tyou too much.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cleave<\/span>: Can&#8217;t combine with Vital\n\t\t\t\tStrike.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Furious Focus<\/span>: Every attack is your\n\t\t\t\tfirst attack in a round, so you always ignore the attack penalty. Take\n\t\t\t\tthis, and hit every time.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rapid Reload<\/span>: Still essential for\n\t\treloading your heavy crossbow (normally a standard action).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Focus<\/span>: More attack bonus never\n\t\thurts, but if you have more interesting feats in mind, don&#8217;t worry about\n\t\tthis too much.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: This feat really\n\t\t\t\tonly works if you get multiple attacks to apply the bonus with. 2 damage\n\t\t\t\tper turn is hardly worth the feat.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge Person<\/span>: Get it permanent if you&#8217;re\n\t\tbuilding for melee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gravity Arrow<\/span>: Stand-in until you can\n\t\tget an Impact weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lead Blades<\/span>: Stand-in until you can get\n\t\tan Impact weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shillelagh<\/span>: Technically not a size\n\t\tincrease, so it stacks with Lead Blades.

These progressions present some interesting math. When relying on weapons, your two damage-increasing factors are your weapon&#8217;s effective size and your best Vital Strike feat in the chain. Class-dependent damage scaling adds a third factor, dramatically complicating the math.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize the information below: All of them are bad. Vital Strike becomes an occasionally amuzing mechanic that eats 3 or 4 feats with no meaningful payoff.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brawlerunchained-monk\">Brawler\/Unchained Monk<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your best bet for Vital Strike and level-dependent scaling. Weapon users will get access to Enlarge Person and Impact weapons at roughly the same rate that you will, so unfortunately that means that you won&#8217;t match an oversized bastard sword until 16th level, and won&#8217;t exceed it until 8th. If you really need a meaningful way to spend Standard actions, Vital Strike is fine, but you can do better with style feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk\">Monk<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t do this. Monks have 2\/3 BAB so not only are you handicapped by getting Vital Strike feats late, but the Monk&#8217;s unarmed strike damage won&#8217;t match an oversized bastard sword until 16th level. Maybe someday we&#8217;ll see a monk archetype which trades out Flurry of Blows for Vital Strike and better unarmed strike damage, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warpriest\">Warpriest<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The warpriest&#8217;s damage progression is weird. It&#8217;s a little bit weaker than Monk, so you won&#8217;t match and oversized bastard sword until 20th level. The damage die is also dependent on your character&#8217;s size, not on the weapon&#8217;s size, so you can use one-handed weapons without sacrificing damage. Unfortunately, you need to compare your own damage output to a normal-sized bastard sword, which you won&#8217;t match until 10th level, and if you add Impact to that comparable bastard sword you won&#8217;t match it until 20th level. You can still elect to use the normal damage die of your weapon if you choose to do so, but you&#8217;ll fall behind the maximum damage output of Vital Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-pale\">Beyond the Pale<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>When you expand your options beyond my official SRD-only rule, Vital Strike becomes immediately problematic.

Options like Monkey Grip and the Goliath race up your effective weapons size cap by several more steps, adding several additional dice to your theoretical maximum damage.
