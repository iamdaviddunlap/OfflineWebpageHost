Let&#8217;s begin:<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-party-roles\">The Party Roles:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>Anyone reading this who has not been playing D&amp;D over the past thirty\n\tyears may not know that there are some fairly &#8220;official&#8221; party roles that date\n\tback to the original basic set. They are Fighter, Thief, Magic User and\n\tCleric. The idea is that the Cleric heals, the Fighter takes hits and does\n\tdamage, the Thief opens locks, disarms traps and backstabs, and the Magic User\n\tthrows magic missiles and fireballs. These roles are every bit as outdated as\n\tBasic D&amp;D itself, yet you still see players flocking to &#8220;fill&#8221; these\n\troles, thinking that this remains the most effective party, despite a game\n\tthat resembles Basic D&amp;D cosmetically only.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>How many times have you gotten\/sent an email when wondering what kind of\n\tcharacter you could make, and a reply comes up with something like, &#8220;We have a\n\tRogue, a Druid and a Sorcerer.&#8221; The implication of course is, &#8220;Make a\n\tfighter-type&#8221;, but in fact, the email is useless. Is the Rogue a melee rogue\n\tor an archery rogue? Is the Druid going to be engaging in melee? What kind of\n\tspells will the Sorcerer have? Maybe the best thing for this party is a\n\tWizard, or another rogue&#8230;who knows?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Instead the email should say, &#8220;In combat we&#8217;ve got a Tank, a Striker and a\n\tBattlefield Controller, another Tank would be great. Out of combat we need a\n\tparty face. How about some kind of Melee character with some social skills?&#8221;\n\tCharacters are too flexible in D&amp;D (and Pathfinder) to define roles by\n\tclass. Instead the role should be defined by what they do.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The mechanics of the game changed enough in 3.0 that the optimal party\n\tchanged with them, yet many players never realized that the iconic party is no\n\tlonger optimal, so we still see Wizards throwing fireballs (sorry, just threw\n\tup a bit in my mouth), and Clerics running around healing, wondering why they\n\tcan&#8217;t heal as fast as the party seems to take damage.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The reality is that D&amp;D isn&#8217;t all combat, but combat plays a major role\n\tin pretty much every campaign. Therefore you can break party roles into two\n\tmajor categories. The &#8220;out of combat&#8221; roles, and the &#8220;combat&#8221; roles. Let\u2019s\n\tlook at how the God Wizard fits into each.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-out-of-combat-roles\">5 OUT OF COMBAT ROLES:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Social (&#8220;The Fop&#8221;)<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Can the wizard fill this role? Well if you specialize in enchantment kinds of\n\tspells, then you very well might be able to, but, you shouldn&#8217;t. First, you\n\taren&#8217;t the best choice to fill this role, and secondly, this guy tends to\n\tthink he&#8217;s the leader, do you know what happens to the leader? He gets\n\ttargeted first. Let the Paladin, Cleric or Bard take this role. Pretend you&#8217;re\n\tjealous.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Sneak (&#8220;The Corpse&#8221;)<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Can the wizard fill this role? Well if you specialize in spells that imitate\n\tthe iconic rogue skills like invisibility and knock, and a few divinations you\n\tvery well might be able to, but, you shouldn&#8217;t. The purpose of the Sneak is to\n\tscout out ahead in the enemy&#8217;s lair, look for traps and disarm them, scout out\n\tthe enemy and report back, and do this all alone. Wonder why I call him &#8220;the\n\tCorpse&#8221;? Read what he does again.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Healbot<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Can the wizard fill this role? Actually, in Pathfinder he can&#8217;t, but don&#8217;t\n\tworry, you don&#8217;t want it. The healbot gets to use up all his resources\n\t&#8220;servicing&#8221; the party between combats. Sound pleasant?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">The Lump (&#8220;The lump&#8221;)<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>I can&#8217;t think of another name for him. He&#8217;s the character of the player that\n\tmade his character specifically for combat, and is really uninterested\n\twhenever he&#8217;s not rolling his attack rolls. He makes the best use of his time\n\twhen not in combat by snoozing, or reading a novel, or making it very clear to\n\tthe DM that he&#8217;s bored. You DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to be this guy.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Utility Caster (&#8220;Everything else&#8221;)<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The party transporter, the party Diviner. One way or another &#8211; this is the\n\tcasters&#8217; role &#8211; in other words &#8211; this is you.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>That&#8217;s pretty much it. A party should look to cover all those bases (except\n\tthe lump, but all too often it gets filled regardless, and often a single\n\tcharacter can fill more than one (The party Cleric may be both the Fop and the\n\tHealbot&#8230;lucky guy), but let&#8217;s be honest here, D&amp;D is largely about\n\tcombat, so even if you have a character that is the Fop, the Corpse, the\n\tHealbot and the Utility Caster, if you aren&#8217;t contributing to combat, then you\n\tare a liability to your party, because when characters die, it&#8217;s usually in\n\tcombat.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-four-combat-roles\">The Four Combat Roles:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">The Tank: (&#8220;The Big Stupid Fighter&#8221;):<\/span> This\n\trole involves two things: Doing Hit Points damage to BBEG (big bad evil guy),\n\tforcing BBEG to attack you with his viscous weaponry. The Big Stupid Fighter\n\tis not always a fighter (though stereotypically he is). He may be a Barbarian,\n\ta Summoned Critter, or a Druid. In order to qualify as a Big Stupid Fighter he\n\tshould be any character that actively tries to be the target of enemy attacks.\n\tFor those who wonder why I would label this character as &#8220;stupid&#8221; regardless\n\tof their INT score &#8211; reread the previous sentence.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">The Striker: (&#8220;The Glass Cannon&#8221;):<\/span> This role\n\tinvolves one thing: Doing HP damage to BBEG. The Glass Cannon is like the Big\n\tStupid Fighter except he does not want to take damage. Usually this is not due\n\tto superior intelligence &#8211; but instead due to inferior HP or AC (or in most\n\tcases &#8211; both). The Glass Cannon is often a Rogue (Or Rouge for our 13 year old\n\treaders), a Gish, an Archer, or a Blaster (the inferior wizard).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">The controller of reality: (&#8220;GOD&#8221;):<\/span> When\n\treality would entail the above two meeting a rather messy end &#8211; someone will\n\tneed to make some adjustments to said reality in order for the above two to\n\tinstead meet glorious victory. What other label could such a force be labelled\n\tas than &#8220;God&#8221;? Well &#8211; how about &#8220;Primary Caster&#8221; One label or another &#8211; this\n\tguy needs to control reality to make sure the right team wins.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">The Waste of Space:<\/span> What else do you call\n\thim? The Waste of Space is the guy who thought that multi-classing Wizard and\n\tSorcerer made an excellent &#8220;character concept&#8221;, or maybe he figures that a\n\tdedicated healer is an appropriate contributor to a combat environment, or\n\tmaybe he&#8217;s the Cleric who insists on swinging a mace for 1d8 damage per round\n\tbecause he won&#8217;t memorize any useful combat spells, I could go on, but you\n\tknow who I mean, there is probably one in your current group. If there\n\tisn&#8217;t&#8230;well&#8230;maybe there is&#8230;*cough* *cough*&#8230;ahem.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>* Why isn&#8217;t the Healer useful in combat? There are two ways you can live your\n\t&#8220;pretend&#8221; life &#8211; &#8220;reactively&#8221; or &#8220;proactively&#8221;. The God Wizard will alter\n\treality to prevent damage, a healer will try to do &#8220;damage control&#8221; (pun\n\tintended) after the damage has been taken. Simple truth: The mechanics of the\n\tgame make preventing damage more efficient then healing damage after the fact.\n\tThat&#8217;s not to say a well placed &#8220;Heal&#8221; or even &#8220;CLW&#8221; never has use in combat &#8211;\n\tbut if you&#8217;re doing your job &#8211; it should never be required as a primary\n\trole.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-roles-to-fill\">What roles to fill?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>Obviously, I&#8217;m suggesting here what you should be doing. You should be a\n\tutility caster outside of combat, and in combat, you should be the &#8220;God\n\tWizard&#8221;. However, not every party is the same, and sometimes the roles are\n\tweak or need some filling. Fortunately, you can help out when needed. Focusing\n\ton any of these areas shouldn&#8217;t be your prime concern, but consider yourself a\n\t&#8220;patch&#8221; for a leak.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The Fop: Your charisma likely ain&#8217;t great, and you likely have all the social\n\tskills of the Big Stupid Fighter. Filling this role is going to be a\n\tchallenge. However, you can provide some aid to the party Fop when required.\n\tThe key here is enhancement and enchantment. Use enhancement spells like\n\tEagle&#8217;s Splendor if your party Fop isn&#8217;t all he should be, and even a simple\n\tprestidigitation can clean him and his clothes up when he stinks like he&#8217;s\n\tbeen crawling a dungeon for the past week.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The Corpse: You aren&#8217;t any kind of sneak, but you can magically cover the\n\tskills. If the party is short on the scouts, a planar bound Imp is a pretty\n\tgood one. Even a low level summoned monster (like a Dire Rat) can scout out\n\tunder a door or around a corner. Your familiar can also make a great scout.\n\tWho&#8217;s to know yet another bat in the cave is in fact an intelligent creature?\n\tKnock spells trump any open lock skills, and don&#8217;t worry about disarming\n\ttraps&#8230;set them off (not personally, but that summoned Dire Rat can, or\n\tperhaps an unseen servant to open doors and chests that may be otherwise\n\tdangerous. Invisibility + Fly is as good as any stealth skill most of the\n\ttime.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The Healbot: Did you know that a 9th level wizard can cast Cure Serious\n\tWounds? OK, OK, not directly, but he CAN summon a Bralani Azata, and that\n\tBralani Azata can cast Cure Serious Wounds&#8230;twice. Not something you want to\n\tdo often, but if you need some quick healing in a combat, it can be done. That\n\tsaid, the wizard is an absolute terrible healer, but he can help out in a\n\thealing weak party. Out of combat, don&#8217;t get suckered into doing this. Get\n\tsome cure light wounds wands (one of the best deals in the game) and somebody\n\tin the party surely can use it (whether Cleric, Druid, Bard or anyone with Use\n\tMagic Device)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The Big Stupid Fighter: Obviously you will never do this personally, but\n\tthat&#8217;s what summoning spells are for right? A summoned critter may not be as\n\ttough as a PC fighter, but he takes up space, draws attacks, and has some form\n\tof attack as well&#8230;and they never need healing after the fight.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The Striker: That&#8217;s what Blast spells make a wizard. I&#8217;m not a fan of these\n\tkinds of spells, but they have their place, and that&#8217;s the place of a weak\n\tstriker in the party.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The Waste of Space: Everything I&#8217;ve just pointed out you want to avoid doing.\n\tWizards aren&#8217;t the best at any of these roles, and when you start filling\n\tthese roles you will notice your spells running out really fast. A Wizard may\n\tbe able to do nearly anything, but don&#8217;t get fooled into thinking he can do\n\teverything. Spells\/day is the limitation that ensures that a Wizard doesn&#8217;t\n\tget too big for his britches, or he finds himself filling the one role you\n\tnever wanted to, the &#8220;Waste or space&#8221;<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"get-a-job-nananana-nanananana\">Get a Job NA-NA-NA-NA, NA-NA-NA-NA-NA:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>In combat, the God wizard doesn&#8217;t have one job, or two, he&#8217;s got\n\tthree&#8230;yippee! Remember these three jobs, and it will help you evaluate\n\tspells, pick memorization&#8217;s, and fulfill your combat role effectively. None of\n\tthese jobs is to do damage to the enemy. In fact, a Wizard can be very\n\teffective and powerful without ever &#8220;killing&#8221; anything.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The God Wizards three jobs are: Control the Battlefield, Debuff the enemy,\n\tBuff your allies. Lets look at each separately.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Battlefield Control:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>In order to be an effective battlefield controller &#8211; you should consider your\n\tprimary goal to line up your enemies flanked by your Glass Cannon and Big\n\tStupid Fighter one at a time and backwards, all while standing on their heads.\n\tThis will make the BSF and the GC win the combat with little damage to\n\tthemselves &#8211; and they will feel like &#8220;they&#8221; won. That&#8217;s the point &#8211; you&#8217;re God\n\tafter all, let the mortals have their victory.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The point of Battlefield Control is that you are ensuring your allies gain\n\ttactical advantage over your enemies. If you secure tactical advantage, and\n\thold it, you will win. A simple wall spell can separate enemies so that they\n\tcan be taken on one at a time. Putting the BSF and the Sneak Attacker in\n\tflanking positions makes each of them more effective than they otherwise would\n\tbe. Some characters have difficulty with flying enemies or difficult terrain.\n\tSometimes hampering vision can force an enemy to close the distance with your\n\teffective melee characters. The best thing about battlefield controls, is\n\tquite often they offer no saving throw, no spell resistance, so luck ceases to\n\tbe a factor, it&#8217;s all about smart tactics and evaluating the situation\n\tcorrectly.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Debuffing:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>In order to be an effective Debuffer &#8211; you should consider your primary goal\n\tto have your BBEG standing in front of your GC and BSF dazed, stunned,\n\tnauseated, STR = 1, Dex = 1, Level = 1, and Blind for good measure. This will\n\tmake the BSF and the GC win the combat with little damage to themselves &#8211; and\n\tthey will feel like &#8220;they&#8221; won. That&#8217;s the point &#8211; you&#8217;re God after all, let\n\tthe mortals have their victory.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>(Note to readers: Debuffing can more literally be termed as reducing\n\tattributes or levels of opponents &#8211; I extend the term to be anything that\n\timpairs or damages the abilities of the enemy &#8211; which is why I include things\n\tlike &#8220;blinding&#8221; to be a debuff)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Usually when we talk about debuffing we talk about flat penalties or status\n\teffects. Look for debuffs that either affect large groups of enemies or that\n\toffer no saving throw. A spell like Slow spell thrown over 6 enemies may\n\tstagger only 3, but that creates a huge advantage for your allies. Numerical\n\tdebuffs also adjust the math in the favor of your allies as well. Why worry\n\tabout a save or die, when a save-or-lose will do the job?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Buffing:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Buffing means making your allies more powerful. In order to be effective at\n\tbuffing &#8211; you turn your Big Stupid Fighter into a Colossal, Stupid Fighter on\n\tcrack, and your Glass Cannon into an Adamantium Chain Gun. This will make the\n\tBSF and the GC win the combat with little damage to themselves &#8211; and they will\n\tfeel like &#8220;they&#8221; won. That&#8217;s the point &#8211; you&#8217;re God after all, let the mortals\n\thave their victory.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>The great thing about buffing is that when you buff, you NEVER need to worry\n\tabout &#8220;to hit&#8221; rolls, saving throws, or spell resistance. Your party members\n\tare all too glad to get that statistical advantage in combat, whether you are\n\toffering an extra attack, or a bonus to hit and damage. Buffing is also a\n\tgreat way to become very popular with the rest of the party, who act like kids\n\ton Christmas Morning when you start passing out buff spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>So What Job is Best? It really depends on the circumstance. Personally, I\n\tthink a &#8220;God&#8221; wizard should put the greatest emphasis on Battlefield Control\n\tspells. If you have the right battlefield control spell for the situation, you\n\twill win the combat every time. It doesn&#8217;t win the combat on its own, but it\n\tcreates a tactical advantage that shift the odds far enough in the favor of\n\tyour allies that after that, they are assured of victory. Buffing is a good\n\tstandby for when no Battlefield Control spell is appropriate, and you are\n\tconcerned about resistances or immunities of your enemies. Debuffing is\n\tusually more significant than buffing at the same level, so if you think you\n\tcan &#8220;stick&#8221; some debuffs to an enemy or a group of enemies, it is a great way\n\tto go.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-to-skip-the-all-powerful-save-or-die-spells\">Why to skip the &#8220;all powerful&#8221; Save or Die spells:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>Yes, Save or Die is powerful, we&#8217;ve all heard why (who cares how many HP the\n\tmonster has? If they fail their save, the fight is over) &#8211; however, it is\n\toverrated. This is why:<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Lots of enemies: You take down one and do little else to help your Big Stupid\n\tFighter and Glass Cannon. You spent a high level spell doing so.\n\tCongratulations &#8211; you&#8217;ve been demoted from God to Glass Cannon. Ouch!<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>One Big Enemy: You either do nothing or everything. The Big Stupid Fighter\n\tand Glass Cannon are either in lots of trouble or are feeling useless. This is\n\tlike the chess player who is addicted to using his queen &#8211; ends up losing it,\n\tand then sucks for the rest of the game. Use your lesser pieces (That&#8217;s the\n\tbig stupid fighter and the glass cannon &#8211; your peons) to your advantage &#8211; let\n\tthem do the dirty work &#8211; your job is to make it easy for them, not to take\n\ttheir place. Try to take their place your spells will run out fast. Besides,\n\tyou are a team, enjoy the benefits of that.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>By Yourself: Now in this rare circumstance &#8211; save or dies are actually quite\n\tgood. However &#8211; avoid this situation like the plague. If you choose to test\n\tyour &#8220;phenomenal cosmic power&#8221; by going out alone, then YOU are the Big Stupid\n\tFighter, except you aren&#8217;t Big, you aren&#8217;t a Fighter, and you&#8217;re not&#8230;.well,\n\tthat&#8217;s it pretty much.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-blast-spells-should-be-recreation-only\">Why &#8220;Blast&#8221; spells should be recreation only:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>The first point is that in 3.0, blast spells became in inefficient way to do\n\tdamage. Look at a fireball for example. Cast by a 5th level wizard it does 5d6\n\tdamage&#8230;but not really, saving throws can reduce that by half, evasion can\n\teliminate it entirely, and improved evasion will at least cut it in half. Then\n\tyou take into account fire resistance (AFTER the save), which will very\n\tcommonly reduce it further by 5, 10, 20, or even offer full immunity&#8230;and\n\tfire resistance and immunity is common. In the end, that Fireball will do 20\n\tpoints of damage if you are lucky, more likely, anywhere from 5 to 10 damage.\n\tSo how many creatures that you fight at level 5 can take that? Yep&#8230;all of\n\tthem, while laughing at you. Now how much damage does a Haste spell do? Well,\n\tyou would need to take one average attack from every party member for every\n\tround of duration and add them together. The number will vary, but it will\n\tdwarf the damage of a fireball spell. You don&#8217;t get the glory, but you did the\n\tright thing.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Then the second point is a tactical one. HP damage in Pathfinder does NOT\n\tdecrease your ability to fight. The big bad monster with 1 HP has just as\n\tdeadly attack as the big bad monster with 100 hp. &#8220;Softening&#8221; up the enemy\n\twith a blast spell may or may not change the time it takes the rest of the\n\tparty to drop the enemy, but it does nothing to ensure their safety during\n\tthat time. Giving your allies a tactical or mechanical advantage prevents\n\tparty deaths. Throw a blast when you have nothing better to do, but never\n\tthrow one when you have one of your 3 jobs to do.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>I&#8217;m not saying you should never do pure blast. In fact, my own wizards\n\tusually have a blast or two at hand. I&#8217;m just saying that blasting is\n\tsomething you do after you&#8217;ve ensured tactical advantage in the combat.\n\tBlasting in combat should be&#8230;.what comes after tertiary?<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summoning-gods-favorite-spells\">Summoning: God&#8217;s favorite spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>I love summoning. So much so, that I need a special section to explain why\n\tyou should do it. So why summon? Here&#8217;s a few reasons. There&#8217;s more than this,\n\tbut these are the main advantages.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1) Doing Damage: Summoned creatures aren&#8217;t a one shot damage spell. Summons\n\tdo damage every round, the blast spell that keeps on blasting. Note that\n\tCelestial and Fiendish Templates no longer add INT to the animal, but they do\n\tprovide the new and improved Smite Evil\/Good mechanic &#8211; which is a signficant\n\toffensive boost.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>2) Taking Damage: Every time the enemy attacks a summoned creature you win.\n\tThat&#8217;s an attack that would have gone towards you or your allies. Whether it\n\thits or not really doesn&#8217;t matter all that much, because you never need to\n\theal a summoned creature after battle.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3) Battlefield Control: Summoned creatures do more than attack, they also\n\tgrapple, trip, and block the enemy, they also provide cover. Many summoned\n\tcreatures are amazing grapplers.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>4) Extra Spellcasting: Is casting one spell per round getting you down? Well,\n\tthere are always quickened spells, but they are so darned expensive. What if\n\tyou summon a creature with Spell Like Abilities? Then you cast, the summoned\n\tcreature casts, and it&#8217;s like your own little quickened spell every round.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>5) Mounts: Sometimes you need a quick way to get your pet Big Stupid Fighter\n\tup to the big bad guy with wings. That&#8217;s where a quick summoning can be very\n\thandy. A Dire Bat or any number of large (or larger) flying creatures can make\n\teffective quick mounts to get your party where they need to be.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>6) Perception: Ever had that invisible guy you just couldn&#8217;t find? You have a\n\tglitterdust but don&#8217;t know where to aim it, and you left your see invisible\n\tspell unmemorized today. No problem, a quick summoning spell and your Dire Bat\n\twill be attacking the offending square using its blindsense. Now you know\n\twhere to throw that glitterdust spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-stats-does-god-have-anyways\">What STATS does GOD have anyways?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>Unfortunately &#8211; no matter how close to God you become &#8211; your DM is closer.\n\tHopefully your DM has gone the more progressive route of a no-luck version of\n\tcharacter creation, and allows point buy for stats, but some old-time DM&#8217;s out\n\tthere can&#8217;t get past the idea that your stat rolls should involve the &#8220;luck of\n\tthe dice&#8221;.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Any way you slice it &#8211; here&#8217;s the simple rules I follow when making my God.\n\tHighest stat goes to <span class=\"rating-blue\">INT<\/span> &#8211; no exception. (and\n\tall my stat increases will be going into INT) My\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">CON<\/span> is always at least 12 (14 is better if\n\tyou can). Whatever else I can afford goes into\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">DEX<\/span>. This is before Racial modifiers.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Random Roll: Put your highest roll into INT. Dex and Con should have your\n\tsecond and third highest roll, and the other stats get the dump. If your 3rd\n\thighest stat is at least 12, put your second highest stat into DEX, otherwise,\n\tyour second highest stat should go to CON.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Point Buy: What point buy you have will make a difference, but you can dump\n\tStrength, Wisdom and Charisma, so usually you can do pretty well overall.\n\tHere&#8217;s some examples:<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>12-point buy: Str 7 (-4), Dex 16 (10), Con 12 (2), Int 16 (10), Wis 7 (-4),\n\tCha 8 (-2)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>15-point buy: Str 7 (-4), Dex 16 (10), Con 12 (2), Int 17 (13), Wis 7 (-4),\n\tCha 8 (-2)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>20-point buy: Str 7 (-4), Dex 16 (10), Con 13 (3), Int 18 (17), Wis 7 (-4),\n\tCha 8 (-2)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>25-point buy: Str 8 (-2), Dex 16 (10), Con 14 (5), Int 18 (17), Wis 7 (-4),\n\tCha 9 (-1)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Obviously these aren&#8217;t set in stone. If you want to have a decent strength\n\t(maybe your DM is an encumbrance Nazi), then drop the Dex to a 14, or whatever\n\tyou need to do. The most important thing is you make sure your Intelligence is\n\tyour top priority, and that Dex and Con, in that order, are number 2 and 3.\n\tThe rest are dump stats.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-race-is-god\">What Race is God?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>In Pathfinder, you&#8217;ve got great choices for Wizards, and more than that, your\n\tchoices are flexible. However, that said, your best, best choice is the\n\telf.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Unlike previous editions, the Elf is\n\ttruly made for the Wizard class. A +2 to Dex and Int is huge, and the -2 Con\n\tis no longer a game-breaker. In addition, the elf gets a +2 bonus to defeat\n\tSR, being a racial bonus, this should stack with the Spell Penetration feats.\n\tBonuses to spellcraft (for identifying items) and low light vision, and other\n\tlittle tidbits are all welcome, although the primary selling features we&#8217;ve\n\talready covered.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Human:<\/span> With a flexible stat bonus you can\n\tget that all important +2 Int score. The lack of racial features matters less\n\twith the Wizard that can duplicate many of those features with spells. The\n\textra skill point is great, as is the extra feat.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf:<\/span> Pretty much full out trumped by\n\tthe Elf, however, you&#8217;ll still take the +2 Int score, which is the most\n\timportant feature, and you get a skill focus which is nice too. Not my first\n\tchoice, but the +2 Int alone puts it in the same league.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Half Orc:<\/span> *cries*, yes, you can give your\n\tHalf-Orc a +2 Int. I know, I know, it&#8217;s just wrong. However, in addition to\n\tthat, the Half-Orc is actually an excellent choice, one I would only put\n\tsecond to the &#8220;made for the wizard&#8221; elf. The reason is the Orc Ferocity\n\tability. If there is any class that can benefit more from that\n\tone-last-standard-action than a Wizard, I don&#8217;t know what it is. That said,\n\thopefully this is an ability you will never need.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dwarves, Halflings and Gnomes:<\/span> Not great\n\tchoices, though any of them can still make a good wizard. In general, a +2 Int\n\tscore is the best thing you can get with race, but not having it by no means\n\tmakes a Wizard worthless. However, this is an optimization Guide, and the\n\toptimal choices will have that +2 Int score.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcane-bond-pick-your-double-edged-sword\">Arcane Bond: Pick your double edged sword:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Arcane Bonds. Why? Well, they are both double edged\n\tswords. Advantages that have a significant possibility to be disadvantages.\n\tHowever, you get them anyways, so lets check out the choices, and the\n\tadvantage and disadvantage of each.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">The Bonded Object<\/span>: Remember in &#8220;The Two\n\tTowers&#8221; when Sauroman&#8217;s staff was destroyed how screwed he was? Welcome to the\n\tbonded object. This object gives you a free spell of any level you can cast,\n\tas long as it is in your spellbook, absolutely free and spontaneous, once per\n\tday. This is a nice advantage, especially at low levels when you are short on\n\tcastings. In fact, a first level Specialist Wizard with a Bonded Object gets\n\tjust as many castings per day as a Sorcerer. Yeah&#8230;nice.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Now the downside. Bonded items can be destroyed or lost or stolen, and you\n\tonly can have one, and they take awhile to replace (1 week before you can cast\n\ta ritual that costs 200gp\/level to replace the item). During that time how\n\tscrewed are you? Super screwed. Every spell you cast requires a DC 20+spell\n\tlevel caster check. OK, EVENTUALLY this will be an auto-succeed, but that&#8217;s\n\tonly going to be at high levels. Until then, you have a chance (and at low\n\tlevels a good chance) for every spell you cast to fail. Welcome to Hell. Rings\n\tor amulets of course are less likely to be damaged in combat, but they are\n\teven easier to steal, and they take up a valuable item slot.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Now how big a disadvantage this is really is going to depend on your DM.\n\tHowever, I always have a second copy of my spellbook hidden away somewhere,\n\tbut I can&#8217;t have a second copy of a Bonded Object, so that makes me nervous.\n\tIn the end, my point is, there are two sides to this coin, one gives you a\n\tmoderate advantage, the other absolutely destroys you for at least a week.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">The Bonded Creature (Familiar):<\/span> The obvious\n\tdisadvantage of a familiar is that, with 1\/2 your HP, the Familiar is\n\trelatively vulnerable, and not especially difficult to kill. However, also\n\tnote that unlike previous editions, there is no penalty to you for the death\n\tof your familiar (except the loss of the familiar, which can be replaced later\n\tat cost). If your familiar dies, you still can cast spells, which makes me\n\tmore inclined towards this bond.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Familiars can be quite useful, they can be great scouts, can eventually\n\tdeliver touch spells (though this is dangerous because it identifies the\n\tfamiliar as a target) and deliver messages, as well as give you a moderate\n\tbonus on a skill or saving throw (and you always get alertness when the\n\tfamiliar is close), and the familiar gets your skill ranks, so you get a\n\tsecond roll on knowledges or that type of thing.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Overall, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of familiars, the bonuses they give are pretty\n\tminor, and sometimes keeping them safe is a pain, but they are never worse\n\tthan nothing, which a Bonded Object could be, so therefore, they get my\n\tcomplete endorsement and suggestion.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"specialization-gods-choices\">Specialization, God&#8217;s choices:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>In general you will find that the weight of spells that serve the style of\n\tthe &#8220;God Wizard&#8221; fall more under Conjuration than any other school. For that\n\treason, you should consider Conjuration specialty based on that alone. For the\n\tmost part, the specialization abilities are pretty minor (although nice to\n\thave), but that said, you can make a God Wizard that follows any school as a\n\tspecialist. Keep in mind that you can cast from prohibited schools, but should\n\tavoid doing so except when necessary, because the cost is double.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abjuration School:<\/span> As a school, Abjuration\n\tis for the most part a one-trick-pony. Weighted heavily in resistances and\n\tdefensive bonuses, interestingly though, many of the best defensive spells in\n\tthe game are not abjuration spells at all. That means that the greatest\n\tstrength of the Abjuration school isn&#8217;t unique to Abjuration, which is a bit\n\tof a letdown. All in all, Abjuration is a so-so choice.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abjuration abilities<\/span>: Provide small energy\n\tresistance bonuses to yourself, or deflection AC bonuses (that will not stack\n\twith rings of protection) in a 10&#8242; circle. Largely redundant with the spells\n\tyou are specialized in, rather than enhancing them. These abilities can save\n\tyou a spell or two, unfortunately they save you the very spells you are forced\n\tto memorize.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Conjuration School:<\/span> The best selections of\n\tspells for a God Wizard, conjuration has the largest range of effects\n\tincluded, has spells<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>that target all three saving throws, and lots of spells that offer no save or\n\tspell resistance. In addition, the conjuration list is more centered on\n\tBattlefield Control than any other list. When it comes to spells, which is\n\treally what being a Wizard is all about, you can&#8217;t go wrong with a Conjuration\n\tSpecialty<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Conjuration Abilities:<\/span> OK. The Summoning\n\tduration boost will be pretty good at low levels, and become less of a factor\n\tat higher levels (until 20th, which is a nice ability). The acid dart isn&#8217;t\n\tgreat, but could be an OK fallback at low levels. The Dimensional Step is your\n\tway out of a situation where you are being grappled by a silenced foe. Maybe\n\tcircumstantial, but very handy in that position.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divination School:<\/span> My main problem with\n\tDivination Specialty is redundancy. Lots of divination spells do very similar\n\tthings with different ranges, or perception types, or casting times, but to a\n\tlarge extent, the whole school is built around finding out what is around the\n\tnext corner without having to go there. That&#8217;s a bit extreme, divination does\n\tother things as well, but by and large, that is what much of the school is\n\tbuilt around. Filling one spell of every level in divination can actually be a\n\tbit daunting. Divination is a great school to have, but a weak school to\n\tspecialize in.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divination abilities:<\/span> Easily the best\n\t&#8220;specialization&#8221; abilities in the game. Mainly because of the &#8220;forewarned&#8221;\n\tability that always allows you to act in the surprise round, and gives 1\/2\n\tyour wizard level as a bonus to initiative. Winning initiative as a Wizard is\n\tvery helpful, more so than any other class, so this ability is prime. The\n\tother two abilities are both less impressive, but OK. This makes the\n\tspecialization in this school a good choice all on its own.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enchantment School:<\/span> My problem with\n\tspecializing in enchantment is that Enchantment Spells are very much confined\n\tto Will-Save Mind-Affecting type spells, so when you fight something with a\n\thigh will save, you are disadvantaged, and when you fight something immune to\n\tmind-affecting spells (which is pretty common), you are hooped with pretty\n\tmuch your entire specialized school. This is a big Achilles heel, and why I\n\tdon&#8217;t particularly recommend enchantment specialization.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enchantment Abilities:<\/span> The Aura of Despair\n\tability is a decent debuff with no save, though a Bard can do it much faster,\n\tthe other abilities do not impress. Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate are\n\tnon-class skills tied to a dump-stat, so moderate bonuses to those skills\n\tisn&#8217;t stellar, and the Daze ability requires a touch attack, and although it\n\tseems to offer no saving throw, I&#8217;m vary wary on touch attacks (and it&#8217;s not a\n\tspell, so your familiar can&#8217;t do it for you.)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Evocation School:<\/span> Yeah, I don&#8217;t like\n\tblasts, however, Evocation is far better than its reputation. Evocation is the\n\thome of Force spells, which come in more shades than Magic Missile. In fact,\n\tI&#8217;m a fan of the magic hand Spells, and force makes great walls too. Add in\n\tsome wind spells, protection spells, light and darkness spells, and more,\n\tevocation is actually a very good battlefield control school. Not a bad choice\n\tat all.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Evocation abilities:<\/span> Make your blasts more\n\tblasty, or replace them with a really wimpy blast replacement (OK at low\n\tlevel), the only ability that I find tempting is the 8th level ability to\n\tcreate a short duration energy-wall effect (a short term wall of fire, but\n\tchoose your energy type)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusion School:<\/span> There is much more to\n\tillusion than Silent Image and it&#8217;s progression. Invisibility spells, mirror\n\timage spells, all kinds of defenses. Illusion is good for Battlefield Control\n\tand defensive buffing, weak on debuffing. Overall, not a bad choice for\n\tspecialization.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusion abilities:<\/span> Some fairly decent\n\tabilities here if not earth-shattering, adding duration after you finish\n\tconcentrating is going to be handy, and the invisibility power is a swift\n\taction, which is the big draw there. The Blindness ability is a low level\n\tability really, but OK at that point.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Necromancy School:<\/span> Not my first choice, but\n\tNecromancy is a good debuff school, in addition, if you like undead critters,\n\tthis is the school for that (though Clerics are probably better). Battlefield\n\tControl and Buffing are pretty much non-existent in this school, which is a\n\tproblem for the God wizard. Still, there are a good number of good spells in\n\tthis school.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Necromancy abilities<\/span>: Not great. Turn\n\tundead works better for classes that don&#8217;t dump CHA, and the touch attack\n\tdoesn&#8217;t prevent your target from touching you back&#8230;hard. The Blindsight\n\tability is nice, but is a standard action to activate which hurts.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Transmutation school:<\/span> Transmutation is the\n\tschool of the buff. There are some nice debuffs to, but no real battlefield\n\tcontrol spells. Nevertheless, Transmutation is a very nice school, and a\n\tdecent choice for specialization.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transmutation abilities:<\/span> You can simulate\n\tsome of your spells to a lesser degree (ho-hum) and are given a long range\n\tattack that will be of moderate use at low levels only. Not much here.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Universalist School:<\/span> What can I say? Give up\n\tone spell casting of every level you can cast, so that spells from 2 schools\n\tof your choice don&#8217;t take double slots to memorize? This is an absolutely\n\tterrible, awful, dismal deal. Being a generalist in Pathfinder is a practice\n\tin masochism, don&#8217;t do it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Universalist abilities:<\/span> Nothing here that\n\tgives you extra castings, so nothing even close to worth it. The 8th level\n\tability is nice, but nowhere near enough to make up for the pain of\n\tsignificantly reduced casting of spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-feats-does-god-take\">What Feats does God take?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>The natural inclination of any player making a wizard is to jump to Metamagic\n\tor Item Creation feats first, and why not? After all, they are all feats\n\tspecially for casters, so shouldn&#8217;t they be your best option? Well, maybe they\n\tshould be.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Metamagic Feats:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>I guess the first thing I should mention about metamagic feats is that,\n\tgenerally speaking, a 3rd level spell plus 2 levels of metamagic is more\n\tpowerful than a normal 3rd level spell, but no more powerful than a 5th level\n\tspell (and very often, less powerful). So this leads to the question: Why am I\n\tspending feats so I can just fill my upper level slots with spells that aren&#8217;t\n\tany better than my upper level slots? Good question. In addition, if you are\n\tusing an offensive spell with metamagic, note that the DC will be based on the\n\toriginal spell level (unless you are using heighten)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>That said, some Metamagic feats are actually important to have access to.\n\tWhen you are silenced, it&#8217;s very important to have some non-verbal component\n\toptions, when you are paralyzed or movement restricted, some non-semantic\n\tspells are sure nice to have. When you get to high level, quicken spell is\n\talmost a must, allowing you to piggyback a lower level spell with a higher\n\tlevel one. I personally use extend all the time.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>However, this is where the metamagic rods come in. If you go to the Rods\n\tsection, you will see some followed by &#8220;X, lesser metamagic&#8221; these are the\n\tones you should jump at the chance to get. When you get silenced, even a\n\tlesser silent spell rod is going to give you lots of spell options\n\t(ummm..maybe dispel that silence?).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>I&#8217;m not saying you shouldn&#8217;t take metamagic feats, but it&#8217;s easy to overvalue\n\tthem. Pick up a few through your career, but don&#8217;t overdo it, you&#8217;ll find you\n\taren&#8217;t getting enough out of them otherwise.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Empower Spell:<\/span> Skip it. Really, skip it. The\n\tclarification that Jason has given on this is that it only works for the die\n\troll, not for any additions to the die roll, and for a 2 level increase, I\n\tjust can&#8217;t see any case where it is worth it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enlarge Spell:<\/span> Double the range of your\n\tspell. Note that &#8220;Sizes&#8221; are not increased, so you can&#8217;t enlarge a cone spell\n\tfor example. As a 1 level metamagic, it&#8217;s not too expensive, and I could\n\tpotentially see using it on a long range spell to snipe at super range,\n\thowever, really, probably a once in a blue moon kind of metamagic.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Extend Spell:<\/span> I do recommend it. It&#8217;s one\n\tlevel for double the duration. Spells like Rope Trick are going to rely on\n\textend until you get to 8th level for example. I find myself using this on\n\tself buffs or utilities fairly regularly.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Heighten Spell:<\/span> Mostly of use in loopholes\n\tand abuses, for regular use I just can&#8217;t recommend making a 3rd level spell a\n\t4th level spell, just so it&#8217;s treated as 4th level. You are almost universally\n\tbetter just memorizing a 4th level spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Maximize Spell:<\/span> For the 3 levels this adds to\n\tthe spell, there is almost no spell I think maximize spell is worth it for.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Quicken Spell:<\/span> At high level, using\n\tquickened spells is kind of a staple (even necessary), though I find that a\n\tlesser quicken rod can serve you nicely if you don&#8217;t want to spend the feat\n\tslot (or pay the 4 level increase)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silent Spell:<\/span> Although I don&#8217;t recommend\n\tthis for wizards (because you never know when you need it), a lesser silent\n\trod may be the best item for the cost you can get in the game. When you get\n\tsilenced, you draw the rod and cast away. For a sorcerer, this feat is\n\thandy.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Still Spell:<\/span> Not available as a standard\n\tmetamagic rod unfortunately, but mainly for use if you are paralyzed, or\n\treally don&#8217;t want to be identified as the source of a spell (in these cases,\n\tStill spell will need to be used in conjunction with Silent Spell). Some\n\tmethod of casting silent spells (such as the Rod) should really be obtained\n\tfirst, as Silent Spell is more useful on its own than Still Spell is.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Widen Spell:<\/span> Increasing a spells area by 100%\n\tsounds great, but 3 levels to increase &#8211; an absolutely terrible deal.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"item-creation-feats\">Item Creation Feats:<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t>To me, item creation feats are kind of like watching Martha Stewart (&#8220;Why buy\n\tyour magic items at the store, you can make them at home for a fraction of the\n\tcost!&#8221;). That&#8217;s pretty much it. Make your own magic items and save your money.\n\tIt&#8217;s like selling your feat slots. In a campaign where magic items are hard to\n\tcome by, you may actually need these feats to properly equip yourself and your\n\tparty, but you don&#8217;t have to like it. In the end, you aren&#8217;t going to get much\n\tfun out of item creation feats, and I personally almost never take them, but\n\tif you need to create, or you want to sell off your feat slots for cash,\n\there&#8217;s some options.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Brew Potion:<\/span> Potions are bad, overpriced, and\n\trestricted for which spells you can apply. Avoid buying potions, and\n\tdefinitely avoid brewing them.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Craft Magic Arms and Armor:<\/span> The most\n\tcommon magic items to find in the game, however, there could be some definite\n\tvalue to this if someone in your party uses a rare style of weapon, and you\n\tcan&#8217;t buy magic items, but for most wizards this isn&#8217;t worthwhile.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Craft Rod:<\/span> Well you will definitely want\n\trods, however, usually you want the rod to cover a metamagic feat that you\n\tDON&#8217;T have. I think you should just buy your rods, they&#8217;re cheap.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Craft Staff:<\/span> If you are going to item\n\tcreate, this is a good choice. Staves are expensive, and I&#8217;m not a big fan\n\tbecause of the cost, but at half price they are better. The important thing is\n\tyou can cast the spells on the staff with your full caster level, even when\n\tyou enchant the staff with a lesser caster level. Also there is no limit to\n\tthe level of spell you can put in the staff.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Craft Wand<\/span>: Probably worse than craft staff\n\tin almost every way.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Craft Wondrous Item:<\/span> Could be handy for a\n\tcampaign where you have trouble buying this stuff.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Forge Ring:<\/span> Very specialized item list,\n\treally, I can&#8217;t see this being worth a feat.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scribe Scroll:<\/span> Actually one of the better\n\titem creation feats, and you&#8217;ve got it anyways. Use this to create scrolls of\n\tthose really circumstantial spells that you don&#8217;t want to memorize, but may\n\treally need someday.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-feats-you-may-want-to-consider\">Other Feats you may want to consider:<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Armor Training:<\/span> Only listed to tell\n\tyou not to get this. If you use this feat you must activate it every round you\n\tcast as a swift action &#8211; so no quickened spells for you. All this for armor\n\tthat you can effectively duplicate with spells. Besides &#8211; AC isn&#8217;t your best\n\tdefense anyways.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Augment Summoning:<\/span> I love summoning, did I\n\tmention that? Augment Summoning adds a substantial bonus to your summoned\n\tcritters (+4 Str and Con), that&#8217;s 2 HP per HD, and a nice offensive boost. If\n\tyou are going to be summoning, this is worthwhile.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Strike<\/span>: God wizards don&#8217;t want this,\n\tit&#8217;s more for Gish types.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Casting:<\/span> Get a +4 to defensive\n\tcasting checks or checks to cast when grappled. You can&#8217;t get Skill Focus:\n\tConcentration anymore, since Concentration isn&#8217;t a skill &#8211; so this is really\n\tthe only feat to boost your defensive casting. Personally I avoid situations\n\twhere I would need to defensive cast like the plague, but defensive casting is\n\tharder in Pathfinder, so this may be worth the investment.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Combat Training:<\/span> Use your HD\n\tinstead of your BAB when determining your CMD. I think this is a really good\n\tchoice for any wizard.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eschew materials:<\/span> I wouldn&#8217;t jump at this\n\tfeat, but at higher levels when you start polymorphing into dragons, your\n\tcomponent pouch disappears.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Counterspell:<\/span> Counterspelling really\n\tisn&#8217;t very good most of the time, rather than ready a spell to counterspell,\n\tjust casting a spell is usually better.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Familiar:<\/span> I wouldn&#8217;t jump at this\n\tat the first opportunity, but when the 7th level critters become available,\n\tthe Mephits, Imp or Quasit are all great choices. If you take opposable\n\tthumbs, the ability to speak, and the Use Magic Device skill for example (or\n\tjust having the familiar throw the alchemists fire before you cast\n\tPyrotechnics) &#8211; opportunities abound. Be aware that you are giving up the\n\tfamiliar &#8220;bonus&#8221; you received with your old familiar.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative:<\/span> Get this. Initiative is\n\tmore important for the party Wizard than any other party member, and even more\n\timportant for battlefield control spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mounted Combat:<\/span> Specifically you want this\n\tonly if you use a phantom steed &#8211; if you do use a phantom steed, this is a\n\treally good feat to have. (Phantom steeds are squishy) For earlier levels,\n\tthis spell is really only one you want if the campaign is &#8220;horse-friendly&#8221;\n\tsince most horses will not accompany you down into the dungeon.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nimble Moves:<\/span> losing a 5&#8242; step in\n\tdifficult terrain can be bad when you are caught by a big pointy stick user.\n\tNimble Moves lets you take that important 5&#8242; step away before turning him into\n\ta newt for his impudence.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Focus:<\/span> Increases the DC by 1 for one\n\tschool. Certain schools benefit more from this feat (Enchantment, Evocation,\n\tNecromancy, Conjuration), and certain ones less (Transmutation, Abjuration,\n\tDivination). Generally, you want Spell Focus Conjuration if you want Augment\n\tSummoning, then maybe one for your specialist school, depending on the\n\tschool.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Spell Focus:<\/span> Unless you really\n\tconcentrate on one school of spell, this probably isn&#8217;t worth it. Maybe in\n\tyour specialist school, depending on what school that is.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell Mastery<\/span>: I&#8217;ve never had use of this,\n\tand the use is rather specific. If it allowed you to prepare all your spells\n\twithout a spellbook I would be all over it. Just make sure you get 2\n\tspellbooks as soon as you can. Then use spells like Secret Chest to ensure you\n\talways have access to a spellbook.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Penetration:<\/span> This is a good idea for\n\tmost wizards. A lot of battlefield control spells ignore spell resistance, and\n\tyou can always buff if SR of the enemy is a problem, nevertheless, you WILL be\n\tmaking rolls to overcome spell resistance in your career, and +2 is a nice\n\tbonus. Note that the elven racial ability stacks.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Spell Penetration:<\/span> Yet another +2,\n\tI&#8217;m less concerned with getting yet another +2, although it&#8217;s not a bad\n\tchoice.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toughness:<\/span> Classes with lower base HP\n\tbenefit more from this feat, and Wizards are no exception. Also, the deal is\n\tbest at first level, so either this or Improved Initiative (or both if you&#8217;re\n\thuman) are the best 1st level choices.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"god-got-skillz\">God got Skillz:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fly<\/span>: You are definitely going to be flying\n\tat some point, and this improves your ability to maneuver, which is a good\n\tthing.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcraft:<\/span> Kind of a staple for Wizards,\n\tused to identify spells and magic items. This is an obvious choice<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledges<\/span>: The ones that you want are\n\tArcane, Nature, Religion, and The Planes. This allows identification of the\n\tlargest number of critters. All knowledges are Int based and are decent\n\tchoices though.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Lingustics:<\/span> I recommend learning Celestial,\n\tInfernal, Abyssal, Terran, Ingan, Aurian, and Aquan if you plan to do much\n\tsummoning. Always nice to be able to give verbal commands.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Escape Artist:<\/span> If you aren&#8217;t going to take\n\tthe Defensive Combat Training feat, then you definitely want this maxed out to\n\thelp you escape grapples.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ride:<\/span> If you use Mounted Combat and\n\tPhantom Steeds, then you want this maxed out. It&#8217;s not a class skill &#8211; but\n\tthat&#8217;s OK<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception:<\/span> The most used skill in the\n\tgame. You will never be great at this, but it&#8217;s worth having nonetheless.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"favoured-class-wizard\">Favoured Class: Wizard.<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>You have a high Int score and not too many skill requirements, but your HP\n\tare tied for the lowest of any class. Don&#8217;t let D6 fool you, HP are never high\n\tenough. Put your extra into HP every time, every level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"prestige-class-options\">Prestige Class Options:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>The Question of the Scribed Spells: So when you take a PrC that gives you &#8220;+1\n\tspellcasting level&#8221; do you get the 2 free spells in your spellbook? The answer\n\tis, I think so. However, the rules are ambiguous, and there&#8217;s been no official\n\truling at this time that I&#8217;m aware of. 3.5 had the same ambiguity. If your DM\n\tsays you don&#8217;t, then PrC&#8217;s aren&#8217;t for you, just go straight wizard. Giving up\n\tyour 2 spells\/level is absolutely devastating and makes every PrC in the game\n\tan absolute powerdown. This section is only for sensible DM&#8217;s that give the 2\n\tspells\/level with PrC spellcaster level increases.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Archer:<\/span> So here&#8217;s the trick, you\n\ttake 2 levels of Arcane Archer then go back to being a Wizard. This costs you\n\tone spellcasting level, and you get the ultra-powerful &#8220;Imbue Arrow&#8221; ability.\n\tThe real power of this is you can put area spells that normally have to be\n\tcentered on the caster. Antimagic Field is the obvious an incredibly powerful\n\toption. Of course you have to take 3 feats that really aren&#8217;t of any use to\n\tyou to enter this, and you give up a caster level, all for one trick. It&#8217;s a\n\tvery nice trick though.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Trickster:<\/span> Here&#8217;s some news for you if\n\tyou hadn&#8217;t already heard it, Wizard 3\/Rogue 3 is terrible. Terrible. Terrible.\n\tYou have to endure this situation in order to enter this prestige class.\n\tThat&#8217;s the problem with hybrids, right as you qualify for the class you really\n\tsuck. For God wizards, the abilities are pretty worthless too.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eldritch Knight:<\/span> A Prestige Class for Gish\n\twizards, not god wizards.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Loremaster:<\/span> The feat requirements are\n\tpretty stiff, but that said there are some nice benefits to going this route.\n\tLore is just nice if you have lots of knowledges, and almost all the secrets\n\tare decent too (The +1 to hit does not impress). It&#8217;s not fantastic, but\n\tprobably better than straight wizard<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mystic Theurge:<\/span> If you want a\n\tCleric\/Wizard, then this is really your only option to make that viable.\n\tHowever, be aware that a Wizard 3\/Cleric 3 is an absolutely horrible\n\tmulticlass, and although it looks better when you are a Wizard 3\/Cleric\n\t3\/Mystic Theurge X, remember, you need to survive to 7th level before that\n\tever happens, and it&#8217;s really going to suck for you from levels 4 through 6\n\t(and probably a few levels after that). When you get to Cleric 3\/Wizard 3\/MT\n\t10, the build maxes out, and whatever you take for your 17th level onwards,\n\tyou will face a power decrease in comparison to the other characters again.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"equipment-choices\">Equipment Choices:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Small shield, Mithril:<\/span> Arrow deflection and\n\tSlick seem like the obvious enchantment choices here, or just use it to up\n\tyour AC.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Protection:<\/span> A staple, add a\n\tdeflection bonus to your AC. This works against touch attack too.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Sustenance:<\/span> Lets you prepare spells\n\tafter 2 hours rest (still only 1\/day). This is pretty useful for a pretty\n\tcheap ring.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ring of Wizardry<\/span>: A fairly expensive way\n\tto get extra spell slots, pearls of power are generally cheaper (and don&#8217;t\n\ttake item slots) but still very useful.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rod of Metamagic Extend, Lesser<\/span>: Yes, yes,\n\tyes &#8211; cheap and very handy for long duration buffing and of course, rope\n\ttrick.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rod of Metamagic Silent, lesser:<\/span> You&#8217;ll\n\teventually regret it if you don&#8217;t buy this. When you get targeted with\n\tsilence, draw the rod, cast a spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rod of Metamaic Quicken, lesser:<\/span> Expensive\n\tand very, very good. Your 3rd level spells you quicken are effectively 8th\n\tlevel spells. Maybe not that expensive. When you get to higher levels, being\n\table to cast twice per round is significant.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Other Metamagic Rods:<\/span> All metamagic rods\n\tare good, they are all worth the price. The one&#8217;s listed individually are\n\tmusts &#8211; but they are all good.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rod of Absorption:<\/span> A great defensive item\n\tthat will grab up the spells directed at you. Great news! You can then use\n\tthat spell energy to power your own spells! The price tag is steep, and the\n\titem only holds 50 levels of spells, but it&#8217;s worthwhile.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Scrolls:<\/span> You want a number of scrolls,\n\tbelow here I will recommend under certain spells that they make better scrolls\n\tthan memorizations. The general rule is this: spells that are really good in\n\tcertain circumstances, but the circumstance is rare and not in your control,\n\tthat makes a good scroll. An example would be &#8220;Tongues&#8221;. Also, low level\n\tscrolls are a really good deal, the higher level you go, then not so much.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Staves<\/span>: In general, staves are overpriced,\n\tif you need more castings, you are better off with Pearls of Power. That said,\n\tit&#8217;s important to note that a staff uses your Caster Level, which makes it\n\tactually useful for offensive spells. Because of the mechanics, staves that\n\thave less spells within them are a better deal. If you are getting a custom\n\tstaff &#8211; pick 2 spells that have versatile use, like a summon spell and a buff\n\tspell for example. Theme staves are cool, but they aren&#8217;t efficient use of\n\tresources.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wands:<\/span> First level wands are a great deal.\n\tFind first level spells that don&#8217;t rely too much on caster level, or save\n\tDC&#8217;s, and you may cast often, and get them as wands. Silent Image is a great\n\texample, so is protection from evil (why not have one of each? Protection from\n\tevil, good, chaos and Law?) Second level wands are an OK deal. Third and\n\tFourth level wands are overpriced.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bracers of armor:<\/span> Overrated for wizards.\n\tMage armor gives +4 Armor bonus and lasts one hour\/level. Save your money.\n\tThat said, when you get up into the upper ranges (+8 or so), if you are still\n\trelying on AC at all (your best defense won&#8217;t be armor at that point), then it\n\tmight be worthwhile.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Pearl of Power:<\/span> The first level spell\n\tversion is an incredible deal, the second level version is a pretty good deal\n\ttoo. As the levels increase, the deal gets worse. Definitely get a few level 1\n\tpearls, and eventually a couple level 2 pearls, maybe one or two level 3\n\tpearls someday. You&#8217;ll find them very handy.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Efficient Quiver:<\/span> Clearly better for Wands,\n\tRods and Staves than for Bows and Arrows. Buy all those level 1 wands and then\n\tcall them to use when you need them.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Handy Haversack:<\/span> Definitely handy. I love\n\tthis item, a great way to organize a large number of items.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of Vast Int:<\/span> Obviously your\n\theadband of choice. Really, Cha and Wis aren&#8217;t really important for you, so\n\tdon&#8217;t worry about those multiple stat boost headbands.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Belt of Incredible dexterity:<\/span> Your first\n\tchoice for a belt, eventually, you want a Con\/Dex multi boost.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glove of storing:<\/span> Store that important\n\tmetamagic rod and bring it forth as a free action. Not that you can&#8217;t afford a\n\tmove-equivalent, but you may want to use that for something else&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloak of resistance:<\/span> A staple item, and\n\tvery handy to have. Missing saving throws can really suck.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tome of clear thought:<\/span> Obviously nothing\n\tyou are getting right away, but someday&#8230;note that when and if you get Wish &#8211;\n\tit&#8217;s actually slightly cheaper to use than getting this item.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Amulet of Natural Armor:<\/span> Another staple,\n\tnaturally a good way to stack AC bonuses.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crystal Ball:<\/span> Rather than getting the 50\n\tdifferent scry spell options, get one of these instead<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Robe of the Archmagi:<\/span> Overrated. The +5 AC is\n\tbarely better than mage armor, and you likely already have spell penetration.\n\tSR is not all it cracked up to be, trust me. Leaving you with a resistance\n\tbonus. Just get a Cloak of resistance.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion-spells-and-interaction\">Illusion Spells and &#8220;Interaction&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t>A lot of Illusion spells specifically only allow a save if the illusion is\n\tinteracted with. This seems fairly self-explanatory for something like an\n\tillusionary wall. If you touch the wall, you&#8217;ve interacted with it, and\n\ttherefore get a saving throw. How about if the illusion contains sound? If you\n\tmake an illusion of a roaring dragon, does hearing the roar constitute\n\tinteraction? This is when the rules become vague.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>I&#8217;m not aware of any Pathfinder Specific clarification, but Skip Williams did\n\tdo a clarification for 3.5 that makes a lot of sense, and I would recommend\n\tthat using Pathfinder, the same guidelines be used. (The article in question\n\thas been lost to time, sadly)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>To sum up, he says that a saving throw for an illusion that requires\n\tinteraction to provide a saving throw, should require either touching or\n\tstudying the illusion, and that should, under most circumstances, require an\n\taction. So for the Dragon example, if a character is to use a standard action\n\tto either study the image, or carefully listen to the roar, or carefully smell\n\tthe dragon&#8217;s stench, etc, then a saving throw is received. Just hearing the\n\troar by itself however, does not constitute &#8220;interaction&#8221;.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>This definition makes sense, and is as close to official as I think we can\n\thope for, so my ratings will assume that your DM uses this criteria. It never\n\thurts to check though, or at least make sure your DM gets a link to the\n\tarticle.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0level-wizard-spells-cantrips\">0-Level Wizard Spells (Cantrips)<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resistance<\/span>: Subject gains +1 on saving\n\tthrows. The bonus is resistance, so stacks with almost nothing, but at very\n\tlow levels you can technically cast this on everyone every minute (though it&#8217;s\n\tdefinitely going to slow you down)<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Acid Splash<\/a>: Succeed on an attack roll and do\n\tpretty much nothing!

In most circumstances, probably worse than a\n\tcrossbow bolt.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Magic:<\/a>Highly useful spell at any level.\n\tNice to have this as an unlimited cast.

The duration is short though.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Flare:<\/span> Dazzles one creature, and that&#8217;s not\n\tworth an action even if there was no saving throw, but there is.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Light:<\/span> Replaces the need for a torch. Cast\n\tit on something light and movable.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Ray of Frost:<\/a> Terrible spell that delivers\n\tinconsequential damage to a single creature if you hit. For some reason, the\n\talready crappy 3.5 version got nerfed?<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Ghost Sound:<\/a>Create illusionary sounds. Very\n\thandy.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Bleed:<\/span> If this is better than it sounds, let\n\tme know. Sounds terrible.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Disrupt Undead:<\/a> Very, very, circumstantially\n\tmediocre at low levels.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Touch of Fatigue:<\/a> Touch attack that will make the\n\ttarget likely smack you hard in vengeance<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Mage Hand:<\/a> Moderately handy telekinesis\n\tability<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mending:<\/span>Occasionally handy, repairs items,\n\teven damaged magic ones.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Message:<\/span> Also occasionally handy way to\n\tcommunicate at a moderate range with whispering<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Open\/Close:<\/span>If you have no party\n\ttrapfinder, this is a must, otherwise, circumstantially handy<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"universal\">Universal<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Mark:<\/a> Sign an item with your own personal\n\tsignature. I&#8217;m not sure what practical use that is.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prestidigitation:<\/span>Performs all kinds of\n\tlittle minor magics, including moving around the very light item you cast\n\tlight on. Handy and versatile.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1stlevel-wizard-spells\">1st-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alarm<\/span>: When you are high enough level to\n\tmake this spell worthwhile (4th level or higher), the immeasurably superior\n\trope trick is available. However, this is handy in conjunction with rope trick\n\t(cast it on the rope).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Endure Elements<\/a>: Circumstantial at best, it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t provide any statistical energy resistance, but useful in very hot or\n\tcold climates.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Hold Portal<\/a>: I like this spell for blocking off\n\ta retreat in a hurry, but in all, this is a highly circumstantial spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Protection from Chaos\/Evil\/Good\/Law<\/a>: Massively\n\tuseful spell that makes you immune to mental control (great as a &#8220;at need&#8221;\n\tspell to cast on allies under mental control to give them another save at +2),\n\tand also makes it so summoned creatures can&#8217;t touch you (considering they\n\talmost exclusively rely on natural attacks &#8211; this is good). A +2 deflection\n\tbonus is just gravy.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield<\/span>: Short duration +4 shield bonus to\n\tAC. Not great, but it stacks with Mage Armor and any of the other common armor\n\tbonuses a Wizard can get. Generally, buffing AC isn&#8217;t a wizards best defense,\n\tbut still OK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Grease<\/span>: Very nice battlefield control. No\n\tSR and targets Ref or fall prone. Whether you save or not doesn&#8217;t prevent you\n\tfrom hindered movement or being flat-footed while moving. This also blocks\n\tpotential charges instantly. I even occasionally use this at higher levels.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Mage Armor<\/a>: A standard that grants +4 Armor bonus\n\tfor a long duration. It&#8217;s not self only, so buff up your allies as well\n\t(doesn&#8217;t stack with Armor though)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Mount<\/span>: Works as advertised, and the\n\tcreative can come up with more uses for this spell. A quick getaway, cover in\n\tcombat, you get the idea.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Obscuring Mist<\/a>: A useful quick defense that\n\tblocks vision past 5&#8242;. A good defensive cover when doing spells that don&#8217;t\n\trequire you to see your opponent &#8211; like summon spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Summon Monster I<\/a>: I love summoning, but when you\n\tget this spell at low level, the duration is a problem, when your level\n\tincreases, it becomes a fair bit underpowered since the creatures themselves\n\tdo not scale with caster level. The Riding Dog is pretty tough, and may have\n\tuse for mid-levels &#8211; though the SMIII list has creatures a fair bit\n\ttougher.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Unseen Servant<\/a>: Reasonably useful telekinesis\n\tspell that lasts a long time. Use it to carry your stuff, or make sure that\n\tother wand is really handy, or to massage your back after a long day of\n\tputting down the fighter.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Comprehend Languages<\/a>: Always worth a spot in the\n\tspellbook, but only circumstantial on the memorization list.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Detect Secret Doors<\/a>: Not a fan of using a spell for\n\tthis. Very short duration is the killer. If I could have it up for a long\n\ttime, I would like it much better.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Undead<\/a>: The Range on this is really too\n\tshort to use it for much besides detecting invisible undead or undead behind\n\tthe next door.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Identify<\/span>: Spellbook? Yes. Memorize? No.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">True Strike<\/a>: Your attacks are pretty much all\n\ttouch attacks, and if your chance to hit isn&#8217;t good with that, then don&#8217;t cast\n\ttouch attacks.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Charm Person<\/a>: Save or lose that only works on\n\thumanoids. That said, a failed save ends a battle before it starts. Worth one\n\tmemorization.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Hypnotism<\/span>: Fascinate is not a terrific\n\tcondition, I&#8217;m just not sure of many uses for this, never mind the HD\n\tlimit.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleep<\/span>: Probably the best 1st level spell\n\twhen you are first level. Once you get to level 5, it&#8217;s not worth the space in\n\tyour spellbook.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Burning Hands<\/a>:&gt;Blast only spell that has an\n\tarea of effect, but you have to get really close. For a first level blast, it\n\tdoes what it should.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Floating Disk<\/a>: Holds a great deal of weight and\n\tkeeps it handy to use for a good duration. Not fantastic, but OK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Missile<\/a>: A standard, but a pure blast that\n\tdoesn&#8217;t do great damage.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Shocking Grasp<\/a>: Horrible spell that requires a\n\ttouch attack for so-so damage.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Color Spray<\/a>: Almost as good as sleep at first\n\tlevel, but remains useful much longer.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise Self<\/a>: Not something most wizards will\n\twant or need, but circumstantially useful.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-red\">Magic Aura<\/a>: Stupidly circumstantial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Silent Image<\/a>: Remains useful to level 20. Gives no\n\tsave unless the illusion is interacted with. Makes a great spell or wand.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Ventriloquism<\/span>: Probably circumstantially\n\tuseful, but ghost sound will serve 90% of the time.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Cause Fear<\/a>: Decent debuff at level 1, but\n\tdoesn&#8217;t last.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Chill Touch<\/a>: Touch attack that makes the victim\n\tangry with you, and lightly damaged<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Ray of Enfeeblement<\/a>: In 3.5 a great spell, but\n\tnerfed to the point that it simply isn&#8217;t worth casting anymore.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Animate Rope<\/a>: Crazy circumstantial, and I can&#8217;t\n\tthink of many of those circumstances.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Enlarge Person<\/a>: Very nice buff for that Big\n\tStupid Fighter so he can be Bigger stupid fighter.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Erase<\/span>: Really pointless spell. Never worth\n\tmemorizing that I can see<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Expeditious Retreat<\/a>: Situationally helpful,\n\tthough generally I prefer Mount which will perform a similar function, but\n\tprovide more options<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Feather Fall<\/a>: Circumstantial, but a lifesaver\n\twhen you need it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Jump<\/span>: Bonus to acrobatics. I just don&#8217;t see\n\tthe point.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Weapon<\/a>: Give a weapon a +1 bonus. It does\n\tallow that weapon to bypass DR\/Magic. The duration isn&#8217;t great though<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Reduce Person<\/a>: Actually a not-terrible buff for\n\tyourself, improve your &#8220;to hit&#8221; and your &#8220;AC&#8221;, not bad for non-str based melee\n\ttypes (like rogues) as well. Note that cast on a small creature it makes them\n\ttiny, which may have uses, but prevents them from threatening adjacent\n\tsquares.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2ndlevel-wizard-spells\">2nd-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Lock<\/a>: Certainly more versatile than Hold\n\tPortal, but I can&#8217;t think of many circumstances where this is all that\n\tuseful<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Obscure Object<\/a>: Super Circumstantial.\n\tPotentially worth a spot in your spellbook, but usually not worth\n\tmemorizing.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Protection from Arrows<\/a>: OK protection at low\n\tlevels vs. ranged attacks, but once attacks are nearly exclusively magical,\n\tuseless.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Resist Energy<\/a>: I actually consider this the best\n\tof the energy protection spells for its level. It improves with level as\n\twell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Acid Arrow<\/a>: An insult to conjuration spells. So\n\tsadly, some people still consider this spell a staple. WHY???<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Fog Cloud<\/a>: I like fogs and clouds, though not\n\tTHAT much better than obscuring mist, and worth waiting for stinking cloud\n\tnext level<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Glitterdust<\/span>: Nerfed from 3.5 but still a\n\tgood spell. Does an area blindness (Will save), and reveals invisible\n\tcreatures. The Nerf is the save every round now provided.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Summon Monster II<\/a>: I&#8217;m not a big fan of most of\n\tthis list, I think it&#8217;s worth waiting one more level&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Summon Swarm<\/a>: Summon a swarm for some very\n\tmoderate damage, but you can block vision and other effects. Not great, but\n\tOK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Web<\/span>: Some aspects nerfed, but still really\n\tgood, the required anchor points make it a bit circumstantial, but otherwise,\n\tjust a really awesome battlefield control.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\"\n\t\t>Detect&lt;\/span &gt;<a class=\"rating-orange\"> Thoughts<\/a>: Invasive\n\t\ttelepathy. Only detects surface thoughts. It can also detect the presence of\n\t\tothers by detecting their thoughts. Not a bad spell.<\/span\n\t><\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Locate Object<\/a>: Circumstantial, but you&#8217;ll never\n\tlose your car keys again. Seriously, maybe worth a spot in your book, but I\n\twouldn&#8217;t pay for it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">See Invisibility<\/a>: Better at detecting the invisible\n\tthan Glitterdust, but not so much better that it makes up for losing a mass\n\tblinding effect. Take Glitterdust instead.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Daze Monster<\/a>: Make a creature of up to 6HD miss one\n\taction if it fails a saving throw. Yep, sounds just as bad as it is.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Hideous Laughter<\/a>: Compare this to Daze Monster,\n\tlonger duration, and no HD limit. Creatures of different &#8220;type&#8221; get enough of\n\ta bonus to save that this spell probably isn&#8217;t worth it for them.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Touch of Idiocy<\/a>: Leave this one to Aberrant\n\tSorcerers. Touch attacks aren&#8217;t for you. If you like using familiars to\n\tdeliver touch attacks, then this is a decent debuff on enemy casters.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Continual Flame<\/a>: Make your own everburning\n\ttorch&#8230;that&#8217;s it. They aren&#8217;t even expensive. I guess you could cast it on\n\tyour head and be &#8220;Firestorm&#8221;&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Darkness<\/span>: If you don&#8217;t have darkvision,\n\tthis is red, if you do, this is probably green. Used similarly to Fog Cloud,\n\tbut with the darkvision factor.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Flaming Sphere<\/a>: Not a huge fan of blasting, but\n\tif you are going to blast, this is a pretty good one. Direct it to move around\n\twhile you keep on casting.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Gust of Wind<\/a>: Better than it sounds, because it\n\tblows away fog spells (there are quite a few) in one round. Also used as minor\n\tbattlefield control (especially good against Swarms). Circumstantial\n\tanyways.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Scorching Ray<\/a>: Mediocre blast spell. Requires a\n\tto hit roll. Not nearly as good as WAY too many people think.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shatter<\/span>: Fairly circumstantial, but I&#8217;ve\n\tseen it used to good effect on a spell component pouch. I guess innovation is\n\tthe key.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blur<\/span>: Makes you immune to sneak attacks\n\tand gives a 20% miss chance. Cast this on the rogue to give him the equivalent\n\tof Hide in Plain Sight.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Hypnotic Pattern<\/a>: More fascination. Still not\n\timpressed.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility<\/span>: We all know the use of\n\tinvisibility right? Also keep in mind that most battlefield controls, and all\n\tbuffs DO NOT end invisibility, meaning that to a large degree, this is just\n\tbetter than the &#8220;greater&#8221; version for the improved duration.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Magic Mouth<\/a>: If there is a great use for this\n\tspell, I don&#8217;t know it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Minor Image<\/a>: Give your Silent Image sound, which\n\tis a bit redundant if you already have silent image, however, it gives some\n\tgreater versatility, so it&#8217;s still a good spell. See the section on\n\t&#8220;interaction with illusions&#8221; at the beginning of the spell section.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Mirror Image<\/a>: Really effective defensive self\n\tbuff. The miss chance of attacks starts much higher than 50% and gradually\n\treduces.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Misdirection<\/span>:&gt; Very circumstantial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Phantom Trap<\/a>: Probably some great use for this\n\tspell I haven&#8217;t considered, but most traps aren&#8217;t avoided, they&#8217;re tripped or\n\tdisarmed.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blindness\/Deafness<\/span>: Blind a single subject\n\twith a failed Fort save (permanent). Circumstantially better than Glitterdust.\n\tSave or lose.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Command Undead<\/a>: More accurately this could be\n\ttermed &#8220;Charm&#8221; undead, since the mechanics follow Charm mechanics. In undead\n\theavy campaigns, decent.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">False Life<\/a>: Self only buff that gives a long\n\tduration buff to temporary HP (will eventually always be 10). Not a huge buff,\n\tbut OK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Ghoul Touch<\/a>: Beware Aberrant Sorcerers, Wizards who\n\tdeliver this spell either don&#8217;t value their familiar, or are too close.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Scare<\/span>: Not much better than Cause Fear (2 HD\n\tboost) considering the extra level<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Spectral Hand<\/a>: Delivers those touch attacks,\n\tincreasing the rating of all those attacks. However, spending the standard\n\taction to cast this is painful.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Alter Self<\/a>: Self only buff usable for potential\n\tdisguise, and for a very small Str or Dex buff (but stackable). More\n\tsignificantly, you can get Darkvision, Low light vision, Scent, or a Swim\n\tspeed for 1 min\/level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Bear&#8217;s Endurance<\/a>: Provides some quick HP and\n\tFort save bonus, but doesn&#8217;t stack with most Con boosters.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Bull&#8217;s Strength<\/a>: The subject who needs this will\n\tbenefit at low levels, but since it doesn&#8217;t stack with most Str boosts, it\n\twill eventually be pretty useless.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-orange\">Cat&#8217;s Grace<\/a>:&gt; As Bull&#8217;s strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Darkvision<\/span>: Darkvision 60&#8242; for 1\n\thour\/level. Mainly of use if you like Darkness Spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-orange\">Eagle&#8217;s Splendor<\/a>: See Bull&#8217;s Strength<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-orange\">Fox&#8217;s Cunning<\/a>:&gt; See Bull&#8217;s Strength<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knock<\/span>: I don&#8217;t really recommend this for\n\tmemorization, but it makes a great wand. Well worth the price.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Levitate<\/span>: Cast on yourself at low levels,\n\tthis is one of the best defensive spells there is. Trumped by Fly, still,\n\tworth getting and memorizing until mid-level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Make Whole<\/a>: A more powerful version of mending,\n\tcan repair broken magic items (some). Very nice when you need it but\n\tcircumstantial. In the spellbook or keep it as a scroll, not to be regularly\n\tmemorized for sure.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Owl&#8217;s Wisdom<\/a>: See all the other Enhancement\n\tbonus spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Pyrotechnics<\/span>: You need a source of fire,\n\tbut when you have that, this is a great debuff and battlefield control\n\tspell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Rope Trick<\/a>: Would be a wand spell except caster\n\tlevel is important. Becomes the standard &#8220;camping&#8221; spell, though I&#8217;ve used it\n\tfor quick escape too. Note that there is a nerf where you can no longer lift\n\tup the rope. This is significant, but it doesn&#8217;t ruin the spell &#8211; it does,\n\thowever, require you to have guard duty.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Spider Climb<\/a>: Should not be a second level spell.\n\tIn most cases, levitate is much better.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Whispering Wind<\/a>: Used for sending messages over\n\ta distance, but has a few limiting factors, for one, you choose a location\n\trather than an individual to send your message, also, the range is 1\n\tmile\/level, so distance communication, but not LONG distance.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3rdlevel-wizard-spells\">3rd-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Dispel Magic<\/a>: Heavily nerfed from 3.5, however,\n\tnote that this spell no longer becomes useless at high level, it&#8217;s\n\tconsistently mediocre across the levels.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Explosive Runes<\/a>: Now the highly circumstantial\n\tspell it was meant to be, since the massively stupid &#8220;hand grenade&#8221; use has\n\tbeen nerfed (THANK YOU).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Magic Circle against Chaos\/Evil\/Good\/Law<\/a>: Good\n\tduration protection that makes you and your allies all but immune to the\n\tenchantment school.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Nondetection<\/span>: I&#8217;m not big on using spells to\n\tprotect you from the possibility of being scryed. It&#8217;s pretty circumstantial\n\tto be using a valuable memorization slot on.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Protection from Energy<\/a>: Honestly, I&#8217;m a bigger fan\n\tof energy resistance than this spell, and it is lower level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Phantom Steed<\/a>: Very nice maneuverability spell\n\tthat will eventually be your preferred movement source all day every day. Cast\n\tit for your allies too.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Sepia Snake Sigil<\/a>: Prevent others from reading your\n\tstuff. If that&#8217;s a problem.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Sleet Storm<\/a>: Great Battlefield Control spell that\n\thinders movement (and can prevent it) and vision. The area is huge, the range\n\tis great, what&#8217;s not to love?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Stinking Cloud<\/a>: Devastating Debuff and the value\n\tof a fog cloud on top of that. Creates the Nauseated status on a group of\n\tenemies (Nauseated is pretty bad). Targets Fort.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Monster III<\/a>: One of the best Summon Spells\n\tfor the Level. For combat summoning look at the Leopard, Cheetah or Wolverine,\n\tall are similar but have their unique advantages (Leopard for pounce, Cheetah\n\tfor sprint and trip, Wolverine for more HP when using Rage), Dire Bats for a\n\tflying steed or Blindsense, The Dretch can create stinking clouds and scare\n\teffects&#8230;just a really good spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Sight<\/a>: Detect magic with longer range and\n\tdoesn&#8217;t require concentration. I don&#8217;t know if a pumped up cantrip is worth a\n\t3rd level slot thanks.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clairaudience\/Clairvoyance<\/span>: We begin the\n\tvarious scry options. This one is quite limited, but lets you know what&#8217;s\n\tbehind the door.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tongues<\/span>: Circumstantial, so this is a\n\tscroll, and that should cover you.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Deep Slumber<\/a>: A HD bump from 1st level sleep (up\n\tto 10 HD) Maybe OK when you first get it, but it won&#8217;t last.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heroism<\/span>: A fairly minor buff, but it lasts\n\ta decent duration and stacks with most things.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Hold Person<\/a>: Only works on humanoids, but can\n\treally mess you up. I have to point out that Glitterdust affects multiple\n\tcreatures, and although blindness isn&#8217;t as good as paralyzed, it&#8217;s still\n\tpretty good, and a level lower, and isn&#8217;t restricted to humanoids&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Rage<\/span>: Awful &#8220;buff&#8221; that delivers a double\n\tedged sword to allies. The bonuses are small, and you need to concentrate\n\ttoo.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Suggestion<\/span>: Similar to a Charm effect,\n\tbasically convince a creature to do one thing. Note that communication is\n\tnecessary. Creativity helps with this spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Daylight<\/span>: A pumped up light spell that\n\tgives 60&#8242; illumination. I would recommend Darkvision instead myself.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fireball<\/span>: The staple blast spell. It&#8217;s not\n\tterrible for a blast, but not nearly as impressive as advertised.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Lightning Bolt<\/a>: Take fireball, remove the nice\n\trange, make the shape less helpful (except in long straight hallways) and make\n\tit electricity and you have this spell. Sold?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Tiny Hut<\/a>: Not really the &#8220;environment protection&#8221;\n\tspell advertised, more often it&#8217;s a combat spell used to give you and close\n\tallies the ability to look out, but enemies can&#8217;t see in. Nice defensive\n\tspell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Wind Wall<\/a>: A very nice defensive spell that\n\tprotects against nasties like Cloudkill, arrows, gaseous breath weapons, and\n\tthe like.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Displacement<\/span>: Short duration defensive\n\tbuff. Really, I recommend saving a spell level and using mirror image\n\tinstead.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Illusory Script<\/a>: Give your sepia snake sigil\n\tcompany, and make your books really hard to read. Hooray.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Invisibility Sphere<\/a>: Not better than individual\n\tinvisibility spells, but if you have a lot of people to hide, then OK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Major Image<\/a>: Like Minor image except you can\n\tinclude smell and thermal illusions. It seems to me that this is a pretty\n\tsmall addition for a spell level. Sight and Sound are the primary senses after\n\tall.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Gentle Repose<\/a>: Works exactly as advertised. If\n\tyou&#8217;ve got use for that, then this is better than I&#8217;ve rated it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Halt Undead<\/a>: Like hold person for Undead, but\n\taffects multiple targets, who don&#8217;t get additional saves, making this spell\n\tpretty good. Zombies and other unintelligent undead get no save. Wasn&#8217;t this\n\tgood until Pathfinder when Coup de Gras on Undead became an option.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Ray of Exhaustion<\/a>: With a to hit roll, the target\n\tmakes a Fort save or becomes exhausted. The key here is the partial effect. If\n\tthe opponent makes their save they become fatigued, if they are already\n\tfatigued they become exhausted. So, hitting someone twice ensures automatic\n\texhaustion. Not bad. Exhaustion is excellent against certain creatures, pretty\n\tgood against others. Cast on the very weak to take advantage of encumbrance\n\trules, or big strong thugs to soften them up.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Vampiric Touch<\/a>: Do damage to gain temp HP. You\n\tneed to make a touch attack to do this which isn&#8217;t so nice, and the damage is\n\t1d6\/2 levels, which isn&#8217;t that much. The &#8220;no save&#8221; part is the only real\n\tselling feature.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Beast Shape I<\/a>: Turn into an animal. Most of the\n\tabilities you can grant yourself you can get with Alter Self. (Fly being the\n\tonly exception), so unless you have some crazy desire to be a dog, much better\n\tto have Alter Self and Fly at the ready. Note that animals can&#8217;t cast\n\tspells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Blink<\/span>: A defensive &#8220;buff&#8221; that you really\n\tshould skip, offering as much negative as positive. The one use is to walk\n\tthrough walls, though this is far from foolproof.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Flame Arrow<\/a>: Not worth it as a way to &#8220;buff&#8221; the\n\tarcher&#8217;s ammunition, since 1d6 per arrow isn&#8217;t going to add up to much. Now if\n\tyou have 50 archers, each with one arrow knocked&#8230;sound circumstantial?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fly<\/span>: Fly for 1 min\/level. Note that the fly\n\tskill is not a requirement to use this spell, but does help with\n\tmaneuverability. The use of this is obvious right?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Gaseous Form<\/a>: Glide under doorways, and float\n\tover walls. You won&#8217;t be casting in this form, though it does offer you\n\tprotection as well. Utility only, occasionally useful until superior ethereal\n\teffects become available.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haste<\/span>: One of your jobs is to buff your\n\tallies, and this is probably the best buff for its level in the game. Give all\n\tyour allies an extra attack on full attack actions, and a small bonus to AC\n\tand Ref saves (that stacks with everything), and 30 feet of extra movement.\n\tVery solid, capable of turning the tide in a battle.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Keen Edge<\/a>: Does not stack with Improved Critical,\n\tbut doubles the threat range of a single weapon. Compare this to Haste one\n\tabove. Yep, it sucks.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Magic Weapon, Greater<\/a>: Gives weapon an\n\tenhancement bonus that increases with level. The duration of this spell is\n\tgreat, so it can be a beginning of the day buff for the Big Stupid Fighter&#8217;s\n\tpointy stick. I wouldn&#8217;t jump on this at 5th level, but as a later level\n\tspell, it&#8217;s worth a slot.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Secret Page<\/a>: Why do they keep reading my stuff? Mix\n\tthis with Sepia Snake Sigil and Illusionary Script and your diary is really,\n\treally safe.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Shrink Item<\/a>: Better than it sounds. Want that\n\tobsidian statue in the dungeon? Shrink it, fold it up, and throw it in your\n\tpocket. Need a siege engine? Pull the Trebuchet out of your pocket, unfold it,\n\tand throw it on the ground&#8230;ALAKAZAM! Big Stupid Fighter dead? Shrink his\n\tcorpse down and throw him in your pocket. This spell has all kinds of uses.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slow<\/span>: As good a debuff as Haste is a buff.\n\tGranted the enemies get a saving throw (Will), but if they fail, they are all\n\tstaggered (and more). More selective a debuff than Stinking Cloud, and targets\n\tWill instead of Fort, but the two spells do have similar effects (though\n\tStaggered isn&#8217;t quite as good as Nauseated).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Water Breathing<\/a>: Super circumstantial.\n\tPotentially worth a spot in your spellbook, but only memorized if you know you\n\tneed it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4thlevel-wizard-spells\">4th-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Anchor<\/a>: A solid debuff against\n\tdemons and devils (who teleport all over the place), this offers no save, and\n\tcompletely prevents all kinds of &#8220;popping around&#8221;. It requires a ranged touch\n\tattack. It&#8217;s a bit circumstantial &#8211; but great in that circumstance. A scroll\n\tor two might suffice though.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Fire Trap<\/a>: Trap an object so someone who opens it\n\tgets a mild burn. Apply cold water to the area and you should be fine.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser<\/a>: Spend a standard\n\taction at the beginning of combat to protect yourself from the weakest spells.\n\tNot worth it most of the time.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Remove Curse<\/a>: Super circumstantial spell, let the\n\tCleric memorize it as needed.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Stoneskin<\/span>: A pretty solid defensive buff, but\n\tcosts you 250 gp per casting. My suggestion is to avoid spells with costly\n\tmaterial components.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Black Tentacles<\/a>: Also known as &#8220;win the fight&#8221;.\n\tThe obvious downside of this spell is you steal the thunder from the teammates\n\twho now only have to clean up some grappled foes. Not as tough as 3.5 as the\n\tgrapple is harder to land, but still should be an absolute combat winner a lot\n\tof the time, at the worst, it will give you a significant tactical advantage.\n\tFair size, no save, no SR. Devastates casters of all types.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Dimension Door<\/a>: Short range teleport which you\n\tcan take allies along. This turns out to be all kinds of useful in gameplay.\n\tUse it to circumvent the battlefield controls of your enemies. It works quite\n\teffectively. Note that it is verbal component only, so escape grapples&#8230;heck,\n\tyou can even escape the spell listed one above.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Minor Creation<\/a>: If anyone has found a great use for\n\tthis, (beyond &#8220;make stuff and sell it for profit&#8221;), please let me know.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Secure Shelter<\/a>: Intended for use as a &#8220;camping&#8221;\n\tshelter. Has some advantages\/disadvantages compared to Rope Trick. Because of\n\tthe lower level, I would recommend the latter in general.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Solid Fog<\/a>: Nerfed from 3.5 to the point that I\n\treally need to direct you to Sleet Storm one level earlier, to achieve a\n\tpretty much superior effect. Solid Fog was once stupidly broken, now it&#8217;s\n\tunderpowered.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Monster IV<\/a>: Dire Apes, and Rhinos are nasty\n\tbeasts, and Dire Wolves are great trippers and tough on top. Mephits offer a\n\tnumber of minor magical effects, nothing earth-shattering, but it does offer\n\tsome versatility. One of the better Summon Monster spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Eye<\/a>: We used to call this spell &#8220;Wizard\n\teye&#8221; back in the day (when we walked to school in the driving snow, uphill\n\tboth ways). It&#8217;s a lot like Clairvoyance except you can move it around, which\n\tis handy. Not for every wizard, but if Divination is your thing, this is a\n\tgood way to scout out a dungeon level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect<\/span><a class=\"rating-red\"> Scrying<\/a>:\n\tSuper Circumstantial, and doesn&#8217;t actually prevent scrying.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Locate Creature<\/a>: Moderately useful spell that\n\tallows you to locate one subject. I&#8217;ve used this to track enemies using\n\tDimension Door to attempt retreat.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scrying<\/span>: Spies on subject from a distance.\n\tAllows you to use your special vision types. Diviners want this staple spell,\n\tother Wizards will wait for a crystal ball.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Charm Monster<\/a>: Removes the &#8220;humanoid&#8221;\n\trestriction from Charm Person. Enchantment specialists will want this, other\n\twizards probably aren&#8217;t going to get enough use for the level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Confusion<\/span>: Massively useful debuff that can\n\thave all the enemies attacking each other. Only really useful for large groups\n\tof enemies, but really messes them up bad. The key here is that a confused\n\tcreature who is attacked, will automatically attack back. Therefore, you only\n\tneed a couple enemies to randomly attack their allies before they are all\n\tattacking each other exclusively. You then pull out the popcorn and watch the\n\tshow.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Crushing Despair<\/a>: Fairly minor debuff that offers a\n\tsave. The range sucks, it is a small cone size, and yeah, skip it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Geas, Lesser<\/a>: Kind of like a dominate for a\n\tsingle command. The HD limit on this significantly limits its power.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Fire Shield<\/a>: Not a bad protection spell, but for 1\n\tround\/level and only you as the subject, this does not offer nearly enough.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Ice Storm<\/a>: A multi threat spell, it does 5d6\n\tdamage (not great) and makes the terrain hindered (so-so) and provides\n\tperception penalties. Overall, not terrible.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Resilient Sphere<\/a>: Kind of an interesting spell\n\tthat can trap an enemy (who fails a save) or protect yourself or an ally\n\t(though you effectively remove yourself from combat).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Shout<\/span>: Does so-so damage at close range and\n\tpotentially deafens (a mediocre status effect). Not very good.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Wall of Fire<\/a>: The damage wall of fire does is\n\tpretty sad. It is big, so if you are taking on legions of wimps, it&#8217;s good,\n\tbut for the average wizard, skip it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Wall of Ice<\/a>: Creates a solid wall that can trap\n\tor separate foes. It can be broken, but this requires some form of attack, and\n\tyou still take damage going through (not much). A pretty good battlefield\n\tcontrol. The level 5 Wall of Stone is significantly better.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Hallucinatory Terrain<\/a>: Probably useful if you are\n\tmore creative than me. Did I say probably? I mean possibly.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Illusory Wall<\/a>: Creates an illusionary wall.\n\tUnlike Silent Image &#8211; creatures (other than you) who successfully disbelieve\n\tstill cannot see through it (but they can then travel through it), so the\n\tpurpose is to create a barrier that you can see through and they can&#8217;t,\n\tregardless of their saving throw. Silent Image doesn&#8217;t do this trick quite as\n\twell, and requires concentration, but is also significantly lower level, and\n\tyou can have your allies see through a silent image. Not terrible, and worthy\n\tof independent consideration.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Invisibility, Greater<\/a>: A very short duration\n\tinvisibility that lets you attack. Generally, I think this is a poor upgrade,\n\tto the point I&#8217;m not sure it even is an upgrade. I&#8217;ve had a couple comments\n\tthat this is a good buff for a party Rogue who can&#8217;t get in Sneak Attack\n\tposition otherwise, and for that purpose, I think it could be OK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Phantasmal Killer<\/a>: Save or die, or to be more\n\taccurate, save or save again. If you love save or die, this is your first\n\tchoice. I don&#8217;t.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Rainbow Pattern<\/a>: The problem with fascinating\n\tcreatures isn&#8217;t the HD limit, it&#8217;s that fascinate is pretty circumstantially\n\tuseful. This spell doesn&#8217;t change that.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Shadow Conjuration<\/a>: The 20% real thing is\n\tpainful, but there are certain spells (like phantom steed) that should still\n\toperate fairly close to expectations. Is that worth a 4th level spell? Not in\n\tmy opinion.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Animate Dead<\/a>: Zombies and Skeletons won&#8217;t do\n\tmuch good in combat at this level, and are likely to slow you down. They can\n\tserve as pack animals though, and can still block squares in combat that can\n\tgive you some defensive advantage. Not too bad. Memorize only as needed\n\tthough.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Bestow Curse<\/a>: A single target debuff that requires\n\ta touch attack, grants a save, and allows SR. So at this point, it doesn&#8217;t\n\tmatter how good the debuff is.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Contagion<\/span>: In 99% of cases, this spell comes\n\tinto effect WAY too slow to be of use, so instead it is an out of combat spell\n\tthat is super circumstantial.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Enervation<\/span>: Give the target 1d4 negative\n\tlevels with no save (ranged touch attack required), these negative levels\n\tstack. A pretty solid debuff, especially good against single super-tough\n\ttargets.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fear<\/span>: Much improved over Scare, Fear has no\n\tHD limit and affects a large area. A decent way to separate the enemy (those\n\twho save and those who don&#8217;t). Those who save are shaken for a round, not a\n\thuge effect, but worth mentioning.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Beast Shape II<\/a>: Combat-oriented Druids will be\n\thappy to get pounce and trip abilities of the form taken, for wizards, the\n\tonly real use is going to be utility, and not too much that you can&#8217;t already\n\tdo with lower level spells. Giving up spellcasting to change form really hurts\n\ttoo.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Body I<\/a>: First, check with your DM. If\n\tI was your DM I would say that an elemental doesn&#8217;t have the manual dexterity\n\tto be performing semantic components to spells, but if your DM has a different\n\topinion, then these Elemental line of spells just got a lot better. Again,\n\tdon&#8217;t be thinking this makes you tough. However, earth glide could be a useful\n\t(you can&#8217;t take the rest of the party though). Other minor utility abilities\n\tas well, though if you summon, you can get an elemental to do this stuff for\n\tyou without giving up spellcasting to do it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Enlarge Person, Mass<\/a>: Your value in this will\n\tdepend on the amount of party members who benefit from being enlarged. In a\n\tlot of groups, that will be one character, in these cases, this is pointless,\n\tI would say unless you have 3 or more, it&#8217;s not going to be worth it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Mnemonic Enhancer<\/a>: In general, you are better to\n\tprepare a 4th level spell than be able to recover a 3rd level spell.\n\tMemorizing 3 1st level spells instead of one 4th level spell is also, in most\n\tcases, inferior too. Circumstances will come up where that isn&#8217;t the case, for\n\tthe most part I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with saying you can skip this.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Reduce Person, Mass<\/a>: I can think of circumstances\n\twhere this would be handy. Perhaps in a small cave where otherwise you must\n\thunch over or crawl. Not something you are going to need more than once in a\n\tcampaign though. Skip it, and maybe get a scroll instead.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Stone Shape<\/a>: Utility spell, the most obvious use\n\tI can think of is to make the opening in a stone wall, but I can think of some\n\tothers too right off the top of my head. (Create cover from the stone floor,\n\tclose in something you want to keep safe and hidden&#8230;etc)<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5thlevel-wizard-spells\">5th-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Break Enchantment<\/a>: Not something you ever want\n\tto prepare. One minute casting time means this is NOT an in combat spell. OK\n\tfor the spellbook at need though.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Dismissal<\/span>: Clerics get this as a 4th level\n\tspell, so if possible, leave this to them. Otherwise, this is basically a save\n\tor lose vs. extradimensional creatures only.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Mage&#8217;s Private Sanctum<\/a>: A very effective spell\n\tto ensure privacy, though the need for said privacy is probably\n\tcircumstantial. Note that this spell does not provide invisibility to those in\n\tthe area, so not really a camping spell. Also, it&#8217;s a 10 minute spell, so not\n\tan in-combat spell. However, I could see using it as a defensive spell if you\n\thave preparation time (use similar to tiny hut).<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloudkill<\/span>: Mainly a debuff to do some Con\n\tdamage to opponents. The primary selling feature is they still take some Con\n\tdamage even if they make their Fort save. The cloud moves, which occasionally\n\tis advantageous, and quite often a disadvantage, though it does give some\n\tversatility in regards to other fog spells. Poison immune creatures aren&#8217;t\n\thurt by the cloudkill, which does hurt, since as you increase levels, poison\n\timmunity becomes more common. Overall, it sounds good, but it&#8217;s often\n\tdifficult to get your money&#8217;s worth from this.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Mage&#8217;s Faithful Hound<\/a>: Very similar to the 1st\n\tlevel alarm spell except it delivers a minor bite attack vs. intruders. If\n\tthis spell was second level, I would consider it OK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Major Creation<\/a>: Like Minor Creation, I haven&#8217;t\n\treally come up with any really useful ways to use this spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Planar Binding, Lesser<\/a>: Not memorized daily, but\n\tpre-plan your use. Force an extraplanar creature to perform a task. Naturally\n\tyou want the task to be something like, &#8220;Be my servant for the next X (x=your\n\tcaster level) days&#8221;. I could devote entire threads to suggestions of creatures\n\tfor this spell, but my suggestion is to look for utility and users of\n\tspell-like abilities. One example would be a Barghest. It can use Dimension\n\tDoor, cast levitate on you and your allies at need, and can &#8220;feed&#8221; to become\n\ttougher and get more SLA&#8217;s. Bound creatures could come back for revenge, so\n\tit&#8217;s best to ensure their untimely demise before the contract ends. A bit\n\tslimy admittedly. Planar Binding a good creature to what is essentially\n\tslavery is going to be a level of slimy only appropriate for evil\n\tcampaigns.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Secret Chest<\/a>: Put stuff in the chest and\n\tretrieve at will. A good way to hide something valuable, or avoid encumbrance\n\ton heavy spoils of war. There is a 5,050gp startup fee, but as a one time\n\tinvestment, it can be swallowed (I hate material costs, but focus costs are\n\tless offensive). Not a terrific spell, but OK.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Summon Monster V<\/a>: A fairly decent summoning\n\tspell. The Chain devil can be pretty nasty if you have a couple extra chains\n\tfor it to use. The Bearded Devils ability to create a bleeding wound can put\n\tthe nail in the coffin of an enemy, and the Bralani has a couple decent SLA&#8217;s\n\tand afterwards can support combat with arrows. Babau demons have sneak attack\n\tand can dispel magic at will. You get some of this stuff at an earlier summon\n\tspell than you did in 3.5.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Teleport<\/span>: Anyone who&#8217;s played D&amp;D has\n\tprobably used this utility before. The inexact nature of the spell is\n\tinconvenient, though not a killer. A very good utility to have.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Stone<\/a>: A lovely spell that allows you to\n\tcreate a permanent stone wall. Did I say wall? The name of the spell is\n\tsomewhat misleading&#8230;make stone domes, stone bridges, stone battlements, etc.\n\tTrapping a creature in stone gives it a saving throw to avoid, but if you try\n\tto trap several creatures, some will save and some won&#8217;t &#8211; mission\n\taccomplished. This is the best wall spell for its level in the game.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Contact Other Plane<\/a>: OK, so you can contact another\n\tplane to request a yes\/no answer to a question. Now get this, after casting\n\tthis 5th level spell, you ask your question, risk a loss of mental stats, and\n\tyou will get an answer of Yes\/No\/or I don&#8217;t know. The answer is potentially a\n\tlie&#8230;yep, you didn&#8217;t read that wrong &#8211; after all that, you may just get the\n\twrong answer anyways! Here&#8217;s a great way to avoid casting a 5th level\n\tspell&#8230;instead ask the Big Stupid Fighter. Whatever answer he gives you,\n\tassume the opposite is correct, that gives you more than 50% chance of getting\n\tthe right answer.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Prying Eyes<\/a>: I really like the very idea of this\n\tspell. You create a bunch of little floating eyes to go scout for you, then\n\treturn with their findings. They have normal vision only (though they do have\n\tperception equal to your CL) which makes this spell less useful in darkness.\n\tAlso note that the eyes are small and hard to spot, but they aren&#8217;t invisible\n\tor invulnerable. You don&#8217;t see through the eyes, they have to report back to\n\tyou. You don&#8217;t direct the eyes, you must give them instructions. Overall, lots\n\tof disadvantages to this spell, but I still like the idea.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Telepathic Bond<\/a>: Cast this and create a 10\n\tmin\/level telepathic bond with you and your allies. Everyone can now\n\tcommunicate telepathically regardless of distance. There are some really\n\tobvious uses of this I think, including coordinating, keeping in touch with a\n\tscout, and communicating with allies without others listening in.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Dominate Person<\/a>: Dominate is usually considered\n\tthe ultimate form of enchantment. Instead of making friends and influencing\n\tpeople, you are making them your own very sock puppet slave. Note that giving\n\tcommands that oppose their nature give extra saves, and thus should be avoided\n\t(unfortunately, this is very vague, and will alter the use of this spell based\n\ton the DM&#8217;s view of &#8220;against their nature&#8221;). If enchantment is your specialty,\n\tthis is a must, for other wizards, it&#8217;s a trumped up Charm Person spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Feeblemind<\/span>: I hate being targeted with\n\tthis. It&#8217;s not save or die, but it is save or be useless to any arcane caster\n\t&#8211; and arcane casters get a painful -4 to their saving throw. The save is a\n\tWill save, but still, -4. This destroys you until it&#8217;s healed.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Hold Monster<\/a>: Like Hold Person without the\n\thumanoid requirement. This spell is a bit high level for the effect IMO.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Mind Fog<\/a>: If you are a specialized enchanter,\n\tand unable to avoid targeting Will, this spell can be OK only if you know who\n\thas been affected by it and who hasn&#8217;t. For most wizards, it&#8217;s just not worth\n\ta whole spell to create a potential minus to a saving throw if that same\n\tsaving throw is failed without a minus.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Sleep<\/a>: I don&#8217;t like the symbol spells for\n\ta few reasons. They have material component costs (I universally avoid these\n\tspells), they can&#8217;t be used in combat (due to casting time) and are highly\n\tcircumstantial. I might put this in my spellbook if I found it, but I wouldn&#8217;t\n\tworry too much either way. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t memorize it unless I knew I\n\thad use for it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Cone of Cold<\/a>: Do some cold damage in a cone. You\n\tcan affect quite a few squares, and the damage is OK. For a pure blast, not\n\tbad.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Interposing Hand<\/a>: The least impressive of the\n\tmagic hand spells. Provides cover, which gives a minus 4 to be hit (no big\n\tdeal &#8211; shield spell offers a similar benefit), and slows opponents who try to\n\tclose with you (somewhat useful). These spells get very nice later on though,\n\tso be patient.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sending<\/span>: Send and receive messages over\n\tany distance. This is a handy utility spell, not overwhelmingly useful, but\n\tthe use comes up fairly regularly. Clerics can just pray for this though, and\n\tat earlier level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Force<\/a>: A pretty good wall spell. If you\n\tjust need a wall for dividing enemies (the most common Battlefield Control\n\tuse), then this spell is the ultimate for that purpose. It can&#8217;t be destroyed\n\tby martial means unless the enemy is capable of absolutely terrifying levels\n\tof damage (it has hardness 30 and 20 HP per CL), and it&#8217;s invisible, so 1\/2\n\tthe enemy forces can see what&#8217;s happening to their allies on the other side of\n\tthe wall, which has got to be bad for morale. It can be laid flat as well,\n\twhich can be nice for blocking the attempts of dragons to do strafing runs and\n\tthe like.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Dream<\/span>: Seems to me this spell is just\n\tinferior to Sending (except you can send a longer message this way). If there\n\tis some other value to this spell over sending, let me know.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">False Vision<\/a>: Trick those scrying you. Like\n\tother scrying protections, I consider it to be too circumstantial to be\n\tmemorized most of the time.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Mirage Arcana<\/a>: Add some structures to your\n\tHallucinatory Terrain, once again, I can&#8217;t think of many situations where this\n\tspell is worth memorization slots.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Nightmare<\/span>: Mighty circumstantial, some\n\troleplaying use if you want to torment someone and fatigue them, however, many\n\tcampaigns may not have one situation where you would want to use this\n\tspell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Persistent Image<\/a>: Like major image, but doesn&#8217;t\n\tneed you to concentrate. OK, I can see the value in skipping concentration\n\ttimes.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Seeming<\/span>: Kind of like Disguise Self, but\n\twith mass effect. Unwilling targets get a saving throw. Overall, this spell\n\thas uses, but is situational.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Shadow Evocation<\/a>: 20% reality really hurts,\n\tallows you to mimic lower level evocations like Wall of Ice, which may be\n\thandy if you don&#8217;t have, say, an actual Wall of Ice ready.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Blight<\/span>: Damage plant creatures moderately.\n\t1d6 damage per caster level (15d6 max) to one creature (Fort save for half)\n\twould make for a crappy spell if it wasn&#8217;t restricted to Plants only.\n\tRestricted to plants only, this spell is super-crap. I realize they wanted\n\tDruids to get this spell at a lower level, but why not make it 2nd level for\n\tDruids, 3rd level for Wizards? Even then, I don&#8217;t think I would recommend it,\n\tbut it would decrease to regular crap again.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Jar<\/a>: Has this been nerfed at all? Seems to\n\tbe as broken as ever. Room full of high level baddies? Wipe them all out with\n\tno danger to yourself and your allies. Simply get your spell focus (a gem)\n\tinto the hands of one of the baddies or the room itself, then proceed to take\n\tthem over one at a time, attack the others, then when your new body dies,\n\tswitch to the next victim. When you&#8217;ve taken over the last victim, yell the\n\t&#8220;all clear&#8221; to the party, then turn your back and expose your neck to the\n\tparty rogue. Done. If an opponent makes their saving throw, they are the one\n\tyou want to kill with those that didn&#8217;t, since you only get one try per\n\tbaddie. That&#8217;s one possible use of this super-nasty spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Pain<\/a>:&gt; See Symbol of Sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Waves of Fatigue<\/a>: An OK mass debuff. The big\n\tselling feature is that there is no saving throw, the downsides are a short\n\trange (30 ft cone effect), and that creatures that are already fatigued are\n\tnot affected (normally a second fatigue effect will exhaust). Naturally, to\n\tavoid this weakness, start with the Waves of Fatigue, and then follow up with\n\tthe Ray of Exhaustion, laughing when they reach for a saving throw die. (Oh,\n\tif only Pathfinder had &#8220;Chain Spell&#8221;)<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Growth<\/a>: Really good for Druids and\n\tRangers, for you, not so much. If there is a Ranger or Druid in the party, you\n\tcould cast this spell to help them out I guess&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Baleful Polymorph<\/a>: &#8220;She turned me into a Newt!\n\t&#8230;I got better&#8221; Essentially a save or die, turn your opponent into a little\n\tnothing creature then send it on its way. When you turn the subject into a\n\tsnail, whether it retains its class abilities and mental stats isn&#8217;t really\n\timportant, so consider this spell a Fort save spell, not a Will save spell.\n\tThe Big Stupid Fighter can then go stomp on the snail. (He&#8217;ll enjoy it,\n\tbecause the snail will need lots of stomping)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Beast Shape III<\/a>: Being a Huge animal is not\n\tenough reason to enter combat. However, being Diminutive could be a useful\n\tstate. Getting Blindsense (for the right kind of creature) can have its uses\n\ttoo. Also, allows faster fly than the fly spell. Some utility value here.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Body II<\/a>: Be a bigger elemental. There is\n\tZERO value to you for this. Your special abilities remain unchanged, and it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t make you tough or stupid enough to wade into battle.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Fabricate<\/span>: Turn a block of stone into a\n\tpretty statue, turn a block of wood into a wagon. Note that you need the\n\tcorrect crafting skill, so all this spell really does is takes your existing\n\tcraft skill, and saves you time and tools. Not particularly useful IMO.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Overland Flight<\/a>: Slower than the fly spell, but\n\tthe 1 hour\/level duration is the selling feature. Cast this on yourself and\n\tyou are good nearly all day.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Passwall<\/span>: Make a hole in a stone or wood\n\twall. Of course you can shape a hole in a stone wall with Stone Shape which is\n\tone level earlier (and is more versatile), so really the value of this is to\n\tmake a hole in some wood. Only time I ever use this spell is if I find a staff\n\twith it, otherwise, you can be better served by lower level spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Plant Shape I<\/a>: You can turn into a rosebush, or any\n\tother plant of small or medium size. The uses are endless, photosynthesize,\n\tabsorb small quantities of water, stand very still for long periods of\n\ttime&#8230;you can turn into plant creatures too, which isn&#8217;t going to be all that\n\tmuch more useful to you.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Polymorph<\/span>: Now you can use shape changing\n\tas a buff on others. This actually could have value, because &#8220;others&#8221; are the\n\tones who should be going into combat. Note that the benefits can be very\n\tsmall, and giving up equipment usage may be much, much worse than any benefit\n\tgained, but also note that an &#8220;alter self&#8221; effect can provide a small but\n\thelpful buff without any downside at all.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Telekinesis<\/span>: Telekinesis is lots of fun.\n\tFirst, the obvious utility use of moving things around out of reach, or just\n\tlifting heavy stuff. Then the combat use of lifting someone in the air,\n\tturning them backwards, and letting the party rogue at them (they get a will\n\tsave to avoid this). Then there is the really fun part about becoming an\n\texpert Grappler, Tripper, Bull rusher. Use your CL plus INT mod as your CMB\n\tand you don&#8217;t need to get in close, then grapple and trip foes for fun.\n\tFinally, you can do a &#8220;push&#8221; where you fire everything close to you away (this\n\trequires a dedicated casting of the spell), like 15 ballista bolts for\n\texample, or a horde of enemies who are getting uncomfortably close, or a bunch\n\tof guards on a parapet.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Transmute Mud to Rock<\/a>: Far more circumstantial\n\tthan its brother, transmute rock to mud. Sometimes this is used as a\n\t&#8220;finisher&#8221; in conjunction with Rock to Mud. Use the Rock to Mud spell to trap\n\tthe enemy, then Mud to Rock to really, really trap them, they do get a Ref\n\tsave to avoid the effect, but it can be basically a mass save or die\n\tcombination that targets the generally weakest save (and the save almost never\n\tassociated with Save or die). Personally I&#8217;m not big on the strategy, but I\n\tcertainly see the value of it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Transmute Rock to Mud<\/a>: No saving throw\n\tbattlefield control. Reduces movement of those caught to 5 feet per round (I\n\tthought 3.5 Solid Fog was &#8220;broken&#8221;?) regardless of their normal movement rate.\n\tCircumventing this spell is easy if you aren&#8217;t restricted to walking, but for\n\tthose who are, it can be a nice way to control the battlefield. You can also\n\tconvert ceilings to mud for a really unimpressive blast effect if you like,\n\twhich is technically multi-threat since it leaves a 5&#8242; deep mud-puddle around\n\tthe victims, Ref save for 1\/2.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"universal\">Universal<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Permanency<\/span>: Not something you are going to\n\tmemorize, but gives a few decent ways to spend your coin. A permanent Enlarge\n\tPerson on the party fighter may be a godsend.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6thlevel-wizard-spells\">6th-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Antimagic Field<\/a>: A very powerful spell, but with\n\tsobering implications. An antimagic field suppresses all magic, yours included\n\t(Hi commoner!), and is centered on you. There are tricks you can still do, for\n\texample, a summoning expert (I love summoning&#8230;did I mention that?) can\n\tpre-summon some creatures, and it&#8217;s likely they all won&#8217;t be suppressed,\n\tgiving you an advantage over the other wizard. If you are going into Arcane\n\tArcher, imbue arrow is made for this spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Dispel Magic, Greater<\/a>: I like this a lot more\n\tthan dispel magic, got to say, that&#8217;s a nice chance, considering the level\n\tdifference. An effective way to debuff an enemy who&#8217;s &#8220;spelled themselves\n\tup&#8221;.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Globe of Invulnerability<\/a>: My issue with this\n\tspell is the same as my issue with the lesser globe. If you are dealing with\n\tan enemy spellcaster, and the situation is dire, using a standard action to\n\tcast a spell (That he will recognize by the way) that will negate SOME of his\n\tspells, but can be circumvented even by lower level spells (Did I mention I\n\tlove summoning?), is not a good idea most of the time, and the limited\n\tduration tends to make it an &#8220;in combat&#8221; spell most of the time.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Guards and Wards<\/a>: Creates a bunch of lower level\n\teffects to ward some form of structure. I certainly love the theme of this\n\tspell, though I question the application in 90% of adventures. Possibly worth\n\ta spot in your spellbook, but will be seldom memorized.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Repulsion<\/span>: Primarily going to be a defensive\n\tbuff to keep the baddies out of melee with you. The 1 round\/level duration\n\tgives it the standard problem with so many defensive spells. Is it worth a\n\tstandard action? Personally, I don&#8217;t think so. It&#8217;s not foolproof (they get a\n\tsave), it has to be activated in combat most of the time (1 round\/level), if\n\tthe opponent is already closer than the 10&#8242; radius, it doesn&#8217;t work on them. A\n\tdimension door probably would serve you better.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Acid Fog<\/a>: If you check out my &#8220;Solid Fog&#8221; entry,\n\tyou&#8217;ll see that solid fog was nerfed to the point where I can&#8217;t recommend it.\n\tAdding very minor damage while they are in the easy to escape solid fog makes\n\tthis spell way too underpowered for the level. Skip it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Planar Binding<\/a>: A significant power increase from\n\tthe Lesser version. There are a lot of really interesting creatures that are\n\t12 HD or less that you can bind with this spell. Like the previous version,\n\tI&#8217;m personally fond of creatures that can add some spell-like abilities to\n\tyour magical tool belt, but you can get a decent tank for this as well.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Monster VI<\/a>: Got a significant powerup from\n\tthe 3.5 version, there are several very interesting options on this list. Dire\n\tTigers naturally are good tanks, but Succubus, Shadow Demons, Lillends,\n\tErinyes&#8230;give you lots of great options. I love summoning.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Wall of Iron<\/a>: Creates a wall of iron of 5sq\n\tft\/level. Unlike Wall of stone, the wall of iron is a flat wall. This reduces\n\tthe versatility of the spell a great deal. Adding the chance that it can fall\n\ton enemies for fairly unimpressive damage doesn&#8217;t make me much more impressed.\n\tThe wall is harder to breach, which is the main advantage I can see, but\n\tconsidering the disadvantages, I&#8217;m not sure this spell should be higher level\n\tthan wall of stone.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Analyze Dweomer<\/a>: There are two main purposes to\n\tthis spell. Firstly, it will give you everything you need to know about any\n\tmagic item. For identifying purposes, spending a 6th level spell is pretty\n\textreme, but it&#8217;s fast and reliable. The Second use is to instantly see every\n\tspell affecting a creature including their caster level. Naturally, this is a\n\tnice precursor to a greater dispel, or in extreme cases, an antimagic field.\n\tThe duration is short, which means this is going to take an action in combat,\n\twhich is very painful if that&#8217;s how you are using it. Nevertheless, some\n\tinteresting applications.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Legend Lore<\/a>: This divination spell will have a\n\tvariable effect based on your DM. Exactly how much information is given with\n\tthis spell isn&#8217;t really clear in the spell description, meaning it&#8217;s basically\n\tgoing to give you information your DM wants you to have. I&#8217;m not sure this is\n\tworth a 6th level slot.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">True Seeing<\/a>: There are a few applications to\n\tthis, but we&#8217;re all pretty familiar with the applications I think. True seeing\n\tlets you see invisible things, allows you to recognize illusions or disguises,\n\treveals secret doors, allows the Rogue to bypass blur effects, etc. Moderately\n\tuseful circumstantially.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Geas\/Quest<\/span>:&gt; Kind of like a dominate\n\teffect, but for only one command. Of course the casting time means that this\n\tis an out-of-combat spell only.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Heroism, Greater<\/a>: Like heroism except double the\n\tbonus and add an immunity to fear and some temporary HP. However, the duration\n\tis 1\/10th the lesser version. Why the game designers decided to temper\n\tincreased effect with reduced effect for a significantly higher level spell is\n\tbeyond me too (was that way in 3.5 as well).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Suggestion, Mass<\/a>:&gt; Use suggestion on a whole\n\tbunch of creatures. Suggestion has some limitations, including that the\n\tsuggestion must be tempting, it provides a saving throw, and it requires\n\tcommunication. However, creative players can use suggestions to excellent\n\teffect. Your mileage will largely vary on how your DM defines &#8220;reasonable&#8221;\n\tsuggestions.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Persuasion<\/a>: Symbol spells ALL work the\n\tsame way, they ALL have the same problems, so get used to red.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Chain Lightning<\/a>: To start with, I&#8217;m not a big\n\tfan of blasting, however, it is worth noting that Chain Lightning got a\n\tpowerup in Pathfinder. Now the secondary targets take full damage from the\n\teffect (though their save DC is 2 easier &#8211; still, consider the math &#8211; this is\n\ta good deal). The primary purpose of chain lightning is to have a straight\n\tblast that you can throw into melee without worrying about hitting allies.\n\tIt&#8217;s pure blast, so I&#8217;m not recommending it highly, but if you want to blast,\n\tthis is a decent option.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Contingency<\/span>: A very handy way to layer your\n\tdefenses. Use the contingency to bring a defense (or outright &#8220;leave the area&#8221;\n\tspell) into play when something bad happens. It might be triggered by your HP\n\treaching a certain point, or you&#8217;ve been grappled, Paralyzed, Dazed or\n\tStunned, or if you are targeted by an offensive spell of a certain level\n\t(making spells like the globes of invulnerability situationally useful when\n\tpaired with this). You can only use one at a time, but whenever you use it,\n\tbring up another as soon as possible. Essentially, this is a way to get a\n\tquickened spell off.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Forceful Hand<\/a>: This is where magic hand spells\n\tstart to get good. Cast this and it works like interposing hand, except that\n\tthe hand takes a very respectable Bull Rush against the opponent every round.\n\tThis is likely enough to ensure that most opponents simply cannot close, or\n\twaste their actions bull rushing the hand &#8211; which is almost as good. No saving\n\tthrow, Nasty. Of course, while the Forceful Hand continues to do its job, you\n\tcan cast other spells, since concentration isn&#8217;t required. However, note that\n\tSpell Resistance is still a concern.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Freezing Sphere<\/a>: I&#8217;m not highly recommending\n\tthis, but that rating is based on the assumption that you aren&#8217;t doing a lot\n\tof aquatic adventures. If you are, then this spell is highly recommended. For\n\teveryone else, Freezing Sphere is an OK blast that&#8217;s main selling feature is a\n\tvery large area of effect. Water subtype creatures (that I think are pretty\n\trare in most adventures) are debuffed as well. The utility\/battlefield control\n\tapplication comes only with a body of water, which Freezing sphere can freeze\n\tto 6 inches of depth. Very useful if the body of water is an environment\n\ttactical factor in battle only.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mislead<\/span>: The use of this spell is pretty\n\tobvious. Casts improved invisibility on you and creates an illusionary double\n\tthat will hopefully draw attacks away from you and to it. The illusionary\n\tdouble however will likely be quickly detected after the first successful\n\tattack on it and the duration isn&#8217;t great unless you are maintaining\n\tconcentration, leaving me overall, unimpressed.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Permanent Image<\/a>: The advantage of this over\n\tother illusions should be self evident right? Now personally, I haven&#8217;t had\n\tmuch need of illusions that never disappear, certainly in combat permanency is\n\tnot a necessary condition. I&#8217;ve got to therefore give this the so-so rating it\n\treceived.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Programmed Image<\/a>: I like this illusion a lot more,\n\tmainly because I can use it as a quickened Major Image with no concentration\n\t(example, &#8220;When I say X, an illusionary wall of iron appears 10 feet in front\n\tof me&#8221;). As far as I can see, you can use this in &#8220;off-time&#8221; as often as you\n\twant, and the programmed images are all ready for use at your command\n\tpermanently until used. If you like illusions, this is going to be a must\n\thave.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Shadow Walk<\/a>: A way to travel rapidly with your\n\tcompanions. Wait a minute? Didn&#8217;t you get teleport a level earlier? The\n\tteleport spell is better overall, the use of this will be the ability to\n\ttravel quickly to areas you are not familiar with. This use will be trumped\n\teventually by Greater Teleport, but before Greater Teleport is available, in\n\tthat situation, Shadow walk gives an OK quick travel option (though\n\tpersonally, I&#8217;m more for phantom steeds for the group)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Veil<\/span>: Quite a bit like Seeming except you\n\tcan have the creatures look, feel, and smell like anything. I think the\n\tapplications are similar to Seeming, as are the limitations.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Circle of Death<\/a>: A ranged area of effect save or\n\tdie. I&#8217;m not big on save or die&#8217;s when they are single target, but I like them\n\tmore when they have mass effect. The limit on this spell is 1d4 HD\/level, but\n\tthat&#8217;s a pretty decent number of HD. Fort negates the effect, which is pretty\n\tstandard for save or die, and which is why it&#8217;s important that you target\n\tseveral creatures.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Create Undead<\/a>: Creates more powerful undead. The\n\tUndead you create you do not have control of. For Evil Clerics, this isn&#8217;t a\n\tbig problem, for a Wizard&#8230;well.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Eyebite<\/span>: I&#8217;ve always really wanted to like\n\tthis spell, after all, you cast it once and get a debuff &#8220;spell&#8221; for 1\n\tround\/level afterwards. However, against almost anything you fight at this\n\tlevel will be targeted by a sickened effect (single target) &#8211; and that&#8217;s kind\n\tof small potatoes at this level, giving them a save to resist the effect just\n\tadds insult to injury.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Fear<\/a>: More symbols, the base problems not\n\tremoved.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Undeath to Death<\/a>: A &#8220;Circle of Death&#8221; for undead\n\t(note that they make Will saves instead of Fort saves). My problem with this\n\tspell is simply that it is more circumstantial than the Circle of Death spell,\n\tsince, in general, you fight more living creatures than undead ones in most\n\tcampaigns.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Bear&#8217;s Endurance, Mass<\/a>: I think the problems of\n\tBear&#8217;s Endurance are more profound at this level (spell being trumped by magic\n\titems) making this spell suffer for that even more than the original (Because\n\titems with multiple stat bonuses are more common)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Beast Shape IV<\/a>: I guess this means I&#8217;m just not a\n\tfan of this whole line of spells. Giving up spellcasting for situational\n\tutility abilities may be OK for occasional out of combat use, but you have\n\tbetter options for that. In combat, you just don&#8217;t want to give up\n\tspellcasting so you can enter melee. Bigger creatures are bigger targets as\n\twell. If you could cast this on others, it may be a different story.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Bull&#8217;s Strength, Mass<\/a>: See mass bear&#8217;s endurance<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-red\">Cat&#8217;s Grace, Mass<\/a>: See mass bear&#8217;s endurance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Control Water<\/a>: A very moderate value utility that\n\tis late entry for Wizards. Just not worth it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disintegrate<\/span>: Probably the most overrated\n\tcombat spell I know of. If you hit on a touch attack, and the single target\n\tfails their save, yes, the damage is pretty good (but why didn&#8217;t you just save\n\tor die then? This is just single target Save or take some damage.). If they\n\tmake their save, it&#8217;s pretty much useless (5d6 damage). This spell&#8217;s other\n\tapplication is probably more useful, though circumstantial, it can\n\tdisintegrate walls, rocks, and force effects (like magic hand spells).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Eagle&#8217;s Splendor, Mass<\/a>: See mass bear&#8217;s\n\tendurance.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Body III<\/a>: If you could cast, this would\n\tbe a decent way to become immune to sneak attack and critical hits. However,\n\tmore likely it&#8217;s just a buff to enter combat &#8211; which you don&#8217;t want to do.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Flesh to Stone<\/a>: Essentially a standard save or\n\tdie. Pick the target, they make a Fort save, if they fail they are a statue.\n\tTechnically, they aren&#8217;t officially dead, although for the combat (unless\n\tsomeone has stone to flesh handy) it&#8217;s basically the same thing. One handy\n\tapplication of course is that you can turn someone to stone, then turn them\n\tback with Stone to Flesh, which may be handy for prisoner taking for\n\texample.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Form of the Dragon I<\/a>: First and foremost, this is\n\ta form where you can clearly continue to cast spells. That is highly\n\tsignificant. The duration is long enough that this can be a combat-prep spell,\n\tbut not so much that you can keep it up. There are a number of advantages to\n\tbeing in dragon form. You get fly (maneuverability sucks &#8211; hope you have the\n\tfly skill), Darkvision, a natural armor boost, a Con boost (Size bonus &#8211; it\n\tshould stack), and an energy resistance (based on the type of dragon of\n\tcourse). You also can get swimming, burrowing, or spider climb based on which\n\tdragon you take. The Str bonus isn&#8217;t really going to mean much to you, nor is\n\tthe Breath Weapon or bite and claw attacks. However, a fairly useful self-only\n\tbuff.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>Special note: Since your material Component pouch will polymorph into your\n\tnew form, you either need to deal with that (remove said pouch before casting\n\tspell, then reclaim it) or have the eschew materials feat &#8211; or you will need\n\tto avoid spells with a material component.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-red\">Fox&#8217;s Cunning, Mass<\/a>: See mass bear&#8217;s endurance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Mage&#8217;s Lucubration<\/a>: Recall a lower level spell\n\tyou&#8217;ve already cast today as a standard action. Really not very useful most of\n\tthe time.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Move Earth<\/a>: You can flatten or create buckles in\n\tthe ground. If you become a professional landscaper, this is a must. For the\n\trest of you, very, very, very circumstantial (create a trench for defending\n\tarchers for example).<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><a class=\"rating-red\">Owl&#8217;s Wisdom, Mass<\/a>: See mass bear&#8217;s endurance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Plant Shape II<\/a>: Form of the Dragon is going to give\n\tyou similar benefits, and more, and not risk the loss of spellcasting. Skip\n\tthis.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Stone to Flesh<\/a>: If you have Flesh to Stone and\n\twant to be able to reverse the effects, you probably want this in your\n\tspellbook, it also has a very grisly circumstantial utility use as well. (it&#8217;s\n\teasier to get through a wall of flesh than a wall of stone. Heard enough?)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Transformation<\/span>: An absolute massive debuff\n\tthat completely strips all casting ability from a caster with no save.\n\tUnfortunately, the target is self only. Instead this becomes a very so-so\n\tspell to turn you into a very so-so melee combatant (probably less than so-so\n\tunless you are stacking this with some other self buffs beforehand). Eternally\n\thated spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7thlevel-wizard-spells\">7th-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Banishment<\/span>: A pumped up dismissal &#8211; send\n\tmultiple extraplanar creatures back to their own plane on a failed save (up to\n\t2HD per CL). This could be handy against Demons\/Devils and the like\n\t(especially when they begin summoning more of their own), but it&#8217;s extremely\n\tcircumstantial and not completely reliable. Me? I prefer to use a dimensional\n\tanchor on these guys and let the BSF cut them to ribbons.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sequester<\/span>: Completely hide someone for 1\n\tday\/level. They turn invisible, comatose, and can&#8217;t be detected through\n\tdivination. If it wasn&#8217;t for the comatose thing, this would be a great self\n\tbuff! As is, it&#8217;s a save or die, or a really circumstantial utility.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Spell Turning<\/a>: Not a bad defensive self buff.\n\tWith a 10 min\/level duration, you can have this up quite often before combat,\n\tand it has the delicious effect of turning a spell back on the caster. The\n\tlevels affected will be eaten up very quickly, and this doesn&#8217;t work on area\n\tspells (targeted only), but still this spell would be a pretty standard buff\n\tif I knew I was facing a caster.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Instant Summons<\/a>: If this has some common practical\n\tapplication worth the 1,000 gp material component I don&#8217;t know it. Summons a\n\tpredetermined object right to your hand. The most obvious applications I can\n\tthink of could be suitably completed with Secret Chest or a Handy\n\tHaversack.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Mage&#8217;s Magnificent Mansion<\/a>: A high level spell to\n\treplace Rope Trick as the ultimate camping spell, but at least it does that\n\tconvincingly. No giveaway rope, you simply are gone. Nice digs too, far more\n\tsuitable to a mage of your caliber.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Phase Door<\/a>: Create a portal to which only you\n\tcan go through, therefore you can move in and out of combat through the door,\n\tso primarily I would consider this a defensive spell. The door has limited\n\tuses, but consider this: your wizard takes Flyby attack, then flies through\n\tthe door with 1\/2 your move &#8211; casts &#8211; and flies back. Situational, but set up\n\tcorrectly, effective.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Plane Shift<\/a>: Your first plane travel spell. I\n\twouldn&#8217;t recommend this spell unless you know you need it. Too many campaigns\n\tdo not require you to plane travel on your own spell power.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Monster VII<\/a>: Vrocks, Bebiliths, and T-Rex&#8217;s\n\tall available through SM VII now. Very nice. Also, the Dire Crocodile is just\n\tnasty, and pretty much the ultimate grapple machine. Loving the higher level\n\tsummon spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Teleport, Greater<\/a>: Teleport anywhere, take your\n\tfriends, 100% accuracy, no limited distance.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Teleport Object<\/a>: Instead of teleporting yourself,\n\tyour allies, and your equipment, you are teleporting an object, and not\n\t&#8220;Greater Teleport&#8221; either (though you can teleport to the ethereal plane).\n\tObviously this is going to be of less use.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Sight, Greater<\/a>: It&#8217;s like Arcane sight but\n\tit automatically works on everything you see. Enter the battlefield knowing\n\texactly what spells are in effect on what creatures, what magic items they are\n\tcarrying, how many charges those items have, etc. Surely you can see how this\n\tmight be handy. Really, I can think of no other divination I would rather have\n\talready active when I enter most combats.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Scrying, Greater<\/a>: If you like to scry, this spell\n\tlasts an hour\/level and is only a standard action to cast. You can cast\n\tmessage through the scry, so you can actually communicate with the scryed\n\tcreature (or those nearby). Personally, I make due with a Crystal Ball, but a\n\thard-core diviner probably wants this nice upgrade.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vision<\/span>: A faster version of legend lore.\n\tOf course, if you read my Legend Lore spell review, the casting time was not a\n\tbig concern. The concerns it does raise are not alleviated by this version.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Hold Person, Mass<\/a>: I like the idea of this spell\n\t(mass save or lose with a will save), but it is just too high level for the\n\teffect. Heck &#8211; you had a mass save or die covering a similar area one level\n\tago! The HD limit doesn&#8217;t affect this, but it is humanoids only. I just can&#8217;t\n\trecommend this.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Insanity<\/span>: So you create a confusion effect on\n\tONE target, except the duration is permanent. This is not a good deal at all\n\t99% of the time. Certainly not in combat, and out of combat it&#8217;s going to be\n\thighly situational. Love confusion, but insanity fails to impress.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Power Word Blind<\/a>: So compare this with the 2nd\n\tlevel spell Blindness\/Deafness. The former offers no save, the latter offers\n\tno HP limit (200 hp for this spell). Neither circumvent SR. Hmmm&#8230;seems this\n\tone is a bit better than that 2nd level spell. Wait, what level spell is\n\tthis!!!???<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Stunning<\/a>: Standard symbol problems here\n\tas usual.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Delayed Blast Fireball<\/a>: I know this is considered a\n\tstaple, but I don&#8217;t know why. Seems to me to be a Fireball with double the Max\n\tcaster level limit, that you can delay the blast of up to 5 rounds. Am I\n\tmissing something? Sounds way too pathetic for the level to me. Max 20 CL was\n\talready available for other blasts at earlier levels.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Forcecage<\/span>: Used to be the best Evocation\n\tspell in the game in 3.5. Pathfinder Nerfed it badly by allowing force effects\n\tto be destroyed by damage alone. However, turning it into a decent spell\n\twasn&#8217;t enough. Then they nerfed it again to 1 round\/level (this is&#8230;wait for\n\tit&#8230;1\/1200th of the original duration). This turned it into an OK spell. Not\n\tenough you say? OK, then they nerfed it with the biggest nerf of all added a\n\tsaving throw to avoid the effect entirely. Yep &#8211; now it&#8217;s entirely crap, not\n\tworth the ink they took to print it. Good job. If you really miss the utility\n\tof forcecage, look one line down. Go ahead &#8211; why are you still here?<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Grasping Hand<\/a>: Since forcecage is a waste of space\n\tin your spellbook, Grasping Hand is a more important addition than ever. Like\n\tinterposing hand, except that Grasping Hand isn&#8217;t satisfied with keeping the\n\topponent at range, the grasping hand wants them grappled too (and it&#8217;s pretty\n\tgood at it). A really nice spell, and the only way to trap someone effectively\n\twith Evocation at this level now.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Mage&#8217;s Sword<\/a>: Not to be confused with summoning\n\teffects, this spell is really just a blast that keeps on going. The damage is\n\tpretty basic, but it has a decent to-hit, and it keeps hitting for 1\n\tround\/level. I&#8217;m not big on blasts, and really not big on single target\n\tblasts, but I&#8217;m somewhat moved by 1 round\/level movable blast effects.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Prismatic Spray<\/a>: I can name several reasons you\n\tdon&#8217;t want this spell. However, the primary reason is this: Creatures hit by\n\tthis spell either get a save to avoid the effect, or are hit with a minor\n\tblast with a save for half damage. (The small chance exists to double the\n\teffects). The effect is random, which always makes it tactically inferior, and\n\tthe random effects just aren&#8217;t that great. Was that more than one reason? At\n\tleast I didn&#8217;t go into the limitations of the cone effect&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Invisibility, Mass<\/a>: Cast invisibility over many\n\tcreatures (and really, there is no limit &#8211; so make an army invisible if you\n\tlike &#8211; though an army isn&#8217;t very stealthy anyways). For your party, individual\n\tinvisibility spells off a wand are likely far more economical most of the\n\ttime, or an invisibility 10&#8242; radius spell. This is for huge groups, and\n\tfrankly, that&#8217;s pretty circumstantial unless you are in that kind of\n\tcampaign.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Project Image<\/a>: Project Image sends an illusionary\n\timage of you forth, however, unlike other illusions of you (like created\n\tthrough mislead), your spells actually originate from the projected image\n\t(your choice, spells of touch or greater distance, so no &#8220;self-only&#8221; spells).\n\tYou can also see and hear from the projected image if you like. I love this\n\tspell because firstly, it&#8217;s a lot more convincing if the spells are actually\n\tcoming from the illusion, second (and more importantly) I like it as a way\n\t(the only way I know of) to circumvent the limitations of line of effect (you\n\tneed line of effect to your projected image, and it needs line of effect to\n\tthe spell, so that means casting around corners etc.) Finally, I like it as a\n\tway to increase range, the range of the projected image is medium &#8211; so deliver\n\ttouch, short range, or cone spells all at medium range, or double the range of\n\ta medium range spell. The duration is short, which is the main disadvantage of\n\tthis spell. Still, highly recommended.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Shadow Conjuration, Greater<\/a>: Now conjuration\n\tspells are 60% real, which is a significant improvement, but how many spells\n\tare you realistically duplicating with this, a 7th level spell? Summoning,\n\tWalls. That&#8217;s pretty much it, and in every case, inferior to the original.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Simulacrum<\/span>: I&#8217;m really split on this\n\tspell. First off, it&#8217;s expensive, and creating illusionary doubles? Big deal.\n\tHowever, a Simulacrum can be created of any creature up to 2x your HD (so\n\tlike, a 30th level epic wizard, if you know of one), and the simulacrum has\n\t1\/2 the ability, presumably including spellcasting. I can see massive value in\n\tthat. However, how many creatures\/NPC&#8217;s of super high level do you know to\n\tduplicate? The more obvious and intended use is to create a double of a\n\tcreature or NPC under your control to assume their identity. In that respect I\n\tthink this is an OK spell that probably costs too much. Thus&#8230;I&#8217;m of two\n\tminds on this one.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Control Undead<\/a>: You can take control of multiple\n\tundead (2 HD\/CL), but they get a saving throw to resist (Will). If you take\n\tcontrol of them, the duration is one minute per level, not bad. If you are\n\tfighting undead consistently, I would be all over this. Otherwise, very\n\tsituational.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Finger of Death<\/a>: Save or die &#8211; whoops! Not anymore.\n\tNow it&#8217;s save or take damage. You know &#8211; like Disintegrate &#8211; that spell I said\n\twasn&#8217;t very good at 6th level. If you want save or die vs. Fort, go for Flesh\n\tto Stone instead.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Weakness<\/a>: More symbols, more of the same\n\tproblems. It would be nice if as the level increased, the material cost and\n\tcasting time decreased&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Waves of Exhaustion<\/a>: 60&#8242; cone that exhausts\n\teveryone in it. A natural spell to pair with Project Image IMO. No saving\n\tthrow, and that&#8217;s a pretty big area of effect for a fairly nasty status effect\n\twith no save to avoid to have. Note that Exhaust isn&#8217;t nearly as good as stun\n\tor daze, but when you are causing it to occur to a mass of creatures with no\n\tsaving throw &#8211; I&#8217;m behind that.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Control Weather<\/a>: Changing weather in a local area\n\tover a long casting time I&#8217;m sure has value in certain circumstances, but\n\tconsidering your level, a lot of those circumstances are ones you can deal\n\twith using lower level spells. The use of this spell I would consider too\n\tcircumstantial.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Body IV<\/a>: The same problems as the other\n\telemental spells. Things like swim 120&#8242; and Fly 120&#8242; perfect are very nice,\n\tbut giving up spellcasting to do them makes this an out-of-combat spell\n\texclusively, and again, often replaceable by lower level spells that don&#8217;t\n\tremove your spellcasting ability.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Ethereal Jaunt<\/a>: Primarily a utility spell, and\n\tnot a particularly great one for the level. Defensively you can use this as an\n\tescape, though when you are ethereal your spells have no effect on the\n\tnon-ethereal. You are still subject to force effects as well.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Form of the Dragon II<\/a>: I actually prefer the\n\tlower level version. You increase your Con by an extra +2 which is nice, and\n\tnatural armor by +2 which is also nice, the flying is faster, and you get a\n\tsmall DR, but Large creatures are also bigger targets, so I&#8217;m not totally sure\n\tthat is worth a whole spell level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Giant Form I<\/a>: Turn into a troll and get\n\tregeneration. I assume you can still cast in this form too. You&#8217;ll get a con\n\tbonus and natural armor bonus too. Overall, I think that is likely worth being\n\tlarge. Please remember you are not a melee character. The dragon form is\n\tbetter for utility, but I do like regeneration. This spell is kind of\n\torangy-green.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Plant Shape III<\/a>: Can treant&#8217;s cast spells? (We know\n\tthey can be great Monks!) If so, then this is pretty good. Otherwise, it&#8217;s one\n\tto skip. The Red coding is because I would say that branches aren&#8217;t like\n\tfingers for casting.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Polymorph, Greater<\/a>: Not a half bad buff spell. I\n\tcan see a definite advantage to turning the Barbarian into a Dragon for\n\texample. Gives them a nice stat boost, some natural attacks, and some nice\n\tmovement\/sense options. Note that equipment is melded into the form, but if\n\tyou can cast this before combat, you can avoid at least some of that\n\tdisadvantage.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Reverse Gravity<\/a>: Sometimes you fight creatures\n\tthat don&#8217;t fly, and don&#8217;t have ranged attacks either. In those cases this\n\tspell wins the fight. No SR, no save, they just float in midair for you to\n\tpick off one at a time for 1 round\/level. The difference between using this to\n\tkill those non-flying foes and flight spells, is that creatures that can&#8217;t fly\n\tcan still run and find cover, or other useful tactics. Just floating there is\n\ta nice place for them to be.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Statue<\/span>: You can turn into a statue.\n\tDoesn&#8217;t sound great? You can turn back and forth at will. Turning back and\n\tforth is a free action &#8211; so you can be a statue during your opponent&#8217;s move\n\tand then normal on yours. All your equipment switches with you &#8211; so check with\n\tyour DM as to what functions and what doesn&#8217;t. Also, check with your DM\n\tregarding spell effects (if you are flying, and turn into a statue, do you\n\tkeep flying?) The rules don&#8217;t say you won&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s not a surprise you want\n\tfrom your DM interpreting it differently. The total advantage here is 8\n\thardness. Probably better than stoneskin anyways, because there is no costly\n\tcomponent.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"universal\">Universal<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Limited Wish<\/a>: Wonderfully versatile spell.\n\tHowever, me, being the miser I am, can&#8217;t get past the 1,500 gp material\n\tcomponent to cast this spell. I can&#8217;t see scribing a spell into my spellbook\n\tand memorizing it regularly, knowing that every time I cast it, I lose that\n\tkind of money. Sorry. I will note that there are those out there who will\n\tSTRONGLY disagree, saying limited wish is one of the best spells in the game.\n\tJust making you aware of that, but my opinion won&#8217;t change.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8thlevel-wizard-spells\">8th-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Lock<\/a>: Prevents any form of instant\n\ttravel type spell from working in a 20&#8242; radius for 1 day\/level. This spell\n\tobviously is going to be overly circumstantial. In combat, Dimensional Anchor\n\twill keep your enemies from popping around just fine. Instead, this spell is\n\tfor keeping creatures imprisoned and the like.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Mind Blank<\/a>: No longer does this grant immunity to\n\tall mind affecting spells. Instead it grants a +8 resistance bonus. Of course,\n\tdon&#8217;t expect that bonus to stack with anything, since most saving throw\n\tbonuses (including rings of resistance) are resistance bonuses. So now this\n\tspell is primarily to block scrying, which isn&#8217;t worth an 8th level slot. Get\n\tyourself a nice resistance bonus to saves and skip this. Use protection from X\n\tas protection for compulsion effects.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Prismatic Wall<\/a>: A wall that is pretty much the\n\tmost difficult wall to breach there is. Of course anyone can just walk through\n\tthis wall &#8211; but good luck surviving (it&#8217;s possible, but not likely). The big\n\tadvantage of this wall over the various other walls is that you can pass\n\tthrough it. Giving you kind of a phase door effect where you pop out from\n\tbehind the wall and then move back behind its protection. (Prismatic walls\n\tstop just about everything.) The biggest disadvantage of the wall of course,\n\tis whatever it&#8217;s anchored to likely can be circumvented, especially at this\n\tlevel. Regular walls have become far less obtrusive to many enemies. (Which is\n\twhy the sphere spell next level is the preferred spell)<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Protection from Spells<\/a>: Horrible. Spend 500 gp\n\tmaterial component to get a short duration resistance bonus to spell saves.\n\tSave your money and buy a ring of resistance, and get a resistance bonus to\n\tevery save.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Incendiary Cloud<\/a>: Like cloudkill, except instead of\n\tdoing Con damage to those within, it&#8217;s doing 6d6 fire damage (Ref save for\n\thalf). That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m not sure I understand why this is a higher level than\n\tcloudkill, it really shouldn&#8217;t be. If it was a Cloudkill that did fire damage\n\ttoo&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Maze<\/span>: Remove someone from combat with no\n\tsaving throw. This is quite good. It&#8217;s really a strong &#8220;Divide and conquer&#8221;\n\toption, because you are just removing one enemy from combat &#8211; poof. When he\n\tcomes back, his partner is a corpse, and then, so is he. This can also be\n\tuseful against a single foe. Cast Maze, raise buffs, prepare for his\n\treturn.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Planar Binding, Greater<\/a>: Now the creature is up\n\tto 18 HD. This really opens the door to just about anything short of the big\n\tguns (Balors, Pit Fiends, Solars). It&#8217;s a good spell for the same reason the\n\tlesser versions are.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Summon Monster VIII<\/a>: Hezrou Demons, Barbed\n\tDevils, Elder Elementals. Decent creatures, but a small list means less\n\tversatility. Not significantly better than SM VII IMO.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Trap the Soul<\/a>: Imprisons a person&#8217;s soul in a gem\n\t(which costs insane amounts) either a save or die, or a trap that gives no\n\tsave. Based on the cost alone, I would never use this spell. I&#8217;ve been told\n\tthat for some groups, in-combat resurrection can be a problem at this level,\n\tand Trap the Soul prevents that. I say, then use Baleful Polymorph&#8230;problem\n\tsolved.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Discern Location<\/a>: Cast this spell and you know\n\twhere the target (be it creature or object) is. Almost no scry defense works\n\tto prevent this from working. It&#8217;s scry up another notch I guess, this kind of\n\tdivination specialization is not really up my alley.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Moment of Prescience<\/a>: This is really good. Get a\n\t+1\/CL insight bonus on any one saving throw (yes), Attack roll (no), Skill\n\tcheck (probably not), AC vs one attack(maybe), or a combat maneuver check\n\t(no). You don&#8217;t need to specify when casting, and it&#8217;s going to last all day,\n\tand you can use it any time (even if flat footed). So cast at the beginning of\n\tthe day, and when that REALLY important saving throw comes along&#8230;succeed.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Prying Eyes, Greater<\/a>: I like prying eyes, and\n\tprying eyes with true seeing is even better. Is it 3 spell levels better? Of\n\tcourse not!<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Antipathy<\/span>: Purely defensive magic that takes\n\tan hour to cast. Repels (if they fail their save) a creature of specific type\n\tor alignment (no repelling evil in general, you can repel Chaotic evil,\n\tneutral evil or Lawful evil). This is going to be massively circumstantial,\n\tand requires too specific a target to be of any general use. This shouldn&#8217;t be\n\tup here with the big boys at 8th level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Binding<\/span>: This spell gives you all kinds of\n\tways to imprison a creature. That&#8217;s really what it does though, and yes, they\n\tare imprisoned really, really good for pretty much as long as you like. They\n\tbetter be already defeated though, because the 1 min casting time does not\n\tmake this an in-combat spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Charm Monster, Mass<\/a>: This is twice the level of\n\tCharm Monster, you better be targeting a whole slew of creatures with this.\n\tIt&#8217;s basically a mass save or lose spell. It&#8217;s OK, but the level seems a bit\n\thigh.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Demand<\/span>: This is a sending spell, but it lets\n\tyou implant a suggestion, like the spell, into the sending. Since sending is\n\tsomething usually for allies, I&#8217;m not really sure how this would be used to\n\tany great advantage.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Irresistible Dance<\/a>: Nerfed from 3.5, guess when\n\tit&#8217;s not Otto&#8217;s spell anymore it&#8217;s weaker. Now provides a saving throw that\n\treduces the duration to one round if successful (Will). Making one creature\n\tunable to act, even for one round, is still a pretty decent ability though.\n\tThe spell is not bad, but not great anymore.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Power Word Stun<\/a>: The problem with power words is\n\tthe HP limits. The BIG problem with power words is that the HP limit decreases\n\tas the spell level increases. With this spell the limit is 150 hp.\n\tUnfortunately, that leaves you in a guessing game (most DM&#8217;s don&#8217;t tell you\n\tthe HP of your opponent). Is he damaged enough to stun? Or will I waste the\n\tspell? Not worth it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Insanity<\/a>: All the weaknesses of all the\n\tsymbol spells remain. Too bad.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Sympathy<\/span>: First of all, there is a costly\n\tcomponent, secondly, the spell is ambiguous on how creatures are attracted to\n\tthe area in the first place, or how strong that compulsion is. Depending on\n\tyour DM interpretation, this spell could be very useless, or on the other\n\textreme, fairly useful. Based on the ambiguity and the material cost, I say\n\tskip it.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Clenched Fist<\/a>: I&#8217;m kind of unsure if this spell\n\tis actually better than Grasping hand. The big draw here is that the opponent\n\tmay be stunned for a round (Fort to save), and technically could be stunned\n\tevery round for the duration of the spell. When stunning, it&#8217;s part of a\n\t&#8220;punch&#8221; attack, but the damage is unimpressive. The fist can also act like a\n\tpushing hand, bull rushing opponents as the 6th level spell. The versatility\n\tis welcome, and overall this is a good spell, though for the level, I&#8217;m not\n\tsure it&#8217;s actually better than Grasping hand. I like grasping hand, though.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Polar Ray<\/a>: Fire a ray that does a so-so blast\n\t(1d6 per caster level) and debuffs slightly (1d4 dex drain). The debuff is way\n\ttoo small for the level, making this really not much more than a single target\n\tso-so blast spell dealing cold damage. It is worth noting that there is no\n\tsaving throw, which keeps this from being totally terrible.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Shout, Greater<\/a>: A cone that does damage, deafens\n\tand stuns. The cone is 60&#8242;, and really, we prefer ranged radius effects right?\n\tAlso, the damage isn&#8217;t very good (10d6), and the stun is only for one round,\n\tand they get a Fort save to 1\/2 the damage, deafness duration and avoid the\n\tstun. So in the end, really not that great, even though sonic damage is\n\tnice.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sunburst<\/span>: Overall not a bad spell. Long\n\trange burst effect with a really great radius (80&#8242;!). All creatures within\n\tmake a Ref save, if they fail they are blinded and take 6d6 damage (permanent\n\tblind). Against undead it does 1d6 per caster level damage. The damage really\n\tisn&#8217;t the candy here, it&#8217;s the size of the effect and the blindness. This is a\n\tspell for mass amounts of enemies, not single targets.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinetic Sphere<\/a>:&gt;Like resilient sphere,\n\texcept you can float it around telekinetically (along with anyone or anything\n\tinside). I keep thinking that there has got to be some really great uses for\n\tthis, but other than using it to fly through a danger zone safe, or lifting up\n\ta non-flyer and dropping him (pretty non-8th level effects if you ask me) I\n\tcan&#8217;t think of any.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Scintillating Pattern<\/a>: I don&#8217;t understand. This\n\tspell affects your CL worth of HD (1\/2 of most spells around this level), and\n\tif the target is 13th level or more, it&#8217;s basically a low duration confusion\n\teffect. There is no save, but still&#8230;<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Screen<\/span>: We&#8217;re at the point where scry\n\tdefenses aren&#8217;t really getting any better, just higher level (and thus need\n\tthe NEXT level of scry&#8217;s to penetrate it). This one creates an illusion that\n\tthe scry sees instead of what it intended to see, but the casting time is\n\tlong, and the area is a set area.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Shadow Evocation, Greater<\/a>: Since you can cast\n\tcontingency without this spell, this is just a weaker way to cast magic hand\n\tspells or poor blasts. I&#8217;m not impressed.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clone<\/span>: For 1,000 gp you can have this &#8220;get\n\tout of death free card&#8221; hidden somewhere safe. Note that if you die, you will\n\tawaken in the clone, and the poor Cleric trying to resurrect you in combat is\n\tgoing to be very disappointed. However, otherwise, this is a nice\n\tdeath-contingency (just make sure the rest of the party know). Use a teleport\n\tto return, reclaim your stuff, and claim the corpses of your allies. You get 2\n\tnegative levels when the clone awakens, so get a restoration too. Or &#8211; clone\n\tthe entire party then you have no corpses to claim. TPK&#8217;s become near\n\timpossible. That&#8217;s good value for the material cost. Hint: Buy some cheap\n\tequipment and leave it with your clone&#8230;also leave an extra copy of your\n\tspellbook. Being prepared is just the right thing to do.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Create Greater Undead<\/a>: The undead you create are\n\tnot under your control &#8211; so the value of this becomes pretty stretched.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Horrid Wilting<\/a>: Pure blast, but certainly one of\n\tthe best pure blasts in the game. No energy types here, you just take damage.\n\tThe range is long, and you target specifically, so your allies are safe. Fort\n\tsave for 1\/2 damage.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Symbol of Death<\/a>: The bad mechanics that spawned all\n\tthe lesser versions with the same bad mechanic.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Form of the Dragon III<\/a>: Huge size has some\n\tdisadvantages, but if the size fits, then this is the ultimate dragon form.\n\tYou get +8 Con (size bonus, stackable, that&#8217;s 4HP per level), +8 Natural armor\n\t(will trump whatever natural armor bonus you have), Blindsense 60&#8242; (very\n\thandy), Frightful presence, etc. etc. etc. You still shouldn&#8217;t enter melee,\n\tbut still a great spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Giant Form II<\/a>: Not nearly as attractive,\n\tespecially considering the Dragon option.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Iron Body<\/a>: This spell gives you all kinds of great\n\timmunities, but the big killer is that all your spells have a 35% fail chance\n\twith this spell &#8211; that&#8217;s a big price to pay.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Polymorph Any Object<\/a>: Turn anything into anything\n\telse. Sound powerful? Yep. You can even turn your allies into more powerful\n\tcreatures permanently. That&#8217;s right &#8211; permanently. Really, really good.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Temporal Stasis<\/a>: 5,000 gp for a touch save or die.\n\tNeed I say more? Hopefully not.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9thlevel-wizard-spells\">9th-Level Wizard Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjuration\">Abjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Freedom<\/span>: Releases the target from anything\n\trestricting its movement, even Maze or Imprisonment. This is an instantaneous\n\tspell, so you won&#8217;t be casting this on yourself. As a way to circumvent\n\tdebuffs on your allies, it&#8217;s going to be good &#8211; but is it going to be 9th\n\tlevel good? No.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Imprisonment<\/span>: Like Trap the Soul but the soul\n\tis hidden in a small sphere deep beneath the ground, protected from scrying,\n\tand in all ways an expert at not being seen. Kill? Overkill? This remains a\n\ttouch save or die with a Will save.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Mage&#8217;s Disjunction<\/a>: Interesting contradiction with\n\tDisjunction. Pathfinder has nerfed this spell, and the nerf has made it\n\tbetter. The reason you never wanted to cast this spell except in an emergency\n\twas because it turned magic items mundane (making your allies very\n\tunderstandably upset), however, the nerfed version actually only suppresses\n\ttheir magic for the duration of the spell. This means you cast Disjunction,\n\tdestroy all spells, make everyone else&#8217;s magic items normal for 1 minute per\n\tlevel, clean up, and magic items go back to normal. This spell went from\n\tdeadly with dire consequences to just deadly. Nice.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Prismatic Sphere<\/a>: Takes the biggest disadvantage\n\tof the wall and eliminates it. If someone gets to close this can be defensive\n\ttoo, just cast the sphere, then leave them in the sphere. Kill their buddies,\n\tdrop the sphere, kill them. Leaving some long duration damaging effect inside\n\tthe sphere after you leave may be fun too. Naturally, this is normally\n\tdefensive, and works like the wall that way (except better)<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjuration\">Conjuration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Gate<\/span>: I do not like this spell. Fortunately,\n\twe are only connected by computer so you cannot throw tomatoes. Gate has 2\n\tuses, one is to Planar Travel &#8211; of course, you could already do that. The\n\tsecond is to call a creature or creatures through the gate (a calling), you\n\tcan bring a total of twice your caster level through the gate, and cannot\n\tcontrol any single being over your CL in HD (the one minor nerf this spell\n\treceived-so control 2 powerful beings instead of one super powerful being).\n\tWhy don&#8217;t I like gate? Because I have an 8th level spell that lets me bind an\n\t18 HD outsider already thank you, and unlike this spell, I don&#8217;t give\n\tup&#8230;wait for it&#8230;10,000 gp to do it. If I want 2 I can bind 2. Gate is not\n\tbringing anything to the table worth the insane material component cost.\n\tSorry. Throw your tomatoes now.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Refuge<\/span>: You create an item (for 1,500 gp),\n\tthat you give to someone. When they speak a command word and break the gem,\n\tthey are instantly transported to your abode. This is a moderately useful\n\tspell, as you can make these items for your allies so they have a quick escape\n\titem. Kind of an expensive way to do it though isn&#8217;t it? I just can&#8217;t\n\trecommend it as a 9th level spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Monster IX<\/a>: I LOVE SUMMONING! Yes! Summon\n\tMonster IX is finally the great spell that it always should have been! The\n\tSLA&#8217;s available now through this spell are amazing. Heal, Blade barrier, Holy\n\tWord, Prismatic spray, Wall of force, Mass cure serious wounds &#8211; and much,\n\tmuch more, and some really nice combat summons on top of that. The Ice devil\n\tis misplaced on this list &#8211; it should have been on the level 8 version, but\n\toverall, SM VIII was a blip, we&#8217;re back in business.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Teleportation Circle<\/a>: The purpose of this spell is\n\tkind of obvious, you can either use it to transport huge numbers of beings\n\tacross the universe, or you can cast it in two places so you can pop back and\n\tforth through the duration. Very circumstantial, and there is a 1,000gp cost.\n\tFor most wizards, I would say live with Greater Teleport and skip this.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"divination\">Divination<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Foresight<\/span>: You are warned of impending\n\tdanger, the most obvious mechanical benefits are that you are never surprised\n\tor flat footed. There is a small bonus to AC and Reflex saves (+2). That&#8217;s\n\tpretty much it. I would have thought some kind of initiative benefit would fit\n\tthis spell, but I guess that&#8217;s too powerful. If you are playing core\n\tpathfinder, the value of never being flat footed is OK, but not worth a 9th\n\tlevel spell (in 3.5 it was different, Foresight + Celerity meant that you\n\tcouldn&#8217;t lose initiative &#8211; no longer).<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchantment\">Enchantment<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Dominate Monster<\/a>: As the dominate person spell,\n\texcept it works on any creature. That means essentially save or lose. Also\n\tnote that dominate doesn&#8217;t mean you can have the creature do anything, things\n\t&#8220;against their nature&#8221; give them an extra saving throw. This spell is OK, but\n\tnot amazing.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Hold Monster, Mass<\/a>: A mass hold effect that\n\taffects creatures within 30&#8242; of each other. How many high level CR creatures\n\tcan you fit in 30&#8242;? Not many usually. I like mass save or lose, and this\n\tqualifies, but it&#8217;s not 9th level power.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Power Word Kill<\/a>: I mentioned the issue in Power\n\tWord Stun. PWK has the lowest HP limit of the power words (100 hp), and how do\n\tyou know when your opponent is under 100 hp? When they&#8217;re dead. Of course,\n\tthis spell doesn&#8217;t really have value at that point does it? Overall, I would\n\tsay this spell is actually worse than Power Word Stun. Not worth a 9th level\n\tslot.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evocation\">Evocation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Crushing Hand<\/a>: Works very much like the grasping\n\thand, except the bonuses are a bit better and it does some minor damage to the\n\tgrappled foe. Overall, I would not say this is all that much better than\n\tgrasping hand, so maybe it isn&#8217;t worth 2 levels higher.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Meteor Swarm<\/a>: There are minor differences, but this\n\tis really like firing 4 double wide fireballs for 6d6 each. Yes, you read that\n\tdamage correctly. In total you are doing 24d6 damage, FIRE damage. How many\n\tcreatures are immune to fire at this level? Well, the list of how many aren&#8217;t\n\twould probably be smaller. If this was &#8220;meteor explosion&#8221; damage or something\n\tinstead of fire damage (you can do bludgeoning damage by hitting someone\n\tdirectly &#8211; but not enough to mention) This spell has not been nerfed, it\n\talways sucked.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusion\">Illusion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Shades<\/span>: 80% real is pretty good, but once\n\tagain you are not getting a great variety of effects here. The weak SM VIII\n\tspell? Or maybe Incendiary cloud? This just isn&#8217;t giving you the bang for your\n\tbuck.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Weird<\/span>:&gt; We&#8217;ve seen mass save or dies at\n\tlower level, but have we seen mass save or dies that give the victims an extra\n\tsaving throw? No we haven&#8217;t. Hooray.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"necromancy\">Necromancy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Astral Projection<\/a>: Travelling to other planes of\n\texistence is neat, but dying via hordes of demons in the Abyss can be a drag,\n\tfor you and your allies. Fortunately, this spell keeps the good and eliminates\n\tany chance of the bad. Has your DM gotten smug when you&#8217;ve &#8220;killed&#8221; a demon on\n\tyour own plane, implying that said demon is alive and well on his own plane\n\tnow planning revenge? Well, turnabout is fair play. Welcome to the astral\n\tprojection spell. There is a 1,000 gp cost, which I hate &#8211; but this is\n\tdefinitely a party-share benefit, so should be a party-share cost. It&#8217;s\n\tactually circumstantial, but it&#8217;s get out of death free when travelling to\n\tother planes.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-green\">Energy Drain<\/a>: Subject gains 2d4 negative levels\n\t(yes they stack), so it&#8217;s like a doubled enervation. The Fort save is to\n\tregain those negative levels the next day, not reduce the level loss when you\n\tneed it. A solid debuff.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-orange\">Soul Bind<\/a>: Make it so the corpse simply cannot\n\tbe resurrected, by any means. Even Freedom doesn&#8217;t work. If keeping someone\n\tfrom being resurrected is important to you, then you have a multitude of\n\tspells to choose from over the past couple levels, this one is the most\n\tfoolproof.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-red\">Wail of the Banshee<\/a>:Ewww&#8230;.alright, do some damage\n\tto everyone close to you who fails a fort save. No targeting, so your friends\n\tare every bit as susceptible as your enemies. This is a bad spell.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation\">Transmutation<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Etherealness<\/span>: Like Ethereal Jaunt except you\n\ttake your friends. You all get to hold hands&#8230;awww. I&#8217;m not sure what 9th\n\tlevel spell value you are going to get from this. Walk through walls, escape\n\tdanger, yeah &#8211; you can do that kind of thing many levels ago. If there is some\n\tgreat use for this I&#8217;ve missed &#8211; let me know.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shapechange<\/span>: Almost enough to consider\n\tmelee, almost. You basically cast this on yourself and can switch between\n\tpretty much any of your previous polymorph spells once per round. Turn into a\n\tdragon for the blindsense, then a troll for regeneration, etc. Not massively\n\tpowerful like it once was, but certainly useful.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><a class=\"rating-blue\">Time Stop<\/a>: Time. Stop. Give yourself 1d4+1 rounds\n\tof free buffing, throwing prismatic spheres around foes, with nasty critters\n\tinside, or whatever. It&#8217;s Time Stop &#8211; I don&#8217;t need to sell this right?<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"universal\">Universal<\/h3>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wish<\/span>: Easily the most versatile spell in\n\tthe game. However, 25,000 gp PER CASTING. That&#8217;s some serious scratch. The\n\tspell needs a huge cost or it would be seriously broken if you could cast it\n\tregularly. However, you just can&#8217;t hope to cast this very often because of the\n\tterrible cost. Note that it is cheaper than the manuals that give insight\n\tbonuses to ability scores (slightly).<\/p\n>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do you mean by &#8220;GOD&#8221;?!?
