It relies heavily on the Monk\u2019s core features, adding onto the effects of Flurry of Blows, emphasizing the Monk&#8217;s ability to reposition and debuff enemies, and expanding the Monk&#8217;s exceptional mobility even further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Warrior of the Open Hand adds little to the Monk\u2019s damage output or durability. Instead, Open Hand Technique provides a small amount of crowd control. On top of the Monk\u2019s roles as a Scout and Striker, Open Hand allows you to add a little bit of Controller to your capabilities by allowing you forcibly reposition your enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This additional capability as a Controller makes the Open Hand Monk an effective force multiplier. The ability to both knock foes prone and reposition them significant distances makes the Open Hand Monk a powerful asset in a party with Blasters who can consistently produce area damage. Evoker Wizards work especially well, but anyone with a breath weapon or something similar will still enjoy your presence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD 5e rules.

Pushing an enemy out of reach\n\t\t\t\t\tand knocking them prone with falling damage means that you won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\ttrigger an Opportunity Attack and that your target is prone, combining\n\t\t\t\t\tthe benefits of Addle and Topple.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n<p>Note that this feature <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/sae\/sage-advice-compendium#SAC-Monk2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">intentionally ignore creature size<\/a>, unlike most push effects.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Topple<\/span>: A great way to knock\n\t\t\t\thigh-Strength foes prone.

This costs 4 FP to create the vibrations, then another attack during an\n\t\tAttack action to trigger the damage. The target makes a Constitution save,\n\t\tand since Constitution saves are consistently high, we need to expect\n\t\tenemies to pass the save. So is this worth the Focus Points to use?\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For 4 FP, you can trigger Flurry of Blows twice and Stunning Blow twice.\n\t\t\tThe 4 additional attacks compared to Martial Arts will deal 1d12+5 damage\n\t\t\teach. Assuming all four hit, that&#8217;s an average of 46 damage without\n\t\t\tconsidering the possibility of crits, falling damage from Open Hand\n\t\t\tTechnique, etc. The two Stunning Fist uses might rob the target of two\n\t\t\tturns.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>It&#8217;s difficult to make a direct comparison between Quivering Palm and our\n\t\t\tother options. Quivering Palm can be a big damage nuke delivered very\n\t\t\tquickly, but I don&#8217;t trust Constitution saves enough to make that gamble\n\t\t\tfrequently. Personally, I would rather use Stunning Fist and spend a turn\n\t\t\tpunching the target while they&#8217;re unable to retaliate.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Warrior of the Open Hand Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-monk\/#backgrounds\">typical Monk<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"species\">Warrior of the Open Hand Species<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-monk\/#species\">typical Monk<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Warrior of the Open Hand Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-monk\/#ability-scores\">typical Monk<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Warrior of the Open Hand Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the Open Hand Monk&#8217;s feat options are no different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-monk\/#species\">typical Monk<\/a>.

Roughly 6 months after publishing that guide, the same advice started appearing on TikTok, Youtube, and other social platforms where other DnD content creators discuss character optimization. Not long after that, Wizards of the Coast caught on and started experimenting with &#8220;horizontally away&#8221; in the Unearthed Arcana playtest for the 2024 rules, eventually settling on &#8220;directly away&#8221;, which better conveys the intended behavior. The vast majority of push effects in the 2024 rules now use &#8220;directly away&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly, WotC left Open Hand Technique&#8217;s push option unchanged. The wording still just says &#8220;away&#8221;. It&#8217;s not clear if WotC just missed one instance, or if they saw what I did with the 2014 rules and said &#8220;You know what? That&#8217;s the most Monk thing we&#8217;ve ever seen. Leave it in.&#8221; Regardless, it means that our 2014 shenanigans work almost completely unchanged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m not going to recycle those tactics. That&#8217;s boring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to get <em>so much worse<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build is a highly mobile melee controller that relies on pushing and grappling to reposition enemies. Like our 2014 Open Hand Monk build, it thrives when paired with a friendly blaster. But, unlike the 2014 build, this build is much better equipped to capitalize on clever use of terrain. A big part of playing this build will depend on your own awareness of the world around you, often extending much further away <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fairly standard for the Monk.

Hit an enemy with an Unarmed Strike and grapple them (remember that you can use Dexterity for your save DC), then spend the rest of the turn attacking them with Advantage.<br><br>As cool as Advantage is, Grappler&#8217;s Fast Wrestler feature is the real reason why we&#8217;re here. The ability to move a grapple allows us to precisely reposition grappled enemies, and it&#8217;s limited only by how far we can move in a turn. Step of the Wind allows us to Dash as a Bonus Action at no Focus Point cost, and we can combine that with Unarmored Movement and Feline Agility to have 160 feet of movement without consuming our Action. This gives us enough movement to put our grappled enemy wherever we want, including far away in a separate room where they&#8217;ll need to spend two turns Dashing to get back into combat.<br><br>If you have an ally that can cast Spike Growth, the whole game is now on easy mode. Cheese grater your problems at super speed.<br><br>Keep in mind that Feline Agility only recharges if you spend a turn not moving, so you may need to drag yourself back at normal speed. Alternatively, you and your unwilling passenger can spend a turn fighting one-on-one (which is often a winning decision thanks to Deflect Attacks) before you super speed back to the party.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br>Stunning Strike<\/td><td>Extra Attack is fantastic. While we can&#8217;t use Grappler to damage+grapple on more than one attack, we can still grapple one creature per empty hand, allowing us to forcibly Tabaxi taxi two enemies out of an encounter, leaving the rest of the party to handle whatever remains while we race back to help.<br><br>Be cautious about doing this. Leaving yourself alone with two enemies makes you very vulnerable to crowd control effects or surprise critical hits. It can also leave enemies to go join up with other groups of enemies, compounding the difficulty of later encounters. If you&#8217;re going to place enemies outside of combat, do it somewhere that&#8217;s inconvenient for them and relatively safe for you.<br><br>If our enemies are too large to grapple, punt them 20 feet into the air. Open Hand Technique doesn&#8217;t care how big they are.<br><br>Also remember that we don&#8217;t need to use these grapple tactics purely offensively. Creatures can choose to fail a saving throw, so you can grapple your allies to reposition them. You have better speed than anyone in the party, so, in an encounter with a lot of space, dragging allies around can tip things in your favor in a way that enemies have no way to counter.<br><br>This is also the level at which Haste becomes an option. An ally casting Haste on you makes all of this doubly effective.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Unarmored Movement + 15 ft.<br>Empowered Strikes<br>Wholeness of Body<\/td><td>Empowered Strikes lets us get past nearly all damage resistances.<br><br>Wholeness of Body provides a splash of healing. It&#8217;s not enough to feel exciting.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Evasion<\/td><td>Always fantastic.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: Dex 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>We do want more feats, but we also really need Dexterity to support all of our various shenanigans.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Acrobatic Movement<\/td><td>The intent of this feature is to allow monks to perform incredible feats of physicality, allowing you to non-magically traverse all sorts of terrain. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do. Sort of.<br><br>Acrobatic Movement doesn&#8217;t care if we&#8217;re grappling. Now we can use Acrobatic Movement to drag our enemies across liquid surfaces or up vertical surfaces. That&#8217;s right, we can grapple enemies and run them straight up a wall.<br><br>With 45 feet of movement, Dash as a Bonus Action, and Feline Agility, we have 180 feet of movement to work with. Grapple an enemy, haul them up the tallest vertical thing you can find, and drop them. If you don&#8217;t have enough movement to run back down the wall, that&#8217;s fine. You have Slow Fall, and you can negate 45 points of falling damage at this level. Maximum fall damage is 20d6 (average 70), so you&#8217;re racing toward the ability to negate average fall damage from terminal velocity.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Unarmored Movement + 20 ft.<br>Heightened Focus<br>Self-Restoration<\/td><td>Heightened Focus further expands our Tabaxi taxi capabilities. If you spend a Focus Point when you use Step of the Wind, you can now bring a willing creature with you. You can grapple one ally with each hand and drag a third along behind you with Step of the Wind, allowing you to transport a party of 4 at Tabaxi taxi speed. If you Dash as your Action in the same turn and use Feline Agility, you can haul your entire party 300 feet in 6 seconds, which is roughly 34 miles per hour. You&#8217;re a Tabaxi taxi moving at actual taxi can speed (albeit briefly).<br><br>Heightened Focus also takes Flurry of Blows from 2 attacks to 3 attacks, making Open Hand Technique even more awesome.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Fleet Step<\/td><td>We&#8217;ve been using Step of the Wind frequently until this point. Now we can go back to always punching things with our Bonus Action because we get the free Dash anyway.<br><br>We have enough speed and attacks at this point that we can start Tabaxi taxi-ing enemies in batches. We have 5 attacks in total, so we could theoretically grapple and move 5 enemies, dropping them as we go only to run back to grab more. You can drag all of your enemies into a nice, neat ball, then race back to safety before your party fireballs the lot of them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Speedy<br>Con 15 -&gt; 16<\/td><td>+10 feet of speed brings us to 60 feet, raises our Constitution modifier to +3, and now we feel much safer running through enemies&#8217; reach when we&#8217;re playing the Tabaxi  taxi.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Deflect Energy<\/td><td>Yes, now you can deflect Eldritch Blast.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Unarmored Movement + 25 ft.<br>Disciplined Survivor<\/td><td>Proficiency in all saving throws, including death saves. Also, we get even faster.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Perfect Focus<\/td><td>Open Hand Technique requires us to use Flurry of Blows, so starting a fight with no Focus Points is very limiting.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>ASI: Wis 16 -&gt; 18<\/td><td>Boring, but impactful.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Quivering Palm<\/td><td>65 damage in exchange for 2 attacks and 4 FP on a Con save for half. Using those points for Flurry of Blows and Stunning Strike will be more impactful in an extended fight.<br><br>Quivering Palm&#8217;s appeal is speed. Use it to quickly eliminate high-priority targets when you just need to nuke something real fast. This isn&#8217;t a go-to tactic, but it is a tool in your toolbox.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Unarmored Movement + 30 ft.<br>Superior Defense<\/td><td>Our speed is now 70 feet.<br><br>We won&#8217;t need Superior Defense often. Save it for really hard fights.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Epic Boon: Boon of Speed<br>Dexterity 20 -&gt; 21<\/td><td>Another 30 feet of speed dramatically expands the range at which we can do our Tabaxi taxi shenanigans.<br><br>With a speed of 100 feet before considering buffs like Longstrider and Haste) and a guaranteed Dash every turn, we can give ourselves 400 feet of movement without spending our Action, easy allowing us to run two enemies up a wall 200 feet, drop them for 20d6 damage each, fall down while negating the fall damage, then potentially grapple them again, and then drag them up the wall <em>again<\/em>. If you manage this, I recommend running back within 5 feet of the ground to avoid taking fall damage and falling prone.<br><br>And to think. Other Monks are just punching people, while you&#8217;re doing 20d6 to two targets and <em>also<\/em> punching people. <br><br>Sure, this requires a 200-foot-tall vertical service, and those are vanishingly rare. But anything 30 feet tall or taller is enough to justify Tabaxi taxi-ing an enemy up a wall instead of just hitting them. If there&#8217;s a body of water nearby, you can run them 200 feet off shore and make them swim back at half speed.<br><br>Barring those options, we can still haul enemies ridiculously far away to inconvenient places and either solo them or abandon them there.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Body and Mind<\/td><td>That math feels so good. We didn&#8217;t get our Wisdom to 20, so we&#8217;re not at 24 Dex\/24 Wis, but 24\/22 is still pretty awesome.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The most \u201cgeneric\u201d of the Monk\u2019s subclasses, the Warrior of the Open Hand Monk is perhaps the most illustrative of the Monk as a class.
