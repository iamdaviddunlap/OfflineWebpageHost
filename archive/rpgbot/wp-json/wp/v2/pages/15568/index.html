If you\u2019re presenting bodies for enemies to attack that don\u2019t belong to the player characters, you\u2019re preventing that damage from being dealt to them. Starting at level 6, if we ignore setup time and just think about using Animate Dead for the \u201cmaintain control on 4 skeletons\u201d features, that\u2019s a 3rd-level spell slot to prevent roughly 76 damage to people who, unlike your skeletons, you can\u2019t just reanimate back into the same form later for no cost beyond another 3rd level spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>5e certainly doesn\u2019t have the absurd capacity for controlling undead armies that 3.x did (a character I created once as a thought experiment could command something like 80,000 hit dice worth of skeletons at 20th level, all of which were immune to cold and fire damage and would explode in a burst that damaged living things and healed other undead near them when they died), but this handbook will guide you through making the best we can out of this incredibly popular trope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">School of Necromancy Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-necromancy-ability-scores\">School of Necromancy Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-necromancy-races\">School of Necromancy Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-necromancy-feats\">School of Necromancy Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-necromancy-weapons\">School of Necromancy Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-necromancy-armor\">School of Necromancy Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-necromancer-build-the-queen-decrees-six-linked-minions\">Example Necromancer Build &#8211; The Queen Decrees: Six Linked Minions<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Strangely, this feature incentivizes you to use your two free\n\t\tspells learned per level to learn literally anything except spells from your\n\t\tfavorite school.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Grim Harvest<\/span>: \nRAW you can use this on any creature, so there&#8217;s nothing to stop you\n\t\tfrom carrying a bag of rats for you to &#8220;harvest&#8221; when you need hit points.\n\t\tUnfortunately, there aren&#8217;t many leveled necromancy spells which\n\t\tcan kill a creature, and many of them are weak. The lowest-level option is Ray of Sickness.\n\t\t<p>For maximum efficiency, cast leveled spells with long durations and ongoing\n\t\tdamage like Vampiric Touch, then kill one rat per turn. Vampiric Touch also heals\non its own, so you can combine it with the bag\n\t\t\tof rats trick to double-dip on healing (though Vampiric Touch can&#8217;t heal\n\t\t\tyou more than the target&#8217;s hit points, and rats have 1 hp).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>There is some ambiguity about how this works with the spell Summon\n\t\t\tUndead. Summon Undead is a necromancy spell, and the summoned creature is\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s &#8220;effect&#8221;, so killing a creature with your summoned undead may\n\t\t\tqualify to trigger Grim Harvest. As a DM, I would not allow this because\n\t\t\tthe creature&#8217;s attacks are not the spell itself and because allowing it\n\t\t\twould immediately become a problem. Along the same lines: the effect of\n\t\t\tAnimate Dead is to create an undead creature. That creature killing\n\t\t\tsomething is not part of the spell&#8217;s effect and therefore doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tqualify.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Undead Thralls<\/span>: Additional hit points and\n\t\tdamage will make your pet undead considerably more lethal. Remember that\n\t\thaving more undead will require you to spend more spell slots every day to\n\t\tkeep them under control, so don&#8217;t have too many. Instead, try to focus on\n\t\thaving a few undead that you can rely upon and move about without\n\t\ttoo much trouble. See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/animating-the-dead\/\">Practical Guide to Animating the Dead<\/a>\nfor help with the relevant spells.\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t appear to work with the Summon Undead spell.\n\t\t\tSummon Undead <em>summons<\/em> an undead creature, and Undead Thralls only\n\t\t\tapplies if you <em>create<\/em> the undead creature.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inured to Undeath<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\tthematically appropriate. There aren&#8217;t spells that let you take control of\n\t\tundead that you stumble across or reassert control of undead which you\n\t\tcreate after you&#8217;ve lost control of them, so sometimes you&#8217;ll run into a\n\t\tshadow or something and need to actually fight them. Command Undead reduces\n\t\tthis risk somewhat, but you can only use it to control one undead at a time,\n\t\tso undead which can reduce your hit point maximum remain a risk.\n\t\t<p>The immunity to hit point reduction, while intended to address a common\n\t\t\tside-effect of attacks by undead creatures, isn&#8217;t limited to those attacks:\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re still immune to hit point reduction from other sources. For\n\t\t\texample, the spells Create Homunculus and Create Magen both require you to\n\t\t\treduce your hit point maximum as part of the spells.<\/p>\n<p>Immunity to hit point\n\t\t\treduction removes that cost, so your Homunculus can perpetually have half\n\t\t\tof your hit dice at no cost to your hit point maximum, and so long as you\n\t\t\thave the gold, you can create a small army of magens to serve you where\n\t\t\tundead might not do the job (i.e. almost anywhere with living people). I\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t think that this was an intentional rules interaction, so your DM\n\t\t\tmight not be thrilled about it. Please be careful not to abuse it too\n\t\t\theavily.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Command Undead<\/span>: This is a very useful\n\t\tability if you have enemies which command undead or which are undead\n\t\tthemselves, but the fact that intelligent undead (very common by this level)\n\t\tget Advantage on the save makes this ability hard to use effectively. Some\n\t\thigh-CR undead like the Nightwalker are tempting targets, but unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tactively seeking them out (and your DM is silly enough to let you find and\n\t\tenslave one) you can&#8217;t count on just stumbling upon a suitable target.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-necromancy-ability-scores\">School of Necromancy Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No change from any other Wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: We are not a muscle Wizard.

You need an attack roll to hit, then it deals less damage than Chromatic Orb, and it has to be the single most resisted damage type in the game, then it asks for a Con save (the perpetually highest type past CR 2) to apply a condition which many things are, once again, immune to. Just don\u2019t.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Faerie Fire (Racial)<br>&#8211; Maximilian\u2019s Earthen Grasp<br>&#8211; Phantasmal Force<\/td><td>Faire Fire will likely be your go-to concentration spell against multiple targets, especially since you get one free per day. It\u2019s not control, but it definitely amplifies party damage which is the next best thing.<br>So then we just need single-target control, and we get that with two excellent save-or-sucks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Telekinetic (Int)<br><br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/mage-hand\/\">Mage Hand<\/a><br><br>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Invisibility<br>&#8211; Wither and Bloom<\/td><td>Since we can take our class features in any order, we grab Mage Hand first, then take Telekinetic to extend the range and grant all the other usual benefits.<br><br>Wither and Bloom is a great replacement to Sleep in your prepared spell list. The damage, unfortunately, still targets a Con save, but this can be the follow up to Fireball which we get at next level, hoping to cull any remaining enemies and heal us accordingly. It also allows for some combat healing. It doesn\u2019t specify that the creature you choose has to be conscious to take advantage of this effect, so you can very much use it to stand up a downed party member as long as they have hit dice left. Especially useful for making it so the healer who dropped doesn\u2019t have to resurrect in town.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Spells:<br>&#8211; Enlarge\/Reduce (Racial)<br>&#8211; Fireball<br>&#8211; Haste<\/td><td>Haste is an interesting pick on this character. Obviously, it\u2019s good for many types of party member. Interestingly, it can also be a good choice to increase the minion speed for, say, the one skeleton you\u2019ve been able to equip very well with full armor and two swords, perhaps even a magical sword if you\u2019ve found such a mass of iron that no one else needed.<br><br>You\u2019ll notice a lack of Tiny Hut appearing here. You can spend the money to put it in your book if you like and cast it as a ritual, but keep in mind that you have 4 permanent guards that don\u2019t need to sleep.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Undead Thralls<br><br>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Animate Dead (Free)<br>&#8211; Vampiric Touch<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#summon-undead\">Summon Undead<\/a><\/td><td>Hoo boy, what a level. First off, Undead Thralls comes online, <em>dramatically<\/em> increasing the damage and durability of the skeletons we can now create with Animate Dead, a spell which we also get for free at this level. As Rocco pointed out, any bones will do, even bones that have been a skeleton already which got knocked back into a pile of loose bones by receiving fatal damage.<br><br>Since we can control 4 of them with one 3rd-level spell slot, and we get two of those a day, spend a day casting it twice to animate two each time, then spend one slot per day maintaining control.<br><br>I mentioned that Telekinetic is good to always have a bonus action. You may look at the bonus action cost of redirecting your skeletons and think that you\u2019ll be doing that frequently. The thing is, they will continue to carry out the last order you gave them until you issue a new one. Skeletons have Intelligence 6, which means they can discern, for instance, if you tell them \u201cattack anything I point to\u201d and then you just have to point to things, which isn\u2019t an action.<br><br>If that feels too much like cheese to you, \u201cstand next to [party member] and attack anything that tries to hurt them\u201d is a single order without a defined completion. It feels like maybe WoTC were trying to make it so you spent your bonus action controlling your skeletons more frequently, but they certainly left the wording vague enough that you don\u2019t have to.<br><br>That leaves you a slot each day to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#summon-undead\">summon a skeleton mage<\/a>. Starting next level, you won\u2019t have to rely on dead reckoning to get your party where they need to go thanks to Arcane Eye.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Spells:<br>&#8211; Arcane Eye<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">Polymorph<\/a><\/td><td>Arcane Eye is one of the best scouting spells in the game. You can now map an entire dungeon before going inside. Many doors will have a 1-inch gap on or around them, even if it\u2019s as simple as a keyhole or the gap between the door and the floor.<br><br>Polymorph, on the other hand, lets you take on a stat block. Flavor is free, and nothing prevents you from turning yourself or one of your minions into a skeletal version of the beast which has an identical stat block to the non-skeletal version.<br><br>With that said, I\u2019m going to plug the utility of using this slot to upcast Summon Undead. It will give your minion more health, but, more importantly, it will give them an extra attack. Also keep in mind that you get an hour of your skeleton mage before it crumbles to dust, so you can very easily bring that through a couple fights and multiply the value of the spell slot.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Int 18 -&gt; 20)<br>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Evard\u2019s Black Tentacles<br>&#8211; Stone Shape<\/td><td>Apart from now being able to be a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9QuZ-veeqCo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tyrannosaurus skeleton<\/a>, there isn\u2019t much particularly interesting for this character at this level. We add an area-of-effect control spell and a tool for later, but, just like last level, I\u2019m going to talk about the value of upcasting again.<br><br>If you use a 4th-level slot for Animate Dead, you can control 6 skeletons\/zombies with one spell. Those 6 linked skeletons make excellent meat shields, and focusing these predators into a feeding frenzy on a new target only takes a bonus action. Between that, the minion speed I talked about earlier, and the minion damage multiplier from Faerie Fire, you\u2019re basically set.<br><br>Your skeletons will only continue to get tankier thanks to the scaling from levels due to Undead Thralls, your ability to afford better armor, and later your capacity to shield them with your charismatic energy when you pick up Inspiring Leader.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Spells:<br>&#8211; Danse Macabre<br>&#8211; Synaptic Static<\/td><td>If you just want to animate a huge pile of additional skeletons on top of your permanent ones, press the <s>Vaal<\/s> Danse Macabre button on the pile of corpses you keep in your bag of holding for just such an occasion. You are creating them, so, unlike the Summon spell, each corpse will get the benefits of your passive ability Undead Thralls.<br><br>Synaptic Static is here because it\u2019s one of the rare debuffs that doesn\u2019t require concentration to maintain.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>New Cantrip:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/shape-water\/\">Shape Water<\/a><br><br>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Telekinesis<br>&#8211; Wall of Stone<br><br>Inured to Death<\/td><td>You know what every proper Necromancer needs?

We can\u2019t lose hit point maximum, so nothing apart from monetary cost should prevent you from making as many of these as you want. Fill the hallways of your Guards and Wards\u2019ed hideout with things capable of shooting lightning bolts that deal half damage on a save. Galvan magens are immune to lightning, so they can friendly-fire each other with no harm done. Demos magen are also great if you just want to spend all of your money creating minions capable of shooting bows at things.<br><br>In combat, though, you\u2019ll want to use your 7th-level slot on Finger of Death as something is close to dying. It creates (not summons) a zombie, so it gets your bonuses, and the control is permanent. If you\u2019re not good-aligned, you may want to keep a stock of humanoids on hand and farm up a bunch of zombies before heading out on your next adventure.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Command Undead<br>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Reverse Gravity<br>&#8211; Teleport<\/td><td>As I\u2019ve mentioned before, Reverse Gravity is a death sentence for anything that can\u2019t move while up in the air.
