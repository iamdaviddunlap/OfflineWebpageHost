The Druid Circle of Wildfire turns this simple fact into a very cohesive theme for a subclass. The Wildfire Druid is set up as a healing support, with tools for positioning and bonuses to healing magic, that also has an array of fire spells not normally on the Druid list. Together with the already impressive Druid spell list, this package allows for a flexible role on the battlefield where round by round the Wildfire druid can switch from damage to support depending on which spells it casts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>One could argue that the abundance of fire resistance and immunity cause us\n\tproblems in the long run. Sure, if all we ever did was fire spells that would\n\tbe an issue, but we have options. And the fire damage from the Wildfire Spirit\n\tis really just an extra bonus. If all it had was a 15-foot combat teleport for\n\tallies it would still be just as useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a little hybrid role action, halfway between blaster\n\tand healer, this subclass may be exactly what you&#8217;re looking for.

At just 10 Strength and small size it&#8217;s not strong enough to\n\t\tcarry anything of significant weight, so its function is almost purely\n\t\tcombative. The 30 ft. fly speed allows it to remain safely out of melee\n\t\tcombat, which is good since it has a small pool of hit points and just 13\n\t\tAC. The 1-hour duration and 2 Wild Shape uses per Short Rest will keep your\n\t\tspirit around for a big chunk of the day, but if you&#8217;re on your second use\n\t\tbe cautious about your spirit&#8217;s hit points, and if your spirit goes down try\n\t\tto get a Short Rest as quickly as possible.\n\t\t<p>The Wildfire Spirit also has a short-range teleportation option which\n\t\t\tleaves a small fire damage AOE in its wake. Even though the 15-foot\n\t\t\tteleportation range is very small, it&#8217;s enough to get an ally out of a\n\t\t\tgrapple and out of melee reach, as well as to get the party through many\n\t\t\tbarriers like portcullises, doors, and windows which would normally block\n\t\t\tpassage but you can still see past.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The Wildfire Spirit has two crucial limitations. First, and most obvious,\n\t\t\tis fire damage. Fire resistance and immunity are common, and Elemental\n\t\t\tAdept doesn&#8217;t help your Wildfire Spirit&#8217;s fire damage. Second, it can only\n\t\t\tattack targets which you can see and teleport to places that you can see.\n\t\t\tIf you&#8217;re blind or just can&#8217;t make line of sight, your spirit is mostly\n\t\t\tuseless.<\/p>\n<p>Even with those limitations, for an hour the Druid more or less has the damage of an extra cantrip as a bonus action on every round, and that adds up.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhanced Bond<\/span>: The bonus to damage and\n\t\thealing is fantastic on its own, applying not just to cantrips but also to\n\t\tyour leveled spells. 1d8 damage\/healing doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but that&#8217;s\n\t\tequivalent to adding a spell level for many spells like Burning Hands, Cure\n\t\tWounds. Just remember that your spirit needs to be summoned, so if you&#8217;re\n\t\tout of Wild Shape uses and your spirit is down, consider a Short Rest as\n\t\tsoon as possible.\n\t\t<p>The second portion of this feature allows you to originate spells from\n\t\t\tyour spirit instead of from yourself. Druids are notoriously frail (medium\n\t\t\tarmor, no metal, d8 hit dice), so allowing you to cast short-range spells\n\t\t\tlike Burning Hands while remaining at a safe distance is a huge benefit.\n\t\t\tThe spirit&#8217;s ability to fly makes this especially useful because you can\n\t\t\ttarget cones straight down and effectively get a circular AOE against\n\t\t\ttargets on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>However, remember that the spirit takes its turn immediately after yours, so positioning for this tactic can be difficult. Be aware that using the Ready action on a spell takes your Concentration so whatever else you were already Concentrating on will end if you try to Ready a spell for when the Wildfire Spirit is in position to deliver a spell.<\/p>\n<p>Also do note that this is not limited to your Druid spells. A good little combo if you for example dipped a level into Cleric is to fly the spirit up to a surrounded ally, use a readied Word of Radiance excluding the ally from the AoE, then using Fiery Teleport to evacuate the ally while adding even more damage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Cauterizing Flames<\/span>: 2d10+Wisdom is a\n\t\tdecent amount of healing or damage, especially as a Reaction. Provided that\n\t\tthere are multiple foes in an encounter, picking off the weak ones and\n\t\tstrategically applying this healing or dragging enemies through a spectral\n\t\tflame to damage them can have a significant impact. However, to make that\n\t\twork your party will need mechanisms to push, pull, drag, or otherwise\n\t\treposition your enemies.\n\t\t<p>Limiting this to your Reaction and proficiency bonus times per long rest prevents you and your allies from running\n\t\t\tthrough a series of these spectral flames in one turn to rapidly heal, and\n\t\t\tlimiting the whole effect to small or larger creatures prevents\n\t\t\tshenanigans like murdering a bag of rats and rolling your party through\n\t\t\tthe spectral flames to produce bottomless healing. WotC really nailed the\n\t\t\tlimitations on this one, so go-to abuse cases don&#8217;t apply. However, if you\n\t\t\twalk into a room full of goblins or kobolds, it starts to look like a room\n\t\t\tfull of health potions.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blazing Revival<\/span>: Half hit points is enough\n\t\tto get you back up and fighting without going back down immediately, and\n\t\tsacrificing your wildfire spirit to make this happen is absolutely worth the\n\t\tcost since you can just resummon it, provided that you still have a Wild\n\t\tShape use to do so. You only get to use this once per day, but hopefully\n\t\tthat&#8217;s enough, and if you&#8217;re ever unsure you can always retreat and live to\n\t\tfight another day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-wildfire-ability-scores\">Circle of Wildfire Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We are a Druid and we need to spend our Wildshape uses on our Flame Spirit so\n\twe&#8217;ll need some physical stats to keep ourselves safe.

This is not that impressive by\n\t\t\titself, but that flat amount is applied to every individual goodberry from\n\t\t\tthe spell. That&#8217;s 40 hit points from a 1st level spell slot, and upcasting\n\t\t\tadds 10 hit points per level. Eat these after every combat to stay topped\n\t\t\toff.<\/li>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span>: Light cantrip is ok.

Voice\n\t\t\tof Authority has a great interaction with Wildfire. Ready to cure an ally,\n\t\t\tsend in the spirit to deliver the cure spell, ally swings, and spirit\n\t\t\tevacs the ally. Or make the ready trigger \u201cafter my spirit performs the\n\t\t\thelp action\u201d and send in an assist to grant Advantage on the reaction\n\t\t\tswing. Rogues love this trick.
