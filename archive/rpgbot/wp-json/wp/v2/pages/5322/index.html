It&#8217;s hard to time, it&#8217;s hard to use, and it&#8217;s hard to not do just as\n\t\tmuch damage to your party.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hexes<\/span>: A couple of decent combat buff\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Master<\/span> (Ex): This is good if you\n\t\twant to serve as a Defender. The two bonus feats allow you to take Weapon\n\t\tFocus on your own if you choose to do so.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Ward<\/span> (Su): The duration is\n\t\tfantastic, and it&#8217;s nice that the bonus doesn&#8217;t disappear immediately like\n\t\tthe Ward Hex.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Curse of Suffering<\/span> (Su): Bleed effects are\n\t\tmediocre, and adding one more point of damage per round won&#8217;t change that.\n\t\tSlowing enemies&#8217; healing is interesting, but very situational.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Eyes of Battle<\/span> (Su): Very situational, not\n\t\tvery effective, and limited uses per day for some reason.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hampering Hex<\/span> (Su): Evil Eye is\n\t\tconsiderably more versatile, though the penalty doesn&#8217;t scale.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Animal<\/span>: Unless you take Improved\n\tFamiliar to get something that can fight, your familiar should never need\n\tAC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Ability &#8211; Battle Spirit<\/span> (Su): A\n\tdecent buff, and it scales a bit as you level. Unfortunately, you won&#8217;t get\n\tmany rounds per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spirit Ability &#8211; Enemies&#8217; Bane<\/span> (Su):\n\tBane is fantastic when it works, but its versatility is limited. This allows\n\tyou to pick whatever bane fits the current encounter, which means that it will\n\talways apply. You can probably expect to have 4 or 5 uses, which should be\n\tenough that you don&#8217;t need to be careful about saving uses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">True Spirit Ability &#8211; Paragon of Battle<\/span> (Su):\n\tThe duration is too short for Deadly Juggernaut to get you anything useful,\n\tand by this level you should be permanently enlarged if you want to be\n\tenlarged at all.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Manifestation<\/span>: The ability to move and make\n\ta full attack in the same turn is the holy grail of melee combat. The other\n\tbonuses are nice, but situational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bones\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classes\/shaman.html#bones-spirit\">Bones<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bones adds some great save or suck and save or die spells, as well as a<br>couple of effects to control undead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Magic Spells<\/span>: Almost all of the\n\toptions are good, and some excellent AOE save or die options are include.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cause fear<\/span>: Not very good, and it stops\n\t\tfunctioning very early.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">false life<\/span>: Temporary hit points with\n\t\thours\/level duration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">animate dead<\/span>: Pet zombies!<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">fear<\/span>: AOE panic. Not the best save or\n\t\tsuck effect, but if you can force enemies into a corner they become coup de\n\t\tgrace bait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">slay living<\/span>: Decent single-target damage,\n\t\tbut it doesn&#8217;t scale well.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">circle of death<\/span>: AOE save or die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">control undead<\/span>: Fantastic way to handle\n\t\tmindless undead, and to expand your collection of undead servants.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">horrid wilting<\/span>: Decent single-target\n\t\tdamage, but at this level you can use save or die spells with the save\n\t\tDC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">wail of the banshee<\/span>: AOE Save or die.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hexes<\/span>: A few decent options, but nothing\n\tthat you absolutely need to have.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bone Lock<\/span> (Su): This isn&#8217;t great until\n\t\tlevel 8, but then it becomes very effective. The 16th-level version is even\n\t\tbetter. Unforunately Fortitude saves tend to be the highest save, and there\n\t\tare other Hexes which will completely disable enemies with a single save at\n\t\tany level.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bone Ward<\/span> (Su): The duration is far too\n\t\tshort for this to be worthwhile. Use the Ward Hex instead.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deathly Being<\/span> (Su): This is great if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re in an evil party because you will have easier access to negative\n\t\tenergy than to positive energy.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fearful Gaze<\/span> (Su): Making a creature\n\t\tfrightened or panicked is a great way to get them out of combat. Making them\n\t\tshaken is pointless unless you&#8217;re combining it with another effect, so don&#8217;t\n\t\tpick this up until at least 8th level.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Grave Sight<\/span> (Su): Very situational, and the\n\t\tlimited number of rounds is terribly low.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Animal<\/span>: A constant 20% miss chance\n\tis great, and with constant concealment, your Spirit Animal can hide wherever\n\tit wants.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spirit Ability &#8211; Touch of the Grave<\/span> (Su):\n\tInflict Light Wounds is better, but you can use it as free healing for\n\tyourself and your undead buddies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Spirit Ability &#8211; Shard Soul<\/span> (Su):\n\tDR is great, but by this level most enemies will have the ability bypass\n\tDR\/magic. The spike burst is a cool ability, and it&#8217;s nice when you get mobbed\n\tbe enemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Spirit Ability &#8211; Shedding Form<\/span> (Su):\n\tFantastic both offensively and defensively.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Manifestation<\/span>: Bleed and Stabilize are\n\tfairly pointless at this level, but animate dead for free is a great way to\n\tget an army, and Power Word Kill with a 50% hit point cap is extremely\n\tpowerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"flame\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classes\/shaman.html#flame-spirit\">Flame<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flame is one of the better elemental Spirits. The spell list is fantastic,<br>and includes several excellent Blaster and Controller spells. However, the<br>poor Hexes and abilities offset how fantastic the spell list is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Magic Spells<\/span>: Almost all of the\n\toptions are fantastic. This spell list turns the Shaman into a viable\n\tBlaster.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Burning hands<\/span>: Poor damage, but it&#8217;s a\n\t\tfirst-level AOE blast.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">resist energy<\/span>: Essential at any level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">fireball<\/span>: Excellent AOE damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">wall of fire<\/span>: Great area control.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">summon monster V (fire elementals)<\/span>: Very\n\t\tlimiting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">fire seeds<\/span>: The holly berries option is\n\t\tinsane. Charge eight berries, then some time in the next hour or two, drop\n\t\tthem in the other guy&#8217;s square, and step back out of the 5 foot blast\n\t\tradius. Trigger all 8 for for 8d8 plus 8 times your caster level. The acorn\n\t\tversion is bad.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">fire storm<\/span>: Excellent AOE damage, and 4d6\n\t\tongoing fire damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">incendiary cloud<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t great,\n\t\tbut this is still a great area control spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">fiery body<\/span>: Fantastic buff.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hexes<\/span>: Gaze of flams is a great utility,\n\tbut the other hexes are all situational or bad.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cinder Dance<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire Nimbus<\/span> (Su): Situational. Good luck\n\t\ttargeting an invisible creature with it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flame Curse<\/span> (Su): Useless until 8th\n\t\tlevel unless someone else in the party is dealing fire damage. Beyond that,\n\t\tit&#8217;s passable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gaze of Flames<\/span> (Su): The ability to see\n\t\tthrough smoke\/fog is really only helpful if you create it. The ability to\n\t\tuse Clairvoyance without casting a spell is the biggest draw here.\n\t\tClairvoyance is fantastic for scouting safely, and because you can stretch\n\t\tthe rounds out however you like, you can do lots of short scouts throughout\n\t\tthe day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ward of Flames<\/span> (Su): The damage is too bad\n\t\tto use in combat, and duration is too poor to use before most combats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Animal<\/span>: Immunity to fire is pretty\n\tgreat, but the constant light really hurts your familiar&#8217;s ability to serve as\n\ta Scout.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Ability &#8211; Touch of Flame<\/span> (Su):\n\tDecent and reliable, but the damage doesn&#8217;t scale well and the user per day\n\tdepend on Charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Spirit Ability &#8211; Fiery Soul<\/span> (Su):\n\tA bit of resistance and a cone of fire with poor damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">True Spirit Ability &#8211; Elemental Form<\/span> (Su):\n\tAssuming that you are built to survive in melee, suddenly becoming a Huge\n\telemental can be a great option for you. The elemental&#8217;s Burn effect is\n\tlargely pointless, but the fire elemental is still one of the better options\n\tfor Elemental Body.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Manifestation<\/span>: More energy resistance, and\n\tfree metamagic on fire spells. The metamagic feats are only +1 spell level,\n\tbut free metamagic is still fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"heavens\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classes\/shaman.html#heavens-spirit\">Heavens<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Heavens spirit provides a great mix of utility and offensive options,<br>\n\tallowing the Shaman to serve as a Blaster and a Support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Magic Spells<\/span>: Lots of good options\n\tacross all spell levels.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Color spray<\/span>: Excellent save or suck at low\n\t\tlevels, and it remains viable far longer than Sleep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">hypnotic pattern<\/span>: Good crowd control.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">daylight<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">rainbow pattern<\/span>: Good crowd control.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">overland flight<\/span>: With hours\/level\n\t\tduration, you should cast this every day and never touch the ground except\n\t\tto sleep on it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">chain lightning<\/span>: Good multiple-target\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">prismatic spray<\/span>: Excellent, though\n\t\tsomewhat unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">sunburst<\/span>: Poorly written and difficult to\n\t\tinterpret.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">meteor swarm<\/span>: Very flashy, but not as\n\t\tpowerful as it should be for a 9th-level spell.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hexes<\/span>: Lure of the Heaves is the only\n\tthing that you really need to have.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Enveloping Void<\/span> (Su): There are plenty of\n\t\teffects which will work better against a single enemy with the same save.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guiding Star<\/span> (Su): Situational, but if\n\t\tyou do all of your adventuring outside at night, it could be helpful.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heaven&#8217;s Leap<\/span> (Su): Situational.\n\t\tBasically Dimension Door with worse range.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lure of the Heavens<\/span> (Su): Flight is the\n\t\tonly part of this Hex that actually matters, but flight is fantastic.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Starburn<\/span> (Su): Decent single-target\n\t\tdamage.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Animal<\/span>: This is somewhat comical. I\n\tcan just imagine the Shaman waving around his pet frog trying to get a look at\n\tthe stars, and the frog attempting to use its fly speed to very slowly escape.\n\tIn all seriousness, this is a decent ability. 5 feet of flight isn&#8217;t much, but\n\tany flight at all is very useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Ability &#8211; Stardust<\/span> (Sp): Like a\n\tmediocre version of Glitterfust. You can&#8217;t hit invisible creatures with it,\n\twhich is a shame because invisible creatures are the best target for this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spirit Ability &#8211; Void Adaptation<\/span>\n\t(Su): Darkvision is fantastic, and the Darkvision spell isn&#8217;t on the Shaman&#8217;s\n\tspell list. The other bits are very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Spirit Ability &#8211; Phantasmagoric Display<\/span>\n\t(Sp): Prismatic Wall and Prismatic Spray are fantastic, if somewhat\n\tunpredictable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Manifestation<\/span>: That bonus to saving throws\n\tis amazing. I&#8217;m not sure what a Star Child is, but I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;s super\n\tcool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"life\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classes\/shaman.html#life-spirit\">Life<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to play a heal-bot, this is absolutely the way to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Magic Spells<\/span>: Lots of important\n\thealing spells for handling problems which go beyond hitpoint loss.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect undead<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">lesser restoration<\/span>: Essential for handling\n\t\tability damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">neutralize poison<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">restoration<\/span>: Costs gold to use, but\n\t\thandles even more problems the Lesser Restoration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">breath of life<\/span>: The most important healing\n\t\tspell in the game. Prepare this every day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">heal<\/span>: Full healing in one spell for almost\n\t\tany character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">greater restoration<\/span>: Fixes nearly\n\t\teverything.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mass heal<\/span>: Situational, but sometimes\n\t\tyour party is really bad at having hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">true resurrection<\/span>: Hopefully you never\n\t\tneed to cast this.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hexes<\/span>: Enhanced Cures is the best option,\n\tand can be replaced by a Wand of Cure Light Wounds.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Curse of Suffering<\/span> (Su): Bleed effects are\n\t\tmediocre, and adding one more point of damage per round won&#8217;t change that.\n\t\tSlowing enemies&#8217; healing is interesting, but very situational.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deny Succor<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhanced Cures<\/span> (Su): This can really help\n\t\tto stretch the usefulness of your lowest-level healing spells.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Life Link<\/span> (Su): This can save your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s lives, but it&#8217;s still situational. You shouldn&#8217;t need this\n\t\tfrequently enough for it to be important.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Life Sight<\/span> (Ex): Very situational, and the\n\t\tlimited duration makes this hard to justify.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Animal<\/span>: Fast healing is fantastic\n\tbecause it allows you to heal completely between encounters. Pick up Improved\n\tFamiliar to get something that can handle itself in a fight, and let your\n\tfamiliar take a few hits before it retreats to recover between fights.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Ability &#8211; Channel<\/span> (Su): Channel\n\tEnergy isn&#8217;t great, and you only get 1+Cha uses per day. Still, I suppose it&#8217;s\n\tfree healing for the whole party without dipping into your spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Spirit Ability &#8211; Healer&#8217;s Touch<\/span>\n\t(Su): This means that you can spend even fewer skill ranks on Heal to get the\n\tmagic +24 modifier for Treat Serious Wounds. The ability to stabilize big\n\tgroups of creatures is very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Spirit Ability &#8211; Quick Healing<\/span> (Su):\n\tFree Quicken Spell for any Cure spell. Absolutely fantastic, especially when\n\tcombined with the Enhanced Cures hex. Channel Energy is a bit situational, but\n\tif you position yourself well it&#8217;s a great to heal your whole party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Manifestation<\/span>: With all of those immunities,\n\tyou will be very difficult to kill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lore\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classes\/shaman.html#lore-spirit\">Lore<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lore Spirit is provides some good Divination options, but doesn&#8217;t allow<br>the Shaman to serve as a Librarian like a Lore Oracle can because it doesn&#8217;t<br>provide additional Knowledge skills as class skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Magic Spells<\/span>: Some excellent\n\tdivination and utility options, but many of the divinations are\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Identify<\/span>: Invest in Spellcraft.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">tongues<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">locate object<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\timportant for talking to all of the weird creatyres which adventurers\n\t\tencounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">legend lore<\/span>: You need to be reasonably\n\t\tclose to the target to find it, so you can&#8217;t just cast Locate Object and\n\t\tlocate the Lich&#8217;s phylactery, but this can be very good for finding items\n\t\tlost among debris and such.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">contact other plane<\/span>: This can very\n\t\tpowerful, and because you don&#8217;t need Intelligence or Charisma for spells,\n\t\tthe penalties for failure aren&#8217;t really important.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">mass owl&#8217;s wisdom<\/span>: The only thing that this\n\t\treally gets you is bonuses to your party&#8217;s Will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">vision<\/span>: How often do you think you are\n\t\tgoing to need to cast Legend Lore in combat? With the exception of the\n\t\tpossible days\/weeks casting times for Legend Lore, you really shouldn&#8217;t need\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">moment of prescience<\/span>: Fantastic and very\n\t\tversatile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">time stop<\/span>: One of the most powerful spells\n\t\tin the game, and it&#8217;s not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hexes<\/span>: A couple of decent options, but\n\tArcane Enlightenment is the only thing that you really need to have.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Enlightenment<\/span> (Su): Hugely expands\n\t\tthe Shaman&#8217;s spell list. Take this early, and update your spell choices\n\t\toften.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Benefit of Wisdom<\/span> (Ex): If you are the\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Librarian, this will give you a sizeable bonus to Knowledge\n\t\tchecks.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brain Drain<\/span> (Su): Situational.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Confusion Curse<\/span> (Ex): Confusion is\n\t\tterrible.<\/p>\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Share Knowledge<\/span> (Su): Situational.<\/p>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Animal<\/span>: Familiars acts on their\n\tcontroller&#8217;s initiative count, so I&#8217;m not sure how the Initiative bonus works\n\there. The bonus to Stealth is nice, but hardly necessary.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Ability &#8211; Monstrous Insight<\/span> (Su):\n\tSpending a standard action on this really hurts, especially as you grow in\n\tlevel and the bonus becomes less important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spirit Ability &#8211; Automatic Writing<\/span>\n\t(Su): Divination is a fantastic spell if your GM is creative enough to give\n\tyou a good response. Getting to use it several times per day can give you a\n\tton of information.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">True Spirit Ability &#8211; Perfect Knowledge<\/span>\n\t(Ex): Tongues is situational, but good to have. The +10 bonus to Knowledge\n\tskills will be hugely helpful for overcoming your lack of Intelligence\n\tcompared to a Wizard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Manifestation<\/span>: Combined with Perfect\n\tKnowledge, the Lore spirit now guarantees a result of 30 on any knowledge\n\tcheck before considering your skill ranks or intelligence. On top of that, you\n\tget Wish once per day for free. Wish is the best spell in the game, and is\n\tonly limited by its material component, which the Lore Spirit allows you to\n\tbypass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"nature\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classes\/shaman.html#nature-spirit\">Nature<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nature spirit has the unique ability combine a Familiar (your Spirit<br>Animal) and an Animal Companion into one pet.

The duration is long enough that you can use it all day\n\t\tlong.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sparking Aura<\/span> (Su): The duration is\n\t\tgarbage, the damage is garbage, you can&#8217;t use it on invisible creatures\n\t\t(probably the things you would want to use this on the most), and you can&#8217;t\n\t\taffect the same target more than once in a day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vortex Spells<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wind Sight<\/span> (Su): The sight through wind\n\t\tthing is ridiculously situational, but the Clairvoyance effect is\n\t\tfantastic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wind Ward<\/span> (Su): The duration is too short\n\t\tto justify taking this before the 8th-level improvement. Minutes per level\n\t\tallows you to periodically walk around and buff the whole party. A miss\n\t\tchance is great, and provides an excellent defense against ranged attacks\n\t\tand some spells.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Animal<\/span>: Your Spirit Animal can no\n\tlonger be stealthy, and it has paltry energy resistance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Ability &#8211; Shocking Touch<\/span> (Su):\n\tDecent and reliable, but the damage doesn&#8217;t scale well and the user per day\n\tdepend on Charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Spirit Ability &#8211; Spark Soul<\/span> (Su): A\n\tbit of energy resistance, and a weak blaster ability. The damage of the line\n\tof sparks isn&#8217;t fantastic, and lines are hard to use, but it will probably do\n\tmore damage than you could do with a weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">True Spirit Ability &#8211; Elemental Form<\/span> (Su):\n\tAssuming that you are built to survive in melee, suddenly becoming a Huge\n\telemental can be a great option for you. However, the Elemental Body spell\n\tdescription does not specify the ability to polymorph into a Lightning\n\tElemental, so I don&#8217;t know if you gain any of the Lightning Elemental&#8217;s\n\tspecial abilities. The hours\/level duration means that you can spend the whole\n\tday as an elemental.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Manifestation<\/span>: More energy resistance, and\n\tfree metamagic on lightning spells.
