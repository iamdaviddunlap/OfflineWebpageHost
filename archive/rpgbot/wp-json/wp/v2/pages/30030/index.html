Their abilities are mean, tricky, brutal, evil, and generally awesome and a lot of fun. After its recent addition to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/tir\/the-illrigger-revised\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DnDBeyond<\/a>, the Illrigger is getting a lot of well-deserved attention from the broader DnD community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the Illrigger is primarily a martial character similar to the Fighter or the Paladin. Their primary role is as a Striker, but their subclasses offer a wide variety of playstyles. The Architect of Ruin feels similar to the Eldritch Knight Fighter, adding a splash of Blaster, Controller, and\/or Defender depending on your spell selection. Hellspeaker focuses heavily on social skills and the Charmed condition, giving them options as a Controller and a Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Painkiller improves the Illrigger&#8217;s armor proficiency to heavy, and adds options to command allies to attack, adding Defender and Support to their roles. The Sanguine Knight mixes Healer and Striker with the ability to drain enemies and both heal and empower allies. Finally, the Shadowmast emphasizes infiltration, stealth, and high-damage attacks similar to the Rogue, focusing more on the Striker role and adding some Scout options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, the Illrigger is roughly as complex as the Fighter or the Rogue. Managing Seals is the most complex part of the class, especially once you add Interdict Boons (very similar to the Warlock&#8217;s Eldritch Invocations). The Architect of Ruin is the most complex subclass, adding spellcasting on top of everything else. The Painkiller is the least complex subclass, focusing almost entirely on the class&#8217;s martial capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that this is 3rd-party content.

The Illrigger also comes with several sidebars encouraging you to discuss potentially problematic themes with your table.

If you find that the Illrigger doesn&#8217;t feel effective alongside 2024 classes, consider a few minor changes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2 Weapon Masteries starting at level 1<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Update Invoke Hell to follow the same uses per rest and recharge mechanics as the Paladin&#8217;s Channel Divinity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Replace the level 19 ASI with an Epic Boon<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"game-balance\">Game Balance<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Illrigger feels similar in effectiveness to core classes in the 2024 rules, but makes some trades in functionality. The easiest comparison is to the Fighter: the Illrigger will generally do more damage in short bursts by relying on seals, but the Fighter is more sustainable and more durable. The Sanguine Knight compares nicely to the Paladin, again trading durability for bigger bursts of damage from seals. The Shadowmaster compares to the Rogue, trading the Rogue&#8217;s skills and sustainability for more durability.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Illrigger Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Optional Class Features are detailed below under <a href=\"#optional-class-features\">Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 is standard for front-line martial characters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Constitution and Charisma are fine. You&#8217;ll need both to fuel your hit points and your class features, so you&#8217;ll be well protected. However, you have no additional defenses against common Dexterity and Wisdom saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor, shields, martial weapons. Painkillers get heavy armor, but other illriggers will lean toward Dexterity-based builds. The Illrigger&#8217;s skills are an interesting mix which caters to a broad range of ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Baleful Interdict<\/span>: You seals are a powerful and precious resource central to the Illrigger&#8217;s class features. You get just 3 seals per rest at level 1, then get as many as 7 per rest at level 18. You can only place one seal on a creature per turn, which helps stop you from burning through them in a hurry, but you&#8217;ll still need to learn to ration them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially the only function of your seals is to burn them for damage. Note that because burning a seal deals damage separate from the triggering effect, the damage isn&#8217;t multiplied on a critical hit, but it does force creatures to make a separate save to maintain Concentration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-orange\">Forked Tongue<\/span>: Interesting, but not very impactful in most games. Omitting the ability to read and write in the granted languages is an interesting touch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Combat Mastery<\/strong>: Combat Mastery works a lot like Fighting Style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bravado<\/span>: Only useful if you&#8217;re planning to be stealthy, which is tempting for Shadowmaster builds.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brutal<\/span>: A great way to control the battlefield, but less novel in a world where Crusher and Weapon Mastery (Push) exist. Of course, you can combine all 3 on the same attack to move enemies a total of 20 feet, and that&#8217;s pretty great.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inexorable<\/span>: Very tempting for aggressive melee builds, but it&#8217;s unreliable without a way to guarantee groups of enemies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lies<\/span>: Great for several builds, but obsolete in the 2024 rules. Take Magic Initiate to get Shillelagh as a Charisma-based spell.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lissome<\/span>: Fantastic for hit and run attacks. Using Crusher or the Push Weapon Mastery will accomplish the same goal in most situations, but this is still very appealing for builds focusing on Dexterity.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unfettered<\/span>: Absolutely essential for ranged builds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Interdiction<\/span>: Interdict Boons are a fantastic decision point within the class. They work a lot like the Warlock&#8217;s Eldritch Invocations, allowing you to pick and choose class features that suit your play style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: See Illrigger Subclasses, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong\">Invoke Hell<\/strong>: Very similar to Channel Divinity. The usefulness of the ability is entirely dependent on your subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: The Illrigger is primarily a martial class, so the bulk of your Actions in combat will be spent attacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <span class=\"rating-orange\">Infernal Conduit<\/span>: The dice scale very slowly, so this will never be very impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Invigorate<\/span>: Donate some hit points to an ally. If you have temporary hp, such as from the Soul Eater Interdict Boon, it will mitigate the cost to use this. If you&#8217;re at nearly 0 hp, use this to heal an ally and have someone heal you. Going from 1 hp to 0 hp to heal an ally for 3d10 or more is nice. This will never be a huge amount of healing since the dice scale so slowly, but putting all of your dice into an ally could get them through another hit or two.<\/span>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Devour<\/span>: Similar in concept to Vampiric Touch, but Constitution saves are consistently high and your damage will never be especially good even if you&#8217;re using all of your dice at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>10. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Price<\/span>: Absolutely fantastic. It doesn&#8217;t include your Constitution modifier, but +1d10 to a save is still really good in 5e&#8217;s bounded math. This is strong motivation to not use your Hit Dice during Short Rests, so consider other healing options if they&#8217;re available to your party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>11. <span class=\"rating-green\">Terrorizing Force<\/span>: A nice boost to your damage output. I strongly recommend Necrotic damage, as it&#8217;s the least common resistance among the listed options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>14. <span class=\"rating-green\">Superior Interdict<\/span>: Ignoring damage resistances is nice, but by this level you have plenty of uses for your seals that aren&#8217;t damage. The one additional seal per day will have very little impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>17. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Infernal Majesty<\/span>: A once per day combat transformation. Flight, damage resistances, and some additional damage output. Altogether a pretty great buff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>20. <strong\">Master of Hell<\/strong>: A once per day AOE nuke. The range is good and the radius is massive, so this is great for handling big groups of enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inferno<\/span>: Decent damage, and the ongoing damage is enough to feel impactful, but won&#8217;t win fights on its own. Ongoing damage is also a great way to break Concentration because it forces saves without you doing anything.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pestilence<\/span>: Worse damage types than Inferno, and it targets Constitution saves. Poisoning the targets is really tempting, but this will be unreliable. If you&#8217;re going to gamble on a Constitution save, go for Darkness.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Darkness<\/span>: The cold damage is fine, but you&#8217;re here for the blindness effect. Despite the description, this doesn&#8217;t obscure the area, and the blindness effect doesn&#8217;t care about the saving throw for the cold damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illrigger-subclasses\">Illrigger Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"architect-of-ruin\">Architect of Ruin<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Similar to the Eldritch Knight Fighter, the Architect of Ruin adds some spellcasting to a martial class. With the ability to build entirely around Charisma using Combat Mastery (Lies), a Warlock dip, or Shillelagh, the Architect of Ruin is best built more like a Charisma-based spellcaster than like a conventional martial character. You can build around Strength or Dexterity, but the benefits of building around Charisma are massive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Asmodeus\u2019s Blessing<\/span>: An extra skill and\n\t\tan improvement to Forked Tongue. Unfortunately, the skills are\n\t\tIntelligence-based, which is really hard on a build that has no other\n\t\tdependence on Intelligence.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Architect of Ruin&#8217;s\n\t\tspells fall somewhere between the Eldritch Knight and the Paladin, focusing\n\t\tprimarily on combat options with a few utilities mixed in. They&#8217;re 1\/3\n\t\tcasters like the Eldritch Knight, so you generally don&#8217;t want to use your\n\t\tspells offensively like a Wizard would, but the Architect of Ruin&#8217;s other\n\t\tsubclass features offer a few ways to make offensive spells appealing\n\t\tdespite your relatively weak spellcasting.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Note that the Architect of Ruin&#8217;s spell list likely will not be expanded.\n\t\t\tAs we see additional official rules supplements which gradually add new\n\t\t\tspells, the Illrigger&#8217;s spell list will be left untouched. MCDM might\n\t\t\trevisit the Illrigger, but their current focus on their\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/mcdm.gg\/rpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Draw Steel RPG<\/a> makes that unlikely.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invoke Hell<\/span>: Both options are fantastic.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enervating Spell<\/span>: Impose weakness to\n\t\t\t\tyour spell&#8217;s damage, ignoring existing resistances and immunities. Very\n\t\t\t\tpowerful. Unfortunately, you get spells very slow;ly.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellblade<\/span>: Pretend that you have the\n\t\t\t\tEldritch night&#8217;s War Magic once per rest. You don&#8217;t want to rush to use\n\t\t\t\tthis right away because Invoke Hell gets so few uses, but if you&#8217;re at a\n\t\t\t\tsignificant advantage this can be a night boost to your damage\n\t\t\t\toutput.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hellish Versatility<\/span>: Cantrips will\n\t\tfrequently deal more damage than a single weapon attack, especially as your\n\t\tcantrip damage scales with level. If you&#8217;re built around Charisma, Fire Bolt\n\t\tand Hellfire both provide reliable damage, while Ray of Frost provides some\n\t\tcrowd control. If you&#8217;re built around Strength or Dexterity, Vengeful Blade\n\t\tprovides some bonus damage to punish enemies for fighting back and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trely on your spellcasting ability.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This may look like it&#8217;s redundant with Invoke Hell (Spellblade), but\n\t\t\tSpellblade also works with your leveled spells, while Hellish Versatility\n\t\t\tworks only with cantrips. Reserve Spellblade for when you need to use a\n\t\t\tbigger spell to buff yourself or to attack, but use Hellish Versatility as\n\t\t\tyour primary attack option.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Note that this needs to be an Illrigger Cantrip, so it can&#8217;t come from\n\t\t\tMagic Initiate or anything else.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><strong>Asmodeus&#8217;s Interdiction<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Axiomatic Seals<\/span>: A significant boost\n\t\t\t\tto your damage output from burning seals. If the spellcasting didn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tsell you on a Charisma-based build, this should.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellbreaker<\/span>: An excellent counter to\n\t\t\t\tenemy spellcasters at a fairly low resource cost. Using additional seals\n\t\t\t\tto raise the spell level of your Counterspell is an expensive prospect\n\t\t\t\tand requires you to apply a bunch of seals to one creature before they\n\t\t\t\tstart casting spells, which is unlikely to happen unless you sit around\n\t\t\t\tstaring at them for a few rounds before combat starts. Plan to use the\n\t\t\t\tbasic level 3 Counterspell at least until you get Hell Mage.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hell Mage<\/span>: You can normally only apply\n\t\t\t\tone seal per turn, which is what prevents your seals from quickly nuking\n\t\t\t\tsingle enemies. Hell Mage allows you to apply 6 seals at once. On your\n\t\t\t\tnext turn, you can then damage the target and burn the seals all at\n\t\t\t\tonce. Assuming 20 Charisma, that&#8217;s 18d6+30 damage (avg. 93), which is\n\t\t\t\tpretty great. It may not be worth that resource cost in many cases, but\n\t\t\t\tnuking an enemy spellcaster in the first round or two of combat will\n\t\t\t\toften win a fight for you. Just remember that you only get 7 seals per\n\t\t\t\trest unless you use Vile Transmogrification to get more.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Submit<\/span>: Imposing Disadvantage on a save is\n\t\tgreat. If you combine this with Invoke Hell (Enervating Spell), you can make\n\t\tone spell extremely effective. The Architect of Ruin gets vew few offensive\n\t\tspells which call for saves, but Suggestion, Bestow Curse, Blight, and\n\t\tPhantasmal Killer will all work here.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The wording of the feature seems to specify only a single saving throw. I\n\t\t\tthink the intent here is that the Disadvantage applies on the first save\n\t\t\tagainst the spell, but wouldn&#8217;t apply to additional saves against spells\n\t\t\tlike Hold Person or Phantasmal Killer.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Vile Transmogrification<\/span>: The ability to\n\t\ttrade your resources back and forth like this offers some neat options.\n\t\tSeals work with your Interdict Boons, but some of your subclass features don&#8217;t\n\t\tmatter without your spells. Trading spell slots for seals is considerably\n\t\tmore efficient, but don&#8217;t rush to melt down all of your spell slots unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;ve built your whole character around spending seals (which is an\n\t\toption).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since you can&#8217;t have more than 7 seals at a time, you can&#8217;t use this to\n\t\t\trecover spell slots above level 2. You can&#8217;t regain something that you\n\t\t\thaven&#8217;t lost, so you can&#8217;t &#8220;regain&#8221; an 8th seal to go over your\n\t\t\tcapacity.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"hellspeaker\">Hellspeaker<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Hellspeaker is almost entirely focused on social skills, offering a handful of combat options, but little utility beyond the ability to charm creatures. They make an excellent Face, but otherwise don&#8217;t expand the Irrigger&#8217;s capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Moloch&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: Proficiency or Expertise in either Persuasion or Deception. Deception feels like it fits the theme better, but choose whichever works for your character.\n<p>The Advantage mechanic requires special attention and deep understanding of the Forked Tongue feature. You will know 2 or 3 languages from your species, almost always including Common. If you can somehow not learn Common from your species, you&#8217;ll spend most of the game rolling Charisma checks with Advantage, but that&#8217;s probably not the intent of the rule. Forked Tongue gets you additional languages, and you get Advantage when using them, so you&#8217;re encouraged to speak in basically anything except Common. Remember that Forked Tongue allows you to change the languages you gained (except for Infernal), so try to keep your languages relevant to whatever creatures you&#8217;re facing at any given point.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you also have Charm Enemy to offer another route to Advantage on your Charisma checks.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Charm Enemy<\/span>: The first part of Charm Enemy allows you to quickly charm a creature. The Bonus Action to apply a seal doesn&#8217;t have any sort of audio or visual indicator, so it&#8217;s perfectly subtle, making it easy to use in a conversation. Many creatures have poor Charisma saves even at high levels, so this is usually reliable. If the conversation goes badly, you go into combat with your target interdicted.\n<p>The second half of the feature lets you charm multiple creatures at once <em>after<\/em> damaging them by burning seals. They get the same Charisma save as your original target, and don&#8217;t get Advantage on their save if you&#8217;re in combat like most charm effects. This can easily end or prevent a combat encounter.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Invoke Hell<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Honey-Sweet Blades<\/span>: One guaranteed critical hit per Short Rest is pretty great, but seal damage doesn&#8217;t multiply on a critical hit, and the Hellspeaker doesn&#8217;t get any combat-focused subclass features which complement this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Turncoat<\/span>: Excellent in crowded encounters both because it forces enemies to damage each other and because it wastes targets&#8217; Reactions so that you and your party can move about freely.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><bold>Moloch&#8217;s Interdiction<\/bold>: \n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Red Cant<\/span>: Excellent insurance in social situations, especially if you haven&#8217;t charmed whatever you&#8217;re talking to.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slippery Ploy<\/span>: A fantastic defense, but be sure that your party members are okay with drawing more attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incontrovertible<\/span>: This makes Charm Enemy and Slippery Ploy extremely reliable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intransigent<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but many effects will charm targets and apply additional problems while the targets are charmed.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Let&#8217;s Make a Deal<\/span>: With Advantage and +PB on the roll on top of any other modifiers, succeeding should be very easy, and your target gets Temporary Hit Points on top of succeeding on the roll. <\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Quid Pro Quo<\/span>: Even once per day, banishing an enemy to summon a CR 11 Horned Devil is pretty good.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"painkiller\">Painkiller<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>By far the simplest of the Illrigger&#8217;s subclasses, the Painkiller feels very similar to the Fighter. With simple, combat-focused features and only one added option to spend seals, the Painkiller&#8217;s resource management is relatively easy, but still extremely impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispater&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: Heavy armor means that you can effectively use Strength-based weapons without making massive sacrifices.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Devastator<\/span>: If your party relies heavily on weapon attacks, this can be devastating. If your party is all spellcasters, it may be useless unless they summon creatures that can make good weapon attacks. Provided that you can affect at least 2 allies who will make effective attacks, this will almost always be more impactful than attacking by yourself. This gets especially powerful with a Rogue in the party.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Invoke Hell<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grand Strategist<\/span>: Free movement for your allies with no action cost from anyone. Absolutely fantastic for getting allies out of dangerous positions or into better positions to attack from. Don&#8217;t rush to use this since Punishment is also amazing, but watch for opportunities for it to have an impact.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Punishment<\/span>: Use this when you suffer a critical hit. Note this works on any kind of attack, not just weapon attacks.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><strong>Dispater&#8217;s Interdiction<\/strong>: \n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Seal<\/span>: Knocking a foe prone will either make it very hard for them to move past you or potentially leave them prone through their turn unless they Dash to get additional movement.\n<p>If you use this with Flash of Brimstone, you can also teleport anywhere within 5 feet of the creature. If you use the push effect, you could push them 15 feet away, then teleport next to them.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">By The Throat<\/span>: Restrained gives them Disadvantage on their attacks, reduces their speed to 0, and grants Advantage on attacks against them. This will be consistently useful for your entire party.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispater&#8217;s Supremacy<\/span>: 15% chance to crit, or 27.75% with Advantage. You&#8217;re going to crit frequently even before you consider Deathstrike.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-green\">You Die on My Command!<\/span>: A fantastic protection for your whole party.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deathstrike<\/span>: Guaranteed critical hits a few times per day. If you&#8217;ve accumulated a few seals on the target, burning them for double damage will also have a huge impact. Remember that they deal 3d6 damage per seal at this level, they ignore damage resistances, and they&#8217;ll go up to 4d6 per seal at level 20.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"sanguine-knight\">Sanguine Knight<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Sanguine Knight adds Healer to the list of the Illrigger&#8217;s roles in the party. While you can&#8217;t quite compete with a full spellcaster, you can produce big bursts of healing, and you have the ability to remove status conditions, so you can replace a full spellcaster in a party as long as your allies aren&#8217;t willfully reckless. The subclass features also have a unique way of taking from your enemies, and giving to your allies which feels very satisfying. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exsanguinate<\/span>: An excellent and reliable\n\t\tsource of Temporary Hit Points. The THP don&#8217;t have a listed expiration, so\n\t\tthey last until you complete a Long Rest. Be sure to spread the points\n\t\taround to everyone in the party. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t appear that you\n\t\tcan use this to give yourself temporary hit points.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sutekh&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: Another skill is\n\t\talways nice, though Intelligence-based skills are hard for the Illrigger.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><strong>Invoke Hell<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Embolden Allies<\/span>: A huge amount of hp\n\t\t\t\thealed as a Bonus Action. By comparison, the Paladin&#8217;s entire Lay on\n\t\t\t\tHands pool is the same amount of healing and takes an Action to heal\n\t\t\t\tanyone except yourself.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vitalize<\/span>: A massive buff for your\n\t\t\t\twhole party. It only lasts for 1 minute, unfortunately, but that&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tenough to disarm traps, lie your way past a guard, etc.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><strong>Sutekh&#8217;s Interdiction<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Foul Interchange<\/span>: Basically Lesser Restoration, plus you can shuggle the condition off to another creature. If you&#8217;re out of combat and don&#8217;t have enemies around, you can put the condition on yourself or an ally for a round.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanguine Fist<\/span>: Very efficient healing.\n\t\t\t\tYou could use this with Invoke Hell (Embolden Allies) and add bonus\n\t\t\t\thealing for your whole party, though beware of the resource cost to do\n\t\t\t\tso.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood for Blood<\/span>: It&#8217;s not a ton of\n\t\t\t\tdamage at this level, but it&#8217;s great motivation to quickly put a seal on\n\t\t\t\tevery enemy you encounter.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodstroke<\/span>: This is a huge amount of\n\t\tdamage, and the scaling is excellent. Be sure to regularly refresh your\n\t\tallies&#8217; Temporary Hit Points to keep this feature as effective as\n\t\tpossible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haemel Exchange<\/span>: A d8 is a significant debuff, and applying this as a Reaction makes it easy to fit into your action economy.\n<p>There&#8217;s no listed expiration for the d8 granted to an ally, and it doesn&#8217;t specify that the dice can&#8217;t stack. This can obviously lead to abuse, so I recommend adding a 10-minute expiration and disallow creatures from having more than one die from Haemal Exchange.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"shadowmaster\">Shadowmaster<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Shadowmaster is the closest subclass to the Rogue, focusing on a high damage from a single attack, stealth, and darkness. They start off somewhat slow, but get a bit insane at high levels once you get Doomed to the Shadows. The Shadowmaster is also the only Illrigger subclass that doesn&#8217;t depend on Charisma in any way, which makes them unusually easy to build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Shadowmaster benefits from fighting in dim light or darkness, Darkvision is an absolute must. Also, strongly consider a species that gets additional skill proficiencies if you plan to replace a Rogue since the Illrigger only gets the standard 2, and you don&#8217;t get Expertise at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Marked for Death<\/span>: Extremely reliable Advantage on your first attack each turn. Unless you&#8217;re completely out of seals, you should get this benefit every turn. Remember that this is once per turn, not &#8220;once on each of your turns&#8221;, so you can use it with Opportunity Attacks, too.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Strike from the Dark<\/span>: A decent damage boost. It&#8217;s not quite Sneak Attack, but it has very similar mechanics. Like Sneak Attack, it can apply once per turn, so you can use it with Opportunity Attacks.\n<p>Because this scales with your Proficiency Bonus, it&#8217;s very tempting for multiclass dips.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><string>Invoke Hell<\/string>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Master of Disguise<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but it definitely fits the theme of the subclass very well.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">No Escape<\/span>: A fantastic way to keep enemies locked into melee with you, provided that you&#8217;re built for melee.\n<p>This effect has no listed expiration. In theory, you could permanently lock a creature within 30 feet of you, so long as you never move more than 30 feet away to break the effect.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><strong>Belial&#8217;s Interdiction<\/strong>: \n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Veil of Lies<\/span>: Effectively the spell Invisibility as a Bonus Action. Fantastic on any sneaky character.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hell&#8217;s Assassin<\/span>: Rerolls like this become more effective as you add additional dice, and you&#8217;re getting additional dice from Strike from the Dark, so it should have a constant impact. You&#8217;ll be rerolling your Strike from the Dark damage dice constantly until you get to level 15 and they become d8&#8217;s.\n<p>The reroll applies to damage from your weapon attacks, not just weapon damage, so anything that applies &#8220;extra damage&#8221; gets rerolled, including Strike from the Dark, Sneak Attack, Hunter&#8217;s Mark, etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Dark Malediction<\/span>: This is a very curious form of magical darkness. It suppressed mundane light, but Darkvision sees through it, so you don&#8217;t need to get Devil&#8217;s Sight or Blindsight or anything else. Enemies with Darkvision won&#8217;t be hampered by it, and most things in the game have Darkvision. The appeal here is that you get another die of damage from Strike from the Dark and creatures have Disadvantage on the save against No Escape.\n<p>The effect is automatically suppressed by any form of light created by magic or psionics, which means that even a cantrip can suppress the effect. However, very few enemies walk around with magic lights running, so that&#8217;s rarely an issue unless one of your party members is bringing the light.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Umbral Killer<\/span>: A grab bag of nice buffs for a sneaky character. They won&#8217;t win you any fights or overcome any challenges on their own, but the combinations of benefits will be consistently useful for your whole career.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Doomed to the Shadows<\/span>: The damage upgrade is nice, but blinding a creature for a full minute with no save is absolutely insane. Turn 1, Bonus Action to mark a creature, Action to Attack. You get your first attack with Advantage from Marked For Death, hit them with a damage bonus from Strike from the Shadows, then use your Reaction to burn the seal on them and choose to blind them for a full minute with no save. The fight is now effectively over for that creature, and all that&#8217;s left is extremely one-sided hit point attrition.\n<p>While this combination consumes your entire action economy for a round, it&#8217;s borderline unstoppable with no investment beyond the 15 levels to get here, and will trivialize the vast majority of combat encounters. I recommend adding a saving throw to the blindness effect, and allowing additional saves at the end of each of the target&#8217;s turns. A Charisma save against the Illrigger&#8217;s Interdict DC seems in line with the rest of the class&#8217;s design.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"interdict-boons\">Interdict Boons<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-2-interdict-boons\">Level 2 Interdict Boons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Abating Seal<\/span>: Decent damage mitigation, especially since you can do it at range. Just be careful about burning through all of your seals with this.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bedevil<\/span>: Absolutely fantastic. Using this to support an ally&#8217;s save-or-suck spell will be massively impactful for the entire game. It&#8217;s not clear if this stacks with itself, but generally effects aren&#8217;t intended to stack with identical effects.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul Eater<\/span>: A good amount of Temporary Hit Points, especially considering how often you can place and burn seals. A great choice for melee builds.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Styx&#8217;s Apathy<\/span>: Only situationally useful. The most common use for this is to prevent Opportunity Attacks, but there are numerous other ways to avoid those.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swift Retribution<\/span>: Grab Sentinel and make yourself a huge, sticky problem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-7-interdict-boons\">Level 7 Interdict Boons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Remember that you can retrain one Interdict Boon each time that you gain a level. Now that you have access to level 7 Interdict Boons, strongly consider retraining the one you gained at level 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Acheron&#8217;s Chain<\/span>: Being grappled reduces a creature&#8217;s speed to 0. If they&#8217;re prone, they can&#8217;t stand. If they&#8217;re flying, they usually fall. It&#8217;s a Strength saving throw, so don&#8217;t use it on big melee enemies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Conflagrant Channel<\/span>: Basically Misty Step at the cost of a seal.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eyes of the Gate<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but very cool. You can do the same thing with a familiar, but the appeal here is the ability to see through the eyes of unwilling creatures. If you&#8217;re clever, you could use this to see through an enemy&#8217;s eyes while they go somewhere restricted, then use Conflagrant Channel to teleport somewhere that they can see.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Shroud<\/span>: Shield of Faith without a spell slot or Concentration. +2 AC is a lot in 5e.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unleash Hell<\/span>: Burning seals does a decent amount of damage, especially as you gain levels, but having enemies crowded together enough to justify this is rare, and you can usually only force two creatures adjacent to each other long enough to deal the splash damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vengeful Shot<\/span>: Your weapon attacks should always deal more damage than the 1d6 for burning a seal. Keep in mind that you won&#8217;t be able to draw a weapon as part of this Reaction, so plan to use ranged or thrown weapons if you take this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-13-interdict-boons\">Level 13 Interdict Boons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Level 13 boons are stupidly powerful. Retrain your lower-level Interdict Boons unless they&#8217;re <em>really<\/em> important to your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dis&#8217;s Onslaught<\/span>: Attack and place a Seal as a Bonus Action. By this level you have at 6 seals per rest, which is enough that you can use this every turn in combat in most games. Consider Hellish Frenzy, too, since the cost is similar and both give you an additional attack.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flash of Brimstone<\/span>: Excellent mobility, but remember that the range to place a seal is only 30 feet, and you can probably walk that far. Consider Conflagrant Channel instead if you want teleportation.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hellish Frenzy<\/span>: Fantastic for melee builds.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hellsight<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but very powerful when it matters.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impaling Shot<\/span>: This is a massive penalty to AC. The <a href=\"\">Fundamental Math<\/a> assumes that you&#8217;ll hit an average CR-appropriate creature on an 8. This changes that to 8 &#8211; PB, which is already 4 at this level. Hit an enemy with this, then have your party focus all of their attacks on that target.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Iron Gaol<\/span>: Effectively the Banishment spell. It&#8217;s great, but also extremely expensive.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Last Word<\/span>: As long as you have 1 seal, you can&#8217;t die due to hit point damage. When you drop to 0, spend 1 seal and hit a nearby creature for 3d6 damage even if it&#8217;s an ally. You heal from 0, which will keep you conscious. This even works against effects that drop you straight to 0 hp. Hit point yo-yoing truly is the most evil and hellish of mechanics.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul&#8217;s Doom<\/span>: A significant damage boost, and it gets better as your party gets larger.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Illrigger Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice of background depends heavily on your role in the party.

Most illriggers should favor ranged weapons and\/or Finesse weapons, but Painkillers can build around Strength in order to use two-handed, Strength-based melee weapons. Beyond those concerns, the Illrigger&#8217;s weapon choices are fairly generic since they don&#8217;t have interesting options for two-weapon fighting and they don&#8217;t have Weapon Mastery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Illrigger Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Illrigger is proficient in light armor, medium armor, and shields.

If you do intend to multiclass, be aware that it may create a much more powerful character than the designers expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This section briefly details some obvious and enticing multiclass options, but doesn&#8217;t fully explore the broad range of multiclassing combinations. For more on multiclassing, see our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Barbarian<\/span>: Not as good as the Fighter. 2 Rages per day is neat, but not terribly impactful unless your party is resting very frequently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bard<\/span>: If you want Expertise, the Rogue is a much easier choice. If you want Charisma-based spellcasting, the Sorcerer is a better choice. If you want a strong Face, the Hellspeaker is sufficient, but it&#8217;s nearly impossible to compete with Eloquence Bard in that capacity, so 3 levels into Eloquence Bard is a great addition.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter<\/span>: Starting with a level in Fighter gets heavy armor on any type of illrigger, plus a Fighting Style. If you&#8217;re playing with the 2024 rules, it also gets you Weapon Mastery.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Paladin<\/span>: Heavy armor, Fighting Style, and potentially spellcasting and Divine Smite. The 2024 version of the Paladin gets a lot at level 1, including spellcasting and Weapon Mastery.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span>: A level for Expertise isn&#8217;t a terrible idea, and you coud likely use Cunning Action reliably on turns where you don&#8217;t need to mark a creature.

Rogues considering a multiclass dip into the Illrigger will get a lot of benefit from 3 levels of Shadowmaster.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: 1 level for better Charisma-based spellcasting is tempting for Architect of Ruin builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warlock<\/span>: 1 level in Warlock to use Charisma with your weapon saves you an Interdict Boon, which is great since you never get more than 4.

Grab a shield and play smart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build gives us an easy comparison to a two-handed fighter build. The Fighter will be more durable and can handle longer periods between rests, but the Painkiller Illrigger can put out more damage in a short time period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re building around Strength primarily.

This feels like an opportunity to play the 2014 Half-Orc, and I honestly can&#8217;t think of a better build for it. But suffering until level 15 to get one extra damage die on crits isn&#8217;t worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead we&#8217;ll play a Goliath. This build is highly aggressive and focused on big, two-handed weapons, so Stone&#8217;s Endurance is a great addition. If you&#8217;re using the 2024 rules, avoid Cloud&#8217;s Jaunt and Storm&#8217;s Thunder, but otherwise anything will work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For the 2024 rules: Soldier.
