A very nice power boost indeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spellcasting\">Spellcasting<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unlike the before times, the Remastered Warpriest can easily keep their Wisdom high for spell DCs. Therefore, have a look at the Divine Spell <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/divine-spell-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">breakdown<\/a> and don&#8217;t neglect the fact that you&#8217;re still a full caster. Hitting things is fun but a hammer is not a wrench and you have a fully stocked toolbox.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"first-level-options\">First Level Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This guide is of course a Warpriest, so we\u2019re going to gain Light and Medium armor as well as Trained proficiency with Gorum\u2019s favored weapon, the Greatsword. We also gain an Ancestry feat, which is where our Aiuvarin heritage comes into play with the feat Nimble Elf, increasing our speed to 25 from the Dwarven base speed of 20. Right now, that just puts us on par with a lot of Ancestries, but we\u2019ll eventually take Unburdened Iron once we\u2019re wearing Heavy Armor to be far faster than other Heavily-armored combatants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>For Skills, we get Trained in Survival from Bounty Hunter, Athletics from Gorum, Religion from Cleric, and two more of our choice. Picking up Medicine and Nature finishes off the Wisdom skills for our party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a full spellcaster, we don\u2019t gain a 1st-level feat because we instead have spells. A lot of spells, but most of them are Heal: the best spell. We will have 2 slots to prepare 1st-rank divine spells, and 4 slots to just prepare Heal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons I chose Gorum was that he is in Player Core 1 and also grants us the Sure Strike spell, which allows us to roll twice on our next attack roll and take the higher value. If I was not sticking to options in Player Core 1, I would also consider Ragathiel who also has Sure Strike, but instead gives us the Bastard Sword for the option of switching between one-handed and two-handed fighting, as well as Haste later on instead of Gorum\u2019s Enlarge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your party\u2019s setup, good options for these first level slots include Runic Weapon, Runic Body, and True Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"second-to-fourth-level-options\">Second to Fourth Level Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We have a few different routes we can take here with our second and fourth level feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we want to be more heavily armored, then at Second level we can take the Warpriest\u2019s Armor feat to become just as proficient in Heavy armor as Medium and Light. This pairs well with Restorative Strike at fourth level bringing a mixture of Sustain and damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If instead we want to have a more support-oriented style, Communal Healing or Rapid Response are good options. At fourth, Divine Infusion means our Heals will add positive damage to someone\u2019s attacks on their next turn. For more direct damage from our own weapons, we can combine Versatile Font with Channel Smite at fourth level instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get a general feat, and Fleet is very useful to push our speed up towards 30.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fifth-to-sixth-level-options\">Fifth to Sixth Level Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fifth level, we get an Ancestry feat, ability boosts, a skill increase, and 3rd-rank spells. For our feat, Unburdened Iron is a fantastic choice if we&#8217;ve taken the feat for Heavy Armor, and even if we haven&#8217;t taken Heavy, it does wonders with Tower and Fortress Shields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Ability Boosts will need to be Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom, but the fourth option is up to preference. Prior to the remaster we needed Charisma, too, but no longer. Instead, we just get 5 Font Slots here at level 5 when we also conveniently get 3rd-rank spells.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>As a Warpriest, our 6th-level feat options are Divine Rebuttal, Divine Weapon, or Selective Energy. Divine Rebuttal is our version of Reactive Strike (formerly Attack of Opportunity) with a rather unique trigger when an enemy forces your ally to make a saving throw. It\u2019s neat and we grant a bonus to the save if we hit. Divine Weapon gives us a small damage boost if we cast a spell and strike on the same turn, something we can take advantage of with Sure Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Both of those are solid options, but I would actually push for Selective Energy. You will find that there are enough situations where your party needs a 3 action Heal, and you need to not accidentally heal your foes at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"seventh-to-tenth-level-options\">Seventh to Tenth Level Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Level 7 brings us Expert Weapon Proficiency in Martial weapons as well as Critical Specialization in our favored weapon, the Greatsword. We also gain a General feat. Then at 9 we get another Ancestry feat. For these, Toughness at 7 and Mountain\u2019s Stoutness at 9 combine together for a hefty chunk of extra hit points as well as a bonus to stabilization checks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative set of options we can consider as an Aiuvarin are the combination of the feat Elf Step which would allow us to Step twice for a single action and the general feat Feather Step which allows us to Step in difficult terrain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>For our 8th-level feat, Zealous Rush allows us to reposition quickly while still casting spells. Remember: this only works if the spell only affects us or our equipment. Spells like Runic Weapon or Sure Strike work well with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At 10th level, Replenishment of War can give us plenty of refilling temporary HP if we\u2019re striking regularly, but I think Heroic Recovery is far stronger than the 5 to 10 temporary HP we could generate each round. It\u2019s an emergency button to help someone stand up and get back in the fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With regards to our attributes, bumping Intelligence instead of Dexterity sets us up so that we won&#8217;t be stuck with half a boost hanging off somewhere at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eleventh-to-fifteenth-level-options\">Eleventh to Fifteenth Level Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The general feat at 11 presents a few options. I recommend the Feather Step feat so that we can still Step around in difficult terrain, but Diehard is another good option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 12, Defensive Recovery is another strong Spellshape feat to have in our pocket. Giving +2 AC to someone who is taking the brunt of attacks can really protect those hit points we just put back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>For our ancestry feat at thirteen, we can either take Elf Step, allowing us to Step twice as a single Action, which works well with Feather Step, or we can take March the Mines to do some fun shenanigans to help an ally move around the battlefield on our turn. Both are good choices. Of course, if you took Feather and Elf Step at 7 and 9 then Toughness and Mountain\u2019s Stoutness can be taken now instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Our class feat at 14 is a choice between Channeling Block and Fast Channel, depending on if we\u2019re using a shield or not (this example build does not since we\u2019re worshiping Gorum). Channeling Block lets us dump a Heal spell when we block to amplify our shield hardness, protecting both our health and the durability of the shield. Fast Channel, on the other hand, is great for getting out a 3-Action heal for only 2 actions, a major game changer. Too often will you be just out of position to use the 3-action AoE, but with Fast Channel you can Stride and still cast it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At 15, it can be prudent to spend the general feat on the level 15 skill feat of whatever skill we take to Legendary at 15. For example, if we pushed Athletics to Legendary, we could take Cloud Jump and suddenly make 30 foot vertical High Jumps with no effort.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sixteenth-to-twentieth-level-options\">Sixteenth to Twentieth Level Options<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At 16, Eternal Blessing is too good to pass up: A permanent 15-foot Bless aura because every +1 matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our final Ancestry feat at 17, Stonewall\u2019s ability to just negate something terribly awful once per day is a good get-out-of-dying-free card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At 18, we have to think really hard about how we play. If we\u2019ve been the frontlining tank, Inviolable might be the right answer, making it hurt enemies that attack and hit you, possibly triggering weaknesses. On the other hand, the damage value is small, and Echoing Channel is great for getting 50% more out of a Heal spell by adding the 1-action version onto the 2-action version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>There is more to Echoing, however. Remember that Zealous Rush only works on spells that are self-targeted. Echoing does not make the spell target two creatures, but instead has us cast a separate 1-action Heal. Either of these Heals can self target and trigger the Zealous Rush Stride. This kinda lets us get a refund on the Spellshape action to Stride and also cast the two heals, at least until we take our capstone at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Spellshape Channel. Now we can use all of those great Spellshape feats we took as free actions instead, keeping our third Action free for Strikes, Strides, and other actions.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-by-level-table\">Level by Level Table<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feats, Features, and Skills<\/th><th>Notes<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>Healing Font<br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Doctrines.aspx?ID=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Warpriest Doctrine<\/a><br>Holy Sanctification<br>First Doctrine<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nimble Elf<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=839\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shield Block<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Experienced Tracker<\/a><br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Skills.aspx?ID=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Athletics<\/a> (Deity)<br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Skills.aspx?ID=16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Survival<\/a> (Background)<br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Skills.aspx?ID=13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Religion<\/a> (Cleric)<br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Skills.aspx?ID=9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Medicine<\/a><br><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Skills.aspx?ID=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nature<\/a><\/td><td>At our first level, we make our Doctrine Choice of Warpriest, giving us up to medium armor as well as our first martial weapon, the Greatsword.<br><br>For skills, we\u2019re using our background and free skill choices to acquire all the Wisdom skills.
