Perhaps it&#8217;s the fact that while western culture has a (somewhat) justified fear of them, we know that in every city we go, they&#8217;ll be there as our urban companions. Ratfolk are the sapient version of this, sometimes played as purely malicious undercity dwellers reminiscent of Warhammer&#8217;s skaven, and other times as a wrongfully maligned caste of people just trying to get on with their lives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanics of pathfinder&#8217;s ratfolk race captures the mechanics of playing an anthropomorphic rat perfectly, making them clever, dextrous, and unafraid of cramped spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

All of these are useful, but a perception bonus makes it an automatic blue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Rodent Empathy<\/span>: A +4 bonus to handle animal checks on rodents only. Fun flavor, and you can be the pied piper, but rodents aren&#8217;t often that important to handle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swarming<\/span>: Multiple ratfolk are able to share a space and gain flanking, which is exceptionally useful for abilities like sneak attack and teamwork feats if you coordinate builds with another player, but virtually useless otherwise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have another ratfolk in your party, this racial trait is excellent. At 7th level you can always take Leadership to add ratfolk party member npcs, but many DMs are wary of that feat. Though it&#8217;s not within our usual covered content, I feel I must mention the ratfolk feat Scurrying Swarmer which allows you to benefit from this ability, alongside teamwork feats, and would place this racial trait squarely among the best racial traits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Senses<\/span>: Darkvision is great, and as a dexterity-based character you&#8217;ll likely be stealthing, which makes it even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-racial-traits\">Alternate Racial Traits<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cornered Fury<\/span>: Replaces Swarming. You gain a +2 bonus to melee attack rolls and AC any time you are at half health and by yourself. This is a nice bonus if your party is wiped, but you should never try to be dealing melee damage at half health while all by yourself, and building around your entire party already being dead is a bad choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scent<\/span>: Replaces Tinker. Scent is occasionally very useful for pinpointing invisible opponents or tracking, but in play it&#8217;s probably not going to matter more than a +2 to perception, and you are penalized for all checks using hearing or sight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skulk<\/span>: Replaces Tinker. If you want to play a stealthy ratfolk, this is worth the trade for the tinker bonuses, though losing the perception bonus hurts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Unnnatural<\/span>: Unlike with sapient beings where starting attitude is generally used, most animals are going to be indifferent or unfriendly to people they come across. This means that this feature decreases nearly every animal&#8217;s starting attitude to unfriendly or hostile. The silver lining is that you&#8217;ll get +2 AC against all the animals who will attack you on sight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ratfolk-feats\">Ratfolk Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Burrowing Teeth<\/span>: A burrow speed is generally very difficult to come by, and you can get this feat relatively early in your adventuring career. The two drawbacks are the prerequisite feats, and that you can&#8217;t use your burrow speed through stone (and presumably you also cannot burrow through wood.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sharpclaw<\/span>: Natural attacks are always nice but claw attacks can be challenging since you need hands free to use them. Casters and gunslingers can use them for attacks of opportunity. Rogues benefit a lot from having two primary attacks, giving them another route to deal sneak attacks twice without the pesky penalties of two weapon fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tunnel Rat<\/span>: Squeezing rarely comes into play in pathfinder. It may preclude you from having to roll escape artist checks to fit through tight spaces, which can be nice, but your escape artist check will probably be high enough to squeeze anyway. This is likely a tax for Burrowing Teeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ratfolk-classes\">Ratfolk Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>With the size of ratfolk and their dexterity increase, ratfolk make for excellent dexterity martials and intelligence casters. With their size bonuses to hit and AC, they make okay wisdom casters. You should think twice about playing a charisma caster as at that point you&#8217;re spreading your ability scores a bit thin. Every character uses perception and will saves, so it&#8217;s always safer to dump charisma than it is to dump wisdom. Any build that primarily uses strength is a hard pass.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alchemist\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/alchemist\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemist<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Ratfolk&#8217;s racial bonuses are pretty ideal for the alchemist, and the favored class bonus is very good. Every six levels, you can gain an additional discovery, which is excellent. Leaning into the alchemist&#8217;s bombs aspect of the class can be very rewarding with a high dex bonus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ratfolk have access to a racial archetype called the plague bringer, which has a lot of flavor but is lacking mechanically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"antipaladin\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/antipaladin\/\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Antipaladin<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Antipaladins do not benefit from ratfolk as a racial choice whatsoever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcanist\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/arcanist\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcanist<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Like all int-based casters, the arcanist benefits greatly from a small race with an intelligence and dexterity bonus.

However, using the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/\">urban barbarian<\/a> archetype to make a dexterity-based barbarian could offset this, and make for a flavorful rat rager.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"barbarian-unchained\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/unchained_barbarian\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Barbarian, Unchained<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>See above.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bard\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/bard\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bard<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>No charisma increase, which is a hard sell for a class that needs charisma over everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bloodrager\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/bloodrager\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodrager<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As funny as this would be, it&#8217;s a truly suboptimal choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brawler\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/brawler\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Brawler<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Similar to the fighter, the combat feats gained through martial flexibility can benefit from the ratfolk&#8217;s swarming trait and another ratfolk, but it will require more system mastery than a fighter to get the full effects. Unlike a fighter, it&#8217;s more challenging to make a functioning brawler using dexterity as your attack and damage stat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cavalier\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/cavalier\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Cavalier<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A small sized cavalier can pick a capybara as a mount, which as a rodent would be easier to handle with rodent empathy. The rules also state that DMs may allow other mounts as well, so a dire rat may be available to you. Even with that, there&#8217;s very little reason to pick a cavalier if you want to be a ratfolk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/cleric\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Cleric<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Clerics need wisdom, and ratfoks don&#8217;t have a wisdom increase in their racial ability bonuses. Clerics benefit less than other wisdom casters from the size and dexterity bonuses to AC because they start with medium armor proficiency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"druid\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/druid\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Ratfolk make mediocre druids, providing nothing other than their size and dex bonus. Their favored class bonus isn&#8217;t good. You gain a +1 bonus on wild empathy checks to influence animals and magical beasts that live underground, which would stack with rodent empathy on most rodents, but it&#8217;s not particularly practical to make use of this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fighter\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/fighter\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fighter<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For a dexterity-based fighter, this can be an alright option, though it&#8217;s significantly improved with another ratfolk to use swarming with. Pick up slashing grace or an agile weapon as soon as possible. The favored class option is alright, allowing you to add +1 to your CMD against grapple and bull rush attempts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gunslinger\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/gunslinger\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gunslinger<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The favored class bonus for gunslinger is a bonus to initiative which would be good for anyone. Beating enemies in initiative and making them flat-footed is insanely good for a gunslinger whose weapons already resolve against enemies&#8217; touch AC within the first range increment. With a feat like deadly aim, your opening salvo can be quite punishing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gunslingers add dexterity to damage at 5th level with one type of firearm. Additionally, there&#8217;s a fairly solid ratfolk-exclusive archetype for the gunslinger called the Gulch Gunner which incentivises making point-blank firearm attacks. It gives the Gunslinger a very reliable way to regain grit, making the lack of a racial bonus to wisdom hurt less.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hunter\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/hunter\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hunter<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The intelligence bonus doesn&#8217;t help a whole lot, and the lack of a wisdom bonus makes a ratfolk hunter a challenge to build, but grabbing a dire rat companion could be fun and easier to handle with rodent empathy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"investigator\"><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/investigator\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Investigator<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The racial bonuses to dexterity and intelligence are perfect for an investigator.

This would require a significant feat investment, but it could be played by 7th level.
