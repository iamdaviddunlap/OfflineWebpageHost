The 2-round duration lasts until the end of your next\n\t\tturn, so you&#8217;re effectively protected for just one round; you can&#8217;t\n\t\talternate turns casting Blade Ward, then doing something fun. The best use\n\t\tcase for this is to keep yourself alive while you finish a fight using Bonus\n\t\tActions, summoned creatures (Spiritual Weapon), or other ongoing effects\n\t\t(Spirit Guardians).<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guidance<\/span>: Absolutely essential. You should\n\t\talmost never make skill checks outside of combat without Guidance\n\t\trunning.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Light<\/span>: Environmental light sources are\n\t\tabundant, actual darkness is rare, and Darkvision is easily accessible. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re really that desperate, have someone carry a torch.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Produce Flame<\/span>: As much damage as Sacred\n\t\tFlame, but it relies on an attack roll and targeting AC will typically be\n\t\tless reliable than a Dexterity save. However, that&#8217;s not always the case, so\nhaving a spell attack option is helpful. Note that when you initially cast the spell, it just creates the flame on your body. You need to look in the Passives section of the action bar for the Produce Flame icon and click that to actually attack with the flame.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resistance<\/span>: Not an awful buff, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tnot good enough to justify Concentration beyond very low levels. If you want\n\t\tthe same benefit, cast Bless. It can be used in dialogue requiring saves, though, so not a bad choice once you\u2019ve picked up Guidance and Sacred Flame\n<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sacred Flame<\/span>: The class&#8217;s go-to damage\n\t\tcantrip.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Thaumaturgy<\/span>: Only affects the caster, and a\n\t\tcleric should never be your party&#8217;s Face.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1st-level\">1st-Level Cleric Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bane<\/span>: A good debuff against powerful\n\t\tenemies in an extended fight, but it only targets three creatures, requires\n\t\tConcentration, and competes for space with options like Bless which will\n\t\thelp your party win a fight quickly rather than putting you at an advantage\n\t\tduring a long attrition fight.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bless<\/span>: +1d4 to attacks and saves for three\n\t\ttargets. This is a fantastic buff which remains mathematically impactful for\n\t\tthe whole game. Note that the bonus to saves also applies to the save to\n\t\tmaintain Concentration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Command<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Approach<\/span>: Sometimes useful for\n\t\t\t\tpulling squishy enemies (wizards, etc.) closer to your party.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drop<\/span>: In a game where enemies are\n\t\t\t\toverwhelming humanoids using weapons, Command (Drop) trivializes many\n\t\t\t\tencounters by forcing your enemies to disarm. Be sure to have your party\n\t\t\t\tmembers grab dropped weapons off the ground to prevent enemies from\n\t\t\t\tre-equipping them.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flee<\/span>: Force enemies to run away,\n\t\t\t\tpotentially provoking opportunity attacks. They&#8217;ll then need to spend\n\t\t\t\ttime running back to rejoin the encounter.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Grovel<\/span>: Force an enemy Prone,\n\t\t\t\tallowing your party to make melee attacks at Advantage until the target\n\t\t\t\tcan stand on their following turn.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Halt<\/span>: Effectively skip your target&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tnext turn. If your party outnumbers your enemies, the trade is absolutely\n\t\t\t\tworth the cost.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create or Destroy Water<\/span>: If your party\n\t\thas sources of cold or lightning damage (Chromatic Orb, Lightning Bolt,\n\t\tetc.), this sets up the rest of your party for additional damage. It applies\n\t\tin an area of effect, allowing you to hit multiple targets. Outside of\n\t\tcombat, there are several points in the game at which there will be areas of\n\t\tflaming ground to cross, and the ability to extinguish that fire can save\n\t\tyou the inconvenience of taking fire damage when you accidentally walk into\n\t\tit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cure Wounds<\/span>: More healing per slot than\n\t\tHealing Word, but since it consumes your Action and only works in melee\n\t\trange, it&#8217;s much more costly to use in combat than Healing Word.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Guiding Bolt<\/span>: Among the best damage\n\t\toptions from a 1st-level spell, and granting Advantage on your party&#8217;s next\n\t\tattack against the target further adds to the damage potential.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Word<\/span>: Among the most important\n\t\tspells in the game, the ability to heal at range with a Bonus Action means\n\t\tthat you can rescue dying allies mid-combat and still spend your Action and\n\t\tyour movement doing something exciting.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Inflict Wounds<\/span>: A big hit of damage at\n\t\tmelee range. Do your absolute best to get Advantage before attacking,\n\t\tbecause the spell slot is wasted if you miss.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Evil and Good<\/span>:\n\t\tSpectacular protection against the affected creature types. Note that this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t actually care about things being evil or good; it&#8217;s just the\n\t\tcreature type that matters. Why is it named &#8220;Protection from Evil and Good&#8221;?\n\t\tTradition dating back to the 70&#8217;s.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanctuary<\/span>: Effectively forces the AI to\n\t\tforget that your target is there. The target can still Help allies and cast\n\t\tspells like Healing Word, but anything hostile (attacking, Shove, hostile\n\t\tspells, etc.) breaks the effect. Because this is cast as a Bonus Action, you\n\t\tcan cast an offensive spell as an Action, then cast this as a Bonus Action\n\t\ton the same turn.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield of Faith<\/span>: A great buff for your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Defender if they&#8217;re drawing a lot of attacks.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2nd-level\">2nd-Level Cleric Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aid<\/span>: This increases targets&#8217; current hit\n\t\tpoints <em>and<\/em> their hit point maximum, effectively raising their\n\t\tpermanent hit points, so temporary hit points can pad things even further.\n\t\tBecause this raises targets&#8217; current hit points, too, you can use it in\n\t\tplace of Mass Healing Word to heal multiple dying allies. However, if you\n\t\tpre-cast this, that function won&#8217;t work because spells don&#8217;t stack with themselves,\n\t\tso you need to choose which of the two uses works better for you.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this lasts until your next Long Rest but doesn\u2019t require Concentration, it\u2019s a candidate for\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t\t>.\n\t\t<\/p><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness<\/span>: A fantastic debuff with no\n\t\tConcentration, especially against enemies that rely on fighting at range. However, Constitution saves tend to be high, so this may prove to be unreliable. If available to your party, the rat familiar&#8217;s Infectious\n\t\tBite can impose Disadvantage on Constitution saves, making this spell much\n\t\tmore reliable.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Calm Emotions<\/span>: Affected creatures are immune\n        to Charmed and Frightened, which is helpful if you&#8217;re facing enemies\n        like dragons which have fear effects because you can prevent allies from\n        becoming frightened. Otherwise, it&#8217;s totally useless.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhance Ability<\/span>: Absolutely crucial.\n\t\tOutside of combat, this is one of the most important spells in the game.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Person<\/span>: Humanoid enemies are abundant\n\t\tin Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3, making Hold Person a spectacularly powerful save-or-suck\n\t\tspell. Paralyze something, then have your party pile in on it until it&#8217;s\n\t\tdead. Upcasting this spell to add more targets keeps it powerful for a very\n\t\tlong time. However, since enemies get to repeat their saves, you need to\n\t\twork quickly.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lesser Restoration<\/span>: Removes some debuffs\nwhich typically end when you break the Concentration of whatever spellcaster caused them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Prayer of Healing<\/span>: Not castable in\n\t\tcombat, but outside of combat it&#8217;s a big pile of healing. Don&#8217;t keep it\n\t\tprepared; rotate it in before casting it, then immediately drop it to\n\t\tprepare something else.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection from Poison<\/span>: Poison is common\n\t\tacross the full level range, making this a powerful defensive option at\n\t\tevery level.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this lasts until your next Long Rest, but doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\t\tConcentration, it&#8217;s a candidate for\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t\t>.\n\t\t<\/p><\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Silence<\/span>: Completely shut down\n\t\tspellcasting (Minor Illusion is an exception) inside the area of effect. A\n\t\tgreat way to counter enemy spellcasters, but since the area is small they\n\t\tcan often just exit the area in order to cast spells.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spiritual Weapon<\/span>: Summons in this game are\n\t\tabsolutely overpowered. The weapon gets its own initiative, moves and attacks\n\t\ton its own, and enemies will even try to attack it. The only problem is that\n\t\tthe Spiritual Weapon&#8217;s move speed is very slow and it can&#8217;t Dash, so in\n\t\tfights taking place over a large area you may struggle to move between\n\t\ttargets. The weapon&#8217;s movement is inexplicable affected by difficult terrain,\ntoo, but you may be able to fly over most it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Warding Bond<\/span>: A great way to protect a\n\t\tfrail party member (wizard) or to mitigate damage to your party&#8217;s Defender,\n\t\tbut be sure that damage to one target doesn&#8217;t accidentally take out two\n\t\tparty members.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this lasts until your next Long Rest, but doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\t\tConcentration, it&#8217;s a candidate for\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t\t>. However, since the caster won&#8217;t be in your party for you to watch their\n\t\t\thit points, you may return to camp and find the caster dead.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3rd-level\">3rd-Level Cleric Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3rd-level spells are a major power jump for full spellcasters, bringing heavy-hitting spells like Spirit Guardians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animate Dead<\/span>: An excellent addition to your party at any level, and with a little bit of effort you can turn your 1 to 3 undead minions into a terrifying force. See our\n<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/spells\/\">Practical Guide to Animate Dead<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beacon of Hope<\/span>: It&#8217;s very easy to use\n\t\tthis spell to turn yourself into a healbot and burn all of your resources to\n\t\trepair the damage that your enemies are doing with mundane attacks. Don&#8217;t\n\t\tmake that mistake. You want this for shared Advantage on Wisdom saves, and\n\t\teven then you won&#8217;t need that especially often. Your best bet is to use this\n\t\twhen you know you&#8217;re facing things that impose Wisdom saves, such as dragons\n\t\twith their Fear Aura.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bestow Curse<\/span>: Single-target, touch\n\t\trange, and the target gets a Wisdom save. The effects are diverse, which is\n\t\tgreat for a bard, but there&#8217;s almost always a good spell that does the same\n\t\tjob better.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dread<\/span>: 50% chance for the target to\n\t\t\t\tskip its turn. That&#8217;s very tempting, but against humanoids Hold Person\n\t\t\t\twill be much more effective since it targets the same save, allows a\n\t\t\t\trepeated save the same way, allows automatic critical hits, and robs the\n\t\t\t\ttarget of their turn 100% of the time rather than 50%.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Additional Damage<\/span>: This is basically\n\t\t\t\tHex&#8217;s damage boost, but everyone gets it. The target doesn&#8217;t get\n\t\t\t\tadditional saves to remove the effect, which is kind of nice. This could\n\t\t\t\tbe good against big enemies with a ton of hit points, but there will\n\t\t\t\talmost always be a better spell for that same enemy.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attack Disadvantage<\/span>: This isn&#8217;t a\n\t\t\t\tbad effect, but it can be done better by several other spells. On the\n\t\t\t\tsame Wisdom save, you can paralyze humanoids with Hold Person. You can\n\t\t\t\tuse Heat Metal to make enemies using metal weapons either drop their\n\t\t\t\tweapon or suffer Disadvantage to attacks. You could also use Dissonant\n\t\t\t\tWhispers or Feat to impose Disadvantage on both attacks and ability\n\t\t\t\tchecks, though those only last for one turn. Bestore Curse (Attack\n\t\t\t\tDisadvantage)&#8217;s advantage over those spells is that it lasts a full\n\t\t\t\tminute and the target can&#8217;t do anything about it. I&#8217;m not convinced\n\t\t\t\tthat that&#8217;s enough.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\"\n\t\t\t\t\t>Ability Disadvantage (Pick an Ability Score)<\/span\n\t\t\t\t>: Disadvantage on both checks and saving throws with the targeted\n\t\t\t\tability can make the target much more vulnerable. Strength will make it\n\t\t\t\teasy to Shove them, Constitution or Wisdom will make them vulnerable to\n\t\t\t\tmany save-or-suck spells. But you&#8217;re already trying to make them fail a\n\t\t\t\tsave, so why not just use one of those save-or-suck spells in the first\n\t\t\t\tplace?<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Daylight<\/span>: Most of the time Darkvision is plenty. Even if you actually need light, you can usually run around and drop candles (it doesn&#8217;t take an action to do so). The big appeal, which isn&#8217;t explained in the spell&#8217;s description, is that for the first minute after you cast the spell, it will trigger Sunlight Sensitivity. When facing enemies like duergar, drow, or myconids, you can debuff the entire encounter with no save. The radius of the light is also enormous, which is nice during Act 2.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Feign Death<\/span>: Why? I can&#8217;t think of a single\n\t\tpractical use for this spell. Sure, they get Resistance to almost all\n\t\tdamage, but since they&#8217;re unconscious your enemies crit them for free.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glyph of Warding<\/span>: You can lay this as a\n\t\ttrap, but if enemies are in the area, it triggers immediately, so you can\n\t\tuse it like any other AOE spell. Weirdly, all of the saves are Dexterity\n\t\tsaves, including the Sleep effect.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><strong>Sleep<\/strong>: Put enemies to sleep without worrying about\n\t\t\t\ttheir hit point total.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><strong>Detonation<\/strong>: Launch enemies away, potentially pushing\n\t\t\t\tthem into pits, off ledges, etc. Targets are pushed directly outward from\n\t\t\t\tthe center, so you&#8217;ll need to be precise with your placement.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><strong>Acid \/ Cold \/ Fire \/ Lightning \/ Thunder<\/strong>: Not as much\n\t\t\t\tdamage as Fireball, but you get to pick the damage type, which means\n\t\t\t\tthat you can capitalize on Wet enemies or other damage\n\t\t\t\tvulnerabilities.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Healing Word<\/span>: Worth at least a look\n\t\tif you&#8217;re not reserving Aid to rescue multiple dying allies at the same time.\n\t\tBut realistically, this will rarely see use for most players. Using Healing Word or throwing\n\t\ta potion to AOE heal multiple allies is typically sufficient.\n<p>But if you&#8217;re taking magic items which apply additional effects when you heal a creature (of which there are several), this is a great way to spread those buffs. Temporary hit points, Momentum, Bless, and additional healing can all be spread to your whole party via Mass Healing Word.<\/p>\n<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Energy<\/span>: A fantastic defensive buff to throw on your party\u2019s Defender, but, since this only affects one target and requires Concentration, it\u2019s often hard to justify over other options. If you can, get resistance from consumables or magic items.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Curse<\/span>: Rarely useful, but you may\n\t\tneed to briefly prepare it after combat to remove a curse.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Revivify<\/span>: Really good, but also available as a scroll for 200gp, or you can talk to Withers to raise them for a scaling amount depending on your party\u2019s level. If you finish combat and someone is dead, this will save you a pile of gold. But don\u2019t keep it prepared in combat unless you\u2019re comfortable that you couldn\u2019t prepare something more consistently useful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Speak with Dead<\/span>: Wonderful, extremely\n\t\tuseful, and tons of fun. You don&#8217;t need to make Charisma checks of any kind,\n\t\tso it&#8217;s fine to have your party&#8217;s low-Charisma characters do the work here.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s also a ritual spell, so it doesn&#8217;t even eat a spell slot. Prepare it,\n\t\tcast it for free, unprepare it.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that once you&#8217;ve cast this, you&#8217;re free to speak to \n\t\t\tcorpses until your next long rest. However, each corpse can answer a\n\t\t\tmaximum of 5 questions, and many won&#8217;t be willing to talk to their killer.\n\t\t\tOnce a corpse has been targeted with Speak with Dead, it can never be\n\t\t\ttargeted again. Quicksave if you&#8217;re not sure how it will go.<\/p\n\t\t><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Guardians<\/span>: A spell so iconic and so\n\t\tpowerful that it nearly monopolizes cleric optimization in the tabletop\n\t\trules, and while it has been nerfed compared to the tabletop rules, it&#8217;s\n\t\tstill amazing. Walk your cleric into a crowd, turn on Spirit Guardians, and\n\t\thave them spend the rest of the encounter casting Blade Ward to mitigate damage.\n\t\tIf enemies escape your magic blender, Shove them back in.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4th-level\">4th-Level Cleric Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Banishment<\/span>: The 2-turn duration means\n\t\tthat the target reappears at the end of your next turn, effectively removing\n\t\tthem from combat for one full round. That&#8217;s likely not enough for the cost\n\t\tin most cases, but that one round might be enough for you to set up the rest\n\t\tof your party to quickly eliminate them. This targets a Charisma save, and\n\t\tCharisma saves tend to be low for most enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Death Ward<\/span>: Excellent insurance,\n\t\tespecially for characters who draw a lot of attacks or who have cast Warding\n\t\tBond.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this lasts until your next Long Rest, but doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\t\tConcentration, it&#8217;s a candidate for\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t\t>.\n\t\t<\/p><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Freedom of Movement<\/span>: Not always useful,\n\t\tbut against enemies that rely on Paralyzed or Restrained, this can be huge.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this lasts until your next Long Rest, but doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\t\tConcentration, it&#8217;s a candidate for\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t\t>.\n\t\t<\/p><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guardian of Faith<\/span>:\n\t\tWhile this can be another source of concentrationless damage, you\u2019re better off upcasting Spiritual Weapon and getting the extra die of damage and having something that can at least move more than none, even if it can\u2019t do it very well.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5th-level\">5th-Level Cleric Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Contagion<\/span>: If you hit the target with the\n\t\tattack, they&#8217;re poisoned for a minimum of 3 turns. Poisoned is an extremely\n\t\teffective debuff, though many creatures are resistant or immune to it. Even\n\t\tso, the Poisoned effect may be more significant than the disease. The target\n\t\tmust fail a total of three saving throw to apply your chosen disease, which\n\t\tis a big gamble that takes a long time to pay off. Consider the Poisoned\n\t\teffect the primary effect of the spell, and think of the disease as a neat\n\t\tnovelty which might come up if you don&#8217;t manage to kill the target fast\n\t\tenough.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Filth Fever<\/span>: Disadvantage on\n\t\t\t\tStrength-based rolls. This is a trap for players who don&#8217;t read past the\n\t\t\t\tfirst option. It looks exciting because enemies often make melee attacks\n\t\t\t\twith Strength, and that&#8217;s scary. But your target already has\n\t\t\t\tDisadvantage on its attacks because it&#8217;s Poisoned, so basically this\n\t\t\t\tonly affects Shove. That is not enough.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Flesh Rot<\/span>: Disadvantage on\n\t\t\t\tCharisma-based rolls and vulnerability to <em>all<\/em> damage. Tempting\n\t\t\t\tagainst a boss, but nowhere near as good as Slimy Doom.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slimy Doom<\/span>: Disadvantage on\n\t\t\t\tConstitution-based rolls, and Stunned whenever it takes damage. Put your\n\t\t\t\ttarget into an area of ongoing damage, and you&#8217;re basically done with a\n\t\t\t\tfight.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Seizure<\/span>: Disadvantage on\n\t\t\t\tDexterity-based rolls. That might seem tempting for things like\n\t\t\t\tDexterity saves, but you could also get Slimy Doom and stun-lock them\n\t\t\t\tfor the rest of a fight, so why risk making them slightly more\n\t\t\t\tvulnerable but letting them fight on?<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Mindfire<\/span>: Disadvantage on\n\t\t\t\tIntelligence-based rolls. Cast Confusion instead.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Blinding Sickness<\/span>: Disadvantage on\n\t\t\t\tWisdom-based rolls and Blinded, giving you and your party Advantage to\n\t\t\t\tattack them. Cast Blindness instead.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Dispel Evil and Good<\/span>: Rarely more impactful\n\t\tthan casting Protection from Evil and Good.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Strike<\/span>: The Cleric&#8217;s answer to\n\t\tFireball. Having some of the damage be radiant allows the spell to\n\t\t(partially) get around common resistances to fire damage, but in a game\n\t\twhere you can always know your targets&#8217; resistances (mouse over them and\n\t\tpress T) there&#8217;s no excuse to accidentally run into a damage resistance. For\n\t\tthe same spell slot, you can upcast Spirit Guardians, walk into your\n\t\tenemies, and do as much damage by the end of the second round, then keep on\n\t\tblending.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Restoration<\/span>: Charm and Stun\n\t\teffects are typically short, but Petrification can be permanent, so your\n\t\tparty needs access to this. Don&#8217;t prepare it unless you&#8217;re expecting to face\n\t\tsomething that petrifies creatures. If you&#8217;re surprised, you can always\n\t\tprepare it outside of combat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Insect Plague<\/span>:\n\t\tGood ongoing area damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Mass Cure Wounds<\/span>: Basically never a good idea. This is a perfect example of the hit point attrition fight, which is nearly always a losing fight for the player. A 3rd-level Fireball does as much damage on average as this heals. Upcasting Aid to this level raises targets\u2019 current hit points and hit point maximums by 20, which is more than the average amount healed by this spell. Mass Healing Word solves the same \u201coh no, my allies are dying\u201d problem, and it\u2019s both a Bonus Action and two spell levels lower.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Planar Binding<\/span>: Basically Dominate Person\n\t\tfor Celestials, Elementals, Fey, and Fiends.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6th-level\">6th-Level Cleric Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>With a level cap of 12, 6th-level spells are the highest that we see in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3, making them the most powerful spells that you can get. Additionally, you only get one per day unless you have magic items to restore spell slots, so you want to choose carefully what\u2019s going to be the most impactful choice. This means that a combat trick like Heal, while tempting in the tabletop version, will likely be outclassed by Planar Ally or Heroes\u2019 Feast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Blade Barrier<\/span>: With a duration of just one turn, it\u2019s not the area control spell you might know from the tabletop rules. Instead, it\u2019s a burst of damage and a very short speed penalty.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Create Undead<\/span>:\n\t\tMummies are fine, but the Deva is a much better option for accomplishing the same thing (single target damage and fear) as it does a better damage type and can fly.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Harm<\/span>: Constitution saves tend to be high,\n\t\tand this can&#8217;t drop the target to 0 due to a weird tradition, so all around\n\t\tthis spell is a huge pain. Inflict Wounds cast at 6th level does an average\n\t\tof just 4 less damage, and if you can get Advantage on an attack roll,\n\t\tInflict Wounds is is considerably more effective on average.\n<p>If you take the Cull the Weak Illithid Power, Harm&#8217;s refusal to reduce creatures to 0 hp\nsuddenly stops being a problem.<\/p>\n<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Heal<\/span>: This is the only healing spell worth\n\t\tusing in combat with the intent getting your target higher than &#8220;just barely\n\t\tconscious&#8221;. 70 hp is enough that your target can actually endure a few hits\n\t\tbefore dropping to 0 again and wasting your spell slots.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heroes&#8217; Feast<\/span>: A spectacular defensive\n\t\tbuff. The hp maximum increase stacks with Aid.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this lasts until your next Long Rest, but doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\t\tConcentration, it&#8217;s a candidate for\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a\n\t\t\t>.\n\t\t<\/p><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Planar Ally<\/span>: A powerful summon that lasts all day.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Djinni<\/span>: Djinni is good if you want your summon\u2019s primary purpose to be disruption and light area control. They can poison targets, but poison is commonly resisted. This is a fine choice, but they don\u2019t hit as hard as Devas.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deva<\/span>: Swinging for a staggering 1d6 bludgeoning+4d8 radiant+1d6 psychic damage per turn (which also causes fear on a failed save), these are a DPR powerhouse. Also, they can cast revive once. Perfect for standing back up the cleric that got thrown off a cliff so they can get back to reviving everyone else.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cambion<\/span>: Charm is questionably useful in combat, and that\u2019s a cambion\u2019s main gimmick besides shooting rays of fire. Stick with something else unless you douse everything in arsonist\u2019s oil.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction While clerics are DnD&#8217;s iconic healer, their spell list certainly is not just that.
