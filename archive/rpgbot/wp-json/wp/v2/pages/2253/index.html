However, because 3.5 rewards specialization Fighters tend to pigeon-hole themselves into a small set of combat options, and when those options are ineffective they frequently find themselves useless in combat. The Fighter excels as a Defender and Striker, but completely lacks the ability to fill other roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Fighters are exceptionally diverse, this handbook will not present a specific build. Instead, it will provide general advice which should apply to most Fighters.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#substitution-levels\">Substitution Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#unearthed-arcana\">Unearthed Arcana<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapon-crystals\">Weapon Crystals<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armorshields\">Armor\/Shields<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor-and-shield-crystals\">Armor\/Shield Crystals<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rings\">Rings<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which tend to be more consistent than 3.5 handbooks. Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 hit points is standard for martial classes.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Full BAB.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Fortitude is the Fighter&#8217;s only good save.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor, tower shields, and martial weapons.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: 2+ skill ranks and the worst skill list in the game by a huge margin.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: The Fighter&#8217;s only class feature. Bonus Feats are why you play a Fighter (or take a 2-level class dip).\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Counterattack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially viable if you&#8217;re using a big two-handed weapon, but it cuts into your damage output and prevents you from using your swift action.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dragonscale Husk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DrM<\/a><\/sup>: This is a weird ability, and it strongly discourages multiclassing into anything which doesn&#8217;t provide heavy armor proficiency. You&#8217;ll probably do better just buying norma armor, but this could potentially save you a whole lot of money, and it&#8217;s a good option for builds which can&#8217;t sacrifice mobility to use heavy armor. The maximum dexterity bonus of +2 is enough for many Combat Reflexes users, but you may want more for really well-optimized area control defender builds.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dungeon Crasher<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">Ds<\/a><\/sup>: The bull rush component is the only important part of this ACF, and it&#8217;s plenty. 8d6 damage plus triple your strength bonus is a huge pile of damage, and you can do it as often as you like. Combined with Shock Trooper, this can be a fantastic component of charge builds, and can give you a fun option for positioning your enemies on the battlefield.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elusive Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: The bonus to AC isn&#8217;t nearly enough to compensate for the amount of damage ouput which you give up for this.<\/li>\n<!--\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit-and-Run Tactics<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DotU<\/a><\/sup>: Not much use for a Fighter, but absolutely fantastic on a class dip for Rogues. However, keep in mind that it only works when the target is flat-footed, so you either need to be invisible, hidden, or attacking during a surprise round.<\/li>\n-->\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Overpowering Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Fantastic for area control Defenders because it doubles the damage of your attacks of opportunity. It also removes the disappointment of rolling and missing with all of your iterative attacks.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Armored Mage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Very tempting for Gish builds like the Eldritch Knight, but you need to take a whole bunch of levels of Fighter so that you can cast higher level spells in armor, which means you&#8217;re giving up spellcasting levels.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Aligned Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: DR is one of the Fighter&#8217;s biggest problems, and the ability to align your weapon as a free action is better than any Cleric or Paladin can do.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Armor of God<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Will saves are one of the Fighter&#8217;s biggest problems. However, many fights involve enemies with no abilities that count on your Will saves, and the bonus is typeless so it will stack with anything.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resolute<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: This is a great option for addressing the Fighter&#8217;s poor Will saves. It&#8217;s an immediate action, so you can use it in response to effects which require a Will save instead of guessing when you might need it. You will probably need to forgo Power Attack on the following turn, but it&#8217;s better than being mind-controlled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"substitution-levels\">Substitution Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kobold Fighter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoDr<\/a><\/sup>: Standard class skills plus profession (miner).\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">1st level<\/span>: Spears are simple weapons with considerably better martial equivalents, and you give up heavy armor proficiency.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">2nd level<\/span>: A constitution bonus is tempting, but not very effective compared to a feat or Dungeon Crasher.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">4th level<\/span>: A Strength bonus is a nice bonus to attack and damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf Fighter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoDe<\/a><\/sup>: Standard class skills plus bluff, diplomacy and sense motive. 4 + intelligence modifier skill points at each substitution level. This allows the Fighter to serve as a passable Face, but adds an annoying dependence on Charisma. These substitution levels could make for a great class dip for Swashbucklers.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">1st level<\/span>: Replace your first level feat for two weapon focuses (rapier, longsword). The Rapier is a great option for a TWF build, but this definitely limits your options.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd level<\/span>: Two-Weapon fighting for free when wielding longsword\/rapier and dagger. Rapier\/Dagger is a fine combo, but it won&#8217;t be as effective as using two identical weapons to capitalize on Weapon Specialization.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">6th level<\/span>: This is a fun mechanic with a cool flavor, and it offsets the TWF penalties.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf Fighter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoS<\/a><\/sup>: Standard class skills plus Knowledge (dungeoneering). d12 hit die at each substitution level. Dungeoneering is one of the most important Knowledge skills, and it gives you a good option for your one skill point. The bonus hit points aren&#8217;t much, but starting with 12+ at first level feels nice. Unfortunately the abilities are all fairly terrible.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">1st level<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using a greataxe or an axe with a shield, this is fine.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">2nd level<\/span>: Weapon specialization is strictly better.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">8th level<\/span>: Essentially Armor Focus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Planar Fighter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PH<\/a><\/sup>: Standard class skills plus knowledge (the planes). Planes is one of the better Knowledge skills, and it gives you a good option for your one skill point.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">4th level<\/span>: Weapon specialization is strictly better.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">8th level<\/span>: The Aligned Strike alternative class feature is strictly better.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">12th level<\/span>: A dimensional anchor effect on you. Nice for grapplers, but situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Raptoran Fighter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RoW<\/a><\/sup>: Some great options for Raptorans.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">1st level<\/span>: Useful for raptorans, especially if you wear heavy armor.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">4th level<\/span>: Weapon specialization when you are higher than your opponent. Raptorans are all about flight, so being higher than your opponent should be a given.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">8th level<\/span>: Nice bonuses to flying speeds. Stacks with others so it is worth the trade.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unearthed-arcana\">Unearthed Arcana<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Content from Unearthed Arcana is generally considered optional variant rules. Many of these options are poorly balanced, so be sure to consult your DM before selecting any such options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thug Fighter<\/span>: For lightly armored builds, the Thug can be a fun improvement to the Fighter. The extra class skills allow you to serve as a Face. Unfortunately you give up the bonus feat at first level, but many builds can afford to give up one feat.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Variant Fighter<\/span>: Trade in your bonus feats for the Rogue&#8217;s Sneak Attack progression. I can imagine a few builds where this might be helpful, but the primary reason to play a Fighter is for the feats.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Fighter&#8217;s abilities vary depending on your build, but the emphasis on physical ability scores is constant across nearly every Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Almost every Fighter is Strength-based, and even the ones who aren&#8217;t need Strength for the damage bonus and access to Power Attack.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Great for AC, Reflex saves, and Combat Reflexes. If you don&#8217;t want to go for Combat Reflexes, you can get away with as little as 10 thanks to Heavy Plate.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are absolutely crucial.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Only useful if you want Combat Expertise.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: You need a bit for the Fighter&#8217;s garbage Will saves, but that&#8217;s all that it gets you.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump stat.\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to physical ability scores are nice, but bonus feats are often more important. Medium size is preferred, especially for Defender builds which rely on being enlarged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: A great defensive option, Dwarfs get a whole mess of good bonuses beyond their Constitution bonus.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The bonus to Dexterity is nice for archer builds, but the constitution bonus hurts a lot.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Small size and a penalty to Strength severely limit your options. None of the Gnomes abilities are useful for Fighters.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Awful.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The Strength bonus is tempting, but the Human bonus feat is considerably more effective.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: Your best bet for small Fighter builds, but still not a great option.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: The gold standard. A bonus feat is a huge bonus, but the Human&#8217;s bonus skill points are wasted on the Fighter.\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): Training animals isn&#8217;t useful for Fighters.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): The Fighter doesn&#8217;t have a way to bring Intimidate into play effectively.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jump<\/span> (Str): Only useful if you want Leap Strike.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Mounts are not typically important for Fighters, but if you want to play a mounted combat build you will need to max Ride.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swim<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-green\">Abberation Blood<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: The aberant feats are surprisingly good for Fighters, though they tend to be supportive or utilitarian in nature, with a couple notable exceptions. Remember that you&#8217;ll look a bit&#8230; odd, so you may want to skip aberant feats in highly social campaigns.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bestial Hide<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Only good if you take a at least 3 other aberant feats.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deepspawn<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Small bonus attacks like these are best left to Rogues. The damage is puny compared to what you can do with a weapon.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Durable Form<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Improved Toughness will get you considerably more hit points.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inhuman Reach<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Permanently extend your reach by 5 feet. A -1 to attacks is nothing considering how good reach is.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scavenging Gullet<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Only applies to ingested poisons. There are plenty of ways to make food edible without a feat.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Starspawn<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Allows short bursts of flight with average maneuverability. Great for getting into combat, jumping pits, ascending walls, etc.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warped Mind<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: Will saves are one of the Fighter&#8217;s biggest defensive gaps, but you need at least 3 other aberrant feats for this to match Iron Will or Combat Focus.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Waterspawn<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">LoM<\/a><\/sup>: There are plenty of ways to get a swim speed, and if you&#8217;re in a campaign where you need a permanent swim speed you should probably be playing something that has a natural swim speed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ancestral Relic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">BoED<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s hard to fit this into complex builds, but it&#8217;s potentially a better way to get a cheap magic item than having a party member craft it. Since you can convert magic items&#8217; entire value, you don&#8217;t lose half of your loot&#8217;s value by selling it. This can allow the rest of your party to take things like art and gems, and leave you with all of the vendor trash items, thereby setting the whole party well ahead of the normal loot curve.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blind-Fight<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Great at high levels when enemies will start having access to effects like Blur. It is also helpful if your party likes to use effects like Obscuring Mist to disrupt enemies.<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-blue\">Brutal Throw<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAd<\/a><\/sup>: Thrown weapon builds can be very effective, and this removes the need for Dexterity.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power Throw<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAd<\/a><\/sup>: Lacking an equivalent to Power Attack is one of the biggest problems with archery in 3.5, but thrown weapons get Power Throw. This can add up to some fairly ridiculous damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brutal Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: The short description says that you can daze targets, but the full description says that you can only sicken targets, and even then its only for 1 round.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Brute<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CW<\/a><\/sup>: The first benefits works very well with Dungeon Crasher: smash enemies into the wall, then hit them on your next turn with a big bonus to attack and damage. The third benefit works on both a regular charge and on a bull rush, assuming your charged to initiate the bull rush, so you can combine the first and third benefits. The bonus to attacks from the first benefit can help to offset your Power Attack penalty, too.<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Expertise<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Adds a difficult dependence on Intelligence, but this is a great way to boost your AC in fights where you&#8217;re taking a lot of hits.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Combat Expertise<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CW<\/a><\/sup>: You probably don&#8217;t want to sacrifice more attack bonus than Combat Expertise already allows.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Disarm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Only a small subset of enemies use weapons which you can disarm.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Feint<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Only useful for Rogues, and even then nearly no Rogues take it.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Trip<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Trip builds are popular because they&#8217;re effective.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whirlwind Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Extremely hard to bring into play, and it costs a huge pile of feats to get.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Focus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: By itself Combat Focus isn&#8217;t as good as Iron Will because it only applies while you&#8217;re in combat, and only lasts 10-15 rounds. The big appeal is the other Combat Focus feats, but unfortunately only a couple of them are worthwhile.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Awareness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Learning enemy&#8217;s hit point totals is very informative, and can help you plan out your turns. Blindsight might seem worthless at 5 feet, but that&#8217;s enough to get adjacent to invisible enemies and murder them.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Combat Defense<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: This helps make Dodge less painful if you took it for something else, but Dodge is still complete garbage.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Combat Stability<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s extremely rare for enemies to use these special attacks.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: The biggest problem with Combat Focus is the short duration, and ending it early greatly exacerbates this problem. Still, this can be a great finishing move when your duration is running low or when you&#8217;re nearly guaranteed to kill the last enemy in the fight. Use Combat Awareness to make sure you don&#8217;t use this prematurely.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Vigor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Fast healing is a great way to keep yourself alive during a fight, especially when it jumps to fast healing 4.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Reflexes<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Required for area control Defenders.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hold the Line<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CW<\/a><\/sup>: The wording of the feat seems to ignore the possibility of reach, which is weird because the most likely users of this feat will have reach. It&#8217;s only one extra attack when people charge you, but an enlarged fighter with a spiked chain has 15 foot reach, and can get a total of 3 attacks.

Check with your DM, and you may be able to get a +2 belt, or upgrade your gloves past +2.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ioun Stone (Dusty Rose)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: At only 5000gp, a Dusty Rose Ioun Stone provides a cheaper boost to AC than upgrading your Ring of Protection from +1 to +2. The bonus is an insight bonus, which makes it easy to stack because insight bonuses to AC are extremely rare.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shirt of Demonskin\/The Fey\/The Inevitable\/Ironskin\/The Moon\/Slaadskin\/The Treant<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: DR 3\/something for 15,000 gp. Expensive, but if you&#8217;re not using adamantine heavy armor it&#8217;s a great way to get DR. Absolutely <em>do not<\/em> get a Shirt of Resilience. By the time you can afford this nearly everything you meet can bypass DR\/magic. DR\/adamantine is my favorite because only things like Iron Golems can bypass it without an adamantine weapon.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot. A strictly better choice than a Cloak of Resistance, unless you plan to buy a Shirt of X for DR.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Essential for Defender builds, large size gets you constant reach. Coupled with a spiked chain, you get a total of 15 foot reach, allowing you to dominate huge portions of the battlefield. The bonus strength is nice, but the penalty to Dexterity cuts into your attacks of opportunity, and you lose a total of 2 to your AC, which can be problematic.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reduce Person<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: For dexterity-based Fighters, being reduced from medium to small size can provide a nice bonus to Dexterity, AC, and attacks. However, be sure not to go down to tiny or you won&#8217;t be able to attack into adjacent squares.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">See invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With no way to handle invisible creatures, the ability to always see them is a fantastic benefit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Barbarian<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A one level dip can get you both Rage and Pounce. Rage doesn&#8217;t really scale with level, so you aren&#8217;t missing much by only taking one level. Two levels and the Wolf Totem gets you Improved Trip without needing Combat Expertise, which greatly simplifies area control Defender builds, and reduces MAD a bit.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crusader\/Swordsage\/Warblade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: Maneuvers and Stances are great for Fighters, and the Tome of Battle classes are all full BAB, and complement the Fighter&#8217;s existing abilities very nicely.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re going for an unarmed build, Monks get you a lot of good things for a one or two level class dip.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide
