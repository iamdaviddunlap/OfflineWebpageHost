Bonuses to Constitution are also important since the Barbarian&#8217;s AC is typically much worse than that of other front-line Defenders like the Fighter or the Paladin, and Reckless Attack compounds that challenge. Even with damage resistances from rage, you still need those extra hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Medium size can also be important for barbarians. Since most barbarians opt for large two-handed weapons, medium size is a good idea because small characters will suffer Disadvantage to use heavy weapons like greataxes. If you&#8217;re planning to use a shield or play Path of the Beast, size is less important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond those core requirements, look for traits which solve problems for the Barbarian. Damage resistances are great, move speed is nice, and other traits which complement the Barbarian&#8217;s usual tactics can be very helpful. Darkvision is great since the Barbarian can&#8217;t cast spells to get it. Additional skill proficiencies will help you stay useful outside of combat, though Primal Knowledge should give you enough if you&#8217;re using Optional Class Features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Innate Spellcasting intended to be used in combat is a poor choice because you can&#8217;t cast spells or concentrate on spells while raging.

However, the damage output gained from doing so is typically smaller than what you give up for using a two-handed weapon, and if you\u2019re not using a two-handed weapon you typically want to use a shield.<\/p>\n\t<p>Secondary Arms offers an opportunity to use two-weapon fighting alongside either a shield or a two-handed weapon. Until you get extra attack you can go handaxe+handaxe+shield, then at level 5 you might switch to handaxe+handaxe+greataxe, attacking once with each, or you might stick to the handaxes and shield. Three attacks with the handaxe, despite losing your ability score bonus on the Bonus Action attack, will exceed the DPR of a two-handed weapon.<\/p>\n\t<p>If we compare a greatsword (4d6 + Str*2 + Rage*2) to two-weapon fighting with handaxes (3d6 + Str*2 + Rage*3), the difference in damage is the difference between 1d6 for the greatsword attacks and one application of your Rage bonus with the handaxes. The rage bonus scales very slowly, so the greatsword attacks have a very minor advantage (1.5 average damage initially), but compare that to the benefits of a +2 AC bonus. Plus, once you get Extra Attack you can do handaxe+handaxe+longsword+shield and reduce that damage gap to just 0.5 average damage. There&#8217;s an action economy cost to doing this, of course, but if you weren&#8217;t consistently using your Bonus Action already this could be great.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-tiefling\">Tiefling<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-custom\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Customized Origin<\/span>: +2 Str, +1 Con,\n\tDarkvision, and fire resistance.
