Because there is no overlap in revelations between Mysteries, each Mystery makes the Oracle very unique. Note that Oracles get 6 Revelations normally, but can pick up more with the Extra Revelation feat. Also note that you cannot select a revelation more than once according to <a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/paizo\/faq\/v5748nruor1fn#v5748eaic9nk0\">The FAQ<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mysteries\">Mysteries<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ancestor\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/oracle.html#ancestor\">Ancestor<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bonus Spells and Revelations, the two biggest parts of a Mystery, are the worst parts of the Ancestor Mystery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skills<\/span>: ALL knowledge skills.\n\tLinguistics can be mostly replaced with the Tongues spell, but opening up\n\tknowledge skills allows you to serve as your party&#8217;s Librarian.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Very few good options.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">unseen servant<\/span>: Cool utility, but being\n\t\table to clean your house magically isn&#8217;t very helpful in most\n\t\tsituations.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">spiritual weapon<\/span>: Decent ongoing damage\n\t\tand it stays passable at higher levels as it adds attacks, but it&#8217;s not\n\t\tgoing to win you any fights.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">heroism<\/span>: Solid single-target buff with a\n\t\tgood duration, and it&#8217;s not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list for some\n\t\treason.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">spiritual ally<\/span>: Decent as a stand0-in\n\t\tdefender or flanker, but not a spectacular source of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">telekinesis<\/span>: Fantastic utility. Not on the\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-green\">greater heroism<\/span>: Nice buff, but the\n\t\tduration is fairly short, and it won&#8217;t stack with all of the other great\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle buffs which provide morale bonuses.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">ethereal jaunt<\/span>: Great for scouting,\n\t\tinfiltration, and escape.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">vision<\/span>: How often do you think you are\n\t\tgoing to need to cast Legend Lore in combat? With the exception of the\n\t\tpossible days\/weeks casting times for Legend Lore, you really shouldn&#8217;t need\n\t\tthis. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list, but you get it a level late.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">astral projection<\/span>: Good way to &#8220;safely&#8221;\n\t\ttravel the outer planes, but situational.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revelations<\/span>: Despite a couple of excellent\n\toptions, most of the list is poor.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ancestral Weapon<\/span> (Su): Situational. The\n\t\tweapon won&#8217;t be able to keep up with a modestly enhanced weapon, so don&#8217;t\n\t\tuse this if you plan to be a combat caster. The Ghost Touch property is\n\t\tsituational, and it could be nice when you occasionally encounter\n\t\tincorporeal enemies, but as a spellcaster you have plenty of other\n\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blood of Heroes<\/span> (Su): You have the full\n\t\tCleric spell list, which includes a ton of options for Morale bonuses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Phantom Touch<\/span> (Su): Your spells should be\n\t\tmiles better than this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sacred Council<\/span> (Su): This would be great\n\t\tif you could use it as an immediate action, but using it as a move action\n\t\tcan be nice if you need to make an attack roll as part of a spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit of the Warrior<\/span> (Su): When you\n\t\tabsolutely, positively need to walk over there and fuck someone up. The\n\t\tability bonuses are fantastic, but getting full BAB and Improved Critical\n\t\treally add a lot to this ability. Combine it with other buff spells, and you\n\t\tcan turn yourself into an unstoppable hulk of divine fury.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Shield<\/span> (Su): Easily the best of the\n\t\tarmor revelations. The scaling matches the best of them, and an ongoing 50%\n\t\tmiss chance against ranged attacks is absolutely amazing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Walk<\/span> (Su): Excellent for escape or\n\t\tinfiltration similar to the Ehterealness spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Storm of Souls<\/span> (Su): The damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tgood enough for how few uses per day you get.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Voice of the Grave<\/span> (Su): Situational,\n\t\tbut very useful when it comes up. Can easily be replaced by the Speak with\n\t\tDead spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wisdom of the Ancestors<\/span> (Su): Commune is\n\t\ta great spell despite the 500gp cost. Make sure to talk to your GM to make\n\t\tsure that they are okay giving you this much information on a daily\n\t\tbasis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Blindsense is fantastic,\n\tand 60 ft. of it is amazing. The +4 bonus to cast levels is spectacular. The\n\tCharisma bonus to saves is nice, but won&#8217;t stack with Divine Protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"battle\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#battle\">Battle<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Battle mystery is a fantastic choice for combat caster Oracles. The skill list is sparse, but the spell list contains several fantastic buffs and some good area control spells, and the Revelations list includes several options which are absolutely fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skills<\/span>: Perception is really the\n\tonly new skill worth having.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Required for a Face, but\n\t\tBattle doesn&#8217;t give you Bluff, so you probably aren&#8217;t a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (engineering)<\/span> (Int): Perhaps the\n\t\tleast useful Knowledge skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The most rolled skill in\n\t\tthe game, and it&#8217;s dependent on your primary ability score.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Oracles aren&#8217;t good at Mounted\n\t\tCombat. Not worth more than one rank.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Battle starts off with a very\n\tsolid spell list which starts to lose steam at mid-level. However, the low\n\tlevel options continue to be excellent into high levels, so expect to continue\n\tusing them for a long time.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">enlarge person<\/span>: Essential and fantastic at\n\t\tany level. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">fog cloud<\/span>: Decent area control. Not on\n\t\tthe Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">magic vestment<\/span>: A fantastic way to save\n\t\tyourself a ton of money on armor\/shield enhancements.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">wall of fire<\/span>: Excellent area control. Not\n\t\ton the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">righteous might<\/span>: Extremely powerful buff\n\t\tif you are a combat caster.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">mass bull&#8217;s strength<\/span>: By this level\n\t\teveryone in the party who needs bull&#8217;s strength should have a belt which\n\t\tprovides at least a +4 bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">control weather<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">earthquake<\/span>: Situational and hard to\n\t\thandle at the table because the effect is so complicated.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">storm of vengeance<\/span>: This is a weird\n\t\tspell. It&#8217;s hard to time, it&#8217;s hard to use, and it&#8217;s hard to not do just as\n\t\tmuch damage to your party. Already on the cleric spell list.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelations<\/span>: Battle gets a ton of excellent\n\toptions, including several which provide the value of 2 or 3 feats, which is a\n\tfantastic return on your investment.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Battlecry<\/span> (Ex): Bless is better until\n\t\tlevel 10, and Bless is a first level spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battlefield Clarity<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls on\n\t\tanything are great, and rerolling a saving throw might save your life. All\n\t\tof the effects listed can take you out of a fight (with the exception of\n\t\tShaken), so rerolling could save your life. This would be blue without the\n\t\t+4 bonus to the reroll.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Healer<\/span> (Su): Healing as a swift\n\t\taction is a great trick because you can cast other spells or hit things in\n\t\tthe same round. Consuming two spell slots is already hard, and the limited\n\t\tuses per day make it difficult to take advantage of this Revelation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Skin<\/span> (Su): Stoneskin is an excellent\n\t\tbuff, but the high material cost makes it difficult to use frequently.\n\t\tRemoving the component cost makes this ability a fantastic defensive\n\t\tbuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maneuver Mastery<\/span> (Ex): For the price of\n\t\tone Revelation (or one Feat if you take Extra Revelation), you get to use\n\t\tyour class level in place of your BAB (worth a feat) and you get two free\n\t\tfeats. This is a huge return on your investment. You don&#8217;t get the feats\n\t\tuntil fairly high level, but adding a combat maneuver to your list of tricks\n\t\tcan really give you a lot of options in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resiliency<\/span> (Ex): Even if you spend a lot of\n\t\ttime nearly dead, actually hitting 0 hit points is pretty rare. Diehard is a\n\t\ttrap that gets stupid people killed by convincing them that they can run\n\t\taround at negative hit points and do things.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skill at Arms<\/span> (Ex): Better than spending\n\t\ta feat on Armor Proficiency, but Martial weapons aren&#8217;t significantly better\n\t\tthe simple weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Surprising Charge<\/span> (Ex): This is a great\n\t\tway to get into reach so that you can make a full attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">War Sight<\/span> (Su): Rolling twice for\n\t\tinitiative is fantastic. Being guaranteed an action in the surprise round is\n\t\tnice because Oracles don&#8217;t have great Wisdom or Perception. Rolling three\n\t\ttimes at 11th level is ridiculously good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): 3 feats for the price\n\t\tof a revelation (or a feat if you took Extra Revelation). This works well\n\t\twith Skill at Arms, which allows you to pick a weapon which can take\n\t\tadvantage of Improved Critical, such as a falchion, or if you want to use\n\t\tManeuver Mastery, go for something like a flail or a guisarme.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Moving and making a Full\n\tAttack fixes a lot of problems with combat characters. The other benefits are\n\tsecondary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bones\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#bones\">Bones<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bones provides a lot of excellent options. You can serve as the party&#8217;s Face and do a bit of scouting due to the class list, and at high levels you get access to some very scary save or die spells. Bones&#8217; biggest shortcoming is its Revelations, which are decent but not very exciting. Because this Mystery involves creating undead, check with your GM to make sure they are okay with you bringing an army of undead pets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skills<\/span>: Bluff and Intimidate give the\n\tOracle all of the skills needed to be the party&#8217;s Face, and Disguise and\n\tStealth are helpful for Scouts.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Required for a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise<\/span> (Cha): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Required for a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Required for a Scout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Bones grants a lot of\n\texcellent spells, many of which aren&#8217;t on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list. At\n\thigh level, you get a couple of excellent save or die spells which will\n\toutright end most encounters.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">cause fear<\/span>: This is mediocre even at low\n\t\tlevel, and it stops working very quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">false life<\/span>: Temporary hit points are a\n\t\tgreat buff, and duration is fantastic. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell\n\t\tlist.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">animate dead<\/span>: Pet undead are always\n\t\tgreat. Even if you don&#8217;t take them into combat, a few skeletons make for\n\t\texcellent manual labor. Already on the Cleric spell list. Not on the\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">fear<\/span>: Excellent area control. Panicked\n\t\tcauses things to run away, and if they&#8217;re cornered, cowering foes are\n\t\tconsidered helpless, which makes them coup de grace bait. Not on the\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">slay living<\/span>: Reasonable damage for two\n\t\tor three levels after you get it, but because the damage dice don&#8217;t scale,\n\t\tit falls off quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">circle of death<\/span>: Area of effect save or\n\t\tdie. You get an average of 2.5 hit dice per caster level, so at level 12 you\n\t\tcan outright kill 30 hit dice worth of enemies. That will cover basically\n\t\tevery enemy of your CR, and could wipe out entire encounters made up of\n\t\tseveral weaker enemies. As long as your Charisma is high enough to give you\n\t\ta good DC, this can stay lethal and effective for several levels. Not on the\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">control undead<\/span>: Allows you to control\n\t\tmore undead pets, and you can steal mindless undead from other\n\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">horrid wilting<\/span>: Decent single-target\n\t\tdamage, but at this level you can use save or die spells with the save DC.\n\t\tNot on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">wail of the banshee<\/span>: The pinnacle of save\n\t\tor die spells. Outright murder whole rooms of foes. Be careful not to murder\n\t\tyour own party. They won&#8217;t like that. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell\n\t\tlist.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revelations<\/span>: Several decent options, but\n\tnone of the options are really fantastic.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Armor of Bones<\/span> (Su): This will take a\n\t\twhile to catch up to a breastplate, but at high levels this can save you\n\t\tquite a bit of time and money. I&#8217;m not sure if you can enhance the armor\n\t\twith Magic Vestment, but if you can your AC should be excellent. Also note\n\t\tthat this armor has no ACP, which is nice if you want to take advantage of\n\t\tStealth as a class skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bleeding Wounds<\/span> (Su): Bleed effects\n\t\taren&#8217;t usually a problem, and the bleed damage is very small.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Death&#8217;s Touch<\/span> (Su): A nice way to heal\n\t\tyour undead minions, but it doesn&#8217;t provide much healing. I would never use\n\t\tthis in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Near Death<\/span> (Su): diseases and poison\n\t\tbecome very common at high levels, and mind-affecting affects include almost\n\t\tall Will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Raise the Dead<\/span> (Su): Even with high\n\t\tCharisma, you can&#8217;t expect this to last more than a minute, and you can only\n\t\tuse it a maximum of twice per day. Cast Summon Monster if you need a\n\t\tshort-term pet.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resist Life<\/span> (Su): If you are in an evil\n\t\tparty, this is excellent. Oracles usually take the place of the party&#8217;s\n\t\tCleric, so you can&#8217;t expect anyone to be channelling energy, but this means\n\t\tthat you don&#8217;t need to learn cure spells. Remember that you get to select\n\t\tall Cure or all Inflict spells for free.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Soul Siphon<\/span> (Su): A negative level with\n\t\tno saving throw, and a bit of healing. It&#8217;s a pretty nice combination, but\n\t\tthe limited uses per day are tragic, and this won&#8217;t keep pace with your\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Walk<\/span> (Su): A great way to get\n\t\tthrough walls, but situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Undead Servitude<\/span> (Su): If you plan to\n\t\tcontrol undead, this is a must-have.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Voice of the Grave<\/span> (Su): An excellent\n\t\tway to gather information, but knowing Speak With Dead is considerably less\n\t\tcumbersome, and you don&#8217;t need it very often.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Several excellent options.\n\tAnimate Dead without the material cost won&#8217;t matter a lot at this point, but\n\tif you plan to animate hundreds of zombies, it can save you quite a bit of\n\tmoney on Obsidian. Power Word Kill is great too because it doesn&#8217;t allow a\n\tsaving throw like Wail of the Banshee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dark-tapestry\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/oracle.html#dark-tapestry\">Dark Tapestry<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dark Tapestry is a solid Mystery. It has a good mix of options, and it can fill a variety of roles depending on your selections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skills<\/span>: Knowledge (Arcana) is the\n\tonly thing that you really need, but Stealth can be nice if you want to be\n\tstealthy.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disguise<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intimidate<\/span>: <\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Arcana)<\/span> (Int): One of the most\n\t\timportant Knowledge skills in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stealth<\/span>: Great for Scouts, but this\n\t\tMystery doesn&#8217;t give you many Scouting options. Be sure to pick up Cloak of\n\t\tDarkness.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Very few poor options, and\n\tseveral very good ones from the Wizard spell list.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">entropic shield<\/span>: The closest thing to\n\t\tBlur that you are likely to get. This is excellent at higher levels as the\n\t\tduration increases.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">dust of twilight<\/span>: The Darkness effect is\n\t\tvery situational, and Fatigued is pointless. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell\n\t\tlist.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">tongues<\/span>: Very important for talking to\n\t\tthe weird races and creatures of the multiverse, even if you&#8217;re not the\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Face. You get it a level earlier than other Clerics and Oracles.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">black tentacles<\/span>: One of the best area\n\t\tcontrol spells in the game. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">feeblemind<\/span>: Crippling save or suck spell,\n\t\tespecially for arcane spellcasters.Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">planar binding<\/span>: Planar Binding spells are\n\t\tvery powerful, though they can be very costly. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle\n\t\tspell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">insanity<\/span>: Confusion isn&#8217;t a great status\n\t\tcondition because it is unreliable, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with a permanent\n\t\tdebuff.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-green\">reverse gravity<\/span>: Somewhat difficult to\n\t\tuse, but excellent for killing things with falling damage. Not on the\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">interplanetary teleport<\/span>: This depends\n\t\tentirely on your campaign. If there are other planets in your game it can be\n\t\tgreat. If ther aren&#8217;t, you have no reason to cast this.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Revelations<\/span>: A mixed bag. Some of the\n\toptions are fantastic, but just as many are poor or very situational.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Brain Drain<\/span> (Su): Very situational, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s likely that your own Knowledge skills will be better. The damage is a\n\t\tnice addition, but you should have plenty of better options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Darkness<\/span> (Su): Unlike other\n\t\tsimilar Revelations which give you an armor bonus, this also gives you a\n\t\tskill bonus. The bonus scales well enough that it can replace your\n\t\tBreastplate, and you get a nice bonus to stealth, too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dweller in Darkness<\/span> (Sp): Once per day\n\t\tsave or die effect. Great, but Phantasmal Killer is both a Death, Fear, and\n\t\tMind-Affecting effect, which can mean a lot of situational resistances come\n\t\tinto play.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gift of Madness<\/span> (Su): Confusion is a\n\t\tvery unpredictable status effect. The target has a reasonable chance of\n\t\tacting normally on any round in which they are confused, which means you\n\t\twasted your turn using this ability. There are much better uses for your\n\t\tturn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Interstellar Void<\/span> (Su): Decent\n\t\tsingle-target blast, and being able to stun someone is pretty good, but you\n\t\tonly get to use it once or twice per day. The fatigued\/exhausted conditions\n\t\tare generally worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Many Forms<\/span> (Su): Polymorphing is\n\t\tsomething that you need to plan for at character creation. If you want to\n\t\tmake use of this Revelation, read my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a>. You get access to enough polymorph spells that you could make good use of\n\t\tthem, but don&#8217;t let it eclipse your role as a spellcaster.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pierce the Veil<\/span> (Su): Darkvision is\n\t\tfantastic, and it&#8217;s not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list, so this is a great\n\t\tway for you to get Darkvision.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Read the Tapestry<\/span> (Sp): This is\n\t\tdangerous for an Oracle because you don&#8217;t have the Wizard&#8217;s Intelligence to\n\t\tprotect you from the Intelligence\/Charisma penalty. If it doesn&#8217;t go badly,\n\t\tthis can be a great way to gather information, but Oracles have access to\n\t\tplenty of other good Divination options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Touch of the Void<\/span> (Su): The damage won&#8217;t be\n\t\tgood past about 3rd level, and the Fatigued condition hardly matters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings of Darkness<\/span> (Su): Flight is crucial\n\t\tat high levels, and activating a new movement type as a swift action gives\n\t\tyou a ton of really great tactical options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: DR 5\/-, some excellent\n\timmunities, and you can cast the best Polymorph spell in the game without a\n\tMaterial component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"flame\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#flame\">Flame<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The lousy skill list is Flame&#8217;s only drawback, and you might not even consider that a drawback because you can afford to dump Intelligence. The spell list and revelations provide fantastic Blaster spells and effects, and Body of Flame can completely define how you build your character if you let it. Imagine walking around as a Huge Fire Elemental slinging flaming death at your enemies. It&#8217;s glorious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Absolutely nothing that you\n\twant, so feel free to dump Intelligence.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): You are an Oracle. Put on\n\t\tsome armor, stand still, and wave your mace at something.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): This Mystery does not\n\t\tmake for a good face, but I have to admit that turning into a Huge fire\n\t\telemental for hours at a time is pretty intimidating.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perform<\/span> (Cha): Why is this here?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Some of the absolute best\n\tfire-elemental blast spells in the game from the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard\n\tspell lists.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">burning hands<\/span>: Even at low levels, this\n\t\tisn&#8217;t great. The AOE is nice for such a low level spell, but the damage is\n\t\tpitiful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">resist energy<\/span>: Essential for any\n\t\tspellcaster.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">fireball<\/span>: The essential, iconic blaster\n\t\tspell.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">wall of fire<\/span>: Excellent area control.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-red\">summon monster V (fire elementals only)<\/span>:\n\t\tOracles can already learn this without the limitation. Not on the\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">fire seeds<\/span>: The holly berries option is\n\t\tinsane. Charge eight berries, then some time in the next hour or two, drop\n\t\tthem in the other guy&#8217;s square, and step back out of the 5 foot blast\n\t\tradius. Trigger all 8 for for 8d8 plus 8 times your caster level. The acorn\n\t\tversion is bad. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">fire storm<\/span>: Fireballs bigger, scarier,\n\t\tmore shapeable brother. Not only can you choose the shape of the spell, but\n\t\tit adds 4d6 ongoing fire damage. This is absolutely devastating. Of, and you\n\t\tget it a level ahead of other Clerics.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">incendiary cloud<\/span>: Almost an area control\n\t\tspell, but because it moves away from you you can&#8217;t actually use it to\n\t\tcontrol an area.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">fiery body<\/span>: A fantastic buff, and not on\n\t\tthe Cleric\/Oracle spell list. I&#8217;m not sure how this combines with the Body\n\t\tof Flame Revelation, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s awesome.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelations<\/span>: A lot of really interesting\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Burning Magic<\/span> (Su): This isn&#8217;t a ton of\n\t\tdamage, but it&#8217;s a nice way to force Concentration checks or stop\n\t\tregeneration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cinder Dance<\/span> (Ex): The equivalent of\n\t\ttaking Fleet twice, plus two other feats for the cost of one revelation.\n\t\tDramatically improves your mobility, and makes difficult terrain largely\n\t\tirrelevant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire Breath<\/span> (Su): Your spells are more\n\t\tpowerful. Firestorm is miles better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Firestorm<\/span> (Su): You only get to use it\n\t\tonce, but this is can be used as both a blast effect and an area control\n\t\teffect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Form of Flame<\/span> (Su): The Elemental Body\n\t\tspells are pretty bad by polymorph standards, but they provide some nice\n\t\tresistances and armor. Plus, walking around as a gigantic fire elemental all\n\t\tday is super awesome. Remember that your equipment is largely absorbed by\n\t\tyour new form, so you can&#8217;t use your weapon or your armor while polymorphed.\n\t\tSee my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a>\n\t\tfor help preparing yourself for this ability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gaze of Flames<\/span> (Su): The ability to see\n\t\tthrough smoke\/fog is really only helpful if you create it. The ability to\n\t\tuse Clairvoyance without casting a spell is the biggest draw here.\n\t\tClairvoyance is fantastic for scouting safely, and because you can stretch\n\t\tthe rounds out however you like, you can do lots of short scouts throughout\n\t\tthe day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heat Aura<\/span> (Su): The damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tfantastic, but it&#8217;s a swift action AOE, which is nice for cleaning up weaker\n\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Molten Skin<\/span> (Ex): Fire is the most common\n\t\ttype of elemental damage, so this is nice to have. You can replace it with\n\t\tResist Energy or with the Form of Flame Revelation, but immunity at 17th is\n\t\tstill great. level<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch of Flame<\/span> (Su): The touch attack\n\t\tcan be mostly replaced by a mace, but adding Flaming to your weapons for\n\t\tfree is nice for combat caster Oracles.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings of Fire<\/span> (Su): Flight is crucial at\n\t\thigh levels, and activating a new movement type as a swift action gives you\n\t\ta ton of really great tactical options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Free metamagic is\n\tfantastic, even if they are only +1 spell level metamagic feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"heavens\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#heavens\">Heavens<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though its skill and spell lists are decent, the Heavens Mystery has a poor list of Revelations, and is capped off by a Final Revelation which brings almost nothing useful to the Oracle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skills<\/span>: Knowledge (Arcana) and\n\tPerception are both really good, and one rank in Fly will pay off very\n\twell.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): Flight is essential at high\n\t\tlevels, but you can&#8217;t really justify more than one rank in Fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge (arcana)<\/span> (Int): One of the most\n\t\timportant Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The mots rolled skill in\n\t\tthe game, and it&#8217;s dependent on your primary ability score.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Very situational, and\n\t\tOracles don&#8217;t have great Wisdom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: An interest mix of options.\n\tAlmost all of the spells are crowd control effects.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">color spray<\/span>: The best save or suck spell\n\t\tat level 1, and it stays useful for several more levels. Not on the\n\t\tCleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">hypnotic pattern<\/span>: Excellent group crowd\n\t\tcontrol. Not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">daylight<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">rainbow pattern<\/span>: Like Hypnotic Pattern,\n\t\tbut it can affect considerably more creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">overland flight<\/span>: Fly all day long.\n\t\tFantastic. Not on the Oracle\/Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-green\">chain lightning<\/span>: Decent blast spell. Not\n\t\ton the Oracle\/Cleric spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">prismatic spray<\/span>: Some of the effects will\n\t\toutright kill targets, but it&#8217;s hard to predict how effective this will be.\n\t\tNot on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-none\">sunburst<\/span>: Very hard to interpret.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">meteor swarm<\/span>: Very flashy, but not as\n\t\tpowerful as it should be for a 9th-level spell.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revelations<\/span>: Most of the options are\n\tsituational. Some of the Revelations are crappy blast effects, and Dweller in\n\tthe Darkness is a once per day save or die effect which seems totally out of\n\tplace.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Awesome Display<\/span> (Su): This can make your\n\t\thypnotic spells considerably more effective, but you only get a few spells\n\t\tto which this applies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Coat of Many Stars<\/span> (Su): This will take a\n\t\twhile to catch up to a breastplate, but at high levels this can save you\n\t\tquite a bit of time and money. I&#8217;m not sure if you can enhance the armor\n\t\twith Magic Vestment, but if you can your AC should be excellent. Also note\n\t\tthat this armor has no ACP, which is nice if you want to take advantage of\n\t\tStealth as a class skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dweller in Darkness<\/span> (Sp): Once per day\n\t\tsave or die effect. Great, but Phantasmal Killer is both a Death, Fear, and\n\t\tMind-Affecting effect, which can mean a lot of situational resistances come\n\t\tinto play.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Guiding Star<\/span> (Su): Very situational. Most\n\t\tadventuring tends to happen during the day, and much of it takes place\n\t\tinside.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Interstellar Void<\/span> (Su): Decent\n\t\tsingle-target blast, and being able to stun someone is pretty good, but you\n\t\tonly get to use it once or twice per day. The fatigued\/exhausted conditions\n\t\tare generally worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lure of the Heavens<\/span> (Su): The low level\n\t\tbenefits are situational, and when you finally get to fly, you can cast\n\t\tOverland Flight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mantle of Moonlight<\/span> (Su): Very\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Moonlight Bridge<\/span> (Su): Very situational,\n\t\tand you can replace it with a number of more versatile spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spray of Shooting Stars<\/span> (Su): Decent\n\t\tblast effect, but the damage dice are d4&#8217;s.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Star Chart<\/span> (Ex): Commune is a great spell\n\t\tdespite the 500gp cost. Make sure to talk to your GM to make sure that they\n\t\tare okay giving you this much information on a daily basis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Final Revelation<\/span>: The Charisma bonus to saves\n\tis nice, but won&#8217;t stack with Divine Protection. Immunity to fear effects is\n\tnice, butsituational. Automatically confirming Critical Hits is cool, but\n\tyou&#8217;re not a combat monster. Reincarnating as a Star Child would be really\n\tcool if there was something which explained what a Star Child was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"life\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#life\">Life<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Life domain is a fantastic option for a heal-bot. Several Revelations add a ton of utility to your healing spells, the bonus spell list gives you all of the essential spells for healing non-hp problems, and the lousy skill list lets you dump an extra ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Nothing worth having, so you\n\tcan dump Intelligence.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): You are not a\n\t\tDruid.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Very situational, and\n\t\tOracles don&#8217;t have great Wisdom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Life includes many of the very\n\tbest and most essential healing spells. If you choose to get all Cure spells\n\tfor free, and you learn Raise Dead, you can heal as well as the best\n\tCleric.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">detect undead<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">lesser restoration<\/span>: Every party needs this\n\t\teventually.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">neutralize poison<\/span>: Very situational, and\n\t\tyou can generally replace it with the Heal skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">restoration<\/span>: Not quite as important as\n\t\tLesser Restoration, but still fantastic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">breath of life<\/span>: Everyone who can take this\n\t\tspell should. There are no excuses. It is simply too good to not have\n\t\tavailable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">heal<\/span>: Fantastic at high levels when things\n\t\tdo crazy amounts of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">greater restoration<\/span>: Very rarely\n\t\tnecessary, but when you need it you&#8217;ll be glad that you have it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mass heal<\/span>: Not as important as Heal, but\n\t\tit can turn the tide of a battle.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">true resurrection<\/span>: Hopefully you never\n\t\tneed to cast this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelations<\/span>: Several excellent options to\n\timprove your healing and support capabilities.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel<\/span> (Su): Channel Energy is\n\t\tsituational, but it can provide some nice burst healing for your allies.\n\t\tBecause Oracles depend on Charisma more than Clerics, you may have more uses\n\t\tper day than most other channellers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Healer<\/span> (Su): More appropriate for\n\t\tthe Life Mystery than for Battle, Combat Healer can really help your healing\n\t\toutput when you need it. However, the uses per day are very limited, so\n\t\tdon&#8217;t expect to rely on this Revelation much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Delay Affliction<\/span> (Su): Or you could just\n\t\tcast Neutralize Poison (which you get for free) or and Remove Disease.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Energy Body<\/span> (Su): Probably not something\n\t\tyou want to use in combat, but it&#8217;s quite a bit of free healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhanced Cures<\/span> (Su): This extends the\n\t\tusefulness of your lowest level cure spells. There are other healing options\n\t\twhich might be more powerful, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with a big pile of hit\n\t\tpoints from a first level spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Healing Hands<\/span> (Ex): These are all very\n\t\tsituational uses. The +4 bonus is nice, but with a little Wisdom, a healer&#8217;s\n\t\tkit, and just a few ranks in Heal you can easily hit the DC 25 for Treat\n\t\tSerious Wounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Life Link<\/span> (Su): This is fantastic. Use\n\t\tthis in addition to or in place of Shield Other, and you can soak up the\n\t\tentire party&#8217;s damage. Be sure that you have enough hit points to survive\n\t\tthis, of course.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lifesense<\/span> (Su): Permanent Blindsight.\n\t\tBlindsight is by far the best sense in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Safe Curing<\/span> (Su): Cute, but casting\n\t\tdefensively is fairly easy, and only becomes easier as you level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Boost<\/span> (Su): This makes your healing\n\t\tspells considerably more useful. Combined this with Enhanced Cures, and drop\n\t\ta Cure Light Wounds on your fighter before every fight. If he somehow drops,\n\t\thit him with Heal and he&#8217;ll pop back up with full health and a pile of\n\t\ttemporary hit points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: An excellent list of\n\timmunities, and you can&#8217;t drop below 1 in an ability score. I can&#8217;t think of\n\tanywhere else that I have seen that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lore\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#lore\">Lore<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wish that this was better, but there are too many bad options and not enough good ones. Instead of using this Mystery, consider taking the Enlightened Philosopher archetype, and pick a Mystery with a better Revelation list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skills<\/span>: Appraise is pointless, but\n\taccess to all knowledge skills is fantastic. Be sure to invest in a bit of\n\tIntelligence so that you have enough skill ranks to serve as the party&#8217;s\n\tLibrarian.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Some excellent divination\n\tand utility options, but most of the divinations are situational and make each\n\tother redundant so your lower-leve spells become obsolete and you can&#8217;t\n\treplace them.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">identify<\/span>: This spell is very situational,\n\t\tand barely exceeds the capabilities of Detect Magic for identifying magic\n\t\titems.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">tongues<\/span>: Very important for talking to\n\t\tthe weird races and creatures of the multiverse, even if you&#8217;re not the\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">locate object<\/span>: I wish I had this for my\n\t\tkeys. You need to be reasonably close to the target to find it, so you can&#8217;t\n\t\tjust cast Locate Object and locate the Lich&#8217;s phylactery, but this can be\n\t\tvery good for finding items lost among debris and such.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">legend lore<\/span>: Cast this spell, turn to\n\t\tthe GM, and say &#8220;so tell me about your backstory&#8221;. This spell is\n\t\tsituational, but when you&#8217;re missing huge portions of the plot, it&#8217;s\n\t\tamazingly powerful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">contact other plane<\/span>: This is dangerous\n\t\tfor an Oracle because you don&#8217;t have the Wizard&#8217;s Intelligence to protect\n\t\tyou from the Intelligence\/Charisma penalty. If it doesn&#8217;t go badly, this can\n\t\tbe a great way to gather information, but Oracles have access to plenty of\n\t\tother good Divination options.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-red\">mass owl&#8217;s wisdom<\/span>: The only thing that this\n\t\treally gets you is bonuses to your party&#8217;s Will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">vision<\/span>: How often do you think you are\n\t\tgoing to need to cast Legend Lore in combat? With the exception of the\n\t\tpossible days\/weeks casting times for Legend Lore, you really shouldn&#8217;t need\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">moment of prescience<\/span>: Fantastic and very\n\t\tversatile.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">time stop<\/span>: One of the most powerful spells\n\t\tin the game, and it&#8217;s not on the Cleric\/Oracle spell list.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Revelations<\/span>: Several great options to\n\timprove your abilities as a Librarian, but a whole bunch of garbage.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Archivist<\/span> (Su): This has so much\n\t\tpotential to be awesome, but it removes the spell from the spellbook, so you\n\t\tneed to have an arcane spellcaster handy to refill the spellbook. On top of\n\t\tthat, you can only do this once per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Automatic Writing<\/span> (Su): Divination spells\n\t\tare great, but they can be become very expensive. This gives you early\n\t\taccess to several of the best divination spells, and cuts down on their cost\n\t\tquite a bit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Brain Drain<\/span> (Su): Very situational, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s likely that your own Knowledge skills will be better. The damage is a\n\t\tnice addition, but you should have plenty of better options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focused Trance<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but\n\t\tthis is a nice way to compensate for the Oracle&#8217;s poor Intelligence when\n\t\tmaking Knowledge checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lore Keeper<\/span> (Ex): This can amount to a\n\t\thuge bonus to your Knowledge checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mental Acuity<\/span> (Ex): A permanent bonus to\n\t\tIntelligence. Because this is an inherent bonus it won&#8217;t stack with Wish,\n\t\tbut by the time you could get wish you will already have a +4 bonus. Take\n\t\tthis as your 7th-level Revelation without exception. The Intelligence bonus\n\t\tprovides skill ranks retroactively, which should let you fill out your\n\t\tKnowledge skills a bit more.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sidestep Secret<\/span> (Su): This allows you to\n\t\tdump Dexterity in favor of Charisma, which is a weird but fantastic thing to\n\t\tdo. Note that this doesn&#8217;t affect CMD or ranged attacks, so you&#8217;re still\n\t\tgoing to suck at those.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spontaneous Symbology<\/span>: The &#8220;Symbol&#8221;\n\t\tspells tend to be expensive to cast and difficult to use. The best way to\n\t\tuse them is with Permanency, which isn&#8217;t on the Cleric\/Oracle spell\n\t\tlist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Think On It<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but a\n\t\treroll is great and a +10 bonus on the reroll is even better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whirlwind Lesson<\/span> (Ex): This generally\n\t\thappens off screen, and doesn&#8217;t happen frequently enough to justify this\n\t\tRevelation even in campaigns where time is a concern.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Taking 20 on knowledge\n\tchecks is fantastic, but a limited version of Wish is even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"metal\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/oracle.html#metal\">Metal<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Metal has a few good options, but nothing really appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skills<\/span>: I&#8217;m very confused by this\n\tskill list. It adds all of the remaining skills which you need to be your\n\tparty&#8217;s Face, as well as Disable Device, which allows allows you to open locks\n\tand handle traps. If you want to use this Mystery, you might consider a level\n\tof Rogue for Trapfinding. I&#8217;m not certain what any of this has to do with\n\tMetal.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Appraise<\/span> (Int): Worthless in most\n\t\tcampaigns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Essential if you plan to be\n\t\tthe party&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disable Device<\/span> (Dex): If you don&#8217;t have a\n\t\tRogue, this is crucial. You can&#8217;t find and disarm magic trap without\n\t\tTrapfinding, but you can do everything else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Essential if you plan\n\t\tto be the party&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: The high level options are\n\tgood, but not great. As a whole, the spell list is okay, but not great.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">lead blades<\/span>: This really only matter if you\n\t\tplan to create weapons with the Impact property.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">heat metal<\/span>: Amusing, but terrible.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">keen edge<\/span>: This is only important if you\n\t\thave someone in the party build for critical hits, and they should have a\n\t\tKeen weapon or Improved Critical.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">versatile weapon<\/span>: Very versatile, and it\n\t\thelps overcome the DR of a wide variety of enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-red\">major creation (metal items only)<\/span>: While\n\t\tcertainly better than being limited to wood items, any material limitation\n\t\ton creation spells is hugely limiting.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-green\">wall of iron<\/span>: Though not as versatile as\n\t\tWall of Ice, Wall of Iron is still very useful as a utility spell.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">statue (metal statue instead of iron)<\/span>:\n\t\tBecause the subject can return to their statue form as a free action, this\n\t\tis a great way to defend yourself between turns. The duration is hours per\n\t\tlevel, so you can use this all day long.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">repel metal or stone<\/span>: Walls will\n\t\tgenerally be too thick to be affected, but you can repel enemies wearing\n\t\tmetal armor or carrying metal weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">iron body<\/span>: You get this a level late, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s considerably better for an Oracle than it is for a Wizard.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revelations<\/span>: Only a few of the options are\n\tworth taking.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Armor Mastery<\/span> (Ex): This is conceptually\n\t\tgreat, but you probably don&#8217;t have enough Dexterity to need more than the +3\n\t\tmaximum dexterity allowed by Breastplate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dance of the Blades<\/span> (Ex): You probably\n\t\twon&#8217;t be spending a lot of time running around in rounds where you attack\n\t\twith weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Iron Constitution<\/span> (Su): This won&#8217;t quite\n\t\tbring you up to a good Fortitude save, but it helps and it&#8217;s better than\n\t\tGreat Fortitude.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Skin<\/span> (Sp): Stoneskin is excellent,\n\t\tbut the material component is too expensive to justify using it on a regular\n\t\tbasis. This has no material component, so you can use it whenever you want\n\t\tit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Weapon<\/span> (Su): This will very rarely\n\t\toutpace what you could have as a modestly enhanced permanent weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Riddle of Steel<\/span> (Su): Craft checks are for\n\t\tNPCs.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rusting Grasp<\/span> (Sp): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skill at Arms<\/span> (Ex): Better than spending\n\t\ta feat on Armor Proficiency, but Martial weapons aren&#8217;t significantly better\n\t\tthe simple weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Steel Scarf<\/span> (Su): The attack is weak,\n\t\tbut the ability to perform combat maneuvers at 30 foot range is pretty\n\t\tgreat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vision in Iron<\/span> (Sp): Scry is a great way\n\t\tto gather information, but it&#8217;s a fairly high level spell, and it&#8217;s costly\n\t\tto prepare for. This allows you to take several quick peeks throughout the\n\t\tday.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Final Revelation<\/span>: If you are a combat\n\tcaster Oracle, Weapon Focus, Improved Weapon Focus, and Improved Critical are\n\tnice, but you won&#8217;t get much out of Improve Critical unless you are proficient\n\twith something like a scimitar. The bonus to maximum dexterity is huge, but\n\tDexterity isn&#8217;t a very important ability for Oracles, and if you have high\n\tenough Dexterity that it matters, by now you have probably invested in armor\n\tto support it. This ability comes too late to make a major difference in your\n\tcharacter choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"nature\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#nature\">Nature<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The only good part of the Nature Mystery is the Final Revelation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: More skills than most\n\tMysteries, but they are all situational and generally bad.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): Flight is essential at high\n\t\tlevels, but you can&#8217;t really justify more than one rank in Fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge (Nature)<\/span> (int): One of the more\n\t\timportant Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Oracles aren&#8217;t good at Mounted\n\t\tCombat.

You can either leave, or set up an ambush for when the creature\n\t\treturns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge of the Ages<\/span> (Su): The reroll is\n\t\tfantastic, but remember that this is a standard action to use, so you\n\t\tprobably won&#8217;t use it in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Momentary Glimpse<\/span> (Su): Using this ability\n\t\tis a standard action, which means it&#8217;s awful in combat. Because its awful in\n\t\tcombat, you can really only use it for skill checks, and a +2 bonus should\n\t\tbe usable more times per day than this.

Rolling three\n\t\ttimes at 11th level is ridiculously good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Time Flicker<\/span> (Su): Both Blink and Blur\n\t\tare fantastic defenses, especially at high levels against enemies that can\n\t\thit your AC without issue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Time Hop<\/span> (Su): Excellent for getting past\n\t\tenemies or through bars or windows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Time Sight<\/span> (Su): All of these abilities\n\t\tare excellent, and True Seeing has a relatively expensive material component\n\t\twhich makes it difficult to justify using frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Immortality is cool, and\n\tyou can cast a 9th-level spell as a spell-like ability once per day.

Bonuses to natural armor and Consitution will keep you\n\t\talive, and Darkvision is always nice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Water Sight<\/span> (Su): The ability to see\n\t\tthrough fog and mist is very situational, but free scrying is very\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wintry Touch<\/span> (Su): You will probably do\n\t\tbetter with a mace.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Free metamagic is\n\tfantastic, even if they are only +1 spell level metamagic feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wind\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/oracle.html#wind\">Wind<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wind Mystery has a fantastic list of Revelations, but has a poor spell list, and provides no flight options beyond Wings of Air, so you will need to find a way to fly when your minute per Oracle level runs out. Consider an archetype which replaces the poor spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Several bad options, so you can\n\tafford to dump intelligence.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Not a good option for an\n\t\tOracle.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Escape Artist<\/span> (Dex): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): Flight is essential at high\n\t\tlevels, but you can&#8217;t really justify more than one rank in Fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Required for a Scout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Really? You don&#8217;t get Fly?\n\tMost of the spell options are situational, and only a handful are truly\n\tgood.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">alter winds<\/span>: Situational, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\treally smart you can use it to your advantage for airborne combat.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">gust of wind<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">cloak of winds<\/span>: The penalty to ranged\n\t\tattacks is nice, but the other benefits are very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">river of wind<\/span>: Weak area control.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">control winds<\/span>: Allows you to prevent\n\t\tenemies from flying.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"12\"><span class=\"rating-green\">sirocco<\/span>: Nice area control effect. A\n\t\tlittle bit of damage, knock things prone, and make them fatigued.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">control weather<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"16\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">whirlwind<\/span>: Excellent crowd control.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">winds of vengeance<\/span>: A very flashy buff\n\t\twith a good fly speed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelations<\/span>: Plenty of excellent options to\n\tkeep you busy.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air Barrier<\/span> (Ex): Even if you have regular\n\t\tarmor, the 50% miss chance for ranged attacks is amazing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gaseous Form<\/span> (Su): Excellent infiltration\n\t\tor escape mechanism.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Invisibility<\/span> (Su): Invisibility is\n\t\tfantastic, though it&#8217;s not as important for you as it is for characters with\n\t\tSneak Attack. The ability to switch to Improved Invisibility is great,\n\t\ttoo.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Breath<\/span> (Su): Clerics\/Oracles\n\t\thave plenty of spells which do more damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spark Skin<\/span> (Ex): Energy resistance is\n\t\talways nice, and eventually you get immunity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderburst<\/span> (Ex): Decent range, a nice\n\t\texpanding AOE, 1d6 damage per level, and it deafens. The uses per day scale\n\t\tvery slowly, but the ability is pretty good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Touch of Electricity<\/span> (Su): You will\n\t\tprobably do better with a mace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vortex Spells<\/span> (Ex): Ludicrously\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wind Sight<\/span> (Ex): The ability to see\n\t\tthrough wind is really only helpful if you create it. The ability to use\n\t\tClairvoyance without casting a spell is the biggest draw here. Clairvoyance\n\t\tis fantastic for scouting safely, and because you can stretch the rounds out\n\t\thowever you like, you can do lots of short scouts throughout the day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings of Air<\/span> (Su): Flight is crucial at\n\t\thigh levels, and activating a new movement type as a swift action gives you\n\t\ta ton of really great tactical options. Unfortunately, this is the only way\n\t\tto Fly provided by the Wings Mystery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Final Revelation<\/span>: Free metamagic is\n\tfantastic, even if they are only +1 spell level metamagic feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wood\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/oracle.html#wood\">Wood<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood is a bad Mystery.

I&#8217;m not sure if you can enhance the armor with Magic\n\t\tVestment, but if you can your AC should be excellent. Also note that this\n\t\tarmor has no ACP, which is nice if you want to take advantage of Stealth as\n\t\ta class skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wood Bond<\/span> (Ex): A permanent competence\n\t\tbonus.
