Archers, including other crossbow builds, typically rely on making numerous attacks in order to deal damage. The Crossbowman flies in the face of this by depending on single shots made as readied actions.

Essentially, the Crossbowmen depends on readied\n\tactions. Applying half of your dexterity to damage is nice, but it&#8217;s hard to\n\tmake it match up to the huge damage gap provided by using a composite bow with\n\trapid shot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Crossbow Expert<\/span> (Ex): Weapon training with\n\tcrossbows. If you&#8217;re only going to get one attack off of a prepared action,\n\tyou had better hit with it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Deadshot<\/span> (Ex): Very few enemies\n\tdepend on dexterity for AC, so this will rarely help you hit. If you had sneak\n\tattack, this would be nice, but after 7 levels a dip into Rogue won&#8217;t be very\n\thelpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Sniper<\/span> (Ex): The bonus to sniping is\n\tnice, but Stealth isn&#8217;t a class skill for you, and the archetype doesn&#8217;t add\n\tit. The ability to return fire is situationally useful, but it also unloads\n\tyour crossbow so that you can&#8217;t take your prepared action shot unless you&#8217;re\n\tusing a repeating crossbow or have Rapid Reload.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Deadshot<\/span> (Ex): Finally. This is a\n\tsmall damage boost for Deadshot. Crossbow damage still isn&#8217;t great, but every\n\tlittle bit helps. By this point your Dexterity should be fairly impressive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Safe Shot<\/span> (Ex): Saves you the trouble of\n\ttaking Point Blank Master.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pinpoint Targeting<\/span>: Pinpoint Targeting is\n\ta tempting feat, especially against high AC enemies. Armor, Natural Armor, and\n\tShields are the sorts of bonuses which a typical tank relies on, and this will\n\tlet you get past their AC. However, it prevents you from using things like\n\tVital Strike, which might mean you sacrifice damage for reliability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Meteor Shot<\/span> (Ex):\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Bull Rush<\/span> or\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Trip<\/span> with a ranged attack. Neither help you\n\tmuch, but they might help your allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Penetrating Shot<\/span> (Ex): I certainly hope\n\tyou took Improved Critical. This makes critical hits with crossbows really\n\texciting, but it&#8217;s fairly difficult to set up, and it&#8217;s certainly not reliable\n\tuntil you get Weapon Mastery.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): With 19-20&#215;3 crit,\n\tyour critical hits won&#8217;t be spectacularly often, but they will be better than\n\twith a bow. Combined with Penetrating Shot, this might see a fair bit of\n\taction.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compatible-archetypes\">Compatible Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gladiator<\/span>: Have you ever watched someone\n\t\tvery patiently load and fire a crossbow? It&#8217;s not terribly exciting. Now\n\t\tbring that into performance combat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Crossbowman is remarkably SAD compared to most fighters.

You also rely on\n\t\t\t\tone big attack, so DR isn&#8217;t as problematic as it is for those who make\n\t\t\t\tlots of attacks.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Penetrating Strike<\/span>: See\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPenetrating Strike.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: 2 damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tenough to justify a feat for the Crossbowman. Weapon Specialization is\n\t\t\t\tdecent when you&#8217;re using numerous attacks because you can apply the\n\t\t\t\tbonus numerous times, but since we&#8217;re relying on a single big attack you\n\t\t\t\tcan find more damage elsewhere.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: A\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle more damage, but all the same problems.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Double Crossbow<\/span>: I almost made the mistake\n\t\tof building this archetype around the Double Crossbow, but because the\n\t\tdamage die is smaller than the Heavy Crossbow, the Heavy Crossbow does as\n\t\tmuch damage and requires less Feats to make it viable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hand Crossbow<\/span>: Only useful for weird builds\n\t\tinvolving an Alchemist class dip and two-weapon fighting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heavy Crossbow<\/span>: With Rapid Reload, you can\n\t\tuse your move action to reload, then ready your standard action for\n\t\tDeadshot.

Your off hand is\n\t\tgoing to be empty anyway, and you need all the AC you can get. When you\n\t\tstart having enough gold to enhance your armor, enhance your buckler first\n\t\tbecause it has no maximum dexterity bonus, and you won&#8217;t need to trade up.\n\t\tYou&#8217;ll take the -1 to attacks because you&#8217;re using both hands with your\n\t\tcrossbow, but -1 to hit in exchange for a minimum +1 AC is as good as you\n\t\tcould get from Combat Expertise, and AC bonus will scale quickly while the\n\t\tpenalty remains static.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Shirt<\/span>: Your best bet for almost\n\t\tyour entire career.

Bonus Dexterity is nice, too, but without iterative attacks to worry about you don&#8217;t need to panic about getting every last bit of attack bonus. Medium size is a must because it&#8217;s so important for Vital Strike, but that&#8217;s our only strict requirement.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Perception.

Combined with Vital Strike, that&#8217;s 8d8, and Devastating Strike adds 6 damage to that. That&#8217;s an average of 42 damage before you even look at your normal damage bonuses from enhancement, weapon specialization, etc.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hate Quick Sniper. I hate it so much.

Archers, including other crossbow builds, typically rely on making numerous attacks in order to deal damage. The Crossbowman flies in the face of this by depending on single shots made as readied actions. To really understand this archetype, make sure to read the Ready Action rules. I also strongly encourage you to read my Practical Guide to Vital Strike, as I plan to use it extensively.
