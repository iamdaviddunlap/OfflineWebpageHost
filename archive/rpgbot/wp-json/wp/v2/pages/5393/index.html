Fortunately Pathfinder&#8217;s skill system is\n\tfairly flexible, so Veiled Illusionists with lots of skill points can continue\n\tto easily invest in the same skills which they took with their base class.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells per Day<\/span>: Like most prestige classes\n\twhich advance your spellcasting, you only get additional spells per day (and\n\tspells known for spontaneous casters). Arcanists, Witches, and Wizards all\n\tneed to go spend money to learn additional spells.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Veil Pool<\/span> (Sp): The Veil Pool is the source\n\tof all of the Veiled Illusionist&#8217;s abilities, and the class is limited by the\n\tpoints in the pool. Any Veiled Illusionist should do everything they can to\n\tboost the size of their pool, or they will find themselves depending solely on\n\ttheir spells.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\">The first level benefit is the most important, and possibly also the most\n\t\tproblematic. Using this ability is basically the &#8220;on switch&#8221; for your class.\n\t\tThe duration is hours\/level, so at early class levels you&#8217;ll spend many of\n\t\tyour Veil Pool points just keeping this turned on, but this will taper off\n\t\tquickly as you gain class levels, just in time for you to make use of your\n\t\tother class abilities.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\">I&#8217;m not sure exactly what this entails with Disguise Self. Most of the time\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going to change from something human-like to something else\n\t\thuman-like. It might matter when you can change into a Cyclops and want to\n\t\tsound like a big stompy giant.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\">The touch component is weird, but the ability to mimic voices is\n\t\timportant.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\">Situational, but very cool.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Goddess&#8217;s Veils<\/span>: Goddess&#8217;s Veils are \n\tessentially &#8220;modes&#8221; for the Veiled Illusionist. You pick a veil, and you\n\tget \n\ta cool ability based on that veil until you switch to a different one.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Human<\/span>: This ability is complicated. \n\t\tWizards will have lots of problems using it, especially at low level \n\t\tbecause you need to turn your veil on, prepare the spell(s), then use\n\t\tthem \n\t\tbefore they fall out of your spellbook after hours\/level. Bards will find \n\t\tthis particularly helpful because their spell list is more limited than \n\t\tother base class options. The wording is somewhat unclear, but if I&#8217;m \n\t\treading this right you need to pick the spells provided as you gain \n\t\tlevels, and get access to them when you activate the veil. You don&#8217;t get \n\t\tto shuffle your spells known whenever you change veils.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Halfling<\/span>: Very situational, and very \n\t\tlimited. If you don&#8217;t want people to know what you&#8217;re casting, cast \n\t\tInvisibility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Spell Resistance is hugely \n\t\tproblematic at higher levels, and rerolling a d20 roughly equals a +5 \n\t\tbonus. Combined with Spell Penetration, you shouldn&#8217;t have any issues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome<\/span>: This means that you can maintain \n\t\ta spell like Silent Image and move it around while still casting other \n\t\tspells. However, remember that the cost is one point for each time you \n\t\tconcentrate, so you&#8217;re going to burn through your entire pool in a few \n\t\trounds. This is probably the veil in which you will spend the most time \n\t\tuntil you pick up True Veil at 10th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cyclops<\/span>: True Seeing is situational, \n\t\tand 1 round for 1 of your extremely limited veil points isn&#8217;t a great \n\t\treturn, but it saves you the trouble of preparing it every day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Naga<\/span>: This effect, like illusions in \n\t\tgeneral, depends on your creativity and the permissiveness of your DM.\n\t\tYou \n\t\tmight do something clever like use Major Image to create an illusory\n\t\ttiger \n\t\tto frighten your enemies. If they disbelieved the tiger, you might then \n\t\thave the secondary illusion portray a tiger skeleton or something which \n\t\tstill attempts the same effect. If your DM is on board, this can be very \n\t\tpowerful. If your DM doesn&#8217;t support illusionists well, you&#8217;ll have \n\t\ttrouble making this work for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Veil<\/span>: With an hours per level \n\tduration, you can run your veil for 5 hours on a single point by the time \n\tyou get this, so you should never need to use it in combat unless your are \n\tambushed. However, once you get True Veil you can use a Swift Action to\n\tturn \n\ton the special abilities granted by your Naga veil.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Veil<\/span>: Keep in mind that this uses a \n\tdifferent duration from the hours\/level duration for your normal Veil. The \n\thumanoid forms are an absolute waste when you&#8217;ve been able to cast Alter \n\tSelf for something like 10 levels, and Alter Self will have a much better \n\tduration without wasting Veil Pool points.<\/p>\n<p>Because this is a Polymorph effect, it may be helpful to read my \n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a>, especially the &#8220;How does polymorph work&#8221; section. Below is a specific \n\texplanation of the abilities you get from possible option so you don&#8217;t need \n\tto go look it up in addition to advice on which forms to use.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary\/cyclops.html#cyclops\">Cyclops<\/a>: +4 size bonus to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, +4 natural armor \n\t\tbonus, low-light vision, Ferocity. This is a melee form, and you&#8217;re \n\t\tprobably a Wizard or something equally averse to melee combat. Bards\n\t\tmight \n\t\tbe able to make use of the Cyclops form in melee, but even that is a \n\t\tstretch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Humanoid, Medium<\/span>: +2 size bonus to \n\t\tStrength. Cast Alter Self for 10 minutes\/level duration and save a Veil \n\t\tPool point.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Humanoid, Small<\/span>: +2 size bonus to \n\t\tDexterity. Cast Alter Self for 10 minutes\/level duration and save a Veil \n\t\tPool point.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary\/naga.html#naga-dark\">Naga, Dark<\/a>: +4 size bonus to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, +4 natural armor \n\t\tbonus, darkvision 60 ft., guarded thoughts, poison (sleep). Sleep poison \n\t\tis a save or suck, so assuming you have a decent DC you can go around \n\t\ttaking out single targets every round for 10 rounds. Guarded thoughts is \n\t\talso cool since you&#8217;re an illusionist and someone reading your mind would \n\t\truin your illusions.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary\/naga.html#naga-guardian\">Naga, Guardian<\/a>: +4 size bonus to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, +4 natural armor \n\t\tbonus, darkvision 60 ft., poison (constitution damage), spit. The big\n\t\tdraw \n\t\tis the ability to spit poison, which can be very lethal, but might drop \n\t\tenemies as fast as you could with a spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary3\/naga.html#naga,-lunar\">Naga, Lunar<\/a>: +4 size bonus to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, +4 natural armor \n\t\tbonus, darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, poison (constitution and \n\t\twisdom damage). Less Constitution damage, but also Wisdom damage. \n\t\tPersonally I prefer the bigger Consitution damage so you can just kill \n\t\tstuff rather than waiting for their Wisdom to hit 0, 1 point at a \n\t\ttime.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary3\/naga.html#naga,-royal\">Naga, Royal<\/a>: +4 size bonus to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, +4 natural armor \n\t\tbonus, darkvision 60 ft. No special abilities beyond what every other\n\t\tNaga \n\t\tgets.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary\/naga.html#naga-spirit\">Naga, Spirit<\/a>: +4 size bonus to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, +4 natural armor \n\t\tbonus, darkvision 60 ft., Swim 20 ft., poison (constitution damage). Swim \n\t\tspeed is the only unique thing the spirit naga gets you, and you can get \n\t\tthat from spells without too much difficulty.<\/li>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/bestiary3\/naga.html#naga,-water\">Naga, Water<\/a>: +4 size bonus to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, +4 natural armor \n\t\tbonus, darkvision 60 ft., swim 50 ft., poison (constitution damage). \n\t\tBetter swim speed than the Spirit Naga, but worse poison damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note regarding poison DC&#8217;s for polymorph effects<\/strong>: I&#8217;m not sure how to calculate the DC of the Naga&#8217;s poisons. Since the veils are a spell-like ability, it should use the universal monster rules for <a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/monsters\/universalMonsterRules.html#spell-like-abilities\">Spell-like Abilities<\/a>. The spell replicated by True Veil is unclear for the Cyclops\/Naga forms, but Veil Pool uses disguise self, which means that the poison DC is 10 +1 (Disguise Self&#8217;s spell level) +Charisma. Alternatively, you might rule that the DC is based on the DC of the originating effect (which makes sense based on the general Polymorph rules), so your DC is 15 + the number of points in your Veil Pool. Check with your GM for a specific ruling.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"base-classes\">Base Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Full casters are an obvious choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcanist<\/span>: The Arcanist&#8217;s unique spell \n\t\tpreparation and casting mechanic works very well for the Veiled \n\t\tIllusionist because illusionists depend on a very fixed set of spells to \n\t\tsolve all of their problems. The Arcanist&#8217;s dependence on Charisma for \n\t\texploits and spell DC&#8217;s is frustrating, but it works well for Bluff and \n\t\tDisguise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/span>: Bard is a tempting option as an \n\t\tinteresting build, but it simply can&#8217;t match the effectiveness of a full \n\t\tcaster. The Bard&#8217;s skills will fall off sharply once they&#8217;re stuck with \n\t\tthe Veiled Illusionist&#8217;s 2+ skill points per level, and Bardic Music will \n\t\tstop being a good option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: A Trickery domain cleric gets \n\t\tenough illusion spells to qualify for the class. Cleric doesn&#8217;t really \n\t\tplay to the concept of the Veiled Illusionist, but I could see some \n\t\tinteresting characters coming out of a Trickery Cleric.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: While not as powerful or \n\t\tversatile as an Arcanist of Wizard, the Sorcerer&#8217;s huge pile of spells\n\t\tper \n\t\tday allow you to cast illusions frequently without running out of spell \n\t\tslots. Unfortunately none of the bloodlines play into the Veiled \n\t\tIllusionist particularly well, but Shadow is a decent choice if you&#8217;re \n\t\talso your party&#8217;s Scout.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Witch<\/span>: The Witch&#8217;s big draw is Hexes, \n\t\tand since you&#8217;re not sticking to Witch your Hexes won&#8217;t be great. If you \n\t\topt for Witch, stick to utility Hexes over those with a save DC like \n\t\tsave-or-suck Hexes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wizard<\/span>: The Wizard is an obvious\n\t\tchoice, \n\t\tespecially with the Illusionist school, and the Wizard&#8217;s natural \n\t\tversatility allows the Veiled Illusionist to do a lot of utility casting \n\t\tbeyond their illusions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Veiled Illusionist&#8217;s abilities will be identical to those of your base class.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Any race which works well for your base class will work well for the Veiled Illusionist. Gnomes are a particularly good choice for their racial bonus to Illusion DC&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Traits which work for your base class will work for Veiled Illusionist. Resist the urge to pick up traits which get you Bluff and Disguise as class skills because you will get the class skill bonus from your first level of Veiled Illusionist, which essentially erases the benefit for the traits.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any Face, \n\t\tespecially one who gets by on illusion and disguises.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disguise<\/span> (Cha): The Veil abilities\n\t\twill \n\t\tgive you a hefty bonus to Disguise checks, but a few ranks can put you \n\t\twell out of reach of other creature&#8217;s Perception checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (arcana)<\/span> (Int): One of the \n\t\tmost important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (religion)<\/span> (Int): One of the \n\t\tmost important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Someone in your party \n\t\tneeds to have it, and it might as well be you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): You can cast \n\t\tInvisibility, but you still need to be quiet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Veiled Illusionist feats are essetnailly the same as <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#feats\">Wizard Feats<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Elf Wizard Veiled Illusionist<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>I honestly have no idea how many people are in this adventuring party.
