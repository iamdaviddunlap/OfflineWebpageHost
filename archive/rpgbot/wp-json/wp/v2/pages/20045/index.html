This creates some gaps in your Camp Casting capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Withers provides access to a roster of Hirelings at a pittance of 100gp each. These Hirelings are largely bereft of personality, but they are full characters and keep pace with your own level like the Companions do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>There is one companion for each class. I recommend the bard, cleric, druid, and wizard. Optionally, you can bring in the paladin, ranger, warlock, and sorcerer for a larger pool of healing and spell slots if you want them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be hard to get all intended targets into the area of effect of AOE spells like Aid and Prayer of Healing, but you can remove your intended party members from the party, then use an instrument to play music to cause everyone in camp to congregate. While the musician plays, cast Aid to catch everyone in the area of effect. Alternatively, rotate in the buff caster and leave camp, causing everyone to gather wherever your party disappeared from. Then, once buffs are cast, go back to camp and dismiss them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have exactly three hirelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"healing\">Healing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Between short rests and spell slots, your party has a finite pool of hit point recovery per day. Rotating in a character who can heal you with spells or Lay on Hands allows you to quickly heal your party before jumping back into the adventure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t limited to hit points, either. Spells like Lesser Restoration and Revivify can be cast the same way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buffs\">Buffs<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Buffs which last until your next long rest can be used via camp casting, and their effects persist when rearranging your party. The exception here is buffs which require Concentration. Characters lose Concentration when you remove them from the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One minor warning: If you talk to Withers to change your class, you\u2019ll lose any ongoing spell effects on that character. Make build changes <em>before<\/em> camp casting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buff-spells-by-class\">Buff Spells by Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Paladins and Rangers are omitted from the list below because the buffs they can cast use the cleric and druid spell lists, respectively. Arcane Tricksters and Eldritch Knights are also omitted. Use the Wizard spell list for such characters. Warlocks are omitted because they don\u2019t have any applicable buff spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spells which can only target the caster are omitted.

If you have a bard of at least 3rd level, you can get an extra short rest between long rests, even if that means visiting camp to briefly rotate them into the party. Of course, long rests trigger fun events and food is both abundant and inexpensive (especially once you can spam Goodberry for free rations), so there&#8217;s not much incentive to stretch the time between rests.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Magic Initiate (Druid): Goodberry is a great source of portable healing, but Magic Initiate doesn&#8217;t work very well. You can only cast the leveled spell once per long rest, and even though your spellcasting screen says that it&#8217;s always prepared, you can&#8217;t re-cast if <em>even if you&#8217;re a druid<\/em>. This is likely a bug, but it&#8217;s such a minor option that it&#8217;s not worth waiting for a fix.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transmutation School Wizard: Transmuter&#8217;s Stone can be moved between characters and doesn&#8217;t disappear until your next long rest, allowing a transmuter to create the stone then return to camp.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"camp-caster-builds\">Camp Caster Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>You can have three hirelings, and let&#8217;s be honest: You&#8217;re not bringing them adventuring unless you somehow didn&#8217;t collect enough Companions to fill your party. Building your three hirelings as camp casters can maximize their contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cleric: A single-class cleric is essential. The Cleric gets good camp casting spells through the entire level range, so one of your hirelings is locked in here.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transmutation School Wizard 6 \/ Rogue 1 \/ Druid 1 \/ more wizard: 6 levels to get Transmuter&#8217;s Stone is excellent, and wizards can provide Longstrider and Mage Armor to buff your party&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/spells\/animate-dead\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"21685\">animated dead<\/a> and day-long summon spells. Be sure to take proficiency in Medicine, max Wisdom (weird for a wizard, I know), then take a level of Rogue to get Expertise in Medicine. This makes your wizard the perfect crafter thanks to Experimental Alchemy. You might do this as early as level 3, but the longer you horde ingredients, the more items you can churn out. Be sure to cast Guidance and Enhance Ability (Wisdom) to further improve your odds of success on the DC 15 check.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Druid 1 \/ Transmutation School Wizard 6: 1 level to get Goodberry, then switch to wizard to work toward another Trasmuter&#8217;s stone. You might go to Druid 3 to get Protection from Poison and Darkvision, especially in the early game when your other camp casters are still short on spell slots.
