A Wizard with a comprehensive spellbook can do essentially anything in the game, often as well as or better than a non-magical character who is built to do that thing. A Wizard with Invisibility is as stealthy as a Rogue. A Wizard with a summoned pet can replace a fighter (at least temporarily). A clever Wizard could even find a way to heal their allies and replace a Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards, in addition to their fantastic spell list, are also the best ritual spellcaster in the game. Even before you consider Heroic Boons, the Wizard is the only spellcaster that can learn more rituals than those granted by their class. The ability to gather every ritual from the arcane ritual list makes wizards fantastically useful. Ritual enthusiasts can use Rite of the Ritualist to expand their options to include every ritual list, making the Wizard the uncontested master of ritual spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Wizards can do so much so well, their roles are numerous and varied. However, in a typical party the Wizard&#8217;s primary functions are as a Blaster, Controller, Librarian, Support caster, Striker, and Utility Caster. Depending on your spells and potentially your skills, you can also serve as a Defender, Face, Healer (though it&#8217;s difficult until level 10), and Scout. You may think, &#8220;but wait, isn&#8217;t that every role?&#8221;. Yes. Yes, it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, with that incredible breadth of capability comes both complexity and risk. Most of this complexity is buried in the Wizard&#8217;s spellcasting. Managing a spellbook is a complex, and unlike clerics and druids who can select from a vast spell list after every long rest, you need to hoard newly-learned spells to expand your capabilities, sometimes at great expense, so learning new spells may be a gamble, costing precious gold for a spell which you may never use. If you are prone to analysis paralysis or don&#8217;t enjoy carefully tracking resources, the Wizard is a waking nightmare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards are among the least-durable characters in the game, having no armor proficiencies, poor saving throws, and the lowest hit dice available. Staying alive as a wizard can be very difficult, and in most cases requires a party of sturdy allies willing to protect you from harm.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#changes-from-5e\">Changes from 5e<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Wizard Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Wizard Lineages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritages\">Wizard Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Wizard Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Wizard Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#talents\">Wizard Talents<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-talents\">Martial and Technical Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Wizard Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Wizard Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Wizard Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Wizard Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-rare\">Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-very-rare\">Very Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-legendary\">Legendary Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Wizard Example Build &#8211; Unthar Shaleheart, Valiant Six Battle Mage Wizard<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineage\">Lineage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritage\">Heritage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improvements-and-talents\">Improvements and Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Advantage on saves against spells and resistance to damage from spells and spell attacks (not all of which come from spells. Looking at you, Eldritch Blast.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spell Mastery: Cast your Rote spells at their lowest Circle once per day. Your rote spells now include 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Circle, so you get to cast 4 spells per day without spending a slot.

It\u2019s unpredictable, but recovering a 9th-level spell slot is going to feel awesome if you\u2019re lucky enough for it to happen.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: d6 hit points is the lowest in\n\tthe game.

More prepared spells means that your spell options will be more diverse, which is fantastic, but you add more spells very slowly. If you&#8217;re not sure what to pick, an easy list is Shield, Misty Step, Fireball, and Polymorph.

Adding Divine spells is always an easy choice, but don&#8217;t overlook Primordial.

This build starts from the options selected for the official pregen character, and takes the build from 1 to 20. It&#8217;s also limited to the options in the free Black Flag Reference Document, making it easily accessible for players who haven&#8217;t yet bought a full copy of the Tales of the Valiant rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official pregen build for Unthar gives us his Lineage, Heritage, Background, starting Talents, and some of his class choices. However, it doesn&#8217;t specify how his Improvements were spent, so we&#8217;re left to reverse-engineer his Ability Scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to build Unthar as a straightforward Blaster. With 10 CON, Concentration is nearly impossible, and Battle Mage encourages you to use spell slots aggressively.

A wizard with better DEX and maybe a shield could be more durable than a fighter, especially with Shield available.<br><br>Keeping Spell Ward running places a constant strain on your resources since you&#8217;re required to cast one non-cantrip spell per turn. At high levels this is less of an issue, but for now you need to be cautious about how you spend spell slots.
