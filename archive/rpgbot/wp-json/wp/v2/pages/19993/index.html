Tempest&#8217;s abilities and spells provide several fun crowd control, area control, and area damage options, allowing the Tempest Cleric to serve as an effective threat both at short and long range. Tempest domain provides no utility or support options, so expect to lean on your spell list to solve problems that can&#8217;t be solved by hitting them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Tempest domain, as the name might imply, depends heavily on Lightning and Thunder damage. The subclass&#8217;s most noteworthy feature, Destructive Wrath, allows you to maximize the damage of spells which deal Lightning or Thunder damage. However, the Cleric&#8217;s absolute void of applicable spells presents a huge limitation for the subclass. You do get a handful of spells from the subclass, but it&#8217;s really not enough. Shatter and Destructive Wave are your best options, and they depend on chronically frustrating Constitution saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>To address this gap, you&#8217;ll need to look beyond the Cleric. A few races can get you Shocking Grasp as a cantrip, and you may be able to get better spells from another class, though you&#8217;ll struggle to find Wisdom-based spellcasting which can deal Lightning or Thunder damage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>A few magic items may also help: Javelin of Lightning, Staff of Thunder and Lightning, and Wand of Lightning Bolts. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a short list, and none of the options are great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is to say that Tempest Domain is bad. It&#8217;s not. it&#8217;s just a whole lot of sound and fury and class features that seem like they would be amazing when you use them as intended and the result is just kinda average.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Tempest Domain Cleric Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Tempest Domain Cleric Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Tempest Domain Cleric Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Tempest Domain Cleric Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Tempest Domain Cleric Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Tempest Domain Cleric Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Tempest Domain Cleric Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Tempest Cleric Build &#8211; Shattering Expectations<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Clerics don&#8217;t have many built-in options for\n\t\tlightning or thunder damage, so these are great additions in conjunction\n\t\twith Tempest Domain&#8217;s other features.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: Fog Cloud is a great\n\t\t\t\tescape or crowd control mechanism. Thunderwave is tempting for when you\n\t\t\t\tget in over your head in melee and need to buy yourself some space or\n\t\t\t\tneed to break a grapple, but remember that it&#8217;s on a Constitution save,\n\t\t\t\tand those tend to be high.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Gust of Wind is very\n\t\t\t\tsituational, but Shatter is basically diet fireball, and it works with\n\t\t\t\tChannel Divinity: Destructive Wrath so you can maximize the damage.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">5th Level<\/span>: Sleet Storm is a mediocre\n\t\t\t\tcrowd control spell, and Call Lightning is frustrating and can be very\n\t\t\t\tdifficult to use to great effect. Note that Channel Divinity:\n\t\t\t\tDestructive Wrath only applies to a single damage roll, not to the whole\n\t\t\t\tspell, so using it with Call Lightning is largely pointless.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">7th Level<\/span>: Ice Storm is a bad spell,\n\t\t\t\tand Control Water is only useful when you have a large body of water\n\t\t\t\thandy, which isn&#8217;t often in most campaigns.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Destructive Wave does\n\t\t\t\texcellent damage of types which are very rarely resisted, but since the\n\t\t\t\tdamage type is split, Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath only maximizes\n\t\t\t\thalf of the damage dice. For the same 5th-level spell slot, Shatter does\n\t\t\t\t6d8 damage (maximizes to 48), while Destructive Wave will deal 47.5 on\n\t\t\t\taverage (30 maximized, plus 17.5 average) in a much larger AOE while\n\t\t\t\talso excluding your allies, so Destructive Wave does still win over\n\t\t\t\tShatter in the vast majority of situations. Unfortunately, Destructive\n\t\t\t\tWave doesn&#8217;t benefit from upcasting because it&#8217;s intended to be a\n\t\t\t\tPaladin spell.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Insect Plague is a fantastic area control option, but has some\n\t\t\t\t\toverlap with Spirit Guardians. Insect Plague uses larger damage dice,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut due to spell slot scaling deals roughly the same damage as Spirit\n\t\t\t\t\tGuardians. Both spells have 10-minute durations and require\n\t\t\t\t\tConcentration. Insect Plague is cast at range and has a larger AOE, so\n\t\t\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t need to stand in the middle of the AOE, but you also can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tmove it. The two spells are roughly equivalent, but excel in different\n\t\t\t\t\tsituations.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor is great\n\t\ton a Cleric. Martial Weapons add a few more combat options, but clerics are\n\t\tbad at using weapons and martial weapons don&#8217;t change that. With heavy armor\n\t\tand Wrath of the Storm, you might pick up a 2-handed weapon, though cantrips\n\t\twill still be more effective as you gain levels and add extra damage\n\t\tdice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wrath of the Storm<\/span>: At low level, this\n\t\twill outright kill enemies. At high levels it&#8217;s a mild deterrent.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath<\/span>:\n\t\tGreat for when you absolutely, positively need to Shatter every enemy in the\n\t\troom. Don&#8217;t be tempted to use this with Wrath of the Storm; that&#8217;s a tragic\n\t\twaste of a great ability. Unfortunately, the Cleric&#8217;s spell list includes\n\t\tvery few spells which qualify for this, so your best options are from your\n\t\tdomain spell list unless you multiclass.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderbolt Strike<\/span>: This combines well\n\t\twith Wrath of the Storm when you need to get out of melee for whatever\n\t\treason, and since Wrath of the Storm still deals half damage on a successful\n\t\tsave you&#8217;re guaranteed to get the push effect. Unfortunately, clerics don&#8217;t\n\t\thave access to any cantrips which deal Lightning damage. This would be great\n\t\tif it worked with Lightning <em>or<\/em> Thunder damage, but it doesn&#8217;t.\n<p>Like many similar effects, this only specifies that you push the target &#8220;away&#8221;, rather than\n&#8220;directly away&#8221;. This means that you&#8217;re free to push them upward and away, potentially launching\nenemies 10 feet into the air and forcing them to fall 10 feet from where they were previously.<\/p>\n<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"8\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Strike<\/span>: Thunder is among the best\n\t\tdamage types in the game, but clerics are still bad at using weapons. See also:\n\t\t<a href=\"#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\">Divine Strike vs. Cantrips<\/a>,\n\t\tabove.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Stormborn<\/span>: Near-permanent flight! Flight\n\t\tis absolutely crucial at high levels, and getting it this easily can free up\n\t\tresources for more exciting things. You won&#8217;t be able to use this inside\n\t\tdungeons and other common adventuring locales, but this is still very\n\t\thelpful.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Tempest Domain Cleric Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from other <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">heavily-armored clerics<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Tempest Domain Cleric Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from your <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11183\">typical cleric<\/a>, but the ability to get Shocking Grasp as a Wisdom-based spell is a huge advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air Genasi<\/span\n\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MotM<\/a><\/sup>:\nOne of few ways to get Shocking Grasp as a Wisdom-based spell other than being a different variety of cleric.

Absorb Elements can give you a way to deal lightning damage with attacks, but it requires that you take Lightning damage first, which isn&#8217;t often enough to make Thunderbolt Strike consistently useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monk<\/span>: Way of the Ascendant Dragon&#8217;s Draconic Strike feature lets you deal lightning damage with your unarmed strikes, making Thunderbolt Strike easily available 2 or 3 times per turn. But that requires three levels, and three levels to be slightly better at weapon attacks isn&#8217;t as powerful as 3 levels of spellcasting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Paladin<\/span>: Two levels to get access to Thunderous Smite, which works with Destructive Wrath, and you&#8217;ll only give up one level of spell slot advancement to get it. But Shatter and Destructive Wave will both be better sources of damage without consuming Concentration, so it&#8217;s not a good option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Storm Sorcery is a natural combination with Tempest Domain, but the class dip needs to go the opposite direction. A cleric can&#8217;t make good use of Charisma-based spellcasting, but a sorcerer can make use of Destructive Wrath. But two levels for Font of Magic and Transmuted Spell will do a lot <em>after you can cast Fire Storm<\/em> since that&#8217;s the only cleric spell worth transmuting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wizard<\/span>: Order of Scribes only works for wizard spells.

This isn&#8217;t that. Tempest Domain isn&#8217;t Thor. It&#8217;s not even Storm from the X-Men. It tried to dress up as Thor, but it&#8217;s mostly a cleric in Thor cosplay that makes loud noises and causes property damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build leans hard into Tempest Domain&#8217;s features and attempts to use them to their absolute maximum effect. This allows us to do two things that other clerics can&#8217;t match: Launch people with Shocking Grasp to control single targets and spam Shatter and Destructive Wave for area damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, this build works like other clerics. Spirit Guardians is still your go-to in many situations. But the ability to get big bursts of damage from Destructive Wrath and a Thunder damage spell allows us to handle groups of enemies much fast than we could by grinding them down with Spirit Guardians. Constitution saves will absolutely be a problem, but if you resign yourself to enemies always passing their saves, you&#8217;ll still deal decent damage with you go-to area damage spells. Sometimes creatures will fail their saves, and you get fun bonus damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build assumes no optional class features, but if your DM is feeling generous, I recommend taking Blessed Strikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We want to avoid the speed penalty from heavy armor so that we can rush into melee, which unfortunately means that we need more Strength than usual.

Grab a weapon, put your holy symbol on your shield, and march into melee. If you get hit, use Wrath of the Storm because it&#8217;s going to do more damage than anything you can do except for your leveled spells.<br><br>For your prepared spells, stick to cleric staples. 90% of what you do is standard cleric stuff.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (1\/rest)<br>&#8211; Destructive Wrath<br>&#8211; Turn Undead<\/td><td>Destructive Wrath comes online, but we have nothing to use it with except Thunderwave. 12 damage is fine, but the tiny AOE means that you&#8217;re unlikely to hit more than 2 enemies, and the Constitution save will be a problem for your whole career.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Gust of Wind<br>&#8211; Shatter<\/td><td>2nd-level spells bring Shatter, which becomes our go-to AOE blast option for much of our career. Maximizing the damage roughly doubles the average damage for a spell, and 2nd-level Shatter&#8217;s now 24 damage is almost as much as 3rd-level Fireball&#8217;s 28 damage. When we can cast 3rd-level spells, Shatter will deal 32 damage, and adding 8 damage per spell level rather than 2d6 (average 7) will keep us ahead of Fireball damage.<br><br>Of course, Shatter&#8217;s range and AOE are both worse, and Constitution saves are consistently less reliable than Dexterity saves, but at least our base damage is slightly better than Fireball, and Shatter explicitly damages objects, so we can also cause property damage to non-flammable things.<br><br>So let&#8217;s just assume the worst for Shatter&#8217;s per-target damage and assume that targets will pass their saves. Honestly, there&#8217;s not much we can do about it. Let&#8217;s just say Shatter will deal 14 damage to 2 or 3 targets. If we hit two targets, that puts us into the High DPR range. We&#8217;re not an Evoker Wizard, but we&#8217;re doing okay.<br><br>Casting Shatter+Destructive Wrath at our highest or second-highest spell level, hitting two targets, and having both targets pass their saving throw deals enough damage to put us into High DPR. We can&#8217;t sustain that because our resources are limited, but the damage output is still good.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>ASI: Con 16 -&gt; 17, Wis 17 -&gt; 18<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Stay right on the Fundamental Math.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Destroy Undead (CR 1\/2)<br>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Call Lightning<br>&#8211; Sleet Storm<\/td><td>At this level, Spirit Guardians comes online, and it starts to compete for space with Shatter. Spirit Guardians will deal 3d8 damage (avg. 13.5) compared to 3rd-level Shatter+Destructive Wrath dealing 18 (assuming that targets pass their saves). So for a short combat or for distance enemies, Shatter is a good deal. If you&#8217;re already in close quarters, Spirit Guardians will deal more damage by the end of your second turn and will also slow enemies in the radius.<br><br>Still, Spirit Guardians isn&#8217;t your defining tactic, which feels like a win on a class where that is famously the defining tactic. Ideally you walk into a fight with Spirit Guardians running and spend your Actions to cast Shatter or Word of Radiance on crowds.<br><br>Cantrips improve at this level, so if you haven&#8217;t started using cantrips instead of your weapon, now is the time. Keep a hammer or whatever for opportunity attacks for a few more levels.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (2\/rest)<br>Thunderbolt Strike<\/td><td>At this level you have enough spell slots that Shatter+Destructive Wrath twice per rest is doable, and the damage is good enough to justify the expense, provided that you&#8217;re hitting two or more targets.<br><br>Thunderbolt Strike is the whole reason we chose Air Genasi as our race. Hit enemies with Shocking Grasp, and you can launch them 10 feet upward at a diagonal. 2d8+1d6 damage and knock them prone. Pretty good for something you can do without limit.<br><br>Thunderbolt Strike also applies when you use Wrath of the Storm, so you can also launch enemies as a Reaction if they hit you.<br><br>By this level we could use Spirit Shroud with Transmuted Spell (we could have taken the feat at level 4 or as a Variant Human) to make Spirit Shroud deal lightning damage, but that&#8217;s a lot of work and resources to replicate what we can do with a cantrip, and you would still need to solve the issue of attacking with a weapon by either improving Strength or getting Shillelagh. it&#8217;s simply not worth the effort.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Control Water<br>&#8211; Ice Storm<\/td><td>Oh look, disappointing spells.

When enemies try to move away, you can shock them, launch them into the air, and drop them prone. Standing to move eats half of their movement, which will severely limit how much further they can co. Just be sure not to launch them to wherever they want to go anyway.<br><br>We will absolutely never use Divine Strikes. Never.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Destructive Wave<br>&#8211; Insect Plague<\/td><td>Finally, something that can compete with Shatter on roughly its own terms. Destructive Wrath will only maximize half of Destructive Wave&#8217;s damage, but 30+5d6 (avg. 47.5 total) will roughly match 5th-level Shatter&#8217;s 48 damage, and Destructive Wave&#8217;s AOE is three times as large and can also knock enemies prone. You can expect to affect every enemy in most encounters. But, like Shatter, you should probably expect enemies to pass the Con save.<br><br>Shatter&#8217;s remaining advantages over Destructive Wave are its 60-foot range, which allows you to use it without marching into the middle of a crowd, and the fact that it benefits from upcasting.<br><br>Flame Strike also comes online at this level, but its damage is the same as Destructive Wave before considering Destructive Wrath, so there&#8217;s little reason to look at it.
