Their divine spellcasting is powerful, impactful, and reliable, and they get enough armor to stand on the front lines alongside barbarians and fighters. They&#8217;re an asset in any party, and the stereotype of clerics being healbots wildly undersells how powerful they are and how much fun they are. I can&#8217;t count how many times I&#8217;ve functionally ended an encounter by pressing the right buttons with Shadowheart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With full spellcasting and many of the best buffs and support options in the game, the Cleric is a great Healer and Support caster, but that is not the extent of their abilities. They also get some excellent damage spells like Guiding Bolt and Spirit Guardians, plus some save-or-suck spells like Hold Person and Command, allowing them to serve as Strikers. The biggest gap in the cleric&#8217;s offensive spellcasting is ranged area damage, but even then some subclasses like Light Domain get access to better blasting options like Fireball, and Spirit Guardians can melt through crowds at short range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With medium armor, shields, d8 hit points, and middling attacks, the Cleric doesn&#8217;t work as a Defender like a martial character could, but you can make up that deficiency with spells and subclass features. Several subclasses (divine domains) provide proficiency in heavy armor and better weapons, but that boost in durability doesn&#8217;t actually make you good at using weapons. Clerics don&#8217;t get weapon damage boosts at low levels like martial characters do, and the Divine Strikes feature offered by some subclasses at level 8 <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\">doesn&#8217;t fix things<\/a>. If you want a melee-focused cleric, expect to multiclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite how powerful and fun they are, it is absolutely not necessary to have a cleric in your party. In-combat healing is rarely a good idea unless an ally is actively on the ground dying, and easy access to short and long rests any time outside of combat means that you don&#8217;t need to bring a healbot like you do in many other CRPGs. If one person in the party can cast Healing Word (it&#8217;s available to bards, clerics, and druids), it is absolutely fine to not have a cleric in the party. Bring a cleric because they&#8217;re awesome, not because you feel like you must.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Cleric Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Cleric Subclasses<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#knowledge-domain\">Knowledge Domain<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#nature-domain\">Nature Domain<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rating-green\">Life Domain<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rating-blue\">Light Domain<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tempest-domain\">Tempest Domain<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#trickery-domain\">Trickery Domain<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rating-orange\">War Domain<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Cleric Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Cleric Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dwarf\">Dwarf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dragonborn\">Dragonborn<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#drow\">Drow<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#elf\">Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gnome\">Gnome<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#githyanki\">Githyanki<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfelf\">Half-Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halforc\">Half-Orc<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfling\">Halfling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#human\">Human<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tiefling\">Tiefling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Cleric Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Cleric Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Cleric Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Cleric Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Cleric Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Cleric Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Cleric Example Build &#8211; Shadowheart, Half-Elf Trickery Cleric<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skill-proficiencies\">Skill Proficiencies<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses a color coding scheme to rate individual character options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Cast\n\t\tSpirit Guardians and dive into combat. This is nowhere near good enough to\n\t\tonly work once.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Cleric Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You will be asked to select a deity. While this has social implications, such as Shadowheart disliking Sel\u00fbne worshippers. Note that choice of deity is restricted by the race and subrace of the cleric. Only Githyanki have the option to choose Vlaakith as a deity, only Duergar Dwarves have the option to choose Laduguer as a deity, Lolth-Sworn Drow may only choose Lolth as a deity, and Seldarine Drow cannot choose Lolth as a deity.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"knowledge-domain\">Knowledge Domain<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Versatile, effective, and capable of changing their skill proficiencies on the fly, knowledge domain borrows some of the Wizard&#8217;s skills and some of their spells to create a great package.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge Domain is a great choice for a cleric main character, allowing you to conveniently switch into Charisma-based skills as needed, but keep your proficiencies elsewhere while out looking for trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge Domain doesn&#8217;t get a 6th-level feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Skill Proficiencies<\/span>: Proficiency and Expertise in two Intelligence-based skills, which greatly makes up for clerics typically dumping Intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spells<\/span>: Many excellent options, especially save-or-suck spells from the Wizard&#8217;s spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Command<\/span>: Excellent at any level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sleep<\/span>: Excellent at low levels, but falls off quickly because the spell scaling is poor.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Calm Emotions<\/span>: Only situationally useful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Person<\/span>: Humanoid enemies are abundant in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, making Hold Person a spectacularly powerful save-or-suck spell.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slow<\/span>: A fantastic debuff. This can often win fights by itself if you get it to land.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Speak with Dead<\/span>: Excellent, but you only need to cast it once per day, so having it permanently prepared feels wasteful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Confusion<\/span>: Too unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Otiluke&#8217;s Resilient Sphere<\/span>: Clerics don&#8217;t get Fireball, but this is a decent substitute.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dominate Person<\/span>: In a game where the majority of enemies are humanoids, Dominate person is very powerful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinesis<\/span>: Fun, but not super effective.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages<\/span>: As many as 5 additional skill proficiencies depending on the ability score that you choose. You&#8217;re going to be locked into at least a few Intelligence-based skills by Knowledge Domain&#8217;s extra proficiencies, so plan to use this elsewhere, such as Wisdom-based skills. If you use your background and your class skills to fill out the other Intelligence-based skills, you can have every Intelligence-based skill and every Wisdom-based skill. Even better, you can change the ability score every time you use Knowledge of the Ages, so you can change your skills to meet the needs of the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge of the Ages doesn&#8217;t stack with the Githyanki&#8217;s Astral Knowledge, but you can use the two features on different ability scores, further improving your skill options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: A significant increase to your cantrip damage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"nature-domain\">Nature Domain<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nature Domain doesn&#8217;t get a 6th-level feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Acolyte of Nature<\/span>: One skill, one druid cantrip, and heavy armor. Altogether it&#8217;s pretty good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Handling<\/span>: Tempting if your cleric is your main character because Animal Handling is an easier fit than using Speak with Animals to make Charisma-based checks, but you get much less information and you&#8217;re also locked into having Speak with Animals prepared.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Nature<\/span>: Your best bet, but still not a great skill since clerics frequently dump Intelligence.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Survival<\/span>: Borderline useless.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison Spray<\/span>: <\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Produce Flame<\/span>: Already a cleric cantrip.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shillelagh<\/span>: Essential to making weapons viable for the Cleric, but it&#8217;s not enough on its own. If you&#8217;re not going to great lengths to build a weapon-using cleric, skip this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thorn Whip<\/span>: One of vanishingly few pull effects in BG3.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Domain Spells<\/span>: Almost all of the spells are from the Druid&#8217;s spell list. The best options are area control options which the Cleric can&#8217;t typically match.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Friendship<\/span>: Made wholly obsolete by Nature Domain&#8217;s Channel Divinity.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Speak with Animals<\/span>: An excellent spell, but with the Cleric&#8217;s poor Charisma you&#8217;ll often be stuck talking to unhelpful squirrels and such.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Barkskin<\/span>: You get heavy armor, and this requires Concentration. This is a terrible spell.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spike Growth<\/span>: Decent area control, but enemies will typically jump out of or over the area to avoid the damage, so it&#8217;s often difficult to make this meaningful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Plant Growth<\/span>: The speed reduction is massive, but Spike Growth is usually sufficient.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleet Storm<\/span>: Potentially knock enemies in the area prone, robbing them of their Action at least for the next turn.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Dominate Beast<\/span>: Beasts almost never appear as enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Grasping Vine<\/span>: Enemies will kill the vine immediately.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Insect Plague<\/span>: Decent area control, and you can shove or throw enemies back into the area to re-trigger the damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Stone<\/span>: Wall off part of an encounter so that your party can focus on a smaller number of foes at a time. The wall is drawn between two points within range, so to get the maximum range you want to draw the line as close to you as possible, though you might not always need to do that.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants<\/span>: Beasts almost never appear as enemies in BG3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Strike<\/span>: Excellent by Divine Strike standards, especially since you can change the damage type to capitalize on weaknesses or status conditions like Wet. it&#8217;s still not great, unfortunately.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"rating-green\">Life Domain<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you read everything else on this page, including my repeated refrain &#8220;the Cleric is not a healbot,&#8221; but you <em>really<\/em> want to play a healbot, Life Domain is for you. Life Domain is the &#8220;default&#8221; cleric subclass in some ways. It&#8217;s simple to play and easy to understand, making it a great choice for players who want a low-complexity support character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Disciple of Life<\/span>: A significant improvement to the efficiency of your healing spells, but the vast majority of your magical healing should be 1st-level Healing Word.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Heavy Armor Proficiency<\/span>: A significant improvement to your durability, and with no Strength requirement to avoid speed penalties you can safely dump both Strength and Dexterity and focus on other ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spells<\/span>: Very few good options, and all of the spells are already on the Cleric&#8217;s spell list, and most of them can be prepared\/unprepared outside of combat for the rare times when you need them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bless<\/span>: A staple buff. Excellent at any level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cure Wounds<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to try to heal allies in combat, this is your best bet until you get Heal when you reach 6th-level spells. It&#8217;s still not a good choice, but at least Disciple of Life tilts the math slightly further in your favor.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aid<\/span>: An excellent spell, but since you can change prepared spells at any time outside of combat, it&#8217;s frustrating to have this permanently prepared.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Lesser Restoration<\/span>: Very rarely impactful in BG3.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beacon of Hope<\/span>: A significant improvement to the efficiency of your healing spells, but your Concentration should be dedicated to something more impactful than making hit point attrition into a longer and even more costly problem.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Revivify<\/span>: Hopefully you won&#8217;t need this often enough that having it permanently prepared makes sense. Scrolls of Revivify are widely available and surprisingly cheap.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Death Ward<\/span>: A great buff, but it lasts all day and it&#8217;s not helpful to have it permanently prepared because you&#8217;re not going to cast it in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Guardian of Faith<\/span>: Only situationally useful, and the same slot is almost always better spent on Spiritual Weapon or Spirit Guardians.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Greater Restoration<\/span>: Almost never useful. You can 100% the entire game and never feel the need to cast this once.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mass Healing Word<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but with Disciple of Life, at least the amount healed is decent.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-green\">Preserve Life<\/span>: A decent amount of healing, and it essentially guarantees that you have a good way to use your Channel Divinity even if you&#8217;re not in a part of the game where you&#8217;ll encounter undead. The amount healed is surprisingly good and the AOE is enormous. Be sure to use this before short rests to get everyone to full hp as quickly as possible. This is a huge improvement over the tabletop version, which is barely usable most of the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Blessed Healer<\/span>: If you&#8217;re on the front lines tanking, you&#8217;re going to take some hits. This reduces the urge to heal yourself instead of your allies. The amount of healing isn&#8217;t huge, but it triggers for each creature that you heal, and it also triggers off of Channel Divinity: Preserve Life (which is treated as a level 0 spell, unfortunately), so multi-harget healing spells can quickly rush you back to full health.  This is important for keeping your cleric topped up as they should be casting Warding Bond on your primary Defender or a melee Striker. It will also trigger off of the weapon ability from Divine Intervention: Arm Thy Servant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Strike: Radiant<\/span>: A great damage type, especially with the abundance of Cleric-friendly items that synergize with radiant damage. Divine Strike is a bad feature, but this is among the best versions.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rating-blue\">Light Domain<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Want to play a Blaster, but also a cleric? Light Domain is the closest you can get to an evocation wizard without playing a wizard. The subclass&#8217;s features are almost exclusively offensive, adding some of the Wizard&#8217;s best fire damage options to the Cleric&#8217;s already excellent spell list. There&#8217;s very little nuance to the subclass, but in a game full of nail-shaped problems, Light Domain is a hammer-shaped solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Spoilers]: Want to run this domain on easy mode? Get the Hat of Fire Acuity, use Produce Flame your primary damage cantrip, and rack up Arcane Acuity using Scorching Ray before droppin high-value spells to boost your save DC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Warding Flare<\/span>: An excellent defensive option on par with the spell Shield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spells<\/span>: All of the fire damage you could ever want. Definitely consider Elemental Adept.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"0\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Light<\/span>: Not particularly useful, but it&#8217;s a free cantrip, which most subclasses don&#8217;t get.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Burning Hands<\/span>: Good short-range area damage at low levels, but it becomes obsolete quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Faerie Fire<\/span>: A good counter to invisible enemies and a great way to help allies focus their attacks on enemies with a lot of hit points to burn through.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flaming Sphere<\/span>: Flaming Sphere is much more trouble and fills a similar niche. Of course, you can summon both if you have the spell slots for it.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Scorching Ray<\/span>: The king of single-target damage until level 11.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Daylight<\/span>: Easy to overlook, especially if you&#8217;re coming from the tabletop rules, but this is surprisingly good against enemies in the Underdark and in Act 2.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fireball<\/span>: The king of area damage spells.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guardian of Faith<\/span>: You\u2019re better off upcasting Spiritual Weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Wall of Fire<\/span>: An incredible area control and damage spell. It lasts a long time, does a decent chunk of damage per turn, and you can shove or throw people back into it if they escape.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Destructive Wave<\/span>: Good damage, a decent area of effect, and if enemies fail the Constitution save they&#8217;re knocked prone. In a game where standing from prone eats your action, that&#8217;s a massive impact. Unfortunately, the <\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Strike<\/span>: Unless your target is specifically vulnerable to radiant damage, cast Fireball or look elsewhere.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn<\/span>: Not a ton of damage and it targets Constitution saves, but it also doesn&#8217;t harm allies, so it&#8217;s decent at low levels or for clearing groups of low-hp enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Warding Flare<\/span>: A great way to negate critical hits or hits that would drop your allies to 0, but be careful not to burn through all of your uses early in the day. Be sure to set this to &#8220;Ask&#8221; in the reactions menu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: A significant increase to your cantrip damage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"tempest-domain\">Tempest Domain<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Where Life Domain creates a heavily-armored tank and War Domain attempts to create a martial cleric, Tempest Domain turns the Cleric into a heavily-armored Blaster and Controller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the rules changes compared to the tabletop rules, tempest clerics suffer from the same challenges that 5e tempest clerics do. That said, Destructive Wrath and Shatter still work out very well mathematically, as we explain in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/tempest-domain\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"19993\">Tempest Domain Cleric Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor is great. Ignore the weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Wrath of the Storm<\/span>: At low levels this can outright kill enemies, but it doesn&#8217;t scale, so at high levels it feels very forgettable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Domain Spells<\/span>: A good mix of offensive options, but not enough that works well with Destructive Wrath, unfortunately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Fog Cloud<\/span>: Low-budget Darkness.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderwave<\/span>: Not much damage, and Constitution saves are often high for many enemies, but you can launch enemies off ledges or into pits, which can often win a fight for you. Becomes obsolete when you get Gust of Wind.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Gust of Wind<\/span>: Thunderwave with a better AOE, but no damage. If you want to launch foes off edges, this is a great way to do it.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shatter<\/span>: Normally second-fiddle to Fireball, but without access to Fireball, Lighting Bolt, or another big damage spell that works with Destructive Wrath, Shatter is your Fireball.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Call Lightning<\/span>: Passable damage in a small AOE. If you can keep enemies Wet or capitalize on Thunderbolt Strike, this can be very effective.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleet Storm<\/span>: Potentially knock enemies in the area prone, robbing them of their Action at least for the next turn.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Freedom of Movement<\/span>: Not always useful, but against enemies that rely on Paralyzed or Restrained, this can be huge.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ice Storm<\/span>: Not great damage unless your targets are Wet, but the icy surface can knock enemies prone. Sleet Storm does the job just as well for a spell slot lower, so it&#8217;s a better option unless you desperately need the damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Destructive Wave<\/span>: Good damage, a decent area of effect, and if enemies fail the Constitution save they&#8217;re knocked prone. In a game where standing from prone eats your action, that&#8217;s a massive impact. Unfortunately, the <\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Insect Plague<\/span>: Decent area control, and you can shove or throw enemies back into the area to re-trigger the damage.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath<\/span>: If you&#8217;re building a single-class tempest cleric, this is going to be used for Shatter and nothing else. If you&#8217;re multiclassing, sorcerers and wizards can use this in conjunction with the Wet condition and spells like Chromatic Orb and Chain Lightning to do insane damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6: <span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderbolt Strike<\/span>: A great way to reposition enemies without cutting into your action economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Stike<\/span>: The damage type is good, but Divine Strike is still weak.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"trickery-domain\">Trickery Domain<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Trickery Domain can be frustrating at times, and it&#8217;s very easy to forget to use its subclass features, but in a party relying heavily on stealth, it can be a powerful asset. A trickery cleric isn&#8217;t a substitute for a rogue, but they are the Rogue&#8217;s best friend. Still, if you can cast Pass Without Trace from another source, strongly consider a different domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trickery Domain doesn&#8217;t get a 6th-level feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shadowheart is a trickery cleric by default.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Blessing of the Trickster<\/span>: A nice buff and you can use it for free whenever you like. Generally you&#8217;ll put this on your party&#8217;s Scout whenever you&#8217;re not concentrating on something important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-green\">Domain Spells<\/span>: A slow start, but some really great options at higher levels. The spell selection is eclectic, but includes and interesting mix of buffs, utility, and save-or-suck spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Charm Person<\/span>: Only useful if you&#8217;re dead set on your cleric being your party&#8217;s Face for some reason.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise Self<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but it does let you do things like talk to corpses of people who you&#8217;ve killed.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mirror Image<\/span>: A good defense once you have Spirit Guardians running since it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, but otherwise it&#8217;s not especially useful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pass Without Trace<\/span>: Trivialize stealth checks for the entire party. It does take Concentration, so you can&#8217;t use it with Blessing of the Trickster, but mathematically it blows Blessing of the Trickster out of water.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bestow Curse<\/span>: Given the choice between the two, cast Command.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fear<\/span>: In some situations, Fear is a better offensive option than Spirit Guardians, and considering how much Spirit Guardians monopolizes the Cleric&#8217;s offensive tactics, that&#8217;s amazing.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Dimension Door<\/span>: Line of sight teleportation for you and one ally on a class that doesn&#8217;t get any.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Polymorph<\/span>: Turn something into a sheep.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dominate Person<\/span>: In a game with a lot of humanoid enemies, this is amazing.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Seeming<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity<\/span>: Worse than the tabletop version, which was already underappreciated. The inability to move the duplicate makes this hard to use in highly mobile fights, and the fact that the illusion can be destroyed if it takes any damage or is moved means that it&#8217;s hard to keep the duplicate running.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8: <span class=\"rating-red\">Divine Strikes: Poison<\/span>: If you use this, it&#8217;s going to be on an opportunity attack. The damage isn&#8217;t enough to make it worth your Action and it&#8217;s of the worst type in the game.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rating-orange\">War Domain<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>War Domain attempts to turn the Cleric into a meaningful weapon user, but falls far short of that goal. War Priest is a neat way to get an extra attack, but a few extra attacks per day simply isn&#8217;t enough to make the Cleric meaningfully good at using weapons, and the domain spells don&#8217;t close the gap. More likely, War Priest is an appealing class dip for other classes looking to get more out of their Bonus Action without leaning into two-weapon fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor is great. Ignore the weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-orange\">War Priest<\/span>: The closest that the Cleric gets to Extra Attack. It only works a few times per day and eats your Bonus Action, which is often better spent on a spell. Note that Divine Strike is still once per turn, so even if you&#8217;re attacking twice you only get the damage boost once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spells<\/span>: Very few good options, an the best ones are already on the Cleric&#8217;s spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Divine Favour<\/span>: Too weak, too short duration, and you can&#8217;t share it with someone who is better than you are with weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield of Faith<\/span>: A great buff for your party\u2019s Defender if they\u2019re drawing a lot of attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Weapon<\/span>: This game hands out magic weapons like candy.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spiritual Weapon<\/span>: A staple at any level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crusader&#8217;s Mantle<\/span>: In a party that brings a lot of pets and summoned creatures, the +1d4 damage can add up quickly. However, if you&#8217;re in a party with just player characters it&#8217;s functionally useless.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Guardians<\/span>: Among the Cleric&#8217;s most defining spells.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Freedom of Movement<\/span>: Not always useful, but against enemies that rely on Paralyzed or Restrained, this can be huge.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Stoneskin<\/span>: By the time you get access to this spell, most things that deal a relevant amount of damage will be dealing magical damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Flame Strike<\/span>: Bad AOE damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hold Monster<\/span>: An upgrade to Hold Person, this can take any creature out of a fight.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2: <span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Guided Strike<\/span>: Decent for damage spells like Guiding Bolt and Inflict Wounds, but don&#8217;t use it with weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: War God&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: By this level you&#8217;re not making attack rolls, so using your Channel Divinity charges to help allies is a much better use of the resource.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Stike<\/span>: The damage type is good, but Divine Strike is still weak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Cleric Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because heavy armor doesn&#8217;t have a strength requirement to avoid speed\n\tpenalties, and because clerics have essentially no reason to use a weapon\n\tbeyond low levels, and because the value of medium armor for clerics is\n\tfurther increased by the abundance of good medium armor specifically designed\n\tfor them, there is really no reason to build a cleric around Strength. This\n\tdoes make cleric builds extremely homogenous, which is disappointing, but this\n\tis an optimization guide so we&#8217;re looking at what&#8217;s effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still want to build a heavily-armored cleric that swings weapons around, take a 2-level dip in paladin for Divine Smite and smite spells, then build your ability scores around Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I typically recommend maxing your key ability score to 17 at level 1. However, the lack of feats which provide a +1 bonus to Wisdom means that there&#8217;s usually no benefit to doing so, so leaving Wisdom at 16 is fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: There is basically no reason to invest\n\tin Strength on a cleric since heavy armor doesn&#8217;t impose a speed penalty.\n\tThere are some great weapons that thematically would make sense on a cleric,\n\tbut those same weapons work better in the hands of a martial character. If you\n\twant a viable melee weapon option, multiclass to get Shillelagh and then use\n\tit on a magic staff that buffs your spellcasting.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: 14 to fill out medium armor is\n\tplenty, but you could just dump it to 8 if you&#8217;re in heavy armor. Having high\n\tDexterity so that you can make opportunity attacks sounds interesting, but it\n\twon&#8217;t be impactful often enough to justify. Even if you&#8217;re proficient in heavy\n\tarmor, you likely want to build around medium armor and Dexterity because many\n\tof the armors intended for clerics are medium.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points, Constitution saves,\n\tConcentration.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Some skills.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Spellcasting, Wisdom saves,\n\tPerception.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Face skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Game Recommended<\/th><th>+2\/+1<\/th><th>Final<\/th><th>RPGBOT Recommended<\/th><th>+2\/+1<\/th><th>Final<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>13<\/td><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>8<\/td><td><\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>13<\/td><td><\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>+1<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>+1<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>+2<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>16<\/td><td><\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td><\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Cleric Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Clerics don&#8217;t have any obvious, fantastically powerful race options.

Players consistently complain that she can&#8217;t hit with attacks, most especially Fire Bolt, and that her subclass features are easy to completely forget about because they don&#8217;t feel impactful. All of these complaints are valid, and complaints about attacks have a very clear and obvious mathematical basis. If you&#8217;re here because you&#8217;re frustrated with Shadowheart&#8217;s performance in combat, you are not alone and you are right to be frustrated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re going to fix it. We can&#8217;t change race or background and we&#8217;re not going to chance Shadowheart&#8217;s subclass. Instead, we&#8217;re going to respec her ability scores and give you tactics that will make her work effectively without changing the heart of her build.

Not enough Strength or Dexterity to use any weapon meaningfully, not enough Dexterity to max out medium armor, and not enough Constitution to keep a cleric alive in melee while concentrating on high-impact spells like Spirit Guardians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Shadowheart is a companion, we&#8217;re not going to use her in conversations, which means that her Intelligence-based skills are less important than if we were playing a cleric ourselves. That lets us dump Intelligence and put those points into Strength. We&#8217;ll also go for a little extra Dexterity to help with saves, intiative, and stealth since Shadowheart (really any trickery cleric) thrives in a party of sneaky characters.

However, its speed is extremely slow, which can be a problem in fights spread over a large area.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Ability Score Increase (Wisdom 16 -&gt; 18)<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Blade Ward<\/td><td>Blade Ward is exclusively for use with Spirit Guardians once we get it. This level isn&#8217;t super exciting.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Domain Spells<br>&#8211; Bestow Curse<br>&#8211; Fear<\/td><td>Fear and Spirit Guardians are immediately amazing. Fear disarms a cone of enemies and sends them fleeing, trivializing many encounters against humanoids.<br><br>Spirit Guardians turns your cleric into a wandering blender. Enemies take damage the first time they enter area on <em>a turn<\/em>, not &#8220;your turn&#8221; or &#8220;their turn&#8221;, but <em>a turn<\/em>. Walk just close enough to hit enemies as you cruise past, then end your movement somewhere that encourages them to charge you and\/or somewhere that your allies could shove your enemies into the area to re-trigger the damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Channel Divinity 2\/rest<\/td><td>Basically nothing here but more resources. No tactical changes.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Domain Spells<br>&#8211; Dimension Door<br>&#8211; Polymorph<\/td><td>Polymorph turns an enemy into a sheep, which is hilarious. Unfortunately, the Cleric&#8217;s 4th-level spells aren&#8217;t great, so expect to reserve this slot for upcasting higher-level spells.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient (Constitution 15 -&gt; 16)<br>Divine Strike: +1d8 Poison<\/td><td>Divine Strike is already bad, and getting it as poison damage only makes it worse.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Domain Spells<br>&#8211; Dominate Person<br>&#8211; Seeming<\/td><td>Dominate Person suddenly becomes our go-to option for encounters against humanoids. Just remember that they get additional saves, so you want to be choosy about your targets and pick enemies that are likely to remain dominated for a few turns.<br><br>Contagion (Slimy Doom) is really good if you can debuff your target&#8217;s Con saves. Resonance (available from various items) and the debuff applied by a rat familiar&#8217;s bite are great options. Once Slimy Doom is in place you can comfortably stun-lock your target until they&#8217;re dead. Camping a Flaming Sphere or a cleric with Spirit Guardians next to them should do the job.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Divine Intervention<\/td><td>Get yourself a cool mace. Don&#8217;t use it as a mace, though, that would be silly. Use it to heal between encounters.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>You get exactly one 6th-level spell slot (although there&#8217;s a necklace you can find to give you another). Spend it wisely. I recommend Planar Ally (Deva), and if you have a second one, Heroes&#8217; Feast unless you\u2019re getting that via camp casting. Buff it via camp casting with spells like Aid, and you have a powerful, durable summon that will last all day long.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Ability Score Increase (Wisdom 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>Max Wisdom for max spell save DC.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Clerics are spellcasters powered by their faith in a deity. Their divine spellcasting is powerful, impactful, and reliable, and they get enough armor to stand on the front lines alongside barbarians and fighters. They&#8217;re an asset in any party, and the stereotype of clerics being healbots wildly undersells how powerful they are and how much fun they are. I can&#8217;t count how many times I&#8217;ve functionally ended an encounter by pressing the right buttons with Shadowheart.
