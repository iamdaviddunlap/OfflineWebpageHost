Right from your first subclass feature you&#8217;re rerolling dice to boost your damage output, and eventually Glyph of Hemorrhaging becomes a defining combat tactic for your whole party. And, while this makes your wizard a wonderful Blaster\/Striker, it doesn&#8217;t do anything to improve your versatility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With so much emphasis on damage output, it&#8217;s natural to compare Blood Magic to the other blast wizards: School of Evocation and War Magic. There&#8217;s some nuance here. War Magic is more durable, especially since it doesn&#8217;t eat its own hit points. Evocation is better at dropping area damage in close quarters. Blood Magic is comparatively self-centered until level 10, at which point you start picking targets for the party to dog pile onto (sometimes it&#8217;s &#8220;everything in the room&#8221;, but you get my point).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>At low levels, you&#8217;re likely going to have trouble using your subclass features consistently and safely.
