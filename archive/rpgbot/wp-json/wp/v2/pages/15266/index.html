Unleash Psyche\n\tgives you the ability to very briefly empower yourself, but you need to\n\taccomplish a lot in the 2-round duration or you&#8217;ll find yourself Stupefied,\n\twhich gives you a failure chance to cast spells. You need to juggle all of\n\tthese concerns to be effective, but if you can manage it all, the Psychic has\n\ta lot to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, the Psychic can fill several roles depending on your build.\n\tThey&#8217;re not quite as versatile as the Bard or the Sorcerer due to their\n\tsmaller pool of spellcasting, but they can still accomplish quite a bit.

Which you use it\n\tdetermined by your choife of Subconscious Mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: 6+ hit points is tiny. Stay in the\nback with your nonexistent armor and hope that your party&#8217;s Defender can keep\nyou safe.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The only thing that you&#8217;re\nremarkably good at is spellcasting.\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Among the worst Perception\n\t\tprogressions in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Saving Throws<\/span>: The worst Fortitude save\n\t\tprogression in the game, terrible Reflex saves, and good Will saves but\n\t\tlittle need for Wisdom. Your defenses are weak.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: 4+Int, which is the standard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: Only simple weapons and your\n\t\tproficiency is horrid. Don&#8217;t use weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: No armor and your proficiency in\n\t\tUnarmored Defense never goes past Expert. Taking feats to get armor\n\t\tproficiency is a good idea.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spellcasting DC<\/strong>: Standard progression for a full caster,\n\t\tmatching other classes like the Sorcerer and the Wizard.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Psychic Spellcasting<\/strong>: Psychics get just two spells per spell\n\tlevel below 10th, giving them one fewer than most full spellcasters and half\n\tof what the Sorcerer gets. That&#8217;s a considerable loss of versatility, so you\n\treally need to be able to rely on your cantrips and amps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Spells<\/span>: Heightening spells is\n\t\tan important mechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many spells scale them. Since\n\t\tPsychics use a Spell Repertoire, you need to learn spells at multiple levels\n\t\tto highten them in most cases, though Signature Spells are an exception.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Fantastic every time, on any\n\t\tcharacter, in any amount. Psychics learn 6 cantrips at level 1 and never get\n\t\tmore, but you can replace them by retraining or when you gain a level so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not locked into whatever you pick at first level (with the exception\n\t\tof the three granted by your Conscious Mind).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psi Cantrips and Amps<\/span>: Focus Points are\n\tcrucial for the Psychic. Cantrips are much larger part of your tactics than\n\tfor similar full casters, and Focus Points fuel the Amps that make your\n\tcantrips more powerful. You get 2 Focus Points and can Refocus to get back\n\tboth of them. For other classes the ability to recover more than 1 Focus Point\n\trequires a class feat that you can&#8217;t get until you&#8217;re past level 10. You don&#8217;t\n\tget to Refocus both points if you use your points for something outside of the\n\tclass, so be cautious if you&#8217;re eyeballing archetypes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unleash Psyche<\/span>: You can only activate this\n\ton turn 2 of combat, and it only lasts for two turns before it becomes a\n\tproblem for you. Being Stupefied in any amount means that you have a failure\n\tchance on your spells, which is <em>bad<\/em>. If you activate this, it&#8217;s time\n\tto get deadly serious about your next two turns. The simple benefit here is\n\tthe damage boost. 2 damage per spell level is nice, especially if you can\n\tapply it to multiple targets. The final benefit enables Psyche actions, of\n\twhich you&#8217;ll have at least one from your Subconscious Mind. These will consume\n\tactions for often minor benefits, so be very thoughtful about how you&#8217;ll get\n\tto spend the two turns after your activate Unleash Pyche.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subconscious Mind<\/strong>: See our\n\t<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/psychic\/subconscious-minds\/\">Subconscious Minds Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conscious Mind<\/strong>: See our\n\t<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/psychic\/conscious-minds\/\">Conscious Minds Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Clarity of Focus<\/span>: A third Focus Point, but\n\tsince you can&#8217;t Refocus to get all three you&#8217;ll likely only be able to use\n\tthree Focus Points in the same encounter once per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Psychic Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"intelligencebased\">Intelligence-Based<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Intelligence-based Psychics have similar ability needs to the Wizard and the\n\tWitch.
