If you need\n\t\t\t\tto switch targets or go help an ally, spend your bonus action and an\n\t\t\t\tattack to ensnare the target, then let them bleed out a bit while you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\toff dealing with more pressing issues. Note that after the initial save\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s a Strength <em>Check<\/em> (not a Save), so even creatures\n\t\t\t\tproficient in Strength Saves will have trouble escaping. Even better,\n\t\t\t\tthe damage scales linearly with spell level so it remains an excellent\n\t\t\t\tgo-to use for a spell slot for your whole career.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-Level<\/span>: Moonbeam is difficult to\n\t\t\t\tuse unless you can restrain a creature inside its effect long enough to\n\t\t\t\tjustify the spell slot (Grapple them, for instance), and even then it&#8217;s better left to\n\t\t\t\tfull spellcasters. Misty Step is a fantastic option and solves a lot of\n\t\t\t\tmobility issues, including pits, chasms, difficult terrain, walls of\n\t\t\t\tfire and other nasty materials, enemies, etc. Misty Step to the BBEG and\n\t\t\t\twave your sword in their face.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th-Level<\/span>: Plant Growth is weirdly\n\t\t\t\teffective area control, and Protection From Energy is a fantastic and\n\t\t\t\tvery important defensive option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: Ice Storm is a\n\t\t\t\tfrustrating combination of not enough damage and too little area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol. Stone Skin is an extremely good buff, but the 100gp component\n\t\t\t\tcost can add up quickly so you don&#8217;t want to cast it constantly.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">17th-Level<\/span>: Commune With Nature is a\n\t\t\t\tuseful divination, especially in unfamiliar areas, but Tree Stride is\n\t\t\t\textremely situational and totally useless if you&#8217;re not in a forest or\n\t\t\t\tjungle.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Channel Divinity<\/span>: Neither option will be\n\t\tconsistently useful. Talk to your DM about using the Harness Divine Power\n\t\tOptional Class Feature.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nature&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: Basically just\n\t\t\t\tEnsnaring Strike but worse. Nature&#8217;s Wrath allows the target to choose\n\t\t\t\teither Strength or Dexterity for its save, while Ensnaring Strike forces\n\t\t\t\tthem to use Strength. Nature&#8217;s Wrath allows the target to repeat the\n\t\t\t\tsave each turn for free, while Ensnaring Strike requires them to spend an\n\t\t\t\tAction to make a Strength <em>check<\/em> to escape (ability checks will\n\t\t\t\ttypically be worse than saves because you don&#8217;t get to add a Proficiency\n\t\t\t\tBonus). Ensnaring Strike does damage every turn, and Nature&#8217;s Wrath\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t do damage at all. Nature&#8217;s Wrath takes an Action, while\n\t\t\t\tEnsnaring Strike takes your Bonus Action and waits for you to\n\t\t\t\tsuccessfully hit with an attack. Ensnaring Strike&#8217;s effects improve with\n\t\t\t\tspell level, while Nature&#8217;s Wrath will never improve in any way.\n\t\t\t\t<p>Sure, you need to hit with an attack to apply Ensnaring Strike, but\n\t\t\t\t\thitting with attacks is your go-to move in combat. Ensnaring Strike&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tbiggest weakness compared to Nature&#8217;s Wrath is that it requires\n\t\t\t\t\tConcentration, but even that isn&#8217;t enough to make Nature&#8217;s Wrath good\n\t\t\t\t\tby comparison.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Turn the Faithless<\/span>: Situational by\n\t\t\t\tdesign. It&#8217;s no worse than Turn Undead or something similar, but without\n\t\t\t\tanother good way to use Channel Divinity it&#8217;s rough to have such a\n\t\t\t\tsituational option.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Warding<\/span>: Resistance to damage\n\t\tfrom spells will prevent a huge amount of damage, but spellcasters are a\n\t\tminority of enemies that you&#8217;ll face in most games\n, especially with the recent move towards monsters having spell-like actions\nin Monsters of the Multiverse. This is good, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tonly situationally useful unless you have allies who don&#8217;t care about\n\t\tfriendly fire.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Undying Sentinel<\/span>: You shouldn&#8217;t need this\n\t\tfrequently, but it&#8217;s a great fallback in case of a lucky crit or a big,\n\t\tunexpected attack. I&#8217;m not sure if &#8220;death of natural causes&#8221; counts as one of the\n&#8220;drawbacks of old age&#8221;, but this makes you immortal if it does.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"20\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Elder Champion<\/span>: One minute per day isn&#8217;t\n\t\ta lot, but, for that brief duration, this is very good. The ability to cast\n\t\tspells as a Bonus Action makes it easy to fit spells into your turn, so cast\n\t\tthings like Ice Storm and Death Ward, or hit enemies with Banishing Smite or Destructive Wave to\n\t\tcapitalize on Disadvantage on saves against your spells. Activating this\n\t\tdoes take an Action, but you can still fit a spell into the same turn. Just\n\t\tremember that your spell slots are limited, and burning both your capstone\n\t\tfeature and all of your spell slots will put you in a bad position to face\n\t\tthe rest of the day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-the-ancients-ability-scores\">Oath of the Ancients Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from other paladins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-the-ancients-races\">Oath of the Ancients Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from other paladins.

This means giving up some of the Paladin&#8217;s built-in damage output in exchange for the benefits of range. Fighting at range means we&#8217;re less dependent on positioning. We can stay closer to other ranged allies to share our auras instead of needing to constantly chase our melee allies to keep them in the aura.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll assume that all optional class features are available for this\n\tbuild.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to build around Dexterity primarily.

Since we&#8217;re primarily fighting at range and we have Lay on Hands, we can afford to have fewer hit points. Instead, we&#8217;ll put those points into Strength to support our Athletics checks.

Giff gets us two things that we really want: guns and hippo build. Firearms Mastery is the important parts of the Gunner feat, allowing us to use firearms effectively and to use them in melee range if necessary. Hippo Build gives us a way to Shove enemies effectively despite mediocre Strength. Astral Spark doesn&#8217;t hurt, either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could accomplish the same build with either Custom Origin or with Variant\n\tHuman, trading Darkvision or proficiency in one skill for Hippo Build and\n\tAstral Spark. This would largely remove Shove from our tactical options, which\n\tmight be fine for your purposes. You technically don&#8217;t need to use guns for\n\tthis build, either, so you might grab Sharpshooter instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Outlander.

You can still run into melee with a rapier and use Divine Smite if you need to, but the action cost to don a shield means that you&#8217;re running a relatively low AC compared to comparable melee paladins, so that&#8217;s not where you actually want to be.<br><br>We won&#8217;t get much out of our spellcasting at this level, but you can throw buffs like Shield of Faith on your party&#8217;s front line and maintain Concentration from a safe distance while you shoot stuff.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Divine Health<br>Sacred Oath (Ancients)<br>Channel Divinity:<br>&#8211; Nature\u2019s Wrath<br>&#8211; Turn the Faithless<br>Harness Divine Power (Optional) 1\/day<\/td><td>This is where our ranged tactics start to take off.

What we want is the improved likelihood of delivering Ensnaring Strike because applying that earlier in a fight means more total damage output from our whole party.<br><br>You can reasonably afford a pistol at this level, but it&#8217;s not better than a heavy crossbow, and we want to save every coin we can for a musket.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>2nd-Level Spells<br>Extra Attack<\/td><td>This is the first level that <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/starting-above-1st-level\/#wealth-by-level-table\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/starting-above-1st-level\/#wealth-by-level-table\">you can reasonably afford to spend 500gp<\/a> to purchase a musket, which is great because we can drop our heavy crossbow and upgrade to a <a href=\"https:\/\/youtube.com\/clip\/UgkxlIlVIGrN7Ik5e-Cv5ljv1chjrJ9RPF-K\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/youtube.com\/clip\/UgkxlIlVIGrN7Ik5e-Cv5ljv1chjrJ9RPF-K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">boom stick<\/a>.

Like other smite spells, you can attack repeatedly and the spell will apply the first time you manage to hit and wil lthen last for the remainder of the 1-minute duration, so even if you can&#8217;t &nbsp;see it yet, you can flail wildly until you can.<br><br>Upcasting Ensnaring Strike to 2nd-level is an option. All it gets you is more ongoing damage, so it&#8217;s not a huge impact unless you&#8217;re expecting your fight to go for a long time against large single foes.<br><br>Our subclass spells give us Misty Step.

It includes magical options for crowd control and area control which most paladins can&#8217;t match, as well as access to Misty Step so that you can move about unhindered. It works equally well with weapon builds and Blessed Warriors builds, so there&#8217;s plenty of options here.
