The Oathbreaker Paladin can also cast Animate Dead, but only gains access at level 9 due to the paladin\u2019s slower spellcasting progression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When cast at 3rd level, Animate Dead allows you to animate a single skeleton or zombie. Casting at 4th level adds two more skeletons or zombies (you must pick one type), each of which requires an additional corpse. Due to the spell\u2019s limited 10-foot range, you\u2019ll frequently need to move corpses into a small area in order to get enough to animate multiple undead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When casting Animate Dead at 5th level and above, you can instead choose to summon ghouls or flying ghouls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casting Animate Dead destroys the corpse which you animated. You can still loot the pile of remains left by this process, but can\u2019t animate it again. Casting Animate Dead again will instantly destroy any undead that your character currently has animated, so you need to upcast the spell to get more undead rather than casting it multiple times. Animated undead which are destroyed (reduced to 0 hp or when the spell ends) disappear, leaving nothing behind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have multiple spellcasters in the party, each caster can have their own group of undead. This includes casting Animate Dead from a scroll, so your various barbarians, fighters, and rangers can all summon undead, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animated dead all act on their own individual initiative in combat and function just like any other member of the party, and can take an Action, a Bonus Action (though none of undead options have one), and a Reaction.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"animated-undead-stats\">Animated Undead Stats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Which variety of undead you should summon depends very much on what you want your undead to do for you. Considering their stats is a great starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/20230911095102_1-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"Baldur's Gate 3 Skeleton Stats\" class=\"wp-image-21687\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Spooky scary skeletons<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Skeleton<\/th><th>Zombie<\/th><th>Ghoul<\/th><th>Flying Ghoul<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>HP<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AC<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Speed<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Attack Range<\/td><td>60 ft.<\/td><td>Melee<\/td><td>Melee<\/td><td>Melee<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Attack Damage<\/td><td>1d6 + 1d10 + Dex (3)<\/td><td>2d6 + Str (3)<\/td><td>3d6 + Str + paralysis<\/td><td>3d6 + Str + paralysis<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Special<\/td><td>Immune to Poison<br>Vulnerable to Bludgeoning Damage<\/td><td>Immune to Poison<br>Undead Fortitude<\/td><td>Immune to Poison<br>Devour<\/td><td>Immune to Poison<br>Devour<br>Flight<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Skeletons are ranged damage output plain and simple. They don\u2019t have a melee attack, and despite lacking Undead Fortitude, their comparable hp and higher AC can actually make them more durable than zombies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zombies are basically bags of hit points for your enemies to beat on instead of attacking you and your party. Their AC is basically nothing, so enemies will wear through the hp quickly, making zombies almost entirely dependent on Undead Fortitude to stay alive. Undead Fortitude can work very well, but a stray critical hit or any amount of radiant damage (fortunately not a common occurrence) will bring them down immediately. That said, a wall of zombies in the front with a bunch of casters in the back is a perfectly fine strategy once your party is high enough level to bring an adequate wall of zombies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghouls (both flying and standard) are there to paralyze enemies. Their attacks are slightly stronger than zombies\u2019, but again: the paralysis is what you want because paralyzing an enemy takes them out of the fight and also makes attacks against them automatic critical hits.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"collecting-corpses-fodder-for-the-army\">Collecting Corpses: Fodder for the Army<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Animate Dead requires you to have corpses available, and despite how much time you\u2019ll spend killing people, it may become difficult to provide enough bodies to animate, especially if you\u2019re taking frequent long rests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you can pick up dead bodies and haul them around. Civilized folks don\u2019t like you doing this, so either hide or lure them away by playing a song or casting <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/spells\/minor-illusion\/\">Minor Illusion<\/a>, then grab the corpse and be on your merry way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that not all bodies can be targeted with Animate Dead. You can only target humanoids, and even then, killing enemies with certain damage types will make their body unusable. You can check which bodies can be animate by starting to cast Animate Dead and hovering over the body, but cancel before you actually cast the spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bodies are heavy, and their weight includes whatever loot they have, so loot them first, then send the loot to camp. Small bodies also weigh less but animate the same way, so they\u2019re great candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you can\u2019t click \u201cSend to Camp\u201d on dead bodies. You can haul them back to camp and drop them, but I promise there is an easier way. The bodies also don\u2019t stick around when you\u2019re camping on a different map, so you might find that you\u2019ve collected a bunch of bodies and promptly left them in the Underdark or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/20230916104918_1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Baldur's Gate 3 camp full of bodies ready to be animated\" class=\"wp-image-21688\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This is exactly the WRONG way to do this, but part of the research process is experimentation.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, pick up a container, such as a box, chest, or pouch. Once it\u2019s in your inventory, open the container and drop the bodies into it. Once you\u2019ve loaded up as many bodies as your carry limit will tolerate, send the container to camp. You have now successfully stowed one or more bodies for later use, and you\u2019re well on your way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next time you\u2019re in camp, open up your Traveler\u2019s Chest and consolidate the bodies into one container. There\u2019s no need to be messy, and it\u2019s nice to see a number on the container which tells you just how much inventory you have.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buffing-your-army\">Buffing Your Army<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With a newly-formed army of various sorts of undead, you\u2019re likely eyeballing their 20-ish hp and dismal AC and thinking \u201cwell, at least they\u2019ll take one or two hits before they\u2019re re-dead.\u201d But we\u2019re not done here: it\u2019s time to do some <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"20045\">camp casting<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our summoned undead are valid targets for many of the same buffs that you want on the rest of your party, and by the time you can cast Animate Dead your party has a lot of 1st-level and 2nd-level spell slots to throw around for just that purpose. In this case, a wizard is the real MVP, so either dedicate Gale to camp casting, get the wizard hireling, or both (I like both). Then get a cleric (either shadowheart or the hireling cleric).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Longstrider is your first buff. It\u2019s cast as a ritual and can be cast repeatedly for free, so hit everyone in the party, living or otherwise. The additional speed is always welcome, and it makes traversing the map much faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mage Armor is next. This one eats a spell slot, which is inconvenient, but between readily-available 1st-level spell slots and Arcane Recovery you have a decently large pool of slots to draw from even with a single wizard doing the buffing. Since none of our animated dead are wearing armor, Mage Armor works on any of them, but might not beat their natural armor. Mage Armor raises zombies\u2019 and skeletons\u2019 AC by 3, which is huge. Ghouls won\u2019t benefit, and flying ghouls will only raise their AC by 1, which is still nice but not as impressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you want Aid, which will dramatically boost your minions\u2019 HP. Select each animated undead and walk them into a tightly-packed crowd. If one of your adventuring party members has animated undead but you need to temporarily rotate them out to make room for your camp casting cleric, their undead will walk back to their tent, so it\u2019s often best to congregate around that character\u2019s tent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve moved your various undead, familiars, yourself, etc. into a crowd, use a musical instrument to draw in other characters in the camp. While the music is playing, walk your camp casting cleric into the crowd and cast Aid at your highest spell level. 3rd-level Aid adds 10 maximum hp, which is a huge improvement for your animated dead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also eyeball Resist Poison and Darkvision but remember that your animated dead are already resistant to poison damage. If you\u2019re worried about darkness, have one of your camp casters cast Light or Daylight. Spending a bunch of 2nd-level slots to give each of your undead Darkvision may not be doable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In combat, consider spells and other tactics that will make your undead more likely to hit with their attacks since you\u2019re betting on numerous relatively small attacks compared to the actual party members. Faerie Fire is a great example here, giving your whole party Advantage to hit affected targets at the cost of a 1st-level spell slot, so you can repeat the tactic for a long time before running short on resources.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"healing-your-army\">Healing Your Army<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, there isn&#8217;t a way to heal your undead minions. Since they&#8217;re not living, they can&#8217;t be targeted by healing effects. Spells, items, channel divinity, etc. all seem to ignore undead. This effectively makes your undead minions disposable, making it even more crucial that you protect them effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zombies will die quickly. Even with Undead Fortitude, they&#8217;re going to die, and probably very quickly. If you plan for long adventuring days, zombies won&#8217;t go the distance. Plan accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character-options\">Character Options<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Beyond the ability to cast Animate Dead and appropriate spells to buff your undead minions, a few character options can also contribute to your success with Animate Dead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Circle of Spores Druid: Spore zombies last all day and don&#8217;t conflict with Animate Dead, so you can get a bigger group of undead than anyone including the School of Necromancy Wizard.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Oathbreaker Paladin &#8211; Aura of Hate: Allied fiends and undead within 10 feet of the paladin deal additional damage with melee weapon attacks (so not spells) equal to the paladin\u2019s Charisma modifier. This is a modest buff, but it can add up quickly if you can squeeze multiple undead into the aura and still get them into melee with a target. Consider having your paladin use a reach weapon in order to attack over your wall of zombies\/ghouls.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>School of Necromancy Wizard &#8211; Undead Thralls: Learn Animate Dead for free, and two important buffs to the spell. First, you can animate an additional corpse (2 skeletons at 3rd spell level, 4 at 4th spell level, 2 ghouls at 5th, 4 ghouls at 6th). Second, each undead you animate increases their hp by your wizard level <em>which stacks with Aid<\/em>, and then adds your Proficiency Bonus to their damage. This makes your undead more numerous, more durable, and more lethal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dealing-with-npcs\">Dealing with NPCs<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>NPCs outside of your party don\u2019t like undead. They\u2019ll frequently chase them around and say things like \u201cGo on, get\u201d and \u201cWhat is this creature doing here?\u201d Dragging a bunch of ghouls and such into a crowd isn\u2019t socially acceptable, so when you\u2019re not expecting a fight, it\u2019s sometimes best to have your undead unchained from the party and standing somewhere out of the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a fight breaks out unexpectedly, you can walk your undead from wherever they are into the fight while someone waits to take their turn. Combat is perfectly happy to wait around since it\u2019s turn-based.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-danse-macabre-create-undead-and-summoning-spells\">What about Danse Macabre, Create Undead, and Summoning Spells?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Other spells do not conflict with Animate Dead, and they all benefit from the same tactics. Load up on summons immediately after you take a long rest, then get to buffing. You may need several of your camp casters to take a level of wizard to get enough Mage Armor to go around, but rolling through dozens of encounters with a firing squad of skeletons and mephits is both hillarious and extremely effective.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You now have a wall of super fast, super durable undead (and maybe other summons). With a cleric, an oathbreaker paladin, and a necromancer wizard in the party, you can easily have 8 heavily-buffed undead minions in the party and roll them over whatever is unfortunate enough to fight you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is Animate Dead?
