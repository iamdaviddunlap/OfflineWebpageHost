This subclass allows a fighter to learn and use Maneuvers, a kind of special attack. Not quite as big and flashy as spells, each Maneuver is very focused on accomplishing a specific purpose, from making an attack more accurate to throwing an opponent across the room, while usually also adding extra damage to the attack. If you want to use cool martial abilities with better names than \u201cSwing my Sword\u201d, then maybe the Battle Master is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The customizability of the Battle Master\u2019s Maneuver choices gives almost as much choice as some spellcasters, so we\u2019ll be going over and rating the available Maneuvers further down on this page. With our help, you\u2019ll be able to avoid the few poor options and assemble the Fighter you want to be. While we always feature an example build in these handbooks, we also see the opportunity to give example packages of full choices, as a single-classed Battle Master will choose just nine of the twenty-three available Maneuvers (not counting feats, fighting style, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The example build below, Bug Game Hunter, is our take on using Battle Master to bring a little support and control to the table without sacrificing the kind of damage Fighters are known for. Taking advantage of the Quick toss Maneuver, we can bypass the special limitation on nets that normally interfere with the extra attack feature. This relatively easy and cheap source of the Restrained condition benefits the whole party in a manner similar to a shoving grappler, granting Advantage to all attacks (instead of just Melee) as well as imposing Disadvantage on the target\u2019s Dexterity saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the net tossing shenanigans are the star attraction of the Bug Game Hunter, don\u2019t think this is some one-trick pony. With a wide selection of Maneuvers, we\u2019re able to contribute more than just damage in many scenarios. For example, with Pushing Attack we can corral foes back into a dangerous AoE, or use Maneuvering Attack to reposition an ally. To keep this build useful out of combat as well, Commanding Presence and Tactical Assessment provide some benefits to specific skill checks. If you want to try Fighter with a side of support control, check out the Bug Game Hunter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Battle Master Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#battle-master-maneuvers\">Battle Master Maneuvers<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#maneuver-packages\">Maneuver Packages<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#battle-master-ability-scores\">Battle Master Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#battle-master-races\">Battle Master Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#battle-master-feats\">Battle Master Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#battle-master-weapons-and-armor\">Battle Master Weapons and Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-battle-master-build-bug-game-hunter\">Example Battle Master Build &#8211; Bug Game Hunter<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

You gradually get more dice, allowing for more maneuvers at\n\t\thigher levels, and you gradually add more known maneuvers. You can replace\n\t\tknown maneuvers as you level, but since there aren&#8217;t any maneuvers with\n\t\tprerequisites or anything, you really only need to replace maneuvers that\n\t\tyou tried and didn&#8217;t like.\n\t\t<p>Many maneuvers add your superiority die to the damage roll if you hit.\n\t\t\tSince the damage die is added to the damage roll, the additional damage is\n\t\t\tmultiplied on a critical hit. This makes it especially appealing to apply\n\t\t\ta maneuver when you score a critical hit so that you get both a big pile\n\t\t\tof damage and a cool rider effect.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Student of War<\/span>: Artisan&#8217;s tools probably\n\t\twon&#8217;t matter to the game, but the expanded options in Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to\n\t\tEverything make this much more fun than it was when the core rules were\n\t\tpublished. Check out out\n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/tools\/\">Practical Guide to Tools<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Know Your Enemy<\/span>: This won&#8217;t come into\n\t\tplay in most encounters unless you work to make it happen, but it&#8217;s great if\n\t\tyou can get the BBEG monologuing while you study him or if you can manage to\n\t\tbe stealthy long enough to observe the target. There&#8217;s no limitation on the\n\t\tusage, so you could spend additional minutes studying the target to learn\n\t\teverything on the list and get a really good sense of the target&#8217;s\n\t\tstats.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Combat Superiority (d10)<\/span>: These\n\t\tbumps only amount to an increase of 1 each, but they feel very nice and\n\t\tsince you&#8217;re using Superiority Dice so frequently the small bonus adds\n\t\tup. As an interesting quirk, RAW if you have any dice from the Superior Technique style or the Martial Adept feat those dice also increase to d10s at this level, though that won\u2019t be reflected in DnDBeyond.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless<\/span>: This ensures that you always\n\t\thave at least one superiority die, so you don&#8217;t have to stress about using\n\t\tyour last die before the adventuring day is over.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Combat Superiority (d12)<\/span>: These\n\t\tbumps only amount to an increase of 1 each, but they feel very nice and\n\t\tsince you&#8217;re using Superiority Dice so frequently the small bonus adds\n\t\tup.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-master-maneuvers\">Battle Master Maneuvers<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>These are the Maneuvers available to the Battle Master.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll note if a Maneuver is limited in some way like Melee Only (M) or Non-Attack Utility (U).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ambush (U)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: A bonus to Stealth can have a huge impact even though you\u2019re likely not sneaking during combat. How effective this will be depends somewhat on your DM and how they apply the Stealth rules. If your DM asks for repeated Stealth checks in quick succession, this won\u2019t work out. But if you can make one check and sneak through a room or disappear into a crowd or explore a small area, this could be very helpful. This can also be used when rolling initiative which is useful if you have something like the Bugbear\u2019s Surprise Attack or the Assassin&#8217;s Assassinate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bait and Switch (U)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, but very interesting if you have frail allies who tend to get stuck in melee from time to time. Switching places with them can pull them out of melee reach, and if they can act before your enemies, your ally could withdraw to safety, removing the need for you to boost their AC and thereby allowing you to keep that benefit for yourself without feeling selfish.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brace (M)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: An additional attack is probably worth a Superiority Die as long as your damage per hit is decent, or if you have a once per turn damage boost like Sneak Attack from levels in Rogue. Unfortunately this doesn\u2019t work with Sentinel; you\u2019ll need Polearm Master for the Polearm Master+Sentinel combo.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Commander&#8217;s Strike (U)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: If you don\u2019t have a Rogue in your party, this is generally a poor option since you should do enough damage on your own that you should reserve your limited pool of Superiority Dice for other options. If you have a Rogue in the party, this becomes a fantastic option which you should capitalize on any time your Rogue can reliably hit the target. Sneak Attack works once per turn (not once per round), so allowing the Rogue to make an extra attack on your turn means a big pile of extra Sneak Attack damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Commanding Presence (U)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Adding a superiority die is enough to offset a poor Charisma score, allowing the Battle Master Fighter to serve as a Face without further splitting their attention on ability scores. This notably omits Charisma (Deception), so there\u2019s mechanical incentive to be honest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disarming Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Bonus damage and you get to force the target to drop one item if they fail a Strength save. Unfortunately, relatively few enemies use weapons and the ones that do predominantly rely on Strength and will therefore have high Strength saves. That means that this is unreliable against most melee combatants, but can see some use against foes armed with ranged weapons or enemy casters holding some kind of focus or wand.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Distracting Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Very helpful with a Rogue or some other Striker in the party, especially against enemies with high AC. However, its usefulness diminishes if you don\u2019t have an ally who can follow your attack with a single high-damage attack to capitalize on Advantage. Sneak Attack is an obvious example, but also look for high-damage attack spells like Inflict Wounds and Chromatic Orb.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Evasive Footwork (U)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a huge boost to AC, but its only purpose is to boost your AC when you know that you\u2019re going to provoke an Opportunity Attack. While you could just Disengage, this doesn&#8217;t take an action to use but it&#8217;s still not really worth spending the die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Feinting Attack (M*)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Advantage on your own attack and bonus damage. You don\u2019t want to use this frequently because it will eat your Superiority Dice too quickly, but this is a good staple option and increasing your likelihood to hit right when you need it can help to eliminate weakened enemies or break their Concentration when doing so is tactically impactful and you just need one good hit. If you need Advantage against the target on an ongoing basis, Shove them prone. While it isn&#8217;t technically restricted to melee attacks, the target must be within 5 feet of you when you use the bonus action.<br>Note that errata updated this to indicate that the Advantage is wasted if you don\u2019t attack the target during the same turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Goading Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: A rare taunt mechanic in DnD 5e. However, Menacing Attack is probably a better option. Goading Attack imposes Disadvantage on attacks against anyone except you, but Menacing Attack imposes Disadvantage on all attacks, and on ability checks, and restricts the target&#8217;s movement. If you need to encourage the target to attack you (which is a good idea for most fighters), this may still be better than Menacing Attack, but in most cases you may be able to use Menacing Attack to achieve the same result (preventing them from hitting your party). However, creatures which are immune to fear won\u2019t suffer the effects of Menacing Attack, so this is an excellent backup option. Funny enough this isn&#8217;t limited to melee and you&#8217;re free to taunt from across the room.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grappling Strike (M)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Grappled creatures have a move speed of 0 ft., which both prevents them from running away and from standing up from prone. If you knock the target prone with either Trip Attack or the Shove special attack, they\u2019re prone and can\u2019t stand (you can\u2019t stand if your speed is 0), giving you and any other melee attackers Advantage against them until they manage to escape the grapple. Grappling Strike works after you hit with an Attack, so it\u2019s easy to employ without gambling a Superiority Die on an attack roll and without cutting into your damage output (assuming that you\u2019re not using two-weapon fighting). An additional quirk to this maneuver is that unlike a lot of others, the trigger is a melee attack not a weapon attack, which is intended to allow compatibility with unarmed strikes, but also allows it to trigger from melee spell attacks.<br>\nAs good as this is, it can be expensive to employ repeatedly. If you find that this is a go-to tactic for you, consider the Tavern Brawler feat for the Bonus Action grapple, and consider the Skill Expert feat for Expertise to replace the bonus to your Strength (Athletics) check.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lunging Attack (M)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Just move closer to your target. If you need to remain in your current position you can move back after attacking or you can make a ranged attack with Quick Toss or something.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Maneuvering Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: It\u2019s rare that this will provide a significant advantage unless you\u2019re using the flanking variant rule or something. Movement in 5e is easy, and using something like Menacing Attack to impose Disadvantage on a potential Opportunity Attack is likely sufficient in most cases, or you can use Pushing Attack to push enemies away and get allies out of grapples.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Menacing Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Frightening a target makes them considerably less effective, and with clever positioning you can use this to keep the target away from your allies. However, beware of creatures that are immune or resistant to fear effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Parry (M)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Reducing damage is often much more effective than waiting to heal it later, but it is probably more effective to spend the same Superiority Die to defeat your attacker than it is to spend it reducing a little bit of damage. The damage reduced also doesn\u2019t scale much since your Superiority Dice scale in size so slowly, so this may be a good option at low levels when you have relatively few hit points, but consider retraining at once you\u2019re more confident in your durability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precision Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Great against enemies with high AC, or if you absolutely need to make one attack hit, but don\u2019t rely on it too heavily or it will eat through your Superiority Dice. The best part of Precision Attack may be hard to spot: you can use it after the attack is rolled, and that\u2019s the only sensible time to use this. If you\u2019re paying enough attention to know the target\u2019s AC (or if you used Know Your Enemy or if you\u2019ve figured it out from dice rolls), you can estimate when using this makes sense. The closer you are to hitting, the more likely this is to work, and at an average bonus of 4.5 (more once your dice advanced to d10\/d12) I recommend only using this if you\u2019re within 4 points of hitting.<br>\nIt\u2019s easy to compare Precision Attack to Feinting Attack since both make it easier to hit. Feinting Attack provides Advantage and a damage boost, but you need to use it before the attack. Precision Attack is nice because you can use it after your attack roll if you know that your Superiority Die could turn a near-miss into a hit, so you\u2019re not forced to gamble a Superiority Die that you might not need to spend. Feinting Attack provides a damage bonus, which means that even if you didn\u2019t need Advantage you still get something out of spending your die. Precision Attack doesn\u2019t require you to spend your Bonus Action and also works beyond 5-foot range. Taking all of these considerations into account, they\u2019re roughly equivalent and which is better depends greatly on your build and your situation. If you use Bonus Actions heavily, definitely go for Precision Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pushing Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Shove is typically sufficient for Strength-based melee builds, but for Dexterity-based builds and for ranged builds, this can be a helpful way to break grapples or knock enemies out of position. Small creatures also aren\u2019t penalized for their size, making this an easy and reliable way to push enemies without relying on Athletics. It\u2019s still only situationally useful, but it\u2019s difficult to replicate by any other means short of magic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Toss<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: If you\u2019re built to throw weapons, you\u2019re using the Fighting Style (Thrown Weapon), so this is for other builds that need a way to quickly deal some ranged damage without cutting into their melee stuff. You still need a free hand to draw the weapon and make the attack, so sword+board fighters will have trouble since you can\u2019t sheathe your weapon, use Quick Toss, and draw your weapon again without spending your Action to do so (though you may be able to drop it on the ground then immediately pick it back up). That means that the only viable users for this maneuver are two-handed melee weapon users.<br>\nEven for that limited pool of users, this has limited usefulness. If you have a two-handed weapon in hand, you can draw a dagger or javelin as your free item interaction for the turn, then spend one of your attacks to throw it before returning your hand to your two-handed weapon. The only advantage Quick Toss provides over that solution is that you get an attack as a Bonus Action and can use your Action to attack with your two-handed weapon.<br>\nMelee users can use Quick Toss effectively with a two-handed melee weapon, especially one with reach like a glaive. You\u2019re going to make the attack with your net at Disadvantage nearly all of the time due to the net\u2019s frustrating 5\/15 range, but if you can hit the target it is Restrained. This also conveniently sidesteps the net\u2019s limitation on one attack per action spent to attack, so you still get to enjoy Extra Attack to repeatedly attack your (hopefully restrained) opponent.<br>\nYou can also put Quick Toss and nets to good effect with certain feats tailored to ranged combat. Both Crossbow Expert and Gunner negate Disadvantage imposed by making ranged attacks while within 5 feet of an enemy, and Sharpshooter negates Disadvantage for attacking at long range. Tossing a net from 10 to 15 feet away to Restrain a target then hitting them wish Sharpshooter attacks made with Advantage is very effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rally (U)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Charisma is a dump stat for Fighters, so this won\u2019t be a lot of hit points, but the temporary hit points don\u2019t have a specified expiration, so they last until they run out or the target takes a Long Rest. You can start each day by rallying your allies, then immediately take a Short Rest to get your Superiority Dice back.<br>\nI\u2019m not certain if you can use this on yourself (I assume you can\u2019t), which is a shame because you are the one who needs this the most. If you really like this, consider the Inspiring Leader feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Riposte (M)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Spend a superiority die for an attack as a Reaction. Seems like a fantastic trade to me, especially if you\u2019re using a big two-handed weapon and do a lot of damage per attack. Also great if you&#8217;ve got a once per turn damage boost like Sneak Attack from levels in Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sweeping Attack (M)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is very little damage, and you can get much better utility from your superiority dice. If you want a similar effect, consider the Great Weapon Master feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tactical Assessment (U)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: The affected skills are difficult choices for the Fighter, with the possible exception of Insight, so you may see little benefit from taking this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trip Attack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Knocking a target prone gives you Advantage on melee attacks against them. Since Fighters get the most attacks, this means you get Advantage on a whole bunch of attacks. For best results, combine this with a grapple to keep the target prone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"maneuver-packages\">Maneuver Packages<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The following packages are some sample packages of Maneuvers to pick up.
