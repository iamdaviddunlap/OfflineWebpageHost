If you talk to your GM and work out an agreement for how Blind Ambition will be handled, it may be very effective. However, I can&#8217;t predict that outcome unless I&#8217;m your GM so I generally can&#8217;t recommend the Ambition domain.

An Action\n\tto get +1 or +2 to attacks won&#8217;t be as effective as using that Action to\n\tdo something like casting a spell or making a Strike. The best combat use\n\tcase is in an encounter with numerous enemies because it mathematically\n\tincreases the odds of an enemy rolling a Critical Success on an attack to\n\ttrigger the improved bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of combat, it&#8217;s comparable to Guidance but doesn&#8217;t have the temporary immunity and you can only target yourself.

This is an easy and effective way to break a grapple either on\n\tyourself or an ally, and with a generous 500-foot range you can easily use\n\tthis on almost anything in sight. You may even be able to knock foes off of\n\thigh points like castle walls or towers.

Your\n\tenemies likely spent actions to reach you, then actions to attack you, and\n\tspending your Reaction (inexpensive compared to an Action on a creatures&#8217;\n\tturn) to move out of reach.

If the target fails a\n\tcheck on their first Action (where they&#8217;re most likely to succeed), the\n\tpenalty applies for the rest of their turn, and might go up to -2 if they fail\n\tagain. Most creatures never get more than three Actions, so even if they do\n\thit that -2 penalty it applies for one Action that was likely to fail anyway\n\tif a check was involved. So the most likely outcome is that the target takes a\n\t-1 penalty to the last Action on their turn, but might take it on two Actions\n\tif you&#8217;re lucky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"creation\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=5\" class=\"rating-orange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creation<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t go this route unless your party is reliant on the Craft skill. If you have people who like Advanced Alchemy or Snares, or who use shields (and therefore need to repair them repeatedly), Artistic Flourish will provide a useful skill bonus that will be constantly beneficial to the party. But if you don&#8217;t plan to use Artistic Flourish, Splash of Art isn&#8217;t good enough on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spell: Splash of Art<\/span>: The effects\n\taren&#8217;t bad, but the AOE is very small and the effects are unpredictable. If\n\tyou hit a spellcaster with Enfeebled, they&#8217;re probably not going to care. Your\n\tbest bet is to throw this into a cluster of enemies early in fight, and the\n\teffects are more impactful against against martial creatures than they are\n\tagainst spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Advanced Domain Spell: Artistic Flourish<\/span>:\n\tThe item bonus to weapons is suprisingly unhelpful. By the time you can get\n\tthis, you and your allies should be using magic weapons which provide\n\tpermanent item bonuses to your attacks. But the bonus with tools is really\n\tgreat. Item bonuses from tools are typically very expensive, so providing a\n\tscaling numerical bonus at the cost of a Focus Point can save you and your\n\tparty a great deal of money. If people in your party need to craft alchemical\n\titems, repair damaged gear like shields, or any number of other routine tasks,\n\tthey can all benefit from Artistic Flourish at very little cost beyond the\n\tfeats to learn the spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"darkness\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=6\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Darkness<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your party is sneaky, or if your party all has Darkvision and can function well in complete darkness, the Darkness domain offers some exciting options which your party can benefit from consistently. Darkvision is available from numerous sources, so parties which include someone with the Darkness domain can easily accommodate these tactics even if not everyone has Darkvision from their Ancestry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spell: Cloak of Shadow<\/span>: Broadly\n\tuseful, and since it&#8217;s automatically heightened magical darkness it can\n\tovercome magical light from other spells in addition to suppressing light from\n\tthings like torches and sunlight. This isn&#8217;t quite the ability to hide in\n\tplain sight (the spell very specifically calls out that observant creatures\n\tcan observe the darkness moving), but it&#8217;s close. The ability to remove the\n\tcloak and leave the effect in place for the spell&#8217;s duration allows for\n\tfurther trickery if you&#8217;re clever enough to intentionally draw observers&#8217;\n\tattention to it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Advanced Domain Spell: Darkened Eyes<\/span>: This\n\tis only useful if your whole party has Darkvision and you&#8217;re fighting in the\n\tdark. That&#8217;s fairly easy to accomplish since Darkvision is widely available as\n\ta racial trait, from a spell, or from items, but if your enemies have a light\n\tsource (torches, the sun, etc.) you&#8217;ll need to extinguish it before this is\n\treliably effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"death\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=7\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Death<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Death&#8217;s Call is an easy and reliable way to turn your Focus Points into damage mitigation.

Eradicate Undeath is only useful if you expect undead enemies to appear in your campaign, but taking Domain Initiate to get Death&#8217;s Call doesn&#8217;t obligate you to go any further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spell: Death&#8217;s Call<\/span>: Consistently\n\tuseful in combat, the temporary hit points can easily make up the gap in\n\tdurability between the Cleric and more durable classes like the Fighter.\n\tEncounters with multiple enemies are the norm in Pathfinder 2e, so you&#8217;ll\n\tnearly always have fodder to trigger Death&#8217;s Call while still having time for\n\tits effects to matter in the same encounter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Advanced Domain Spell: Eradicate Undeath<\/span>:\n\tSituational by design, but against undead this is a solid, reliable burst\n\tdamage option.

If you manage to deal damage before casting this the \tdamage dice chance from d8&#8217;s to d12&#8217;s, increasing the damage by nearly 50%, \tbut with a 2-Action casting time that may be hard to do.

If you and your GM are prepared for that, there&#8217;s a lot of fun to be had here.

Keep in mind that the effect is only suppressed for one\n\tround (though any Grab is broken and doesn&#8217;t automatically reapply) so the\n\ttarget needs to act quickly once you cast this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"healing\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=15\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healing<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t both unless you plan to pick up Rebuke Death. Healer&#8217;s Blessing is unimpressive and encourages you to spend spell slots in foolish ways, but Rebuke Death completely changes the tactics around dying allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spell: Healer&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: This is\n\tfrustratingly the weak. This doesn&#8217;t synergize well with spells which provide\n\thealing over time, so the expectation is that you&#8217;ll cast this then repeatedly\n\thit the target with Heal or something similar. But doing so is typically a\n\tgrotesque misuse of resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In-combat healing should typically only be done in an emergency, and outside of combat you need to use options like Medicine or Rebuke Death to preserve limited resources like spell slots. If you have time to make Healer&#8217;s Blessing work, you probably have time to use the Medicine skill&#8217;s Treat Wounds activity, and outside of combat that&#8217;s a much less expensive way to handle hit point restoration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the best use case for Healer&#8217;s Blessing is as a stepping stone until you can get Rebuke Death. At low levels, the additional healing from Healer&#8217;s Blessing can stretch your spell slots spent on healing magic enough to get you by without needing to heavily invest in Medicine or other hit point restoration. At high levels when the bonus has scaled considerably, spending a 1st-level spell slot to cast Heal can provide an impressive large amount of healing at low cost, though the AOE heal option can also trigger Healer&#8217;s Blessing and will restore considerably more hp for the same spell slot, so that&#8217;s still the preferred way to use Heal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Domain Spell: Rebuke Death<\/span>: The\n\tability to bring a dying ally back to consciousness without applying the\n\tWounded condition is <em>huge<\/em>. Wounded is what makes falling to 0 hit\n\tpoints scary in Pathfinder 2e, so the ability to remove that &#8220;death spiral&#8221;\n\tmechanic means that falling to 0 hit points is considerably less of a problem.\n\tBringing allies back up from 0 hit points gets them back into the fight (at\n\tleast temporarily), easily replacing the Actions which you spent to heal\n\tthem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of healing is similar to the single-target and AOE versions of the Heal spell (though Rebuke Death uses a smaller die), but unlike Heal you can target up to three allies with no risk of healing your enemies. This allows you to heal multiple allies in the middle of combat much more easily than you could with Heal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of combat, this is a great way to heal your party members at no cost. Refocus takes 10 minutes compared to the 10-minute (or 1-hour) Activity for Treat Wounds, and with Rebuke Death you don&#8217;t need to invest skill increases and potentially feats to make Medicine into a renewable source of hit point restoration. Even better, Rebuke Death will restore more hit points than Treat Wounds, and will scale automatically as you gain levels, remaining consistently ahead of Treat Wounds even as you add more Skill Increases and potentially feats. Medicine may still be useful for treating poison and diseases, but Rebuke Death neatly solves the issue of hit point restoration outside of combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"indulgence\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=16\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indulgence<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two excellent options that have a variety of interesting of uses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spell: Overstuff<\/span>: Sickened is an\n\texcellent debuff which doesn&#8217;t go away on its own, and which the target may\n\tstruggle to remove even after spending multiple Actions to do so.

Admittedly this sounds like an uncomfortable\n\tand unpleasant replacement for eating, but it&#8217;s certainly efficient.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Advanced Domain Spell: Take its Course<\/span>:\n\tSituational by design, but it covers conditions which are common enough that\n\tyou and your party will definitely benefit from this even if you only use it\n\tdefensively. Poison and disease afflictions can cause serious problems for\n\tyour allies (though disease afflicitions typically have a generous delay\n\tbefore they become a problem) and granting an additional save to try to end\n\tthem early can save you a lot of trouble. Similarly, for persistent poison\n\tdamage you can allow an ally to make an additional save to end the effect and\n\tset the flat check DC to 5, giving them a 80% chance to end the effect and\n\tthereby prevent a huge amount of additional damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have someone in the party who likes to use poisons (alchemists are a great example), forcing enemies to make another save against the poison with a -2 penalty can increase the severity of the affliction and cause all manner of problems for them. Re-triggering persistent poison damage sounds tempting, but the damage will at best match the damage from hitting the target with an attack cantrip, so re-triggering the persistent damage is generally a poor use of a Focus Point unless you&#8217;re desperate and struggling to harm the target by other means.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"knowledge\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=17\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knowledge<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent if you&#8217;re already reliant on Recall Knowledge, but without a mechanic like the Ranger&#8217;s Monster Hunter feat tree it may be difficult to turn the Knowledge Domain into clear benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Domain Spell: Scholarly Recollection<\/span>:\n\tRecall Knowledge can be an effective way to gain insights into your enemies,\n\tand numerous character options offer specific numeric benefits when using\n\tRecall Knowledge, such as the Ranger&#8217;s Monster Hunter feat chain.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Domain Spell: Know the Enemy<\/span>: A\n\tmassive upgrade from Scholarly Recollection, this allows you to easily make\n\tRecall Knowledge checks without cutting into your Actions on your turn.

There are few domains which so nicely sum the range of capabilities expected from a classic good-aligned cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spell: Dazzling Flash<\/span>: Excellent\n\tcrowd control, and the fact that this scales to a 30-foot cone makes it even\n\tbetter. The Dazzled condition is effectively a 20% miss chance on attacks, and\n\timposing it for a minute on a Failure means that enemies will be severely\n\thindered for the duration of most fights.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Advanced Domain Spell: Positive Luminance<\/span>:\n\tThis spell is weird and requires a bit of additional tracking, but it&#8217;s a good\n\tspell with very minor Action costs and surprisingly good effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Used combatively (I won&#8217;t say &#8220;offensively&#8221; or &#8220;defensively&#8221;, because it&#8217;s both) against undead enemies it&#8217;s a sort of &#8220;thorns&#8221; effect which harms undead enemies for attacking you. However, they need to be within the area of light so you need to ramp up your Luminance Reservoir as fast as possible. If possible, cast Positive Luminance before combat starts and wait a few turns to get it partially charged before you jump into combat. Try to draw as many attacks as possible to get the most retaliatory damage possible, then as combat draws to a close (or when Positive Luminance&#8217;s duration expires) spend an Action to Dismiss the spell and either drop a pile of damage on an enemy or heal an ally with it. There&#8217;s no save against the damage from Positive Luminance, so it&#8217;s a great way to reliably harm undead foes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of combat, Positive Luminance provides consistent, reliably healing that removes the need to rely on Medicine as a source of inexpensive hit point restoration. Positive Luminance doesn&#8217;t heal as much or as quickly as Rebuke Death, and spending a full minute to charge up the healing isn&#8217;t as fast as Nature&#8217;s Bounty, but if you have time to use Treat Wounds you also have time to repeatedly Refocus and use Positive Luminance to heal your party one at a time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most frustrating part of Positive Luminance is tracking the effect as you gradually increase it every round. At the beginning of your turn you <em>can<\/em> (you&#8217;re not forced to do so) spend a Free Action to increase the Luminance Reservoir. If you do so, the area of light also increases. There is no mathematical relationship between the size of the light and number of points in the Luminance Reservoir, so you effectively need to track them as separate resources unless you want to do division on the fly. You also need to be very diligent to remember to take that Free Action every turn or you&#8217;re losing some of the spell&#8217;s effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"travel\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=30\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Travel<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Agile Feet is only situationally useful and immediately becomes less useful when you get Traveler&#8217;s Transit and can give yourself a fly speed, but Traveler&#8217;s Transit is easy access to short-duration flight, providing a massive tactical advantage with an easily renewable cost. Taken as a pair, both spells solve the issue of movement for melee builds who are most frequently inhibited by things like difficult terrain and enemies being out of reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spell: Agile Feet<\/span>: Situational by\n\tdesign, this allows you to move through difficult terrain unimpeded and since\n\tyou can Stride or Step using the same Action which you spend to cast the\n\tspell, it&#8217;s a great way to quickly navigate difficult terrain without cutting\n\tinto your action economy. But at the same time, difficult terrain doesn&#8217;t\n\tappear in every encounter, so you can&#8217;t guarantee that this will be\n\tconsistently useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Domain Spell: Traveler&#8217;s Transit<\/span>:\n\tMove speeds that last long enough to get past an obstacle or get through\n\tcombat. You get flight pretty quickly after getting access to this, and unlike\n\tmany spells which provide flight (like the Fly spell) you don&#8217;t need to Sustain\n\tthe spell, leaving your Actions free to focus on something more fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"trickery\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=31\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trickery<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudden Shift is amazing. If you stopped there, you&#8217;ll be very happy with the results.

There&#8217;s a lot of nuance\n\there that you&#8217;ll likely need to experiment with to really master. For example:\n\tyou place the illusion within 100 ft. of the target in a place that\n\t<em>the target<\/em> can see, but you&#8217;re not required to be able to see that\n\tspace. That allows you to place the illusion around corners, but you need to\n\tbe careful not to accidently place it inside a wall or something<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In combat, you can use this to try to draw the target&#8217;s attacks toward the illusion. If they roll poorly on the initial save they may be totally convinced that they&#8217;re attacking the real version of you, and might spend quite a few Actions (and possibly spells or other limited resources) uselessly attacking the illusion. But the target gets an additional save every time they interact with the illusion, so if they&#8217;re making multiple Strikes they&#8217;ll eventually pass the save and disbelieve the illusion. You also need to be cautious not to take any action which &#8220;doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8221;, which is vague enough that it may cause trouble. Try to stick to actions which don&#8217;t have effects that directly emanate from your space, and avoid touching or striking other creatures. That means no rays or projectiles, no attacking adjacent creatures, no touch-range spells, etc. You may need to stick to things like dodging or using spells and special abilities which don&#8217;t have an obvious visible seffect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of combat, this is a great way to have a conversation with a creature who might respond with hostility. Even if they roll a Critical Success on the initial save, they still see and hear the illusion until they interact with it. That will at least buy you some time to say hello. The illusion mimics your actions, which conveniently includes speech, so you get a full minute to converse with the target and if they try to stab you or fireball you or something you&#8217;re safe since they&#8217;re attacking an illusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"truth\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=32\" class=\"rating-red\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Truth<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Too situational and too ineffective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Domain Spell: Word of Truth<\/span>: Incredibly\n\tsituational.

This allows you to easily\n\tprovide those special weapon materials in situations where you need them\n\twithout the up-front cost and the guess-work of purchasing or crafting such a\n\tweapon. The 1-minute duration is usually enough to get through a fight, and\n\tthe 1-Action casting time is a low cost, so as long as the Touch range isn&#8217;t a\n\tproblem this is a great way to get an advantage against foes weak to specific\n\tmetals<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Precious Metal specifies that it can target weapons, armor, or up to 1 Bulk of metal material (which is enough to affect a shield). However, while the spell&#8217;s description explains how this affects weapons (&#8220;An item transmuted in this way deals damage according to its new material.&#8221;), it doesn&#8217;t specify how it affects armor or shields affected by Precious Metal. It also makes no mention of &#8220;grade&#8221;, so it&#8217;s unclear how armor and shields affected by Precious Metal work. As a GM, I would rule that it changes the item to standard grade of the chosen type of metal, and then maintains the same proportion of its current hit points when changes material. This requires a little bit of math when you transform the item and when it transforms back, but it feels like a fair way to handle the subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"zeal\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Domains.aspx?ID=37\" class=\"rating-orange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zeal<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Weapon Surge is really disappointing and becomes gradually less effective as you gain levels because it doesn&#8217;t scale in any way.
