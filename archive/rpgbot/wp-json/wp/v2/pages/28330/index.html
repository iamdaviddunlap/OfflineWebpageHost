However, the subclass&#8217;s spell list is poor, and some of the other features are only useful against those foes, so big parts of the subclass may go unused in most situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oath of Devotion Spells<\/span>: A few gems, but\n\t\tmuch of the list is only situationally useful.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1<\/span>: Two excellent defensive buffs\n\t\t\t\twhich will be useful throughout your career.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Aid is a nice buff, but Zone\n\t\t\t\tof Truth is only situationally useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 3<\/span>: I would almost almost never\n\t\t\t\tuse Beacon of Hope in combat (especially since you have Lay on Hands,\n\t\t\t\twhich Beacon of Hope doesn&#8217;t affect) unless you need the Advantage\n\t\t\t\tportion of the spell. Paladins don&#8217;t have enough spell slots to spend\n\t\t\t\tthem on Dispel Magic unless your party is truly desperate.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 4<\/span>: Freedom of Movement is\n\t\t\t\tsituational but very powerful. Guardian of Faith is passable area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol, but it&#8217;s a spell that you cast for the 8-hour duration, not for\n\t\t\t\tthe pitiful amount of damage.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 5<\/span>: Commune is a very powerful\n\t\t\t\tdivination if you&#8217;re clever enough to ask useful questions. Flame Strike\n\t\t\t\tgives Paladins a much-needed option for handling crowds of weak enemies,\n\t\t\t\tespecially those which aren&#8217;t affected by Turn Whatever. However, at\n\t\t\t\tthis level Flame Strike&#8217;s damage will be underwhelming and unless you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tbuilt around Blessed Warrior your spell save DC will probably be too low\n\t\t\t\tto make Flame Strike Reliable.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sacred Weapon<\/span>: Adding your Charisma as an\n\t\tadditional attack bonus on top of Strength or Dexterity means that your\n\t\tattacks are exceptionally accurate. Changing your weapon damage to Radiant\n\t\tallows you to easily bypass damage resistances.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>With two uses of Channel Divinity per Short or Long Rest and a 10-minute\n\t\t\tduration for Sacred Weapon, you can afford to use Sacred Weapon in nearly\n\t\t\tevery encounter. If your party typically follows the Adventuring Day\n\t\t\tadvice in the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide (6-8 encounters, 2 Short Rests), you\n\t\t\tmay need to fit multiple encounters into the 10-minute duration until you\n\t\t\tget 3 uses of Channel Divinity at level 11.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The additional attack bonus offsets leaving your Strength\/Dexterity low\n\t\t\tin order to focus on your Charisma, allowing you to focus on Charisma\n\t\t\tfirst without relying on Blessed Warrior. This may be worthwhile to\n\t\t\tsupport Aura of Protection and to make your spellcasting more effective,\n\t\t\tbut it does come at the cost of effectiveness offensively.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Devotion<\/span>: Situational by design,\n\t\tbut Charm effects are common and frequently dangerous. Many effects will\n\t\tcharm a target and apply other nasty effects while the targets is charmed.\n\t\tAura of Devotion blocks those effects.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Smite of Protection<\/span>: +2 AC and +2 to\n\t\tDexterity saves for your whole party for one round. A nice buff, but it\n\t\tencourages you to smite every turn and burn through all of your spell slots\n\t\tin a hurry.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"20\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Holy Nymbus<\/span>: Activated as a Bonus Action\n\t\tand lasts 10 minutes. This is only usable once per day, but you can recharge\n\t\tit at the cost of 1 of your 2 level 5 spell slots.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Ward<\/span>: Only Situationally useful\n\t\t\t\tsince it affects so few creature types.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Radiant Damage<\/span>: At this level your\n\t\t\t\tProficiency Bonus is +6, and you might have 20 Charisma. 11 automatic\n\t\t\t\tdamage is good, especially in a crowded fight.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Sunlight<\/span>: Very rarely matters. Some\n\t\t\t\tcreatures like drow and vampires are affected by sunlight, but they&#8217;re a\n\t\t\t\tvanishingly small portion of the creatures in the game.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"glory\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath of Glory<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Oath of Glory gives you several useful options both in and out of combat. In combat, you&#8217;re unusually durable thanks to Inspiring Smite and Glorious Defense. Outside of combat, you&#8217;re the only Paladin that can cast Enhance ability, giving you great options to support your skills. Unfortunately, the subclass features and spell options vary wildly in effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspiring Smite<\/span>: A decent number of\n\t\tTemporary Hit Points. While you&#8217;ll usually hoard them for yourself, the\n\t\tability to share them with allies offers a fantastic tactical option. Keep\n\t\tin mind that you need to use Divine Smite before you can activate this, so\n\t\tbe sure to keep a spell slot ready so that you can smite something and\n\t\ttrigger Inspiring Smite.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The Temporary Hit Points don&#8217;t have a specified expiration, so they last\n\t\t\tuntil creatures take a Long Rest. If you&#8217;re able to maintain your own pad\n\t\t\tof THP, you can gradually build up THP on each of your allies throughout\n\t\t\tan adventuring day.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath of Glory Spells<\/span>: A good mix of\n\t\tcombat buffs and non-combat utilities, as well as a handful of damage\n\t\toptions.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 1<\/span>: Guiding Bolt is hard\n\t\t\t\tbecause paladins generally can&#8217;t invest enough in Charisma to be good at\n\t\t\t\tspell attacks. You likely won&#8217;t cast it often, but it is still a decent\n\t\t\t\tranged attack spell if you&#8217;re out of melee range. Heroism is a great\n\t\t\t\tdefensive option. At the early levels where the fear immunity is\n\t\t\t\thelpful, your Charisma will be too low for good temp HP, and the high\n\t\t\t\tlevels where the temp HP isn&#8217;t relevant, you&#8217;re immune to fear.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Enhance Ability is just an\n\t\t\t\tall-around great spell outside of combat, though your most likely use\n\t\t\t\tcase in combat is for Strength, and you can use Peerless Athlete for\n\t\t\t\tthat, so save Enhance Ability for outside of combat when you need things\n\t\t\t\tlike Advantage on Charisma checks in social situations. Magic Weapon is\n\t\t\t\tgreat if you don&#8217;t have a permanent magic weapon, but it requires\n\t\t\t\tConcentration so generally you&#8217;ll want to cast something else unless you\n\t\t\t\tabsolutely need this.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3<\/span>: Two fantastic buffs, but both\n\t\t\t\trequire Concentration.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 4<\/span>: We&#8217;re unlikely to have the\n\t\t\t\tCharisma to make Compulsion reliable, and the effect is not that useful.\n\t\t\t\tCompelling targets to run away in a direction and using our\n\t\t\t\tConcentration just makes fights take longer than they need to. Freedom\n\t\t\t\tof Movement is great, but only situationally useful. Fortunately, it\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t require Concentration, and you can share it with your steed.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 5<\/span>: Legend Lore is a great way\n\t\t\t\tto get plot information, but you won&#8217;t use it consistently. Yolande&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tRegal Presence is very similar to Spirit Guardians, but trades much of\n\t\t\t\tthe damage to knock creatures prone. Use it to attack prone enemies.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Peerless Athlete<\/span>: Extremely situational.\n\t\tAthletics and Acrobatics are borderline useless. You might get some use out\n\t\tof longer jump distances if you&#8217;re able to jump over difficult terrain.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Alacrity<\/span>: A nice improvement to\n\t\tyour party&#8217;s mobility.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glorious Defense<\/span>: This is a fantastic\n\t\tdefensive ability, combining the AC bonus of the spell Shield with a free\n\t\tcounterattack. Be sure to grab a throwable weapon or a weapon with Reach to\n\t\tenjoy the effect to its fullest.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"20\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Living Legend<\/span>: Two fantastic combat buffs,\n\t\tplus Advantage on Charisma checks for some reason. Activated as a Bonus\n\t\tAction and lasts 10 minutes. This is only usable once per day, but you can\n\t\trecharge it at the cost of 1 of your 2 level 5 spell slots.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Charismatic<\/span>: Don&#8217;t be tempted to use\n\t\t\t\tthis for Charisma checks in social situations. You can cast Enhance\n\t\t\t\tAbility for that.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saving Throw Reroll<\/span>: With Aura of\n\t\t\t\tProtection you have a decent chance to pass any save. Adding a reroll\n\t\t\t\tevery round is fantastic.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unerring Strike<\/span>: Paladins only get two\n\t\t\t\tattacks (unless you&#8217;re using two-weapon fighting), so this makes it very\n\t\t\t\tlikely that all of your attacks will hit.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancients\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath of the Ancients<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Ranger of Paladins, Oath of the Ancients shares a lot of style and\n\toptions with Rangers and Druids. It includes magical options for crowd control\n\tand area control which most paladins can&#8217;t match, as well as access to Misty\n\tStep so that you can move about unhindered. The options are definitely\n\tinteresting, but there are big weak points in the subclass&#8217;s spell list and\n\tmany of the features may go long periods without having an impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: An AOE restrain effect\n\t\tthat you can use multiple times per Short or Long Rest. This is absolutely\n\t\tfantastic at any level. Unfortunately, many creatures have high Strength\n\t\tsave, but that&#8217;s not universal.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oath of the Ancients Spells<\/span>: About half\n\t\tof the options on the list are bad, but you generally get one viable option\n\t\tfrom each pair of spells.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 1<\/span>: Speak With Animals is only\n\t\t\t\tuseful as your DM decides it will be. Ensnaring Strike is a great option\n\t\t\t\tfor a bunch of reasons, and works very similarly to a smite. Use it to\n\t\t\t\tensnare a target, then let them bleed out a bit while you&#8217;re off dealing\n\t\t\t\twith more pressing issues. Note that after the initial save it&#8217;s a\n\t\t\t\tStrength <em>Check<\/em> (not a Save), so even creatures proficient in\n\t\t\t\tStrength Saves will have trouble escaping. Even better, the damage\n\t\t\t\tscales linearly with spell level, so it remains an excellent go-to use\n\t\t\t\tfor a spell slot for your whole career.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Moonbeam is difficult to use\n\t\t\t\tunless you can restrain a creature inside its effect long enough to\n\t\t\t\tjustify the spell slot (Grapple them, for instance), and, even then,\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s better left to full spellcasters. Misty Step is a fantastic option\n\t\t\t\tand solves a lot of mobility issues, including pits, chasms, difficult\n\t\t\t\tterrain, walls of fire, and other nasty materials, enemies, etc. Misty\n\t\t\t\tStep to the BBEG and wave your sword in their face.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3<\/span>: Plant Growth is weirdly\n\t\t\t\teffective area control, and Protection From Energy is a fantastic and\n\t\t\t\tvery important defensive option.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 4<\/span>: Ice Storm is a frustrating\n\t\t\t\tcombination of not enough damage and too little area control. Stone Skin\n\t\t\t\tis an extremely good buff, but the 100gp component cost can add up\n\t\t\t\tquickly so you don&#8217;t want to cast it constantly.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 5<\/span>: Commune With Nature is a\n\t\t\t\tuseful divination, especially in unfamiliar areas, but Tree Stride is\n\t\t\t\textremely situational and totally useless if you&#8217;re not in a forest or\n\t\t\t\tjungle.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aura of Warding<\/span>: These damage types are\n\t\trare, but they&#8217;re also frequently used to bypass damage resistances to\n\t\tcommon damage types, and resistance to them is rare. Sharing resistance with\n\t\tyour whole party can be great protection against enemies like Aberrations,\n\t\tCelestials, and Undead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Undying Sentinel<\/span>: Good insurance in case\n\t\tthings go badly. If you hit this, use Lay on Hands to heal yourself as much\n\t\tas you can manage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"20\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elder Champion<\/span>: Activated as a Bonus\n\t\tAction and lasts just 1 minute.

Between the\n\tPaladin&#8217;s natural durability and Oath of Vengeance&#8217;s capacity for killing\n\tstuff, they&#8217;re a great standalone character. However, they also have no\n\tfeatures beyond the Paladin&#8217;s core features to assist your allies, so your\n\tparty may need a secondary Defender to fill in when you&#8217;re off smiting\n\tthings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath of Vengeance Spells<\/span>: Most of the\n\t\tspells are good on their own, but depend on a high Spell Save DC that you\n\t\talmost certainly don&#8217;t have.

Hunter&#8217;s Mark is a nice damage boost against a\n\t\t\t\tsingle high-priority target, but its usefulness is limited by the\n\t\t\t\tPaladin&#8217;s low number of attacks per round. It can still yield\n\t\t\t\tconsiderably more damage than spending the same spell slot on Divine\n\t\t\t\tSmite, but only if you can maintain Concentration.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Paralysis is an off-switch\n\t\t\t\tfor an enemy, but since your spell DC is low compared to a full\n\t\t\t\tspellcaster, Hold Person is unreliable. Misty Step is a great way to\n\t\t\t\tget around the battlefield, especially since it&#8217;s a Bonus Action to\n\t\t\t\tcast.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3<\/span>: Haste and Protection From\n\t\t\t\tEnergy are two of the most important buffs in the game.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 4<\/span>: Both situational options,\n\t\t\t\tand the appeal of Dimension Door is reduced because you already have\n\t\t\t\tMisty Step, and you don&#8217;t have the Spell Save DC to make Banishment\n\t\t\t\treliable offensively.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 5<\/span>: Hold Monster makes Hold\n\t\t\t\tPerson redundant, but your Spell Save DC may still be behind full\n\t\t\t\tspellcasters even at this high level. Scrying is very situational, and\n\t\t\t\tyour full caster allies have had it for a very long time by this\n\t\t\t\tlevel.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vow of Enmity<\/span>: Easy Advantage, provided\n\t\tthat you don&#8217;t need to switch targets. You&#8217;ll want to focus on eliminating\n\t\tone target at a time and quickly move through your enemies.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>With two uses of Channel Divinity per Short or Long Rest and a 1-minute\n\t\t\tduration for Vow of Enmity, you can afford to use Sacred Weapon in most\n\t\t\tencounters, but, depending on how your party paces an adventuring day, you\n\t\t\tmay need to save it for more difficult encounters.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Advantage is fairly easy to get in the 2024 DnD 5e rules, but options\n\t\t\tlike Shove and Topple weapons typically require setup before you get\n\t\t\tAdvantage. Vow of Enmity lets you get right to work, and you don&#8217;t need to\n\t\t\tworry about your target standing or anything else.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless Avenger<\/span>: The best part of the\n\t\tSentinel feat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul of Vengeance<\/span>: A fantastic way to get\n\t\tan extra attack each round. You probably don&#8217;t even need a reach weapon to\n\t\tkeep your target in reach because you&#8217;re hitting with Opportunity Attacks\n\t\treliably thanks to Advantage, and then you&#8217;re holding them in place with\n\t\tRelentless Avenger. It&#8217;s basically an even better version of the Sentinel\n\t\tfeat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"20\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Avenging Angel<\/span>: Activated as a Bonus\n\t\tAction and lasts 10 minutes. This is only usable once per day, but you can\n\t\trecharge it at the cost of 1 of your 2 level 5 spell slots.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flight<\/span>: For most Paladins, this will\n\t\t\t\tdouble your speed. With a 10-minute duration, you have enough time and\n\t\t\t\tmobility to chase enemies.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Frightful Aura<\/span>: Frightened is already\n\t\t\t\ta major debuff. Granting Advantage on attacks to hit the targets is just\n\t\t\t\tmean. The Frightened effects and early if the target takes damage, but\n\t\t\t\tGrapple and Shove notably don&#8217;t deal damage, so you have some great\n\t\t\t\toptions to make enemies&#8217; lives even worse before you resort to actually\n\t\t\t\tdamaging them.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Paladin&#8217;s subclass doesn&#8217;t do a lot to change the mechanics of the class, but it does a lot to define your theme.
