From a design perspective, it&#8217;s an excellent subclass. The theme and the mechanics align perfectly, and the whole thing has a nice spooky feel (which makes sense considering the sourcebook that it came from). The subclass also handles complexity well, introducing few additional resources to track while also making those resources useful and exciting, and gradually adding complexity to the subclass as the player gains levels. This gradual ramp in complexity makes the Undead approachable for new players and players who don&#8217;t handle resource management well, but still includes enough buttons to press that veteran players will find the subclass exciting and impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the Undead&#8217;s subclass features work when combined with Eldritch Blast. Form of Dread is the signature feature of the subclass, and it&#8217;s a powerful boost to your attacks right from level 1, supporting either Eldritch Blast builds or weapon builds. Later features like Grave Touched gradually add additional benefits to attacks alongside defensive benefits like damage resistance and on-hit healing. However, Form of Dread has a limited usage pool, so, once you&#8217;re out of uses, you&#8217;ll need to fall back on core Warlock class features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Undead grants temporary hit points when you activate Form of Dread, the Undead can be more durable than most warlocks. This, combined with the damage boost from Grave Touched, is enough to support weapon-using builds, but doesn&#8217;t make melee an easy choice like the Hexblade does. A greataxe could add a second d12 of damage when you hit with it once on each of your turns, which is a significant boost to damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grave Touched&#8217;s damage boost is less useful with common weapon-using warlock builds like Crossbow Expert where you&#8217;re using a weapon with a small damage die and counting on multiple attacks, and your temporary hit points won&#8217;t last long in light armor with no shield. Once you get Spirit Projection, the damage resistance helps, but, since you need to maintain Concentration, it can be hard to stay in melee with a weapon in hand. More likely you&#8217;ll use a heavy crossbow via Improved Pact Weapon. As much as I would like it, firearms are off limits unless you find a magic one due to the weapon limitations of Pact of the Blade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Undead Warlock Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Undead Warlock Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Undead Warlock Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Undead Warlock Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Undead Warlock Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Undead Warlock Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Undead Warlock Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Build &#8211; Ghosts with Guns<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Both spells scale with spell level, which is a great\n\t\t\t\toption for the Warlock, but they&#8217;re still not good enough options that I\n\t\t\t\twould rush to cast them. False Life cast using a spell does notably\n\t\t\t\tallow you to produce temporary hit points right before taking a Short\n\t\t\t\tRest, so you could finish a Long Rest, cast False Life, then immediately\n\t\t\t\tshort rest and have a big pile of temporary hp. You can also get\n\t\t\t\ttemporary hit points from Form of Dread, so even with this abuse case it\n\t\t\t\tmay be hard to justify spending a spell known to get False Life.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\t\t\tgood and cover different use cases. Blindness\/Deafness targets\n\t\t\t\tConstitution saves and adds additional targets with spell level, so it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tgood for low-Constitution targets like spellcasters and for crowds.\n\t\t\t\tPhantasmal Force targets Intelligence and is single-target, so it&#8217;s good\n\t\t\t\tfor single enemies with poor Intelligence (most martial foes).<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\t\t\tonly situationally useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\t\t\texcellent. Death Ward is a powerul defensive buff, and with an 8-hour\n\t\t\t\tduration you can use all of your spell slots to cast it one multiple\n\t\t\t\tmembers of your party, then immediately take a Short Rest to regain your\n\t\t\t\tspell slots and get right back to adventuring. Greater Invisibility is\n\t\t\t\tan absolutely fantastic spell for many reasons, but Shadow of\n\t\t\t\tMoil may be more appealing in combat.\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Both decent\n\t\t\t\toptions. Antilife Shell can make it easy to corner and eliminate foes\n\t\t\t\twith limited reach and no ranged options. Cloudkill is decent, but\n\t\t\t\tHunger of Hadar will frequently be both easier to use and more\n\t\t\t\teffective.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Form of Dread<\/span>: A great combat buff, and, as\n\t\tyou add subclass features, you&#8217;ll gain additional benefits. At this level it\n\t\tadds temporary hp (the temporary hit points expire when Form of Dread ends\n\t\tsince you get them &#8220;while transformed&#8221;) and the ability to make the target\n\t\tFrightened of you, allowing you to repeatedly debuff one creature per turn.\n\t\tThe target does get a save, and, weirdly, the text doesn&#8217;t specify a save DC,\n\t\tso I assume that it uses your spell save DC like everything else.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>With a Bonus Action activation time, it&#8217;s easy to turn this on when you\n\t\t\tneed it without cutting into your Eldritch Blast time. Since it grants\n\t\t\ttemporary hit points and immunity to fear, it&#8217;s a great option after\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ve taken damage or if you&#8217;re currently Frightened (becoming immune to\n\t\t\ta condition removes the condition). If you&#8217;re not worried about those\n\t\t\tconditions, it&#8217;s great to activate it early in a fight to keep\n\t\t\tan enemy perpectually Frightened.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since your number of uses per day for Form of Dread is tied to your\n\t\t\tProficiency Bonus, you can technically use it back-to-back, reactivating\n\t\t\tit immediately after it expires, or using it in back-to-back encounters. I\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t recommend this until your Proficiency Bonus improves a bit,\n\t\t\totherwise you&#8217;ll get through the first few encounters in a day and find\n\t\t\tyourself short on resources.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Grave Touch<\/span>: While not using Form of\n\t\tDread, Grave Touch is minimally impactful. Changing the damage type of one\n\t\tattack per turn usually won&#8217;t make a big difference, especially if you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing Eldritch Blast (while necrotic damage isn&#8217;t as good as Force damage,\n\t\tit&#8217;s still one of the best damage types in the game). If you&#8217;re using a\n\t\tweapon, changing your damage type from slashing etc. to necrotic can help\n\t\tovercome common damage resistances to weapon damage types, but resistance to\n\t\tmagic weapon damage is almost non-existent, and with Improved Pact Weapon\n\t\tyou&#8217;re guaranteed to have a magic weapon if you&#8217;re building around Pact of\n\t\tthe Blade.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The improvement to Form of Dread is more significant. An additional\n\t\t\tdamage die once on one each of your turns is only a minor boost. An\n\t\t\textra d10 once per turn with Eldritch Blast is a reliable damage\n\t\t\timprovement to your DPR, especially as you add additional attacks because\n\t\t\tyou have more opportunities to apply the once-per-turn damage boost, but\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s still only 1d10 per turn. The damage boost is worded as &#8220;extra\n\t\t\tdamage&#8221;, so it&#8217;s multiplied on critical hits like Divine Smite, Sneak\n\t\t\tAttack, and other similar damage boosts. Since you only benefit from this\n\t\t\tboost while using Form of Dread (which you can only use a few times per\n\t\t\tday), you&#8217;re working with core Warlock class features the rest of the\n\t\t\tday.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The ability to change an attack&#8217;s damage type once per turn appears to\n\t\t\taffect all of the attack&#8217;s damage types, so if you have multiple damage\n\t\t\ttypes, such as Force from Eldritch Blast and Fire from Spirit Shroud, you\n\t\t\twould change both damage types to Necrotic. Since this options is once per\n\t\t\tturn, you can also use it for Opportunity Attacks.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Necrotic Husk<\/span>: The damage resistance is\n\t\tnice, but necrotic damage isn&#8217;t especially common unless you&#8217;re facing a lot\n\t\tof undead enemies. The second half of the feature is more interesting: The\n\t\tdamage is decent, though not enough to win a fight, but the AOE is respectable, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s enough that you may be able to eliminate weakened foes. The 1d4-long-rests\ncooldown is odd, but probably not a problem unless you&#8217;re frequently\n\t\tbeing reduced to 0 hit points. If that&#8217;s the case, you should reconsider\n\t\tyour tactics. You&#8217;re not a Defender. The Exhaustion is annoying, but one\n\t\tlevel of Exhaustion is minimally impactful for most spellcasters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Projection<\/span>: Where Form of Dread is\n\t\ta dedicated combat buff with a small usage pool, Spirit Projection is a\n\t\tonce-per-day combination of defense, utility, and combat buff. It provides a\n\t\tcombination of exciting effects with a variety of uses, and combining Spirit\n\t\tProjection with Form of Dread can be exceptionally powerful.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While using Spirit Projection, you need to keep track of both your body\n\t\t\tand your spirit. Your spirit doesn&#8217;t duplicate your equipment, which I\n\t\t\tthink RAW means that your spirit is a spiritual projection of yourself in\n\t\t\tthe nude. Fortunately, I think you can loot your own body to get your\n\t\t\titems, though it&#8217;s not totally clear to me if that&#8217;s intentional. Just\n\t\t\tkeep in mind that you have a time limit, so it may save you time to strip\n\t\t\tyourself naked before activating Spirit Projection. Remember when facing\n\t\t\tinclement conditions like extreme cold, your spirit doesn&#8217;t get any sort\n\t\t\tof protection, so your body and your spirit may both need separate outfits\n\t\t\tto keep yourself from suffering the effects of the climate.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You don&#8217;t need to breath thanks to Grave Touch, so you can shove your\n\t\t\tbody into a bag of holding if you need a safe place to store it. If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tlow on hit points or otherwise need to get out of a bad spot, you can\n\t\t\tteleport back to your body to escape to safety.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While projected, you have resistance to weapon damage types, making you\n\t\t\texceptionally resilient. Combined with resistance to necrotic damage and\n\t\t\tpotentially damage resistances from other sources (your race, items, etc.)\n\t\t\tyou can be alarmingly durable for a warlock. However, you need to maintain\n\t\t\tConcentration to maintain Spirit Projection, and without proficiency in\n\t\t\tConstituton saves that&#8217;s a hard prospect even with damage resistances.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You effectively have a built-in spellcasting focus for Conjuration and\n\t\t\tNecromancy spells, though if you looted your body that&#8217;s probably not\n\t\t\timpactful. You can fly and move through objects similar to the Etheralness\n\t\t\tspell, allowing you to scout, inflitrate, and escape in ways that normally\n\t\t\trequire extremely high-level spells. With proficiency in Stealth, you can\n\t\t\tbe an extremely effective scout.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The final bullet provides a way to heal yourself by dealing damage, but\n\t\t\tit only works while combining both Spirit Projection and Form of Dread.\n\t\t\tYou heal for half of the necrotic damage dealt, so use Grave Touch to\n\t\t\tchange the damage type and add extra damage like Eldritch Smite if you\n\t\t\tneed more healing in a hurry. If you&#8217;re close to the end of Spirit Projection\n\t\t\tand you&#8217;re short on hit points, consider activating Form of Dread and digging\n\t\t\tout your bag of rats to give you easy targets to farm hit points.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Undead Warlock Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Undead Warlock Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Undead Warlock Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Undead Warlock Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Undead Warlock Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Undead Warlock Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#multiclassing\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Ghosts with Guns<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Form of Dread&#8217;s Fear effect, Grave Touched&#8217;s damage bonus, and Spirit Projection&#8217;s hp theft all depend on you hitting with attack rolls. This means that we have two build options: a Pact of the Blade build or yet another Eldritch Blast build. Even with Thirsting Blade and Crossbow Expert, Pact of the Blade&#8217;s number of attacks is outpaced by Eldritch Blast without relying on your Bonus Action which will frequently be used for Form of Dread or Hex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s try something super weird: We&#8217;re going to build around Gunner. Grave Touched provides an extra damage die once per turn, so a d10 weapon like a heavy crossbow or a d12 weapon like a musket is perfect. We can&#8217;t use a musket unless we find a magic one (even with the Gunner feat), but we want to be able to use ranged weapons effectively in melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, we could build yet another Eldritch Blast build, but that&#8217;s been done so many times that <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/#lets-talk-damage\">we&#8217;re literally using it as a formula<\/a> to show common DPR progressions. So, instead, we&#8217;re going to grab a heavy crossbow and try to do as much damage with a single hit as possible so that we can heal ourselves with Spirit Projection for an absurd amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we have all of our buffs running, our DPR easily exceeds an Eldritch Blast build from levels 4 through 20, but this build is extremely resource-hungry, relying on the Aasimar&#8217;s daily transformation, Form of Dread, Eldritch Smite, and potentially Spirit Shroud. You can still exceed the DPR of Eldritch Blast builds without the Aasimar transformation, but the gap isn&#8217;t as big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also requires us to largely neglect our spellcasting, so you&#8217;ll need to avoid spells that allow saving throws. Instead, look for buffs and utility options, but be cautious about spending spell slots since we&#8217;re relying on Eldritch Smite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, 5e has very few mechanics which further capitalize on the Frightened status condition. The only example I know of is <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/subclasses\/oath-of-conquest\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"7695\">Oath of Conquest<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll put our racial +2 into Dexterity and our +1 into Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Increased<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re leaning into a crazy idea here, so let&#8217;s go with a crazy race.

The MotM version will work, too, but Necrotic Shroud&#8217;s damage got a major nerf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drow Half-Elf is another strong contender here. Faerie Fire and Darkness as innate spells both provide additional sources of Advantage without cutting into our class resources, and access to Elven Accuracy is extremely tempting alongside Eldritch Smite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Not especially important to the build.

Form of Dread is a Bonus Action. Necrotic Shroud is an Action. We could reasonably use another Bonus Action buff at the start of our next turn, but if we already have Darkness running, there&#8217;s little reason to spend another spell slot just to get Advantage a different way or to reduce our accuracy in favor of a damage boost like Hex or Spirit Shroud.<br><br>Our Concentration also becomes a problem.
