Using a a few dice and some graph paper, you can construct a full dungeon with little manual intervention. While 3.5 and 5e both include rules for this, 4th editions rules were, in my opinion, the best for generating the actual structure of a dungeon. However, the mechanics presented in 4e lack details and versatility presented in the random dungeon and random encounters tables in the 3.5 DMG. By combining the two, we can create a useful, elegant, versatile dungeon generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system could be used in any system with a little adaptation. The dungeons could just as easily be a space hulk, the interior of some huge starship, the alleys of a crowded city, or the corridors of a mad scientist&#8217;s laboratory. All you really need to change is the room descriptions so that they fit your desired setting and feel.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"limiting-the-dungeon\">Limiting the Dungeon<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Depending on your ruleset, you may want to limit the size of your dungeon. It&#8217;s pretty common for randomly generated dungeons to run the course of a full character level. For 4th edition, this means 10 encounters. For 3.5, this means about 13 encounters plus change. For pathfinder, this means 13, 20, or 40 encounters depending on the game speed. Once you hit this point, stop generating new parts of the dungeon, and move on to step 3.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"entrance\">Step 1 &#8211; Entrance<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>For some reason, most random dungeon generators skip over the entrance, leaving the crucial question &#8220;how do we get in?&#8221;. The 4e DMG provides two pre-made entrance tiles complete with a staircase leading down into the dungeon, a few decorative touches, and a few doors and corridors to branch off into your new dungeon. Alternatively, you can use a random corridor or chamber from the tables below.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"generate\">Step 2 &#8211; Generate<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Start by attaching corridors to each of the exits from your entrance chamber. The heart of the generator is the Corridors table and the Chambers table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If any of the tables requires you to generate another item (door, corridor, etc.), it will be marked in <strong>bold<\/strong>. Corridors are 1 square wide by default.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"corridors\">Corridors<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you generate a corridor which runs into another corridor, end the new corridor by connecting it to the intersecting corridor. If the corrdiror hits a chamber, either add a new exit to the chamber, or move one of the unused exits to accomodate the corridor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>d20<\/th><th>Corridor<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><th>1<\/th><td>Straight 4 squares.

class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleanup\">Step 3 &#8211; Cleanup<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>These will inevitably be some dead ends, hanging corridors, and other weird odds and ends. Do your best to connect these where it makes sense, or just remove anything which isn&#8217;t adding to the dungeon. If you have an entire section of the dungeon which is a maze of dead ends, it should either be removed or you should make it make sense. In a cave, crevices in the rock might suddenly end. In a building, sections of the ceiling may have collapsed to block passages.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"populate\">Step 4 &#8211; Encounters<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The 4th edition rules have a bit of an advantage for generating random encounters. Because of the specifically denoted &#8220;roles&#8221; provided in the rules, you can build a diverse, balanced encounter by picking some random monsters with the right roles. By creating a &#8220;deck&#8221; of monsters, as detailed in the 4e DMG, you can generate all of the random encounters in a dungeon from a small library of level-appropriate monsters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most RPGs lack these specific monster roles, so replicating the 4e encounter deck is difficult in most other RPGs. Instead of creating an encounter deck with a grab-bag of monsters and traps, we can get the same sort of feel with a deck of pre-made encounters. These encounters can be any appropriate combination of traps and enemies that provides an appropriate challenge to the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because using monsters of all one power level can be very bland and because it limits our options, I recommend using a sort of bell curve of difficulties. The majority of the encounters should be the appropriate difficulty to provide an average challenge for the party. Roughly 20% of encounters should be difficult, and 20% should be easy. If you want to have a sort of &#8220;boss&#8221; encounter, add an additional encounter that&#8217;s exceptionally difficult, and consider reserving it for late in the dungeon.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"random-encounter-types\">Random Encounter Types<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>d10<\/th><th>Encounter Template<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><th>1-2<\/th><td>Battlefield Control<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>3-4<\/th><td>Commander and Troops<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>5-6<\/th><td>Dragon&#8217;s Den<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>7-8<\/th><td>Battle Lines<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>9-10<\/th><td>Wolf Pack<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battlefield-control\">Battlefield Control<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The key component of the Battlefield Control encounter is an enemy with the ability to limit where and how the part can move about the field. Spellcasters and similar monsters make excellent choices for this encounter type. The secondary component is small enemies to take advantage of the party&#8217;s lost mobility to deal damage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commander\">Commander<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>These encounters feature a single &#8220;commander&#8221; enemy, either an NPC of higher level than its troops, or a monster like an Aboleth or Mind Flayer which has minions of some sort. The troops typically do most of the fighting, but the commander is the real threat.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beasts-den\">Beast&#8217;s Den<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A solo monster on its home turf can be a terrifying threat. Pick something big, scary, and self-sufficient. Dragons are a good choice, as are Beholders, and other big, iconic monsters. Alternatively, a single enemy supported by environmental hazards or traps can be a good choice.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-lines\">Battle Lines<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>These encounters feature one or more melee enemies, and one or more ranged enemies. A party of enemy adventurers can be a great fit in this encounter type.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wolf-pack\">Wolf Pack<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A pack of weak enemies attempts to overwhelm the party by sheer numbers.
