Several of the feats have some changes from the tabletop version, but even for those that don\u2019t, differences in the base framework of the game mean that many feats are more or less powerful than someone who is very familiar with the tabletop game (i.e. many of our readers) might expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article then aims to present accurate ratings for each of these feats in the context of the video game.

These are less important than they are in the base game due to the abundance of magic items that provide you things like bonuses to attack rolls, damage rolls, and spell save DC. Consider not maxing out your primary stat if there are several feats that seem like good choices for your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"actor\">Actor<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Your Charisma increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Proficiency Bonus is also doubled for Deception and Performance checks.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While this feat is borderline useless in the TTRPG, this is both one of the only hybrid feats and gives an incredible benefit for social situations. Not mentioned in the feat is that it also gives you proficiency for those skills if you don&#8217;t have them already, so this is two proficiencies, two expertises, and a +1 to the relevant score in one feat. If you&#8217;re someone who likes lying to people about why you&#8217;re being sketchy, this is an incredible selection. I only wouldn&#8217;t take it on most paladins because lying frequently is a good way to break your oath (unless you&#8217;re into that sort of thing).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"alert\">Alert<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>You gain a +5 bonus to Initiative and can&#8217;t be Surprised.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This feat is broken, but you have to understand the game mechanics to get why. If you haven&#8217;t trolled through online discussions or game files, you&#8217;ll have no way to know that initiative is rolled with <em>d4+mod in this game<\/em> instead of the d20 used in the TTRPG. This means that the Alert feat basically guarantees the character will go first, which is extremely powerful for spellcasters who want to set up their big concentration tool for the encounter and melee defenders who want to get right up in the action before enemies act.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"athlete\">Athlete<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Your Strength or Dexterity increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are Prone, standing up uses significantly less movement. Your Jump distance also increases by 50%.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, one of the few hybrid feats but also surprisingly useful. There are many hidden areas and\/or puzzles in the game that reward the ability to jump long distances, and combining this with the jump potion, the characters who get Jump as a ritual, or the other items that increase jump distance can make those much easier. Additionally, jump is coded with a flat movement cost and can get you much more distance than that cost, making it very useful for positioning in combat. Highly recommended on any Strength or Dex-based character that attacks in melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"charger\">Charger<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Gain the following weapon attacks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Charger<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shove<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Because positioning is so critical in this game, we talk about several tools to help you do it better (optimizing for jump distance, wearing items that give casts of Misty Step, etc). If you managed to have none of those, this would still be bad. It means that, on a turn you have to dash, you can maybe still get one attack in you couldn\u2019t otherwise, but honestly, any character wanting that can just make a ranged attack on the way instead because swapping between melee and ranged weapons is free, as is drawing weapons to throw. That\u2019s not worth a feat, even though the movement doesn\u2019t provoke attacks of opportunity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"crossbow-expert\">Crossbow Expert<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>When you make crossbow attacks within melee range, the Attack Rolls do not have Disadvantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Piercing Shot also inflicts Gaping Wounds (Condition) for twice as long.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We often rate this feat blue and call it basically a requirement for anyone using crossbows. In the video game, however, the loading property doesn&#8217;t exist, which turns this feat into largely just one line about removing disadvantage. Given that there&#8217;s also no penalty or cost for swapping from your ranged to melee weapons (even multiple times in the same turn), this feat is only good if you have a crossbow that you think is vastly superior to your melee weapon(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"defensive-duelist\">Defensive Duelist<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>When you are attacked with a melee attack while wielding a Finesse Weapon you are Proficient in, you can use a Reaction to increase your Armour Class by your Proficiency Bonus, possibly causing the attack to miss.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Identical to the TTRPG version, and just as useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"dual-wielder\">Dual Wielder<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>You can use two-weapon fighting even if your weapons aren&#8217;t Light, and you gain a +1 bonus to Armour Class while wielding a melee weapon in each hand.

This game does not have an attunement mechanic, so a primary balancing mechanic is item slots. <strong>This feat lets you dual wield caster staves because they are Versatile.<\/strong> This feat should be what you take on every ranged caster at level 12 because you will presumably have at least two good staves by then. I have confirmed that you get the stats of both on Gale in my own playthrough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"dungeon-delver\">Dungeon Delver<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>You gain Advantage on Perception checks made to detect hidden objects and on Saving Throws made to avoid or resist traps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You gain Resistance to the damage dealt by traps.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Functionally identical to the TTRPG version given that speed doesn&#8217;t factor into passive checks in the video game version. Not especially helpful in either case. Every member of your party automatically gets to roll Perception to detect hidden objects, so by the sheer volume of rolls you\u2019re likely to detect most things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"durable\">Durable<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Constitution increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regain full Hit Points every time you take a Short Rest.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Better in the video game version, but still not great. If you have a short rest-focused party, it can be very good as a way to reduce the healing load. On the other hand, you only get two short rests per long rest, so it won&#8217;t be as impactful as often as it could be in the TTRPG where 2 short rests per long rests is a vague suggestion rather than a firm rule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"elemental-adept\">Elemental Adept<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Your spells ignore Resistance to a damage type of your choice.

The game mechanics reward damage output much more than any save-or-suck, because there aren&#8217;t any good spells that just kill people. Given that, doing more damage is powerful for casters, and, given itemization, there&#8217;s a couple possibilities for being very strong while being specialized into one damage type. This is even better for people wanting to deal Acid damage as the smaller die is more valuable for the &#8220;cannot roll a 1&#8221; clause which is better than just the reroll in the TTRPG version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"great-weapon-master\">Great Weapon Master<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>When an attack with a melee weapon lands a Critical Hit or kills a creature, you can make another melee weapon attack as a Bonus Action that turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When attacking with a Two-Handed or Versatile melee weapon (in both hands) that you are Proficient with, Attack Rolls take a -5 penalty, but their damage increases by 10.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as good and build-defining as it is in the TTRPG. Arguably even better since there are more ways to increase your attack bonus, meaning the increased damage is easier to apply and results in a higher DPR increase than your pen and paper character would get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"heavily-armoured\">Heavily Armoured<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>(Requires Medium Armour Proficiency)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increase your Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gain Proficiency with Heavy Armour.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow even worse. With respecs being mostly free, multiclassing not having stat requirements, heavy armor having no speed penalty, and with the limited number of feats due to the level cap being 12, your best bet is to just take your first level in one of the Clerics that gets heavy armor, or Fighter if you want proficiency in Constitution saves. No class gets anything impactful at level 12, so all you&#8217;re missing out on is a feat, which if you&#8217;re spending on proficiencies, is wasted when you could also be getting all the level 1 features of some other class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"heavy-armour-master\">Heavy Armour Master<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>(Requires Heavy Armour Proficiency)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Increase your Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incoming damage from non-magical attacks also decreases by 3 while you&#8217;re wearing heavy armour.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Identical to the TTRPG version, but possibly more useful.

This feat removes that penalty, and provides the signature power attack feature it&#8217;s known for. Also missing, however, is the fact that the TTRPG version removes the disadvantage you get for attacking at long range, which is painful because that mechanic exists in the video game, weapon ranges are reduced compared to the TTRPG rules, and Disadvantage can prevent sneak attacks from a distance. Now, they also made standard and long ranges generously close together so it matters less, but it still hurts to see and downgrades this feat to green.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"shield-master\">Shield Master<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity Saving Throws when wielding a Shield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a Spell forces you to make a Dexterity Saving Throw, you can use your Reaction to shield yourself and diminish the effect&#8217;s damage.On a failed save, you only take half damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a successful save, you don&#8217;t take any damage, even if you normally would.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>They buffed the defensive part of the feat to counter the fact that they removed the feature everyone took it for.
