You could arguably also add Face to that list thanks to Charm Person, but Charm Person won&#8217;t fix 8 Charisma and no skills. Beyond that, you&#8217;re free to do as you please with all of the Cleric&#8217;s other capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the 2024 Trickery Domain Cleric.

Fantastic and reliable.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Invoke Duplicity<\/span>: This can be difficult\n\t\tto use effectively, but once you get your head around it, it&#8217;s very potent.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The best use case is to put the illusion somewhere visible while you&#8217;re\n\t\t\thidden nearby and use the illusion as the origin point of your short-range\n\t\t\tspells. Options like Word of Radiance are much safer when you can walk\n\t\t\tyour illusion into a crowd of enemies to cast it, and, since the illusion\n\t\t\tisn&#8217;t a creature, it&#8217;s not worried about things like Opportunity Attacks,\n\t\t\tarea control effects, or even enemy creatures blocking spaces.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can use the illusion to get yourself Advantage in melee, but I&#8217;m\n\t\t\tnervous to recommend capitalizing on that as a go-to tactic. Weapon\n\t\t\tattacks aren&#8217;t a great option for Clerics. Easy access to Advantage may\n\t\t\tmake weapons viable compared to cantrips, especially with Divine Strike,\n\t\t\tbut don&#8217;t let that compel you to build around melee. This notably applies\n\t\t\tto all attacks, so you can deliver spells like Inflict Wounds and\n\t\t\tSpiritual Weapon with Advantage.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you&#8217;re happy using your illusory double as a distraction and as a\n\t\t\tcourier for your spells, you can totally ignore the Advantage part of\n\t\t\tInvoke Duplicity and you&#8217;ll still do just fine.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The wording of the ability allows you to place the illusion and\n\t\t\tmove it around in the air. This may be helpful for targeting spells with\n\t\t\tless concerns about cover, or for targeting flying enemies.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Strangely, Invoke Duplicity doesn&#8217;t offer details on how to handle\n\t\t\tinteraction with the illusory double. What happens if the illusion is\n\t\t\tattacked? Can creatures disbelieve it, and if they do so, how do they then\n\t\t\tperceive the illusion? If creatures are aware that the double is an\n\t\t\tillusion, do you still get Advantage on attacks when you and your double\n\t\t\tare adjacent to a creature?

Nondetection is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but it does protect stealthy characters like the\n\t\t\t\tTrickery Cleric from magical detection.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 7 Spells<\/span>: Confusion sucks, but\n\t\t\t\tteleportation is great.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 9 Spells<\/span>: Modify Memory is very\n\t\t\t\tsituational, but Dominate Person is a great way to turn a powerful\n\t\t\t\thumanoid enemy into a fun pet for up to a minute.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trickster&#8217;s Transposition<\/span>: Teleportation\n\t\tlike this can be very powerful, allowing you to move around easily in combat\n\t\tand to get around obstacles outside of combat by flying your duplicate to\n\t\twherever you want to go, then switching places with it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><strong>Improved Duplicity<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shared Distraction<\/span>: You no longer need\n\t\t\t\tto be in melee with the target to benefit, and now your allies also\n\t\t\t\tbenefit.

High-five Loki, Shar, and Tzeentch, I guess, then get back to adventuring.<br><br>Invoke Duplicity immediately becomes a central tactic for us. The Advantage on melee attacks benefit is near, but won&#8217;t be especially useful since we don&#8217;t have any interesting melee attack options. We&#8217;ll need to avoid Spiritual Weapon since the two options both consume our Bonus Action.<br><br>Your go-to combat tactic is to walk your duplicate into crowds of enemies and use Word of Radiance. Against single enemies, save Invoke Duplicity and hit them with single-target spells.<br><br>We&#8217;re also really good at Stealth now. We don&#8217;t have Expertise, but Expertise can&#8217;t match the +10 from Pass Without Trace, plus we get easy Advantage from Blessing of the Trickster. If you need to bring your party along, consider putting Blessing of the Trickster on the least sneaky person in your party to avoid getting the whole party caught because one guy insisted on plate armor.<br><br>At this level we now have Detect Magic available from our species.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: War Caster (Wis 17 -&gt; 18)<br>New Cantrip:<br>&#8211; Sacred Flame<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>War Caster will help us maintain Concentration on important spells like Spirit Guardians.

Hypnotic Pattern will let you save-or-suck an entire encounter, but sometimes you need to resort to damage by turning yourself into a blender.<br><br>At this level we now have Misty Step available from our species.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Trickster&#8217;s Transposition<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Trickster&#8217;s Transposition improved Invoke Duplicity. At your least creative, you can use it to move around. You&#8217;re free to move your duplicate into the air, so you can use Trickster&#8217;s Transposition to reach difficult locations up to 120 feet away. But we can do better.<br><br>In most cases, creatures have no mechanism to identify the duplicate until they interact with it unless you&#8217;re doing something to obviously distinguish yourself from the duplicate. If you&#8217;re leaning into this, talk to your DM about keeping the answer secret from the DM, such as by keeping the answer on a face-down slip of paper. Whenever you move the duplicate, reconsider the answer and turn the paper face down. This will help your DM to play the monsters realistically, and it could be a lot of fun for both sides of the table.<br><br>We can also use our duplicate as a drone to drive Spirit Guardians around. It can fly, it can&#8217;t be harmed, and it can&#8217;t provoke opportunity attacks because it&#8217;s not a creature (which raises some rules questions on its own). Combine with Invoke Duplicity, we can move into position, use our Bonus Action to swap places, then use our duplicate&#8217;s 30 feet of movement to walk through a crowd of enemies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/divine-strike-and-primal-strike\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"29949\">Blessed Strikes<\/a><br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Any<br>&#8211; Confusion*<br>&#8211; Dimension Door*<\/td><td>Blessed Strikes presents an interesting choice. The answer is nearly always Potent Spellcasting, but our article <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/divine-strike-and-primal-strike\/\">comparing the two options<\/a> doesn&#8217;t take account of Advantage. Of the listed options, combining True Strike and Divine Strike comes the closest to matching Toll the Dead and Potent Spellcasting. If we assume that Toll the Dead works 65% of the time, Advantage makes True Strike+Divine Strike more damaging than cantrips with Potent Spellcasting.<br><br>But that assumes that you can get Advantage. Invoke Duplicity makes that very easy.<br><br>If you don&#8217;t go for Divine Strike, Potent Spellcasting works very well with Word of Radiance. Cast Spirit Guardians from your duplicate&#8217;s space, pilot them into crowds, and nuke things with Word of Radiance. It&#8217;s a good time.<br><br>We&#8217;ve had Misty Step for a while, but now we add Dimension Door as a third teleportation option.
