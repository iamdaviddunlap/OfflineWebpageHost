With access to any skill,\n\texpertise, and full spellcasting, the Bard can fill essentially every role in\n\tthe party. Subclasses like College of Lore are more of the classic support\n\tBard, with improved magical options and support abilities, while College of\n\tSwords and College of Valor can serve as front-line melee characters who can\n\tbring their spellcasting and support capabilities into the heat of battle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because bards can do so much within a single class, they can fill nearly any\n\trole within a party. Their open skill options, Expertise, and buff spells\n\tallow them to thrive as a Face and a Scout, while their spellcasting makes\n\tthem effective Controllers and Support casters. The Bard&#8217;s biggest\n\tdeficiencies are damage output and durability, so it&#8217;s hard to build them as a\n\tBlaster, Defender, or Striker, but even that isn&#8217;t impossible. Subclasses like\n\tCollege of Dance can expand these rolls by changing the Bard&#8217;s playstyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being themed around music and performance, Bards have nearly no\n\tmechanics related to performing. You don&#8217;t need the Performance skill, and,\n\tother than using them as a spellcasting focus, you don&#8217;t need musical\n\tinstruments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD 5e rules.

No longer a limited number of spells. From level 10 onward you can pick spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, including when you retrain spells that you already knew. No more Paladin\/Ranger\/Warlock spells.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>18: Superior Inspiration. Moved from level 20, and it now raises you to two dice instead of granting just one.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20: Words of Creation. Power Word Heal\/Kill prepared for free and you can affect two creatures with both of them.

According to\n\t\tthe Rules Glossary: &#8220;When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that\n\t\thas a casting time of an action or use a feature or magic item that requires\n\t\ta Magic action to be activated.&#8221;\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Outside of combat, you can still use this to get around obstacles. Cast a\n\t\t\tharmless spell like Prestidigitation and you can teleport without making a\n\t\t\tmess.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Boon of Energy Resistance<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A powerful\n\t\tdefense on any character.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boon of Fate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: 2d4\n\t\taverages to 5. Adding +5\/-5 to a saving throw can rescue you or an ally, or\n\t\tit can cause an enemy to fail a save. On a d20 scale, 5 means that there&#8217;s a\n\t\t25% chance on any given roll that this will have an impact. Granted, it is\n\t\tstill a dice roll, so the smaller the gap, the safer this is to use. On a\n\t\tfull caster where save-or-suck spells are such a huge part of your arsenal,\n\t\tthis is devastatingly effective. The fact that you can use it once per\n\t\tencounter is amazing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boon of Fortitude<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: More hit\n\t\tpoints are great on a class as frail as the Bard, but given the choice\n\t\tbetween this and Resilient (Constitution), you need proficiency in\n\t\tConstitution saves much more than 40 hp and some extra healing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Boon of Irresistible Offense<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Even\n\t\tmartial bards don&#8217;t attack frequently enough to make this appealing.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Boon of Recovery<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The Last\n\t\tStand feature is great insurance, but definitely not enough to justify your\n\t\tfirst Epic Boon.

You get 4 level 1 spell slots and 3 of each of levels 2, 3, and 4.\n\t\tOn average, you get 1 extra level 1 spell slot, and slightly less than 1 for\n\t\tlevels 2, 3, and 4.

Take advantage of invisibility at\n\t\tthe start of combat, then look for ways to become invisible as frequently as\n\t\tpossible. Even if you&#8217;re not making attack rolls (and you almost certainly\n\t\taren&#8217;t doing so often), the defensive benefits of invisibility are massive.\n\t\tHowever, remember that a lot of things are an Action, so it&#8217;s very easy to\n\t\tbreak this invisibility. Notable examples that people easily overlook\n\t\tinclude Hide, Search, and Study.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boon of Truesight<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: You have\n\t\tmagic options to handle invisible enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Bard Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Bard is proficient in simple weapons.
