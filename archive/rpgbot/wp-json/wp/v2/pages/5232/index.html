When drawing a baseline for divine spellcasters, the Cleric is almost always the first example which comes to mind. With access to an excellent spell list and many of the most important skills in the game, Clerics are welcome in any party. On top of their formidable spellcaster, Clerics are also capable melee combatants, and with some magical enhancement can easily hold their own against the very best martial characters. The Cleric can fill nearly any role in the party, but their most important roles are as the parties Healer, Support Caster, and Utility Caster, with a secondary role as a backup Defender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Cleric is so versatile, it can be easy to become very MAD. Be sure to consider what roles you intend to fulfill before building your Cleric. If you plan to be heavily combat-focused, consider playing a Warpriest so that you can reduce your need for ridiculously high Charisma. If you plan to play a Face, you consider playing a Paladin instead. The Cleric can do almost everything well, but it is very hard to do everything well at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Cleric Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells\">Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#spells-0\">0-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rings\">Rings<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rods\">Rods<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#staffs\">Staffs<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wands\">Wands<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

I\n\tthink the most annoying example is prohibiting good-aligned casters from\n\tcasting\n\t<a href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/magic\/all-spells\/i\/infernal-healing\">Infernal Healing<\/a>, which is the Pathfinder equivalent of 3.5&#8217;s Lesser Vigor, which quickly\n\tbecame the basis for all out of combat healing in 3.5.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Languages<\/span>: The Cleric can cast\n\tTongues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>As a full caster, the Cleric&#8217;s Wisdom is essential above all else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Useful if you plan to be in melee\n\tcombat, but even then you can use Guided Hand to use Wisdom for attack\n\trolls, so you probably don&#8217;t need more than 13 Strength to get access to\n\tPower Attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dex<\/span>: Take 12 at most to fill out Full\n\tPlate, but even that isn&#8217;t strictly necessary.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are always important,\n\tespecially if you plan to wade into combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Only useful for skill ranks, and the\n\tCleric isn&#8217;t dependent on skills unless the party absolutely needs them to\n\tbe.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Your casting stat.

The Gnome favored class bonus improves the healing\n\teffects of Channel Energy, but only for a very small set of creature\n\ttypes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Versatile and useful for a\n\tvariety of builds, but not as useful as the Human.

Unfortunately, once per day just isn&#8217;t enough to\n\t\tjustify the feat no matter how absurd your Charisma bonus is.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Smite<\/span>: An excellent way to get\n\t\tsome burst damage, but the target still gets a Will save to halve the\n\t\tdamage, and it only hurts undead if you channel positive energy.

This wastes the enemy&#8217;s turn, positions\n\t\tthem\n\t\tnear one of their allies to make them easy to hit with AOEs,\n\t\t<em>and<\/em> might get you some damage against an enemy. Overall I think\n\t\tit&#8217;s a minor improvement over Command.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanctuary<\/span>: This spell took me a long\n\t\ttime to understand. I overlooked it for years in the 3.5 days. Enemies\n\t\tonly get to attempt the save once, and if they fail they can&#8217;t attack you\n\t\tuntil the spell ends. Using this when you&#8217;re low on hit points is the\n\t\tobvious benefit, but you can do so much more than that. Enemies still\n\t\tcan&#8217;t move into your square, so suddenly you&#8217;re an unassailable road\n\t\tblock. Shove yourself between allies and enemies to tactically position\n\t\tyour party. The last line of the spell description says &#8220;The subject\n\t\tcannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or\n\t\totherwise act.&#8221; That&#8217;s a bit unclear, but it&#8217;s explained in the\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/coreRulebook\/magic.html#special-spell-effects\">Special Spell Effects<\/a>\n\t\tsection of the magic rules. Anything that requires a save to resist, does\n\t\tdamage, or otherwise &#8220;harms or hampers&#8221; count as attacks. So basically\n\t\tany\n\t\tspell that doesn&#8217;t have (Harmless) after the saving throw entry. You&#8217;ll\n\t\tneed to stick to healing, buffs, and utility spells, but that&#8217;s still a\n\t\tfairly large set of spells to choose from.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Grace<\/span>: Situational, but worth\n\t\tconsidering. It&#8217;s a swift action to cast, so you can cast this, move, and\n\t\tspend your standard action healing a downed ally or hitting an enemy with\n\t\ta nasty touch spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Life Pact<\/span>: I really wish the duration\n\t\ton this were longer, but that would probably raise the spell level\n\t\tconsiderably. Having an ally fall below 0 hit points in combat is scary.\n\t\tWether they survive and for how long is largely random, so your party&#8217;s\n\t\thealer (usually you) needs to rush over to their rescue, potentially\n\t\twasting several turns which you should be using to win the fight and\n\t\tprevent additional allies from dropping. This is an insurance policy,\n\t\tguaranteeing that you allies won&#8217;t bleed out on the floor and potentially\n\t\teven saving them from death if they would fall just below their negative\n\t\thit point cap. Until you get Breath of Life, this is the next best thing.\n\t\tEven then, a 2nd-level spell might be enough to prevent you from needing\n\t\tto waste a powerful 5th-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Other<\/span>: If you&#8217;re not in melee\n\t\ttanking for the party, you&#8217;re probably hanging around the back casting\n\t\tspells. If you&#8217;re in the back, you&#8217;re probably not taking damage. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not taking damage, your hit points are a resource that you&#8217;re not\n\t\tleveraging. Shield Other is a great way for back-line casters to help the\n\t\tparty tank. Sharing hit points among multiple players also lets you\n\t\tbenefit more from group healing effects like Channel Energy and Path of\n\t\tGlory, so you may spend less resources healing whoever is subject to\n\t\tShield Other.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sound Burst<\/span>: The damage is terrible so\n\t\tthis is easy to overlook. The real draw the 1-round stun effect. If you\n\t\thave someone in the party with Sneak Attack this can really help them\n\t\tout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Align Weapon, Communal<\/span>: If you need an\n\t\taligned weapon, chances are good that the rest of your party does too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Vestment<\/span>: One of my favorite\n\t\tbuffs. If you&#8217;re using armor and a shield, this will save you as much\n\t\tgold\n\t\tas Greater Magic Weapon. Consider a 3rd-level Pearl of Power if you need\n\t\tthe 3rd-level spell slot. If your allies want their armor buffed, suggest\n\t\tthat they buy you another pearl instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Shape<\/span>: Adventuring tends to\n\t\tinvolve a lot of caves, caverns, and mountains, all of which have enough\n\t\tunworked stone that this offers a ton of utility. Make bridges, make\n\t\tcover, make a temporary shelter, fix the collapsing ceiling, lower the\n\t\tceiling if a flying enemy is bothering you, raise the ceiling if you&#8217;re\n\t\tflying and your enemies aren&#8217;t, put your enemies in a nice box and leave\n\t\tthem there. The spell&#8217;s biggest limit is your own capacity to imagine how\n\t\tto use it. Oh, and the unworked stone requirement.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stunning Bearier, Greater<\/span>: An\n\t\texcellent\n\t\tdefensive option, but the defensive bonuses won&#8217;t stack with common\n\t\tdefensive items. RAW you can stun the same creature repeatedly (&#8220;It is\n\t\tnot\n\t\tdischarged until it has stunned a number of creatures&#8230;&#8221;), but the\n\t\tintent\n\t\tis clearly that you can stun things a number of times equal to your\n\t\tcaster\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Air Walk<\/span>: It&#8217;s not technically flight,\n\t\tbut you also don&#8217;t have to worry about maneuverability. If you don&#8217;t have\n\t\ta better option to move around in the air, this is crucial.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Doom<\/span>: 10 minutes per level\n\t\tduration means that by this level you&#8217;re getting over an hour of the\n\t\teffect. Bringing enemies to Shaken with no action is a fantastic debuff,\n\t\teven if you don&#8217;t plan to use fear stacking. If you use fear stacking\n\t\tthis\n\t\tis irreplaceably good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessing of Fervor<\/span>: Similar to Haste\n\t\tbut with more options. The ability to extend 1st and 2nd-level spells for\n\t\tfree is fantastic if you don&#8217;t already have Extend Spell. Even then, the\n\t\tcost of one 4th-level spell might be preferable to increasing a spell&#8217;s\n\t\teffective spell level if you need to extend a lot of spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Death Ward<\/span>: At high levels save-or-die\n\t\teffects and negative energy attacks become very common. You&#8217;ll want this\n\t\tat some point.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dismissal<\/span>: Save-or-suck on outsiders,\n\t\tbut if they can Plane Shift they might come right back.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Power<\/span>: The bonuses are luck\n\t\tbonuses so they won&#8217;t stack with Divine Favor. 3.5 migrants should read\n\t\tthe description and note that it has changed considerably from 3.5&#8217;s\n\t\tversion: you no longer alter your BAB. Instead, you just get a luck bonus\n\t\tand a haste-style additional attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Imbue with Spell Ability<\/span>: Put this on\n\t\tan\n\t\tally so you have a backup healer, or let them cast buffs with range of\n\t\t&#8220;Self Only&#8221; on themselves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Weapon, Greater<\/span>: One of my\n\t\tfavorite buffs. This will save you a fortune, but you&#8217;ll still need to\n\t\tspend gold if you want interesting weapon abilities. Unfortunately you\n\t\tget\n\t\tit a spell level later than wizards.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Path of Glory, Greater<\/span>: In-combat\n\t\thealing is usually a bad idea, but I want to mention this spell as an\n\t\talternative to Cure Critical Wounds. Cure Critical heals 4d8+CL hit\n\t\tpoints\n\t\tto one creature. That&#8217;s an average of 18+CL (minimum 25 at CL 7). Greater\n\t\tPath of Glory heals up to 5 times your CL to as many creatures as you can\n\t\tfit into 4 squares, easily healing parties of any reasonable size.\n\t\tCreatures in squares created after the initial casting will be healed\n\t\tless, but that&#8217;s really not the point. At CL 7 that&#8217;s 35 points of\n\t\thealing\n\t\tto everyone in your party. As you gain levels and 4th-level spells become\n\t\tless critical, this will become an excellent and reliable source of hit\n\t\tpoint restoration when you need a lot of healing and don&#8217;t want to chew\n\t\tthrough your wand of cure light wounds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air Walk, Communal<\/span>: There is Communal\n\t\tFly, so this is probably the most efficient way to get your whole party\n\t\tin\n\t\tthe air with one spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Break Enchantment<\/span>: A hugely important\n\t\trestorative spell, Break Enchantment heals a massive number of\n\t\tconditions.\n\t\tNotably, it can reverse petrification from Flesh to Stone, and it&#8217;s a\n\t\tspell level lower than Stone to Flesh.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Breath of Life<\/span>: Too good to pass up.\n\t\tPrepare it once every day. It&#8217;s basically a permanent tax on clerics.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Holy Ice<\/span>: Easily overlooked if you&#8217;re\n\t\tnot familiar with Ice Wall. The ice wall option could be amazing with a\n\t\tbit of luck. Creatures that take damage from holy water (undead and evil\n\t\toutsiders) take damage when they touch the wall, so the obvious choice is\n\t\tto make them touch the wall as much as possible. Ideally you want them to\n\t\tbe pressed against the wall or walk on it. Ice Wall states that the wall\n\t\tcan be oriented however you like so long as it&#8217;s correctly anchored. Why\n\t\tnot make the wall horizontal? Suddenly you&#8217;ve got a holy ice floor to\n\t\tfight on.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<p>The Javelin option is extremely easy to overlook, and I&#8217;ve made that\n\t\t\tmistake myself. The attack is based on you Wisdom modifier rather than\n\t\t\tyour Dexterity, so you&#8217;re more likely to hit, but more importantly you\n\t\t\tstill get to apply whatever attack and damage bonuses would apply to a\n\t\t\tranged attack. If you had Divine Power running, for example, that luck\n\t\t\tbonus applies to each of the javelin attacks. If you&#8217;ve got +3 from\n\t\t\tDivine Power, each javelin deals 1d6+1+3 damage, +1 against targets\n\t\t\tthat\n\t\t\ttake damage from holy water. If you can get other bonuses from other\n\t\t\tspells or from things like Inspire Courage, it just gets crazier from\n\t\t\tthere.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pillar of Life<\/span>: Greater Path of Glory is\n\t\tmiles better and a spell level lower. This spell is garbage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plane Shift<\/span>: Equal parts escape plan\n\t\tand\n\t\tbanishment solution. Party in a bind? Plane Shift somewhere nice. Got an\n\t\tenemy that you&#8217;re sick of? Plane Shift them somewhere unpleasant like the\n\t\tplane of fire.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Righteous Might<\/span>: The numeric benefits\n\t\tare\n\t\tbetter than Enlarge Person, but the rounds\/level duration is hard. 3.5\n\t\tmigrants will note that Righteous Might no longer stacks with other\n\t\tsize-increasing effects, so you can&#8217;t combine this with Enlarge Person to\n\t\tbecome Huge.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Slay Living<\/span>: The damage dice are\n\t\tfixed,\n\t\tbut they&#8217;re also really high <em>and<\/em> you get to add your caster\n\t\tlevel. Not bad by damage spell standards.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Banishment<\/span>: Dismissal, but it can\n\t\taffect\n\t\tmultiple creatures and there&#8217;s an abusable mechanic for presenting stuff\n\t\tthat the creature doesn&#8217;t like. Say you were facing a Balor. It&#8217;s an evil\n\t\toutsider, so holy water works. It has DR cold iron and good, so a cold\n\t\tiron weapon works. A holy symbol of a good-aligned deity probably works.\n\t\tBeyond that it gets fuzzier, but you might be able to use things as\n\t\tsimple\n\t\tas angel feathers or something.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blade Barrier<\/span>: A decent area control\n\t\tspell, blade barrier can really change the shape of an encounter. What\n\t\twas\n\t\tprobably a fight before the spell now becomes a game of &#8220;throw the other\n\t\tteam into the wall&#8221;.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span>: The best in-combat healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroes&#8217; Feast<\/span>: I like this enough to\n\t\tcast it every day when I have the option. It heals disease and poison, it\n\t\tgrants a nice pool of temporary hit points, a +1 morale to attacks that\n\t\tlasts all day, and an impressive +4 to saves against poison and fear. 3.5\n\t\tmigrants will note that it no longer grants full immunity to fear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Undeath to Death<\/span>: 40-foot radius save\n\t\tor\n\t\tdie against undead. The 500gp material component cost is hard, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tabsolutely worth it in a fight with a lot of problematic undead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Jolting Portent<\/span>: This sounds really\n\t\tcool,\n\t\tbut the fundamental concept of the spell is flawed. If you can expect the\n\t\ttarget to fail a saving throw, why don&#8217;t you just hit them with a\n\t\tsave-or-suck?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Repulsion<\/span>: Choose when you want to go\n\t\tinto melee. If you&#8217;re against a melee enemy and you or an ally can fight\n\t\tat range, you can use this to hold enemies at range while you wittle them\n\t\tdown.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Waves of Ecstasy<\/span>: Unlike Blasphemy and\n\t\tthe other alignment-based AOE spells at this level, Waves of Ecstacy\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t care about alignment and doesn&#8217;t care about hit dice. Even on a\n\t\tsuccessful save, the target is still staggered. At this level full\n\t\tattacks\n\t\tare important for many enemies, so denying them the ability to do so is a\n\t\thuge handicap.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Chaos \/ Holy Aura \/ Shield of Law \/ Unholy Aura<\/span>: Excellent defensive buff for your whole party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire Storm<\/span>: Simple fire damage AOE\n\t\tdealing 1d6\/level, but the real draw is the ongoing fire damage. 4d6 is\n\t\tenough to cause some annoying Concentration checks from spellcasters, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s enough to quickly wear down enemies who can&#8217;t take the time to\n\t\textinguish themselves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Frightful Presence<\/span>: The most important\n\t\tparts of Divine Power (size, Strength) plus a sizable natural armor bonus\n\t\tand some spell resistance. All for minutes\/level. That enough makes this\n\t\tan excellent spell, but on top of that enemies within 30 feet are\n\t\tautomatically shaken with no save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stormbolts<\/span>: AOE damage and 1 round\n\t\tstun\n\t\ton failed saves. AOE stunning is really good because it can buy your\n\t\tentire party a free turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Overwhelming Presence<\/span>: Make creatures\n\t\thelpless, then potentially deal wisdom drain and stagger them. Even if\n\t\tthey save, they&#8217;re still staggered for one round. You get to pick the\n\t\ttargets, so you can exclude your allies. Send your allies around to coup\n\t\tde grace your victims.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Polar Ice<\/span>: Not as immediately lethal\n\t\tas\n\t\tOverwhelming Presence, but still excellent. Ideally you want to find a\n\t\tway\n\t\tto prevent enemies from moving while in the area. Try combining this with\n\t\tspells like Entangle.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Storm of Vengeance<\/span>: Takes too long, does\n\t\ttoo little.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Winds of Vengeance<\/span>: The flight is nice\n\t\tand the defensive options are helpful, but I don&#8217;t think this is good\n\t\tenough to be a 9th-level spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Allying<\/span> (+1): Even if you&#8217;re built\n\t\tfor\n\t\tweapon combat, you&#8217;re still going to spend a lot of turns in combat\n\t\tcasting spells or using other special abilities. In these cases, pass\n\t\tyour\n\t\tweapon&#8217;s enhancement bonus off to a friend. I wouldn&#8217;t pick this up\n\t\tunless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re planning to get at least a +2 enhancement bonus because the effect\n\t\twon&#8217;t be great enough to justify the cost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Courageous<\/span> (+1): Clerics have a lot of\n\t\tgreat options to get morale bonuses, so a +1 Courageous weapon can do a\n\t\tlot for a cleric.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Grayflame<\/span> (+1): Channel Energy is a\n\t\tnice pool of healing, but you can also use it to power the Grayflame\n\t\tweapon ability. Unfortunately, the duration is short and without full BAB\n\t\tand iterative attacks to capitalize on the temporary damage boost, it&#8217;s\n\t\thard to justify.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Storing<\/span> (+1): Clerics get a lot\n\t\tof damaging touch spells, but unfortunately Storing is capped at\n\t\t3rd-level\n\t\tspells. So you can do Inflict Serious Wounds, but you can&#8217;t do Harm. It&#8217;s\n\t\talso limited to melee weapons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Armor<\/span> (22,400 gp): Unless you\n\t\thave heavy armor proficiency <em>and<\/em> a Dexterity modifier of at most\n\t\t+5, Celestial Armor is the best armor in the game if all you need from\n\t\tyour armor is AC. For more, check out my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/celestial_armor\">Practical Guide to Celestial Armor<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clawhand Shield<\/span> (8,158 gp): This is a\n\t\tweird item. It&#8217;s a bit more expensive than your typical +2 shield, so it\n\t\tmay not be worth the cost compared to a mithral buckler. However, it\n\t\tallows you to perform somatic components with the hand holding the\n\t\tshield,\n\t\twhich means that you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue,\n\t\tand because it has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone\n\t\tcan use it without issue. The ability to automatically damage enemies\n\t\twhile in a grapple is a helpful deterrent for small or physical weak\n\t\tcharacters, but ion&#8217;t go looking for excuses to use it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enhancement Bonus<\/span> (+X): Magic\n\t\tVestment\n\t\tcomes online at 5th level, and will generally outpace or match the amount\n\t\tyou could reasonably invest in your armor. As you gain more levels, Magic\n\t\tVestment will get better and the cost to enhance your armor will\n\t\tgradually\n\t\tbecome less appealing. A 3rd-level Pearl of Power costs 9000gp, which is\n\t\tas much as a suit of +3 armor and slightly more than two +2 armor items,\n\t\tbut with this pearl and one spell slot you can enhance both your armor\n\t\tand\n\t\tyour shield, and get the advantages of Magic Vestment&#8217;s scaling without\n\t\tspending another coin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Counterspells<\/span>: Clerics spend a lot of\n\t\ttime casting buff spells, often on themselves. If you put on a ring of\n\t\tcounterspells and fill it with Dispel Magic and Improved Dispel Magic,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re protected from losing all of your buffs when you run into enemy\n\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Curing<\/span>: Healbots are dumb, and this is\n\t\tnowhere near worth 10,000 gold. I might consider it at 2,000, but even\n\t\tthen I would consider it vendor trash if I found it on the floor of a\n\t\tdungeon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection<\/span>: A lot of cleric spells\n\t\tgrant Deflection bonuses to AC, and they obviously won&#8217;t stack with your\n\t\tring.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rods\">Rods<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic Extend, Lesser<\/span>: Many crucial\n\t\tcleric buffs are 3rd-level or less, including several communal spells. If\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t spare a feat for Extend Spell, a rod can be a nice substitute.\n\t\tOnce the durations are long enough, you can cast extended spells at night\n\t\tbefore you go to sleep and the durations will last well into the next\n\t\tday.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Metamagic Reach, Lesser<\/span>: Cure spells\n\t\thave a range of touch, which can be a problem if one of your allies falls\n\t\tbelow 0 hit points and you&#8217;re not right next to them. A low-level cure\n\t\tspell will at least stabilize them until you can get in range for\n\t\tsomething bigger. If you&#8217;re worried that you&#8217;ll need Breath of Life\n\t\tfrequently, consider the regular rod. It also covers Heal, so even if\n\t\tyour\n\t\tallies don&#8217;t drop below 0 you can still get your money&#8217;s worth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"staffs\">Staffs<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to recommend specific staffs without knowing your individual character, so instead I want to make a general endorsement of the concept of magic staffs in Pathfinder. If you are a 3.5 native, go read Pathfinder&#8217;s rules for staffs because they have improved dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staffs are a reliable, rechargeable source of extra spellcasting that can give spellcasters easy and reliable access to spells from their spell list which they might not want to learn, or which they might like to use so frequently that they can&#8217;t prepare the spell enough times in a given day. On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cure Light Wounds<\/span>: A classic pitall of\n\t\tDnD-style games is thinking of clerics as healbots. While they have the\n\t\tbest healing options in the game, devoting all of their spells to\n\t\trestoring hit points is a tragic waste of resources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Belt of Physical Ability Scores<\/span>: If you&#8217;re built\n\t\tto\n\t\tgo into melee, a belt is a good idea. However, what you want to enhance\n\t\tdepends on how you&#8217;re built. If you went for heavy armor, increasing\n\t\tDexterity is pointless. Increasing Constitution may be unnecessary, too,\n\t\tif your defenses are good and you&#8217;ve got ample healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Candle of Invocation<\/span>: This is a\n\t\tcomplicated item, so I&#8217;ll try to explain it. You get 4 hours of candle\n\t\ttime before it burns out. The effects only apply if you stay within 30\n\t\tfeet of the candle and the candle is lit, so put it inside a lantern\n\t\twhile\n\t\tit&#8217;s lit. If it goes out, you lose the effects of the candle and you&#8217;re\n\t\tout 8400gp. The candle provides some numerical bonuses which are pretty\n\t\teasy to understand. The complex part is the spellcasting aspect.\n\t\tPreparing\n\t\tspells takes one hour, so there goes a quarter of your candle time right\n\t\toff the bat. But you get to prepare spells as if you were two cleric\n\t\tlevels higher. That means that you get extra spell slots and access to\n\t\tspells a level higher than normal in most cases. They go away after three\n\t\thours when the candle burns out, so get to work.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Usually too\n\t\tcrucial to forego, but clerics have easy access to several spells which\n\t\tprovide Resistance bonuses, including Protection From Evil.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of inspired wisdom<\/span>:\n\t\tCrucial.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Headband of Mental Prowess (Wis\/Cha)<\/span>: No\n\t\tmatter how much you like Channel Energy, you can&#8217;t afford to handicap\n\t\tyour\n\t\tWisdom enhancements by adding the price of also enhancing Charisma.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Runner&#8217;s Shirt<\/span>: Tragically, the\n\t\terrataed version is useless to us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Cleric is among the most powerful, versatile, and important classes in the game.
