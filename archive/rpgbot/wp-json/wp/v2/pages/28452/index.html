Much more than just a Jack of all Trades, this subclass does Monk better than any Monk in the book, does a pretty fantastic job of being a Paladin, and, thanks to the mind-bogglingly good change to Magical Secrets, also does a pretty solid job of being a Wizard, Cleric, and Druid. This subclass can basically fulfill any of the traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/party-composition\/\">Party Roles<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Genuinely, I can\u2019t think of a better character to build if you\u2019re playing in a one-person adventure.

Thanks to Influence now including Performance, there\u2019s even a not-irrelevant chance that some good roleplaying will get you permanent Advantage on social interactions. It can heal, it\u2019s got a much higher AC than it should, and it does decent single-target damage when played properly and great AoE damage at level 10 onward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>I would have loved this subclass if all it was was an excuse to throw on my least good Brazilian accent and get to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BhIAqjNapLk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breakdance fighting against Tony Jaa<\/a>.

Usually. Everything scales off of your Bardic Inspiration Dice, so we want as many of them as big as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see a world (again, a solo campaign) where you\u2019d want six levels of Paladin for the huge boost to saves, the mount for another body in combat, and the Extra Attack. I wouldn\u2019t call it wrong, per se, but that\u2019s a huge investment when you\u2019re giving up the exponential scaling inherent to the class. You\u2019re also giving up Wish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One level of Monk will let you punch things as a Bonus Action without expending a Bardic Inspiration die, which is useful for stretching your resources, but also means you\u2019re not handing out as much Inspiration. It also changes the way you set your Grapple Save Dc, which can lead to an excellent abuse case described below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example College of Dance Build &#8211; Harlequin Solitaire<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/rpgbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patreon Discord<\/a>, you\u2019ve seen my profile picture: a green and gold painted model done for me by my friend who inspired our original <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/aberrant-mind\/\">Aberrant Mind Sorcerer<\/a> example build.

We therefore rely on typical Bard tactics: Charisma as high as it can be at level 1, Healing Word, Hideous Laughter to keep something out of a fight, Faerie Fire for a damage multiplier if you catch many things clustered, and Dissonant Whispers for when you need big damage.<br><br>As far as Cantrips go, Sacred Flame and Starry Wisp may seem redundant because of damage type but a) they both have niche uses where one is better than the other (like Starry Wisp taking advantage of the\u2026 well, Advantage from Faerie Fire), and b) a Solitaire really isn\u2019t going to go around insulting things, no matter how iconic it is for Bards.<br><br>Make sure you\u2019re remembering to use Musician\u2019s ability to distribute Heroic Inspiration every time you rest. Your party will love you for it, and may well reward you with Heroic Inspiration they earn when it overflows because they already have some from you.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 2<\/td><td>Expertise<br><br>Jack of All Trades<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Detect Magic<\/td><td>We agree with half of the PHB recommendations and pick up Persuasion and Stealth for our Expertises since we\u2019re about to have permanent Advantage on the Performance rolls we care about which is roughly as good as Expertise until level 13.<br><br>We\u2019ll start running into more magical things and we can cast rituals as rituals now, so we take Detect Magic, which doesn\u2019t compete for our precious spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 3<\/td><td>Bard College: College of Dance<br><br>Dazzling Footwork<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Shatter<br><br>Retrain Spell: Dissonant Whispers -&gt; Mirror Image<\/td><td>Oh boy. We take off the leather armor we\u2019ve been wearing since character creation and our AC goes up by 2 points. We still can\u2019t use a shield, but a 16 AC is respectable, especially when you can heal yourself for roughly \u2153 of your HP as a Bonus Action spell. It\u2019ll also go up to 17 at next level.<br><br>So get close enough that you can punch things with Bonus Actions when you hand out Bardic Inspiration and then scurry away. Hitting for 1d6+3 twice in a turn is even more damage than swinging a greatsword. Admittedly, you can only do that 3 times a day, but that\u2019ll change soon.<br><br>We learn Shatter to be our primary area damage for a while, but far more importantly we retrain our prior single-target damage spell into defense since we can just use our hands for single-target damage in a far more reliable fashion if we\u2019re not worried about dying.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 4<\/td><td>Feat: Inspiring Leader<br>(Charisma 17 -&gt; 18)<br>Cantrips:<br>\u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/mage-hand\/\">Mage Hand<\/a><br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Phantasmal Force<\/td><td>Get people used to taking those Short Rests now (in case Musician\u2019s Heroic Inspiration wasn\u2019t already enough motivation). Eight temp HP per person may not seem like a lot, but that\u2019s 32 points of healing no one has to do per fight, which is a <em>huge<\/em> extension of resources, and it\u2019ll scale every time we level.<br><br>Phantasmal Force can shut down single targets very easily, provided that your DM plays along.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 5<\/td><td>Bardic Inspiration (1d8)<br><br>Font of Inspiration<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Hypnotic Pattern<br>&#8211; Leomund\u2019s Tiny Hut<\/td><td>This is an incredible level for us. Font of Inspiration means we should be handing out Bardic Inspiration with our Bonus Action nearly every single turn of every fight (after getting ourselves next to an enemy to punch them for their troubles). That punch had its die go up to a d8, making our average damage 7.5, a 15% increase. Admittedly, we\u2019re a point behind on the Fundamental Math if we\u2019re looking at Dexterity, but don\u2019t worry too much about that. Faerie Fire can help a lot there if we don\u2019t have to concentrate on anything else.<br><br>Anything like Hypnotic Pattern, which will <em>also<\/em> give us Advantage (admittedly only on the first attack), but is also one of the biggest off switches in the game.<br><br>We take Tiny Hut so that we always have a warm, safe place to sleep. It\u2019s a ritual, which is great when we\u2019ve spent a day burning our spell slots for more <s>Bonus Action punches<\/s> buffs for our party.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 6<\/td><td>Inspiring Movement<br><br>Tandem Footwork<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Mass Healing Word<\/td><td>We are going to be absolutely demolishing our spell slots for more dice. If you ever roll Initiative and don\u2019t activate Tandem Footwork, you\u2019re just doing it wrong and I don\u2019t have a better way to say that.<br><br>Meanwhile, Inspiring Movement will let you punch someone before leaving, allowing us to conceivably attack three times in a round. Cantrips improved recently, so we\u2019ll still want to use Starry Wisps before closing into melee for a Bonus Action fist, then a Reaction fist and walk away without drawing Opportunity Attacks to do it all again on our next turn.<br><br>This puts us at 14.5 DPR, roughly 10% over Target DPR before even talking about spells. If we\u2019re using two Bardic Inspiration Dice per round every round of combat, we\u2019re going to burn through 7 per fight (including the one for Inspiring Movement). We\u2019re only getting 4 per short rest, meaning we\u2019re burning 3 spell slots per fight, or 9 total per day. That unfortunately leaves us\u2026 one spell slot. Better make it count. Of course, we can also drop a punch and come down to 10.3 DPR, halfway between Low and Target. This will let us save our Bonus Action for things like healing our party members.<br><br>Still, the fact that we can get a Bard over Target DPR on a single target without spellcasting is pretty great.<br><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 7<\/td><td>Countercharm<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Fount of Moonlight<\/td><td>They appear to have explicitly added this spell for Dance Bards and Moon Druids with Multiattack. If we turn this on, we still get two punches the first round thanks to our insane action economy optimization. Every round after that we\u2019re at almost 28 DPR, just shy of High DPR <em>as a Bard<\/em>. If you have something increasing your accuracy like a Bless or advantage from other people, it\u2019s going to be even more beneficial than it is for most characters because our Attack Bonus isn\u2019t where it\u2019s expected to be.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 8<\/td><td>Grappler <br>(Dex 16 -&gt; 17)<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Charm Monster<\/td><td>Charm Monster is a powerful tool when used correctly, and it won\u2019t compete for Concentration if you decide to use it in combat.<br><br>Grappler, meanwhile, is already okay and will become great shortly. The Punch and Grab feature only works once per turn, but we spend most of our existence punching people at the end of their turn as well, allowing you to trigger it twice in a round. This is great if something has broken the grapple, but decided to stay next to you (or if something else walked up in the interim).&nbsp;<br><br>Also, since it makes trying the grapple free, the fact that our save DC is only 11 (for now) means things might still fail from time to time, giving us Advantage thanks to Grappler\u2019s Attack Advantage feature, which <em>dramatically<\/em> improves our DPR as described above. Finally, the part about non-hindered movement? That will apply to the Inspiring Movement Reaction as well, allowing you to drag unfortunate targets into the middle of your team to be systematically picked off.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monk 1<\/td><td>Martial Arts<br><br>Unarmored Defense<\/td><td>This version of Unarmored Defense doesn\u2019t matter to us in the slightest, but Dextrous Attacks immediately takes our Grapple Save DC from 12 to 15, making it hugely more likely to land. This will trigger all the good stuff we talked about last level.<br><br>Martial Arts also allows us to make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action without expending our limited Bardic Inspiration Dice, and you can still use Bardic Damage rather than the 1d6 of level 1 Monk.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 9<\/td><td>Expertise<br>\u2013 Perception<br>&#8211; Performance<br><br>Spells Prepared<br>\u2013 Yolande\u2019s Regal Presence<\/td><td>With two more Expertise we get better in Perception and finally Performance because Expertise and Advantage on the same roll just feels incredible.<br><br>For our spell, we have the opportunity to reposition during other people\u2019s turns, and love both being in melee and making things prone so we can kick them with Advantage. There are basically no downsides to this apart from it also taking Concentration.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 10<\/td><td>Bardic Die (d10)<br><br>Cantrips<br>\u2013 Prestidigitation<br><br>Magical Secrets(see text)<\/td><td>We\u2019ll finally learn Jazz Hands to go with our dance routine.<br><br>The increase in Bardic Die means a slight DPR increase, but Magical Secrets is why we\u2019re in love with this level.

If they don\u2019t break the grapple, DPR on following turns is over 51, putting us roughly 20% over High DPR. Add in the ghoul claws for good measure and you\u2019re up to just shy of 60.<br><br>Meanwhile, Charm is cool, but Contingency is probably the second most broken spell in the game behind Wish.&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 13<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Simulacrum<\/td><td>Simulacrum is a surprise tool that will help us later.<br><br>If no one else in the party can cast Teleport or Plane Shift yet, retrain Faerie Fire into whichever you need more.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 14<\/td><td>Leading Evasion<\/td><td>If you still need one of the spells from last level, turn in Yolande\u2019s Regal Presence for it.

But, once you\u2019ve made the first simulacrum of yourself, it has your 9th-level spell slot and Wish. It then casts Wish, duplicating the effect of Simulacrum. This is not casting Simulacrum and is therefore not prohibited.<br><br>Interestingly, my interpretation of strict RAW would be that, if you used Wish to duplicate Simulacrum, it would prevent the Simulacrum from casting Wish based on the wording of the text of Simulacrum. There are, perhaps, points to be made on either side (particularly about RAI, which is clearly the prevention of this nonsense in the first place), and the fact is that, due to my interpretation I just mentioned, since your Simulacra are no longer capable of casting Simulacrum themselves, for any of the abuse cases of Wish that you\u2019d like to take advantage of (the permanent Resistance springs to mind) you actually need to cast one instance of Simalcrum yourself with the real spell, 12 hours, and a pile of snow and ruby dust.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bard 18<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:- <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/true-polymorph-and-shapechange\/\">True Polymorph<\/a><\/td><td>Once your infinite naked Bard army has run out of spells, turn them into anything I rated blue in that article.
