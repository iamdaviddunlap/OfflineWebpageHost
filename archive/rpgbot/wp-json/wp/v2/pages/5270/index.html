When you absolutely, positively have to drop somebody, this is how\n\tyou do it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Accuracy<\/span> (Su): Less costly and less\n\teffective than Accurate Strike, but still pretty good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Cloak<\/span> (Su): Bluffing and hiding\n\tisn&#8217;t really part of the Magus&#8217; skill set.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Deed<\/span> (Ex): Many options won&#8217;t work for\n\ta Magus because you&#8217;re not treated as having a point of Panache, and only a\n\tcouple of the remaining options are remotely worthwhile. You are required also\n\tto take Flamboyant Arcana, which is terrible, so I wouldn&#8217;t bother unless you\n\tplan to use Deadly Stab or Stunning Stab frequently.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Derring-Do<\/span> (Ex): Free from Flamboyant Arcana.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dodging Panache<\/span> (Ex): Depends on Charisma,\n\t\twhich is a dump stat for the Magus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Opportune Parry and Riposte<\/span> (Ex): Free from\n\t\tFlamboyant Arcana.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Kip-Up<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that your\n\t\teffective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Menacing Swordplay<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that\n\t\tyour effective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Precise Strike<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that your\n\t\teffective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Swashbuckler Initiative<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies\n\t\tthat your effective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Swashbuckler&#8217;s Grace<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that\n\t\tyour effective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Superior Feint<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies\n\t\tthat your effective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Targeted Strike<\/span> (Ex): If you can make a\n\t\tFull Round Action, you should be using Spellstrike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bleeding Wound<\/span> (Ex): Just hit things with a\n\t\tspell. It will work much faster.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Evasive<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that you don&#8217;t\n\t\tcount as having points in your Panache pool, so this won&#8217;t function..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Subtle Blade<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that your\n\t\teffective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dizzying Defense<\/span> (Ex): The Magus has plenty\n\t\tof other options to boost their AC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Perfect Thrust<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that your\n\t\teffective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Swashbuckler&#8217;s Edge<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that\n\t\tyour effective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Cheat Death<\/span> (Ex): Arcane Deed specifies that your\n\t\teffective Swashbuckler level is 0, so this will not function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadly Stab<\/span> (Ex): Save or die, and its\n\t\tdependent on your ridiculous Dexterity modifier.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Stab<\/span> (Ex): Stunning a creature is\n\t\tdevastating, and you don&#8217;t need to crit to do it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Edge<\/span> (Su): Keep in mind that bleed\n\tdamage is not <em>ongoing<\/em> bleed damage. You can get a much better return\n\tfor your arcane pool points from other arcanas.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Redoubt<\/span> (Su): Even if this were an\n\timmediate action, it would still be highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Redoubt, Greater<\/span> (Su): Very costly,\n\tvery hard to time, and very expensive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bane Blade<\/span> (Su): Bane weapons are normally\n\thard to justify because it is so difficult to predict what you will be\n\tfighting. The Magus doesn&#8217;t have that problem, and 2d6 bonus damage against\n\twhatever you&#8217;re righting is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Broad Study<\/span> (Ex): This makes multiclassing\n\tinto Wizard or Witch somewhat viable, but because you need to be level 6 to\n\ttake this arcana, your spellcasting abilities in the second class will be\n\tmiles behind.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Close Range<\/span> (Ex): This opens up a lot of\n\toptions for Spellstrike, including Disintegrate. Don&#8217;t bother taking this\n\tuntil fairly high levels when the damage from favorites like Shocking Grasp\n\tbegins to lose its luster and ray spells become more prevalent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Concentrate<\/span> (Ex): Most of your\n\tconcentration checks will be to cast defensively, so your best bet is to take\n\tCombat Casting instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Critical Strike<\/span> (Su): With a keen scimitar,\n\tyou have a reasonably chance of scoring critical hits, and being able to cast\n\tan extra spell as a swift action means a lot of extra damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Devoted Blade<\/span> (Su): Most of your enemies\n\twill be susceptible to either Holy or Unholy, and these abilities allow you to\n\tbypass DR and do a ton of extra damage. If you&#8217;re one of the corner alignments\n\t(Lawful Good, Chaotic Good, etc.) you could add two effects and drop 4d6 extra\n\tdamage on creatures of the opposite alignment.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dispelling Strike<\/span> (Su): Potentially very\n\tpowerful, but it costs too much to use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disruptive<\/span> (Ex): Mages are scary, and this\n\tis one of few ways for non-fighters to get Disruptive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Empowered Magic<\/span> (Su): Damage spells are\n\tyour bread and butter, so 50% more damage is nice. You only get to use this\n\tonce per day, which can be a very important choice. Use this early in a fight\n\tto really mess up someone scary.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enduring Blade<\/span> (Su): The 1 minute duration\n\ton your blade enhancements really hurts, especially for long fights. If you\n\thave long fights (common as you grow in level) or like to have several fights\n\tback to back, this can save you a huge number of arcane pool points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Familiar<\/span> (Ex): Familiars are fantastic, and\n\tthey can deliver touch attack spells for you and scout for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Flamboyant Arcana<\/span> (Ex): A Magus should never\n\tneed Derring-Do, and with only 2\/3 BAB it will be difficult to rely on\n\tOpportune Parry and Riposte.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ghost Blade<\/span> (Su): Ghost touch and\n\tBrilliant Energy are both very situational, and brilliant energy is hugely\n\texpensive to use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hasted Assault<\/span> (Su): Haste is one of the\n\tbest buffs for combat characters, and the Magus is no exception. The duration\n\twill only be a few rounds, but the extra attacks should net you quite a bit of\n\textra damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lingering Pain<\/span> (Su): Very situational, but\n\tvery good. The DC to concentrate will be absurdly high if you hit with even a\n\tmediocre damage spell, which effectively turns off the enemy caster for a\n\tturn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Maneuver Mastery<\/span> (Ex): The Magus really\n\tisn&#8217;t the type of character to be doing a lot of combat maneuvers, but Trip\n\twouldn&#8217;t be the worst choice anyone has ever made.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maximized Magic<\/span> (Su): Take the biggest spell\n\tyou can cast, combine it with Empower Magic, really ruin someone&#8217;s day.\n\tImagine a Maximized, Empowered disintegrate. It&#8217;s a high level example, but\n\tit&#8217;s a beautiful concept.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Pool Strike<\/span> (Su): If you&#8217;re low on spells but\n\tstill have some arcane pool points to burn, this can be a tempting option. The\n\tdamage won&#8217;t be fantastic, but it&#8217;s a cheap way to get a little extra damage.\n\tOf course, you can use Spell Recall to recall Shocking Grasp for the same\n\tcost, and Shocking Grasp with no modifications does the same damage and grants\n\tyou an extra attack thans to Spell Combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pool Strike, Arcing<\/span> (Su): The range isn&#8217;t\n\tfantastic, but this is flashy and exciting. By this level the damage will be\n\t4d6, which isn&#8217;t going to win any fights, but you could potentially do this\n\tevery turn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Pool Strike, Clinging<\/span> (Su): The damage from\n\tPool Strike already isn&#8217;t great, and an extra arcane pool point is too pricy\n\tfor so little damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pool Strike, Thunderous<\/span> (Su): Most enemies\n\twon&#8217;t care about being deafened, and most things won&#8217;t take any additional\n\teffect from sonic damage. If you want to use this on casters, there are much\n\tbetter ways to surpress casters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Prescient Attack<\/span> (Su): You are not sneak\n\tattacking, and very few enemies rely on dexterity for AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Prescient Defense<\/span> (Su): This is good\n\tagainst solo enemies, but it&#8217;s too expensive to maintain. Spell Shield is\n\tconsiderably better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quickened Magic<\/span> (Su): One extra chance to\n\tmurder something as a swift action.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reflection<\/span> (Su): Expensive, but definitely\n\tworth it. At this level there are a lot of very scary spells to worry about,\n\tand this provides a very effective defense mechanism.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rod Mastery<\/span> (Su): There aren&#8217;t a lot of\n\trods that contain spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rod Wielder<\/span> (Su): There aren&#8217;t a lot of\n\trods that contain spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Silent Magic<\/span> (Su): Very situational. On a\n\twizard this might be alright, but if you&#8217;r every silenced you can just start\n\thitting people with you magically enhanced weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Blending<\/span> (Ex): You already have the\n\tvast majority of the spells you will want to cast, but this opens up a lot of\n\toptions for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Shield<\/span> (Su): Helpful, but expensive\n\tto maintain. If you need a shield bonus, cast Shield or pick up a Mithral\n\tBuckler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellbreaker<\/span> (Ex): Combined with\n\tDisruptive, this makes you a major problem for enemy spellcasters. In\n\tcampaigns with a lot of enemy spellcasters, this is a must.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Still Magic<\/span> (Su): This can be helpful for\n\tescaping grapples or escaping ropes, but you spend most of your time in combat\n\twaving your hands around, which makes this fairly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wand Mastery<\/span> (Su): Most of your important\n\tspells won&#8217;t require a save, which makes this less useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wand Wielder<\/span> (Su): A wand of shocking grasp\n\twon&#8217;t deal a ton of damage by itself, but it grants you an extra attack per\n\tturn using Spell Combat, which is certainly worth the 15 gp after low\n\tlevels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Arcana Accurate Strike (Ex): Costly, but crazy effective.
