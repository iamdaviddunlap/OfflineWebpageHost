It probably will not have come to your attention but is still very true: I often end up playing a supportive character, especially one that can be a frontline presence.

As such, I\u2019m going to lean into the advice presented on the subclass breakdown page and talk about how to maximize this feat on a class that gets a lot out of it.

Hunter&#8217;s Mark is a nice damage boost\n\t\t\t\tagainst a single high-priority target, but its usefulness is limited by\n\t\t\t\tthe Paladin&#8217;s low number of attacks per round. It can still yield\n\t\t\t\tconsiderably more damage than spending the same spell slot on Divine\n\t\t\t\tSmite, but only if you can maintain Concentration.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-Level<\/span>: Paralysis is an off-switch\n\t\t\t\tfor an enemy, but since your spell DC is low compared to a full\n\t\t\t\tspellcaster Hold Person is unrealiable. Misty Step is a great way to get\n\t\t\t\taround the battlefield, especially since it&#8217;s a Bonus Action to\n\t\t\t\tcast.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th-Level<\/span>: Haste and Protection From\n\t\t\t\tEnergy are two of the most important buffs in the game.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: Both situational\n\t\t\t\toptions, and the appeal of Dimension Door is reduced because you already\n\t\t\t\thave Misty Step.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th-Level<\/span>: Hold Monster makes Hold\n\t\t\t\tPerson redundant, but it&#8217;s a significant improvement. Unfortunately,\n\t\t\t\tyour spell save DC is likely still behind full spellcasters. Scrying is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational, and your full caster allies have had it for a very\n\t\t\t\tlong time by this level.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Channel Divinity<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Abjure Enemy<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\t\t\tthe spell Cause Feat, but the target doesn&#8217;t get additional saves and\n\t\t\t\ttheir speed is halved for the duration. This is especially useful\n\t\t\t\tagainst fiends and undead, but it works on anything that isn&#8217;t immune to\n\t\t\t\tfear.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vow of Enmity<\/span>: One minute of\n\t\t\t\tguaranteed Advantage against one target. Very helpful against powerful\n\t\t\t\tsingle foes. Use it early, use it often.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Relentless Avenger<\/span>: Absolutely fantastic\n\t\tfor a Defender build, especially if you also have Polearm Master. Look for\n\t\tways to boost you speed like magic items or spells like Haste and\n\t\tLongstrider so that moving half your speed may be enough to keep the target\n\t\twithin your reach.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul of Vengeance<\/span>: An extra attack\n\t\tpresents a 50% boost to your damage output (provided that you&#8217;re not using\n\t\tsomething like two-weapon fighting or Polearm Master).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"20\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Avenging Angel<\/span>: For one hour a day you can\n\t\tchase your terrified foes around and murder them. The move speed is great,\n\t\tallowing you to quickly close to melee and get enemies within the aura. Most\n\t\tpaladin subclass capstone features only last one minute, so the fact that\n\t\tthis lasts for a full hour is incredible.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-vengeance-ability-scores\">Oath of Vengeance Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Not only the driver for your melee attacks but powers athletics as well, the skill martials are reliably asked to use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dex<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Third in importance.
