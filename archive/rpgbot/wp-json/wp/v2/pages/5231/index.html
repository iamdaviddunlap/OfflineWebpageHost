It&#8217;s very jedi-esque in that the Cavalier is a warrior who tries to avoid fighting, and remains tranquil in the face of danger. However, the abilities provided make the Cavalier the martial equivalent of a squeaky hammer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Violence is never your first option.\n\tNot exactly conducive to the typical murder-hobo, but pretty great for\n\troleplaying.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge<\/span>: Spending a standard action to\n\tactivate this ability is annoying, but it makes sense for the Order. You might\n\teven argue that if you don&#8217;t activate this, you are violating your edicts and\n\tmight lose this abilities benefit temporarily. It&#8217;s also frustrating that this\n\tonly applies against sentient creatures.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Everything here is situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: None of your abilities make\n\tyou actually useful in a fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flat of the Blade<\/span> (Ex): 2 extra damage\n\tisn&#8217;t very good considering you have to give up lethal damage to do it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Inner Peace<\/span> (Ex): Once per day, ignore a\n\tpile of damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Shield of Blades<\/span> (Ex): If you are using Full\n\tDefense, you aren&#8217;t fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"beast\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classOptions\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-beast\">Order of the Beast<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Order of the Beast doubles down on your mount by giving you a limited polymorph option for it. Depending on your mount&#8217;s original form, it can be extremely effective while polymorphed. This combines extremely well with the Beast Rider Cavalier Archetype if you choose a mount which has good physical ability scores. Remember that you can polymorph your creature into the same type of creature, and you still get all of the buffs provided by the spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Basically a Druid with a lance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge<\/span>: Your mount&#8217;s damage can&#8217;t hope\n\tto keep up with yours, but with Wild Mount Shape your mount can turn into a\n\tDire Tiger and do a lot of damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Knowledge (Nature) is very useful,\n\tand you effectively get the Tracking ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: Ferocious Charge and Wild\n\tMount Shape are both amazing, though you&#8217;ll need to wait until level 10 to use\n\tWild Mount Shape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Empathy<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but your\n\tCharisma should be passable, so you&#8217;ll get more out of this than a Druid or\n\tRanger would.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Mount Shape<\/span> (Su): Turn your horse into\n\ta Dire Tiger. At 15th level you can instead turn your mount into a dragon,\n\twhich gives you flight and a breath weapon which you can use once each time\n\tyou shapeshift your mount. The hours per level duration will keep your mount\n\tpolymorphed all day, and you can use the extra uses per day to change forms\n\tshould the need arise. For help with Polymorph, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph.html\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ferocious Charge<\/span> (Ex): Frightened creatures\n\trun away, which means that you can charge them again on the next round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cockatrice\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-cockatrice\">Order of the Cockatrice<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Order of the Cockatrice has several devent abilities, but nothing that stands out as a must-have. Due to the flavor of the order, it may be a distruptive choice for a character in an otherwise cohesive party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: It&#8217;s all about you. Maybe not the\n\tbest choice for a cohesive party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t great, but this\n\tis good for fighting enemies one-on-one.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Appraise and Perform are basically\n\tuseless for you. Adding your Charisma to the DC to intimidate will probably\n\tnever come up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: Braggart and Moment of\n\tTriumph are really cool iconic abilities, and Steal Glory might give you some\n\tfree damage once in a while.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Braggart<\/span> (Ex): The wording is a little bit\n\tvague here.\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/threads\/rzs2lk39?APG-Cavaliers-Order-of-the-Cockatrice\">This thread<\/a>\n\tdiscusses the intent of the ability, and comes to a reasonable compromise on\n\thow the ability might have been intended: &#8220;At 2nd level, the cavalier can\n\textol his own accomplishments and battle prowess. He receives Dazzling Display\n\tas a bonus feat, however activating this feat is only a standard action and\n\tthe cavalier does not need a weapon in hand to use this feat. Additionally, he\n\treceives a +2 morale bonus on melee attack rolls made against demoralized\n\ttargets.&#8221; Check with your GM for exact interpretation.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Steal Glory<\/span> (Ex): Critical hits aren&#8217;t\n\tsuper common unless someone in your party is built to spam attacks with\n\tscimitars, but free damage is free damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Moment of Triumph<\/span> (Ex): This is a really\n\tcool, flashy ability which fits the theme of the Order of the Cockatrice very\n\tnicely. You probably invested in Charisma to capitalize on Braggart and the\n\tCavalier&#8217;s social skills, so your Charisma bonus should be at least +2 or +3,\n\twhich can make a big difference when the chips are down and you need to kick\n\tsome ass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dragon\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-dragon\">Order of the Dragon<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering dragons are typically considered huge, selfish, greedy lizards, it seems odd that the Order of the Dragon would be so focused on high fives and being everyone&#8217;s buddy. The passive challenge ability is great, and the skills are solid, but the low- and mid-level abilities are useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Be nice to your friends. Seems pretty easy for an adventurer who routinely puts his life on the line alongside some guys he met in a bar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Challenge<\/span>: Circumstance bonuses are slightly\n\tless common than morale bonuses, and they stack with common buffs like Bless.\n\tBecause you are likely your party&#8217;s front line, this will really help your\n\tparty. The bonus is fairly small, but it will make a big difference against\n\ttargets who justify using your challenge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Perception is the most rolled skill\n\tin the game, and Survival is useful enough to justify a rank to get the class\n\tskill bonus. If your party lacks a Ranger or a Druid, it may be worth putting\n\tmore ranks into Survival.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: The low- and mid-level\n\tOrder of the Dragon abilities are centered on helping your allies at the\n\texpense of doing something useful. Ask you friends which is more useful: a +2\n\tbonus to their next attack, or a pile of damage dropped on the bad guy? Pile\n\tof damage will generally win.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aid Allies<\/span> (Ex): Aid Another is almost\n\tnever used in combat, but the scaling bonus is kind of nice, especially for\n\tskill checks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Strategy<\/span> (Ex): This is a colossal waste of a\n\tstandard action. You could do almost anything else, and it would be a better\n\tuse of your time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Act as One<\/span> (Ex): This is like a single-use\n\tversion of the Coordinated Charge teamwork feat, except it requires no set up,\n\tonly takes a standard action, and doesn&#8217;t require a bunch of\n\tpre-requisites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lion\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-lion\">Order of the Lion<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Order of the Lion is great in every way. It has a cool flavor, it cooperates well with your allies, it doesn&#8217;t have limited daily uses, and the benefits are all interesting, useful, and flavorful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Having a &#8220;banner lord&#8221; is a fairly\n\tcommon motivation for real-world soldiers, knights, heroes, etc. Samurai were\n\tpledged to a lord whom they served, and Housecarls were dedicated professional\n\tsoldiers devoted to the protection of Danish and early English kings.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Challenge<\/span>: Not very flashy, but Dodge\n\tbonuses stack with everything, and this bonus might keep you alive against\n\tscary foes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Knowledge (Local) is useful for\n\thumanoids, but (Nobility) is fairly uncommon. Depending on your campaign,\n\thowever, you might find that (Nobility) works well for you, especially if your\n\tGM chooses to include your sovereign as a frequent plot point.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: Lion&#8217;s Call is a small\n\tbuff, but it&#8217;s free to use, so throw it up before every fight. For the King\n\twill be your big flashy game-changer in the middle of a fight, and shield of\n\tthe Liege makes you a fantastic Defender, even when enemies are in reach of\n\tyour squishiest allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lion&#8217;s Call<\/span> (Ex): The +1 bonus to attacks\n\tisn&#8217;t much and it will stop mattering very early, but it&#8217;s a free bonus that\n\tyou can start before kicking a door. The bonus against fear is solid, and you\n\tcan allow your terrified allies to reroll, which is probably more useful than\n\tthe actual bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">For the King<\/span> (Ex): This can change the tide\n\tof a fight if you time it well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield of the Liege<\/span> (Ex): This is great if\n\tyou have enough AC and hit points to back it up. With Heavy Armor and d10 hit\n\tpoints, you probably should.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"seal\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-seal\">Order of the Seal<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently this isn&#8217;t an order related to aquatic mammals. The rest of the order is just as disappointing. Despite an excellent flavor, the abilities provided are boring and provide very small bonuses which apply in very rare situations. Save this order for NPCs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Protect the macguffin!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Challenge<\/span>: Trip. Trip every time. The\n\tability doesn&#8217;t specify if it takes place before, after, or during the full\n\tattack, but I would take the trip attempt first if the GM allows it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Disabling Devices really isn&#8217;t a\n\tthing that Cavaliers do. You don&#8217;t get Trapfinding, so basically all you can\n\tdo is open locks. Having Linguistics as a class skill is basically useless,\n\tand concealing information with Bluff is hugely situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: All of the abilities are\n\tsituational, and even when they apply they aren&#8217;t very good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Keeper<\/span> (Ex): Hard to bring into play, and the\n\tbonuses are small.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">I Shall Not Be Moved<\/span> (Ex): Very situational,\n\tand takes away a lot of your combat options, including mounted charges.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Staggering Assault<\/span> (Ex): This is a really\n\tgood Bull Rush mechanic, but Bull Rush is very situational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"shield\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-shield\">Order of the Shield<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As befits its name, the Order of the Shield is a Defender build. While the challenge bonus is pretty terrible, the Order Abilities turn you into a fully functional Defender with very little other investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Protect the peasants! This is an\n\texcellent flavor for good-aligned Cavaliers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Challenge<\/span>: While flavorful, this is very\n\tdifficult to use unless you intentionally endanger your allies, which might\n\tviolate your edicts. On top of that, the bonus is fairly small.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Heal is pretty useful, if only\n\tbecause of the &#8220;Treat deadly wounds&#8221; usage. The additional class bonus will\n\tmake you very reliable, which can help supplement your party&#8217;s healing\n\tabilities. Knowledge (Local) is useful for identifying humanoids and\n\tocasionally for plot elements.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: The Order of the Shield&#8217;s\n\tabilities scream Defender.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resolute<\/span> (Ex): Almost as good as DR\/-.\n\tNonlethal damage is basically nothing, and healing removes equal amounts of\n\tlethal and nonlethal damage, so you can easily shake off the nonlethal damage\n\tafter every fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stem the Tide<\/span> (Ex): This has got to be one\n\tof the better Defender abilities available. Stand Still is already excellent,\n\tbut this adds damage to the deal. Keep in mind that many enemies will have a\n\thigher AC than CMD, so you may need to use Stand Still by itself for\n\twell-armored foes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protect the Meek<\/span> (Ex): Sometimes you make\n\tmistakes as a Defender. Maybe your enemy teleported. Maybe one of your allies\n\twas dropped by a foe who is now eying your Wizard. Use this to position\n\tyourself so that you can take attacks of opportunity against critical foes,\n\tand use Stem the Tide to keep your enemies from getting where they want to\n\tgo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"star\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-star\">Order of the Star<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Order of the Star is as close as you can get to being a Paladin without any actual divine power. The abilities provided are a good mix of support and defense, and make for an excellent charismatic Cavalier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Like being a Paladin, but less\n\tstrict and no divine power.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge<\/span>: While not particularly flashy,\n\tyou will probably spend a lot of time threatening the target of your\n\tchallenge, so this is a nice defensive buff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Heal is great for the Treat Deadly\n\tWounds usage, and Knowledge (Religion) is one of the best knowledge skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: All three abilities are\n\tgood. The bonuses provided by Calling and For the Faith may be modest, but\n\tthey are easy to apply, and can be very effective if you remember to use them\n\tas often as possible. Retribution is a fantastic ability for any front-line\n\tcharacter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Calling<\/span> (Ex): Use this before every fight,\n\tevery skill roll, every conversation. There is no limit on the usage, and\n\tbonus can be decent if your Charisma is good. Even a free +1 is worthwhile.\n\tOh, and you can use half off your cavalier levels for some Paladin\/Cleric\n\tstuff, which makes this an excellent ability for dipping into Cavalier from\n\tPaladin.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">For the Faith<\/span> (Ex): Using this as a free\n\taction is fantastic. It&#8217;s one round once per day, and the bonus is modest, but\n\tit&#8217;s a free action that could add up pretty well if you have decent\n\tCharisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Retribution<\/span> (Ex): Attack of opportunity\n\tagainst people when they hit you. You can only use this once per round, but\n\tthat&#8217;s plenty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sword\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advanced\/baseClasses\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-sword\">Order of the Sword<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This may as well be the Order of the Cavalier for how generic it is. However, it&#8217;s hard to deny how good it is. The bonuses directly address what a Cavalier needs to do, and the ablities are a straight improvement on the Cavalier&#8217;s existing abilities. If you can&#8217;t decide on an order (or don&#8217;t want to), I would consider this the default option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Generic good-aligned Cavalier.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Challenge<\/span>: You should always be astride your\n\tmount, so this is basically a permanent bonus to kill the target of your\n\tchallenge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Knowledge (Nobility) is situational\n\tunless your GM brings politics into play frequently, but Knowledge (Religion)\n\tis great. The bonuses to Sense Motive will help in some social situations, and\n\tcan compensate for a low Wisdom score.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: All excellent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">By My Honor<\/span> (Ex): Fix your lousy Will\n\tsave<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mounted Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Ignoring the armor\n\tcheck penalty is nice because you&#8217;re probably in Full Plate. The bonus to AC\n\twhen charging is very situational. How often do you charge someone with a set\n\tpolearm? Adding your mount&#8217;s strength to the charge is great, especially with\n\ta Lance and Spirited Charge. The free bonus feat is good because you were\n\tprobably already going to take several of those feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knight&#8217;s Challenge<\/span> (Ex): More attack bonus\n\tand damage against the target of your challenge is great. You only get one a\n\tday, so use it on something important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tome\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/cavalier.html#order-of-the-tome\">Order of the Tome<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Order of the Tome grants you knowledge of arcana and divine magic, the ability to read and cast one type of scrolls, and some interesting resistances against spells and spell-like abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Knowledge is cool. Take a look, it&#8217;s\n\tin a book.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge<\/span>: Spells are among the most common\n\tand dangerous things that you roll saves against. Challenge the biggest\n\tspellcaster in the room.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Arcana and Religion are the two most\n\timportant knowledge skills in the game, and it makes sense that Order of the\n\tTome should grant them. Linguistics doesn&#8217;t really get you anything, but it\n\thelps if you are the party&#8217;s face.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: Some interesting abilities\n\tregarding scrolls and spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Specialized Knowledge<\/span> (Ex): Situational,\n\tand depends heavily on the plot of your campaign.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Powerful Knowledge<\/span> (Ex): Cast spells from\n\t\tscrolls more easily. The bonus to your spellcasting ability score for the\n\t\tpurposes of spellcasting will help you use higher-level scrolls which might\n\t\tbe out of reach otherwise<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Knowledge<\/span> (Ex): This is\n\tfantastic, but requiring your allies to be adjacent is very annoying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"warrior\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classes\/samurai.html#order-of-the-warrior\">Order of the Warrior<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Order of the Warrior is a spectacular mix of durability and damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Edicts<\/span>: Respect and Honor. Basically\n\tmandates Lawful alignment.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge<\/span>: DR is best when it applies\n\tagainst a large number of attacks, so limiting the DR to your target is\n\tannoying, but DR\/- is still fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: History and Nobility are very\n\tdependent on your campaign. If the campaign calls for it, the bonus to\n\tNobility is very good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Order Abilities<\/span>: Several abilities which\n\timprove the Samurai&#8217;s ability to reliably survive saving throws and kill his\n\tenemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Honor in All Things<\/span> (Ex): A +4 bonus is\n\tmathematically almost as good as a reroll.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Way of the Samurai<\/span> (Ex): A reroll is\n\tfantastic. Rolling three times and picking the best basically gurantees\n\tsuccess.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Strike True<\/span> (Ex): This ability is fantastic,\n\teven if it can only be used once per day. It largely removes the need to\n\tinvest in critical hit feats, and allows you to apply a nice list of very\n\tdebilitating status effects. Because this is a standard action to activate,\n\tit&#8217;s a great choice early in a fight after you have moved into melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ronin\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classes\/samurai.html#ronin\">Ronin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ronin is a survivor.
