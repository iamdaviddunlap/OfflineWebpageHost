In addition, Mediums can call upon spirits in divination-style rituals to gather information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Mediums are an extremely limited class. They have armor, BAB, and hit points matching Clerics, but lack the magic to buff themselves comparably. They have a handful of fun utility abilities and some fun buffs, but are still very limited in functionality. They make a fine Face, and they have some Support options, but that&#8217;s about it. Even then, they&#8217;re far behind core classes like Bard or Cleric. The Medium is a class without a clear role or purpose in most games. The Archmage spirit makes you a terrible wizard, the Champion spirit makes you a mediocre fighter-equivlaent, Heirophant makes you a garbage Cleric stand-in, and Trickster makes you a functional Rogue-equivalent but also a massive jerk and just generally unpleasant to have in the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not playing in an Occult campaign with lots of things like haunts, skip this class.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Medium Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: At d8 hit points you&#8217;re not\n\t\ta front-liner.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB, so you&#8217;re not\n\t\ta massive threat with a weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Will is your only good save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor (this is a\n\t\tpun I literally can&#8217;t avoid) and simple weapons. No shields, so expect to\n\t\tuse two-handed weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Mediums get all the skills they\n\t\tneed to play a Face, plus some of the best knowledge skills. Unfortunately,\n\t\tthey only get 4+ skill ranks and Intelligence is their dump stat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spells<\/span>: Mediums are only 1\/2 casters, so\n\t\ttheir spells only go up to 4th level. Their spellcasting is Charisma-based\n\t\tand spontaneous.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knacks<\/span>: 0-level spells are fantastic, and\n\t\t1\/2 casters almost never get them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Spirit<\/span> (Su): This is the defining ability of the\n\t\tMedium. Your choice of spirit can change every time you perform a seance,\n\t\tpotentially allowing you to change your roles in the party on a daily basis.\n\t\tWhile this flexibility is nice, most Mediums will probably stick to the same\n\t\ttype of spirit every day, especially as they build their feat and spell\n\t\tchoices around their favorite spirit. Influence is your biggest limitation\n\t\ton what you can do with your spirit. You start with 1, get a penalty at 3,\n\t\tand lose your spirit at 5. So in a practical sense you get just 3 points per\n\t\tday unless you&#8217;re willing to lose your spirit when you gain that last point\n\t\tof Influence. I recommend saving that very last point to use Spirit Surge on\n\t\ta life or death roll. Propitiation gets you an additional point\n\t\teventually.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Spirit Bonus<\/span> (Su): Varies by Spirit, but the bonuses\n\t\tare generally excellent. The bonus appears to be typeless, which is even\n\t\tbetter. Keep in mind that the &#8220;favored locations&#8221; are just examples. If none\n\t\tof those locations are available, come up with something creative and\n\t\tdiscuss it with your GM.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Surge<\/span> (Su): Depending on your\n\t\tspirit, this can be a life saver. Many spirits offer bonuses to saving\n\t\tthrows, so you could use this to resist an affect which might otherwise kill\n\t\tyou.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shared Seance<\/span> (Su): Many of the seance\n\t\tbenefits are excellent, and they will freuqently be more useful for your\n\t\tallies than they are for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Taboo<\/span> (Su): Taboos vary by spirit. Access\n\t\tto 2 uses of Spirit Surge twice without granting Influence. This is a huge\n\t\tbenefit, so you should always take a Taboo if you can. You get to select the\n\t\tTaboo, fortunately, so your GM can&#8217;t pick one that he knows will get you\n\t\tinto trouble on a given day. The spirits each list some example taboos,\n\t\twhich I discuss in my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/medium\/spirits\">Medium Spirits Breakdown<\/a>, but the GM is free to offer additional options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Haunt Channeler<\/span> (Su): Only useful in campaigns which\n\t\tfeature haunts, a new mechanic added in Occult Adventures. In a normal\n\t\tcampaign, this will never matter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Location Channel<\/span> (Su): Adventurers tend\n\t\tto do a lot of killing first and asking questions later, which means that\n\t\tthey inevitably kill the one person who had the information they need. This\n\t\tallows you to drag that person&#8217;s spirit back for questioning. It&#8217;s important\n\t\tto note that the spirit takes control of the Medium&#8217;s body, so if the spirit\n\t\tis someone who really doesn&#8217;t like you, it might throw you out a window or\n\t\tdo something else unpleasant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Connection Channel<\/span> (Su): An excellent\n\t\timprovement to Location Channel.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Propitiation<\/span> (Su): You have a hard limit\n\t\tof 5 Influence, and some abilities will grant Influence throughout the day.\n\t\tTaking some time to reduce this Influence, even by just 1 point, is very\n\t\thelpful.\n\t<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ask the Spirits<\/span> (Su): The biggest\n\t\tlimitation on Contect Other Plane is the Intelligence\/Charisma damage\n\t\tmechanic. With no limit on usage and no potential self-inflicted decrease,\n\t\tyou can use this answer any question you might have by talking to a deity.\n\t\tWhere is the BBEG? A deity will know. Where are you keys? A deity will\n\t\tknow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Astral Journey<\/span> (Su): I&#8217;m not sure what\n\t\tto do with this. You can&#8217;t enter other planes, which is the biggest appeal\n\t\tof going to the Astral Plane. Your gear has no effect, so you&#8217;re\n\t\tsignificantly weakened. You&#8217;re also alone. Unless you have some plot point\n\t\tto hit on the Astral Plane, I don&#8217;t know what to do with this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trance of Three<\/span> (Su): You probably won&#8217;t\n\t\tuse this on most days. The duration is too short to use this consistently,\n\t\tand you don&#8217;t have enough room to grant Influence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spacious Soul<\/span> (Su): This is a really\n\t\tinteresting ability. It doesn&#8217;t save your ally&#8217;s life, but it can allow your\n\t\tallies to still contribute to a fight after their death. This is especially\n\t\ttrue for spellcasters, as they retain their spells and still use their own\n\t\tability scores. However, your dead ally can&#8217;t regain expendable abilities\n\t\tlike spell slots, so you still want to get them raised as soon as\n\t\tpossible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Mastery<\/span> (Su): Two extra uses of\n\t\tSpirit Surge, and if you give up spirit abilities for Spirit Surge uses you\n\t\tget four instead of 2.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Astral Beacon<\/span> (Su): At level 20 you\n\t\tsuddenly get to juggle all six spirits. This is a dramatic increase in your\n\t\tcharacter&#8217;s complexity, but it&#8217;s also a dramatic increase in your\n\t\tcapabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">St<\/span><span class=\"rating-green\">r<\/span>: If\n\t\tyou plan to go into melee, you want 14.
