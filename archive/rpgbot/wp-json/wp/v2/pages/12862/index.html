One could even argue from those numbers carving up 1 or 5 javelins in the same time frames. You might not use them, but your party might benefit from the ability to manufacture ammunition.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Artillerist Spells<\/span>: The Artillerist&#8217;s\n\t\tspell list is primarily offensive with some area control effects thrown in.\n\t\tNone of the spells are on the Artificer spell list, which is strange\n\t\tcompared to similar class features on other classes which typically saddle\n\t\tyou with at least a few situational spells that are already on your class&#8217;s\n\t\tspell list.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: Shield is a great spell at\n\t\t\t\tany level, and since Tool&#8217;s Required adds a material component to all of your\n\t\t\t\tspells, you can cast it with your hands full (provided that you&#8217;re holding or\n\t\t\t\twearing an infused item or an appropriate tool). Thunderwave isn&#8217;t a\n\t\t\t\tton of damage, but it&#8217;s nice for pushing enemies away if you get stuck\n\t\t\t\tin melee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th Level<\/span>: Two good offensive spells,\n\t\t\t\tbut remember that the Artificer gets 2\/3 spell progression so you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tgetting Shatter at the same level that wizard get Fireball. Arcane\n\t\t\t\tFirearm comes online at the same level and provides a damage boost, but\n\t\t\t\tit only applies to one damage roll, so AOE options like Shatter are more\n\t\t\t\tefficient against multiple targets than options like Scorching Ray.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Fireball is one of the\n\t\t\t\tbest AOE damage spells in the game, especially for its level, and adding\n\t\t\t\tArcane Firearm&#8217;s damage boost will close some of the gap between the\n\t\t\t\tArtificer and the Wizard. Wind Wall is fine, but it&#8217;s really situational\n\t\t\t\tso you may go your entire career without casting it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">13th Level<\/span>: Ice Storm isn&#8217;t a great\n\t\t\t\tspell, but Wall of Fire is an excellent area control option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th Level<\/span>: Cone of Cold&#8217;s AOE is\n\t\t\t\tgreat, but the damage isn&#8217;t significantly better than that of Fireball.\n\t\t\t\tWall of Force is the real winner here. It&#8217;s a reliable, no-save way to\n\t\t\t\tshut off one or more enemies for the duration of the spell, and most\n\t\t\t\tenemies are totally powerless to escape or counter it.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Cannon<\/span>: The eldritch cannon is\n\t\tbasically a pet that can only perform one action. They&#8217;re severely limited\n\t\tby their 15 ft. movement speed, so generally you&#8217;ll either create a Tiny\n\t\tcannon and carry it around (or make someone else do it) or you&#8217;ll create a\n\t\tnew Small cannon whenever you need a cannon that can occupy a space.\n\t\tCreating a cannon takes an Action, so consider your choices carefully; an\n\t\tAction early in combat (or ideally before combat starts) is very important.\n\t\t<p>In addition to their active abilities, your cannon makes a decent tank.\n\t\t\tWith an AC of 18 and a decent pool of hit points, they can take a lot of\n\t\t\tdamage which would otherwise be dealt to your party members, and you can\n\t\t\theal them between fights using a cantrip (though the 1-minute casting time\n\t\t\tfor Mending can add up quickly if you&#8217;re not careful).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Small cannons are big enough to provide cover for small characters, and\n\t\t\tin tight quarters they might be able to completely prevent enemies from\n\t\t\treaching you by interposing themselves. However, be cautious about\n\t\t\tsacrificing your cannon: you can only have one, you only get to create one\n\t\t\tfor free each day, and it only lasts for an hour. After that it will cost\n\t\t\tyou a spell slot, but a 1st-level spell slot is a negligible price to pay\n\t\t\tfor how good the cannons can be.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flamethrower<\/span>: With 15 ft. speed and\n\t\t\t\ta 15 ft. AOE, it will be difficult to keep the flamethrower in range\n\t\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re in small areas like a cramped dungeon, but if you find\n\t\t\t\tyourself unexpectedly in an encounter with close-packed enemies, it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\toften more efficient to create a flamethrow cannon than to cast Burning\n\t\t\t\tHands or something similar.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Force Ballista<\/span>: Your go-to damage\n\t\t\t\toption. It&#8217;s only slightly more interesting than a crossbow. The damage\n\t\t\t\tis decent and it uses your Intelligence for the attack, so if all you\n\t\t\t\tneed is to kill one creature at a time, this is a good choice. The push\n\t\t\t\teffect isn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s enough to break grapples by forcing enemies\n\t\t\t\tout of reach of your allies.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protector<\/span>: False Life is only a\n\t\t\t\t1st-level spell and provides largely the same benefit, but False Life\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t affect your whole party and you can&#8217;t spam it every round for an\n\t\t\t\thour. Even if your cannon spends all of its time following your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\ttank around to replenish their temporary hit points, the Protector\n\t\t\t\tcannon can go a long way to stretch your party&#8217;s limited daily\n\t\t\t\tresources. Between fights, activate the cannon repeatedly until you roll\n\t\t\t\tan 8 to ensure that you and your party members go into every fight with\n\t\t\t\tas many temporary hit points as possible.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Firearm<\/span>: This applies to all of\n\t\tyour artificer spells. Consider this on Shatter or Fireball. The d8 isn&#8217;t as reliable\n\t\tas adding your intelligence bonus, but it&#8217;s 4.5 damage on average, so it&#8217;s\n\t\troughly equivalent. Also note the wording of the ability. You don\u2019t add 1d8 to the damage; you roll 1d8 and add the value on the die to the damage. Specifically this means it does not get multiplied by a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explosive Cannon<\/span>: A 50% damage increase\n\t\tfor the Flamethrower and the Force Ballista, but the Protector doesn&#8217;t get\n\t\tanything (not that the Protector needs anything; it&#8217;s still spectacular).\n\t\tYou also get the ability to turn your cannon into a bomb, and the damage\n\t\twill at least match a 1st-level spell, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider walking your\n\t\tcannon into a group of enemies and detonating it to be a good go-to option\n\t\tin most cases since your cannon continuing to act will be more impactful\n\t\tthan the explosion.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fortified Position<\/span>: Half cover means +2 AC\n\t\tfor your entire party, which is a significant boost. The second cannon means\n\t\tthat you&#8217;ll spend less time stressing over which cannon to choose, and if\n\t\tone of the offensive options is clearly the best option you could even\n\t\tchoose to make two of them. However, you still only get one free cannon per\n\t\tday, so either carry around Tiny cannons or expect to spend some spell\n\t\tslots.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"artillerist-specialist-ability-scores\">Artillerist Specialist Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Artillerist is the blaster-caster of the Artificers, so we\u2019ll mirror the spread found in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/#ability-scores\">main handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.

We\u2019re taking Centaur and getting a +2\/+1 racial modifier which goes into Intelligence and Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to be a Centaur. We want the 40 feet walking speed and Equine Build allows us to put the Eldritch Cannon onto a pack saddle. We\u2019re not going to use the hooves natural weapon but that\u2019s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re taking Investigator as our background. We want this for two reasons. First off, we\u2019re taking Perception and Investigation from Artificer, so Investigator gives us Insight and then since we\u2019re out of valid options we can replace the other skill with any skill. We\u2019re choosing Arcana so we can scribe scrolls. Second, we want a background that grants two tool proficiencies. Investigator grants Disguise Kit, which is nifty, but it also grants Thieves\u2019 Tools that we already get from Artificer allowing yet another free replacement. For our replacement we\u2019ve chosen Carpenter\u2019s Tools.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>From Centaur, we choose to take Survival. Artificer automatically gives us thieves&#8217; tools and tinker\u2019s tools. We also choose Investigation, Leatherworker\u2019s Tools, and Perception. Once we have Artillerist Specialty we also gain Woodcarver\u2019s Tools. Our background gives us Arcana, Carpenter\u2019s Tools, Disguise Kit, and Insight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an Artificer, we have expertise with tools at sixth level as long as we\u2019re proficient. Interestingly while the Artificer is designed more around Artisan\u2019s Tools, this Expertise applies to all tools, so if you want a different background or race, we prefer backgrounds with two tools and if a race can give us tools by trading in other proficiencies that\u2019s also a great thing to look for.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we take the Fey Touched feat. We put the ability increase into Intelligence and we choose Bane as our spell. We want Bane to combine with our Flamethrower cannon to make it harder for our foes to avoid the full blast as well as the spells of our fellow casters. We could instead choose Bless if our party has more attack rolls than saving throws which does benefit our Force Ballista as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we take an ASI for +2 Intelligence to cap it at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, we take Mobile, increasing our walking speed to 50 and allowing us to take a swing at something in melee if we don\u2019t want to Disengage. Because we\u2019ve got our cannon on our back, we can reposition it very quickly to get the most output in any given round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth and nineteenth level, we can take ASIs for Constitution, which would cap it at 20. Alternatively, we could take two hybrid feats that can choose Constitution, such as Skill Expert and Chef for alternate benefits while hitting 18. Other options include Warcaster for Advantage on those Concentration saves and Tough for more hit points. The build already has all the offensive tools it needs by now, these are just different defensive options that can be taken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infusions\">Infusions<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll get to learn 12 Infusions but eventually only have a maximum of 6 active at any given time. While it is tempting to hoard all the infusions, consider that putting all of these bonuses and magical items on other players is far more powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At second level, we have four options, but can only make two at a time, so we take Enhanced Arcane Focus and Enhanced Defense for our regular infusions. Our other two options can be anything so we\u2019ll pick Enhanced Weapon and Replicate Magic Item (Bag of Holding) because those can be useful to our party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixth level, we can learn two more and increase to three at a time. The repulsion shield and the spell-refueling ring are good options here so we pick them up. At this level, if we\u2019re using the Enhanced Focus then we can probably share one of these infusions with another party member, but if we\u2019ve handed out Enhanced Armor and Enhanced Weapon, pick one of these to wear. Don\u2019t forget that Infused items count as a spell focus for Artificer spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tenth level, we get another pair and are allowed four at a time. Winged Boots are our new personal pick of the pile. With a fly speed equal to our walking speed, we fly nice and fast. If someone in our party <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/gloom-stalker\/\">benefits from going first<\/a>, the Helm of Awareness is a great present. Alternatively the Cloak of Protection would be able to add +1 to AC and saves for a party member. The basic Enhanced infusions grow to +2 at this level so they stay relevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next level, cantrips are growing stronger again, so if we\u2019re spreading out the items across the party, handing the Enhanced Arcane Focus off to a Warlock for those three Eldritch Blasts might edge out over our cannon at this level if our party has one. Bracers of Archery on the other hand, will give anyone firing a bow +2 on damage rolls, so if there\u2019s an archer in our party maybe we hand those over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 14th and 18th levels, we learn two and get to have an additional one active at each level. At that point we already have all the good ones we need, so it\u2019s up to the individual\u2019s preference at that point.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tactical-combat\">Tactical Combat<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The idea behind this build is to run around the battlefield with 40ft (later 50ft) of walking (later flying) speed to position flamethrower cones wherever they need to be. Assuming our cannon is already assembled and mounted, we can spend our Action doing things like Dashing to reposition harder, or Disengaging to put the cone at an unexpected angle, or maybe even toss out a leveled spell or a cantrip through the Arcane Firearm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something else I need to point out about cones and flight: A 15 foot cone pointed down will hit 9 squares if you&#8217;re 15 ft off the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Medium Armor<br>Shield<br><br>Saves<br>-Constitution<br>-Intelligence<br><br>Skills<br>-Arcana<br>-Insight<br>-Investigation<br>-Perception<br>-Survival<br><br>Tools<br>-Carpenter&#8217;s Tools<br>-Disguise Kit<br>-Leatherworker&#8217;s Tools<br>-Thieves&#8217; Tools<br>-Tinker&#8217;s Tools<br><br>Magical Tinkering<br><br>Spellcasting<br><br>Cantrips<br>-Acid Splash<br>-Mending<br><br>1st level spells<\/td><td>At first level, this example will take the average rolls of the starting gold on 5d4x10, or 12.5&#215;10=125. You may or may not be using the same way of generating starting gold so we\u2019ll list the priority for gear.<br><br>With that we purchase Scale Mail and a Shield first, then a Pack Saddle and tools. We want to prioritise Carpenter\u2019s, Leatherworker\u2019s, and Woodcarver\u2019s tools first, because using these tools together is how we assemble and maintain a mounting harness for putting the cannon onto our flank. We then try to squeeze Thieves\u2019 tools into our budget and if we still have some gold, we can also wear a backpack. Being part horse is pretty awesome.<br><br>We have spells, and while we can prepare anything on our list each day as needed, we have to choose our Cantrips so we\u2019re going to take Acid Splash and Mending.<br><br>Mending is for repairing the cannon when we get it as well as just performing minor repairs on damaged items as needed.<br><br>The reason to go with Acid Splash here is because when we get Arcane Firearm at fifth level, the bonus damage will apply to both targets of Acid Splash. If you wanted to go for something else with a bit more single target punch, take Firebolt instead.<br><br>We have the Arcana skill, so we\u2019re mass-producing scrolls. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/downtime-revisited#ScribingaSpellScroll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xanathar\u2019s Guide p133<\/a>) We may have enough money left from our starting gold to make a 1st-level spell scroll. You can never go wrong with an extra scroll of Cure Wounds.<br><br>Also, compared to potions, scrolls are lighter and take up far less storage space, but if you wanted to choose a different background to get herbalism kit proficiency to brew potions, that\u2019s a valid option.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Infuse Item<br>-Enhanced Arcane Focus<br>-Enhanced Defense<br>-Enhanced Weapon<br>-Replicate Magic Item (Bag of Holding)<\/td><td>We gain infusions here so we\u2019re picking up the assortment of basic and useful +1 bonus infusions.<br><br>We\u2019ll want to take a look at the party to see what we need.

Because it\u2019s a spell attack despite not being a spell, the bonus to spell attack rolls from the focus applies, as does ignoring half-cover.<br><br>If we\u2019re going to focus on the other types of cannon however, Enhanced Focus does not apply.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Fey Touched<br>+1 Intelligence<br>Spells<br>-Bane -or- Bless<br>-Misty Step<\/td><td>At this level we take the Fey Touched Feat and start to nail down what kind of cannon we want to lean towards.<br><br>Of the list available from Fey Touched, I recommend either Bane or Bless. Bane will give your foes a hard time dodging the Flamethrower and ruin their attack rolls. Bless on the other hand will make your Force Ballista more accurate and enhance your party\u2019s attacks and saves.<br><br>Given the choice I will take Bane because Artificers also have Faerie Fire if the Force Ballista needs help landing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Arcane Firearm<br><br>2nd-level spells<\/td><td>We have a magic gun. Where\u2019d we purchase that?<br><br>The Arcane Firearm is a special spell focus that makes <em>Artificer<\/em> spells do more damage. Specifically, the extra damage is not an additional die but the value rolled on a d8 is added to a damage roll, meaning that it is not increased by a critical hit.<br><br>To get the most value out of this, try to use spells that hit an area. The damage for an AoE is rolled once and applied to all targets. Acid Splash is a great cantrip example of this which is why we chose that spell at first level. Thunderwave (1st level) and Shatter (2nd level) are great leveled AoE spells we could also use this with. Later on we can even use Fireball (3rd level) with this as well.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Infusions<br>-Repulsion Shield<br>-Spell-refuelling ring<br><br>Tool Expertise<\/td><td>We learn two new infusions, Repulsion Shield and Spell-refuelling ring.
