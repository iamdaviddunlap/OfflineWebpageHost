Thanks to the Primal Spell List, they have some of the healing capabilities of the Cleric, as well as some of the blasting capabilities of the Wizard. But the Druid goes far beyond their spell list: Druids can train a powerful Animal Companion to fight alongside them; they can transform into beasts like wolves, dinosaurs, dragons, and kaiju; or, they can double-down on their core class features, allowing them to do things like conjuring storms or talking to plants at will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, the Druid most frequently serves as a Blaster, Healer, and Support Caster. Depending on your build, you can easily also serve as a Defender, Face, Scout, and Striker. However, this broad skillset means that the class can be complicated to build and play, and you&#8217;ll need to plan out your build well in advance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Druid Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Druidic Orders<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#conventional\">Conventional<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wild-abilities\">Wild Order<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Druid-feats\">Druid Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Druid-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Druid-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells\">Druid Focus Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

This conveniently boosts both your Perception and your Will Saves in addition to your spells and your class DC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+ hit points is normal for a\n\tspellcaster, but if you plan to rely heavily on Wild Shape you need to invest\n\tin Constitution and you should consider the Toughness feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Druid&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies can best be described as &#8220;average at best&#8221;. Across the board,\n\tthe Druid&#8217;s starting proficiencies and proficiency improvements are almost\n\tprecisely average compared to other classes, but their attacks and defenses\n\tmatch the worst in the game. Fortunately you&#8217;ve got plenty of spellcasting to\n\trely upon.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perception<\/span>: Starts poor and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tincrease much (though it does increase early), but your emphasis on Wisdom\n\t\twill make up the difference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Trained in Fortitude and\n\t\tReflex saves, and with your high Wisdom, Expert proficiency in Will Saves\n\t\twill make your Will Saves excellent. You have plenty of Ability Boosts to\n\t\tthrow around, so you can pad your saving throws, but your proficiencies are\n\t\tunimpressive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 4+ Trained skills,\n\t\twhich is normal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: Only Simple Weapons and unarmed\n\t\tattacks, but using weapons is a rarity for most druids. The Druid&#8217;s\n\t\tproficiency with weapons is among the worst in the game, increasing at the\n\t\tsame rate as the Wizard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: Medium armor is fine but since\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t wear metal armor you can&#8217;t use anything better than Hide. On top\n\t\tof that, the Druid&#8217;s proficiency in armor is the among the worst in the\n\t\tgame, increasing at the same rate as the Wizard. Fortunately, you do get\n\t\tShield Block so you can count on a shield to supplement your otherwise poor\n\t\tdefenses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Class DC<\/span>: You start at Trained and never\n\t\timprove. Fortunately, none of the Druid&#8217;s class features or feats use your\n\t\tClass DC, so as long as you avoid external options like Critical Effects\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll be fine.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Primal Spellcasting<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Spells<\/span>: Heightening spells is\n\t\tan important mechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many spells scale with spell level,\n\t\tallowing them to stay relevant long after you learned them. Since druids\n\t\tdon&#8217;t use a Spell Repertoire, you can prepare a spell at any level that you\n\t\tcan cast.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Fantastic every time, on any\n\t\tcharacter, in any amount. Druids can prepare 5 cantrips each day (if you\n\t\thave the first printing the Core Rulebook, this was corrected in\n\t\terrata).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Anathema<\/span>: Prohibiting metal armor means that\n\tyour best types of armor are light armor or Hide armor until you can afford\n\tarmor made from special materials like Darkwood or Dragon Hide, but those are\n\t12th-level items so it&#8217;s going to be a while, and by then you&#8217;ve gotten two\n\trounds of ability boosts so hitting 16 Dexterity shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Druidic Language<\/span>: Neat, but unless your GM\n\tputs other druids into the game it&#8217;s basically useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Druidic Order<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Druidic Orders&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield Block<\/span>: With poor armor options and\n\tpoor armor proficiency, the ability to Raise a Shield and use the Shield Block\n\treaction can dramatically improve your durability, especially at low levels\n\twhen you have few hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Empathy<\/span>: If you&#8217;re good at Diplomacy,\n\tyou can make an entire creature type non-threatening. However, you can also do\n\tthe same thing with spells like Calm Animal, so there isn&#8217;t a huge motivation\n\tto invest in Face skills if you weren&#8217;t going to do so already.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Druid Feats<\/strong>: See Druid feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alertness<\/span>: Your only improvement to\n\tPerception, and you get it at level 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span>: Your only improvement to\n\tFortitude saves, and you get it at level 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: Your only improvement\n\tto Reflex saves, and you get it at level 5.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Spellcaster<\/span>: Better spell attacks and\n\tspell DCs. Standard for full spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid Weapon Expertise<\/span>: You are still garbage\n\twith weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resolve<\/span>: You are very good at Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Medium Armor Expertise<\/span>: This is as good as\n\tyou will ever get with armor. You never get armor specialization effects, so\n\tmedium armor will be worse than light armor in most ways.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: You are still garbage\n\twith weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Spellcaster<\/span>: Better spell attacks and\n\tspell DCs. Standard for full spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Legendary Spellcaster<\/span>: Better spell attacks\n\tand spell DCs. Standard for full spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Hierophant<\/span>: 10th-level spells are\n\tcrazy. You can spend a class feat to get another, but it&#8217;s unlikley that\n\tyou&#8217;ll ever cast more than 2 10th-level spells in a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Druidic Orders<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your subclass grants you a Trained skill, an Order Spell (which is a Focus Spell), and a Druid Class Feat. There are also a handful of Druid Class Feats which are exclusive to a specific Druidic Order. You start with one order, but you can take the Order Explorer class feat to get the benefits of multiple orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"animal\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Animal<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An Animal Companion is a great expansion to your existing capabilities, and since you can direct it with a single Action it&#8217;s a great way to get more out of your turn without giving up the ability to cast a spell. While you can do without Heal Animal (which means Order Explorer is an option), it&#8217;s a great way to keep your Animal Companion combat-ready without consuming other limited resources so if you plan to include Animal Order it should probably be your first choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skill: Athletics<\/span>: Athletics is generally\n\t\tuseful, but I have no idea what it has to do with animals or Animal\n\t\tCompanions. I guess you already get Nature, and since Nature is used to\n\t\thandle animals Paizo probably didn&#8217;t know what else to do.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feat: Animal Companion<\/span>: Animal Companions\n\t\tare powerful, but also complicated. For help with your Animal Companion, see\n\t\tmy\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/animal-companions\">Practical Guide to Animal Companions<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell: Heal Animal<\/span>: See &#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"leaf\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Leaf<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leaf Domain feats are mostly bad, and can usually be replaced by spells. Leshy Familiar is great, but you can get it from Order Explorer if that&#8217;s all that you want from the Order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to play your party&#8217;s Face, Leaf Order is likely your best bet. Diplomacy is obviously crucial, and if you do plan to use the Leaf Order feats you&#8217;ll want enough Charisma to make them effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skill: Diplomacy<\/span>: Essential in any\n\t\tparty, but Charisma is typically a dump stat for the Druid. Several of the\n\t\tLeaf Order&#8217;s unique feats involve talking to plants, but they&#8217;re not very\n\t\tgood so you can ignore them in favor of using spells with roughly identical\n\t\teffects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feat: Leshy Familiar<\/span>: Familiars are really\n\t\tgood. For help with your familiar, see our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell: Goodberry<\/span>: See &#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"storm\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Storm<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A great concept, but the feats and Focus Spells are really disappointing.\n\tStorm Order is notably the easiest way to expand your Focus Pool without\n\tmulticlassing, but it&#8217;s a big investment for little payoff when multiclassing\n\tis so easy to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skill: Acrobatics<\/span>: Used to maneuver in\n\t\tflight, and you&#8217;ll need that if you take Stormwind Flight. You need to be at\n\t\tleast Trained, but you may not need to rush to increase your proficiency so\n\t\tlong as your Dexterity is decent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feat: Storm Born<\/span>: The Primal Spell List\n\t\tincludes numerous options for using weather to impede other creaturs. Even\n\t\tlow-level options like Obscuring Mist can give you a significant advantage\n\t\tin combat thanks to Storm Born.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell: Tempest Surge<\/span>: See &#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wild\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wild Shape is the only thing you need from this order, so if you can spare a feat at 2nd level to take Order Explorer, that&#8217;s a great way to get Wild Shape. Wild Shape is powerful and fun, but it&#8217;s also really complicated, so see our <a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a> for more help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One word of warning: Wild Order doesn&#8217;t get any feats that expand your Focus Pool beyond 1 point, so consider combining Wild with another order or multiclass into something that makes it easy to expand your Focus Pool. Otherwise, expect to use Wild Shape once per fight, then immediately Refocus as soon as you can unless you want to rely on Form Control and use much weaker forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill: Intimidation<\/span>: Charisma is a dump\n\t\tstat for most Druids, so Intimidation can be hard. You can use Skill Feats\n\t\tto make Intimidation an interesting option in combat, but that likely\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t justify investing in Charisma.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feat: Wild Shape<\/span>: See &#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell: Wild Surge<\/span>: See &#8220;Focus Spells&#8221;,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conventional\">Conventional<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most druid only need Wisdom to fuel their spells and class features, then enough Dexterity and Constitution to keep them alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump. Druids don&#8217;t get good enough armor\n\tor weapon proficiencies to be effective in melee, so fighting in melee is very\n\tdangerous.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: You need at least 14 if you want to\n\twear hide armor or 16 if you want to wear studded leather. At low levels, you\n\tmight choose to use a crossbow or other ranged weapon in combat, though I\n\tdon&#8217;t recommend doing so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are always important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Only useful for skills, but your\n\tability score needs are otherwise limited, so more skills are a good way to\n\tbenefit from Ability Boosts which you won&#8217;t otherwise use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Your Key Ability Score.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Most druids can dump Charisma, but if\n\tyou plan to play your party&#8217;s Face or to pursue the Leaf Order you&#8217;ll benefit\n\tfrom a little bit of Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wild-abilities\">Wild Order<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This set of ability scores assumes that you&#8217;ll be investing heavily in Wild Shape and its associated feats. If you don&#8217;t plan to take Form Control, you can dump Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: You need 14 for Form Control at level\n\t4, and you need 18 for Perfect Form Control at 15th level, and you&#8217;ll get\n\tthree sets of ability boosts in between those two points. If you invest\n\theavily in Strength, you may be able to beat the Attack Bonus provided by Wild\n\tShape spells, but that&#8217;s only likely to happen if you invest heavily in\n\tHandwraps of Mighty Blows and if you&#8217;re using Form Control to extend Wild\n\tShape&#8217;s duration at the expense of casting Wild Shape 2 spell levels lower\n\tthan nromal.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: If you&#8217;re in Wild Shape, your\n\tDexterity doesn&#8217;t matter except for Acrobatics checks. You should still get at\n\tleast 14 to fill out hide armor in case you get attacked before you can Wild\n\tShape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Con<\/span>: Wild Shape will give you some temporary\n\thit points, but they won&#8217;t last. You need as many hit points as you can get.\n\tExpect to start with 16 and boost it at every possible opportunity, then add\n\tToughness.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: More skills never hurt, but otherwise\n\tIntelligence doesn&#8217;t offer the Druid much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: When Wild Shape runs out or when\n\tturning into an animal can&#8217;t solve a problem, you still need to be a druid.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: You get Intimidation for free, but\n\tyou&#8217;re not better at being a face than any other character. There are some\n\toptions which seem to imply that Wild Shape builds should work well with\n\tIntimidation, but the inability to speak or activate magic items while\n\tpolymorphed makes it exceptionally hard to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wisdom increases are obviously crucial, but otherwise you have plenty of room to consider other Ancestry traits. Wild Order druids who plan to rely on Wild Shape should also look for a Consitution increase and high racial hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catfolk<\/span>: The Wisdom Flaw is fixable thanks\n\tto the Optional Flaw rules, but there&#8217;s not much here that&#8217;s worth the effort.\n\tCat&#8217;s Luck is good but not essential, and most of the Catfolk&#8217;s other feat\n\toptions won&#8217;t help the Druid.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Constitution and Wisdom boosts, and a\n\tCharisma flaw. Charisma is the druid&#8217;s dump stat, so this lines up perfectly.\n\tFree Ability Boosts are always nice, but honestly you don&#8217;t need it so use it\n\thowever you like. The Dwarf gets the most racial hit points, and Dwarven\n\tStoutness at level 9 adds more hit points on top of everything else (including\n\tToughness). The Forge Dwarf and Strong-Blooded Dwarf add damage resistance\n\twhich can add even more to the Dwarf&#8217;s excellent durability. This is a great\n\toption for any druid, but it&#8217;s absolutely fantastic for Wild Shape builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The ability scores can work for most\n\tdruids, but there&#8217;s very little in the Elf&#8217;s Ancestry Feats which helps the\n\tDruid.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome<\/span>: While the Gnome&#8217;s ability scores\n\taren&#8217;t great on their own, the Gnome otherwise has a lot to offer, especially\n\tto druids focused on spellcasting. Use the Voluntary Flaw rules and you&#8217;ll\n\thave two Free Ability Boosts to put into Wisdom and one other Ability Score.\n\tSeveral of the Gnome Heritages have interesting benefits, and perhaps the most\n\tinteresting is the ability to get an additional cantrip from any of the four\n\tpublished spell lists. Keep in mind that these are &#8220;Innate Spells&#8221;, so they&#8217;re\n\tCharisma-based. I recommend sticking to options that don&#8217;t depend on your\n\tspellcasting ability score because your Charisma will lag behind your Wisdom.\n\tThis means no attack options, but options like Guidance and Prestidigitation\n\tare great. You can then get another cantrip from Fey World Magic and a\n\tfamiliar from Animal Accomplice. You can also take Gnome Weapon Familiarity to\n\tmake the Gnome Hooked Hammer a Simple weapon for you, but I don&#8217;t recommend it\n\tbecause druids are just awful at using weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Goblin<\/span>: Using the Voluntary Flaw rules, you\n\tcan put both additional Ability Flaws into Charisma (or split them between\n\tStrength and Intelligence) and both free Ability Boosts into Wisdom, giving\n\tyou a final result of +2 Dex, +2 Wis, -2 Cha. Once you&#8217;ve dealt with that\n\tmess, the Goblin&#8217;s Ancestry Feats are very good. Burn It! is an absolute must\n\tsince the Primal Spell List includes numerous options for fire damage, and\n\tGoblin Scuttle can help you get out of melee combat if you&#8217;re not built for\n\tmelee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: The Halfling&#8217;s Ability Boosts work\n\tgreat, and if you use the Voluntary Flaw rules you can even manage a Strength\n\tincrease to help support a Wild Shape build without too much trouble. Staple\n\tHalfling Ancestry Feat options like Halfling Luck are always welcome, and you\n\tcan use Cultural Adaptability to borrow great options like Fey World Magic\n\tfrom the Gnome or Burn It! from the Goblin.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Two Flexible Ability Boosts, and\n\tAmbitious Nature is the only way to get one of the Druid&#8217;s 1st-level metamagic\n\tfeats at level 1, and at high levels options like Multitalented add a lot of\n\tuseful things. You have several great Heritage options, too. For example:\n\tHalf-Orcs can make use of orc Ferocity to give them an emergency survival\n\toption for Wild Shape builds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Kobold<\/span>: Put your Free Boost into Wisdom and\n\tyou&#8217;re ready to build a back-line sorcerer. Kobold Breath can be a helpful\n\treplacement for offensive cantrips, especially since it deals area damage, and\n\tthe Kobold&#8217;s other feats can get you some Innate Spellcasting to complement\n\tyour regular spellcasting. Unfortunately, the Innate Spellcasting is Arcane\n\tand Charisma-based, so try to stick to utility options and buffs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Orc<\/span>: The Orc is an odd choice for the\n\tDruid, but it can work for the Wild Order Druid. The Druid doesn&#8217;t have a\n\tbuilt-in way to make unarmed strikes viable outside of Wild Shape, but the Orc\n\tdoes. On top of that, Bloody Blows appears to work while in Wild Shape. And,\n\tof course, Orc Ferocity is great for anyone expecting to be on the front lines\n\tin melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ratfolk<\/span>: The boosts and flaws work fine,\n\tbut the Ratfolk offers nothing else that appeals to the Druid.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tengu<\/span>: Two boosts and no flaws, but the\n\tTengu&#8217;s Ancestry Feats offer nothing that appeals to the Druid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>A Wisdom increase and a Constitution increase are strongly recommended.

That means that you can maximize at most three skills, and the rest of your skills might not advance beyond Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Feats at even-numbered levels, giving you a total of 10 Skill Feats (and maybe another from your Background) by 20th level.

Cat Fall will reduce the\n\t\t\t\teffective distance you&#8217;ve fallen, allowing you to take less damage from\n\t\t\t\ta fall.

Its only unique action is\n\t\tCommand an Animal, but the knowledge actions are very important for handling\n\t\tthe natural world, and the skill feats are helpful for dealing with Primal\n\t\tspells.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonded Animal<\/span>: Basically &#8220;Diet\n\t\t\t\tAnimal Companion&#8221;. While the animal is helpful to you, it&#8217;s not any more\n\t\t\t\tpowerful than a normal animal. You could get a horse to serve as a\n\t\t\t\tmount, or a bird to fetch items and deliver messages, but don&#8217;t look for\n\t\t\t\tanything to fight with.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Natural Medicine<\/span>: This is a bad feat.\n\t\t\t\tIt only applies to Treat Wounds, and if you&#8217;re good at Nature you have\n\t\t\t\teverything that you need to be good at Medicine, too. Instead of wasting\n\t\t\t\ta Skill Feat on this, spend that same Skill Feat to improve your options\n\t\t\t\twith Medicine.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Recognize Spell<\/span>: The ability to\n\t\t\t\trecognize spells can dramatically improve your ability to respond to\n\t\t\t\tthem. Sure, in some cases the spell will be obvious once you&#8217;re familiar\n\t\t\t\twith the game, but more subtle spells like buffs and illusions can be\n\t\t\t\tmuch less effective against you if you know what spell is being cast.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Recognition<\/span>: The Druid has\n\t\t\t\t\t\tno built-in options for using their Reaction, so spending it to use\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRecognize Spell is not a singificant cost.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Train Animal<\/span>: A nice way to add some\n\t\t\t\textra tricks to your Animal Companion so that it can do more than fight\n\t\t\t\tthings.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Occultism<\/span> (Int): Useful, but leave it\n\t\tfor someone with better Intelligence if you can.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Performance<\/span> (Cha): Too situational, and\n\t\tmany druids will dump Charisma.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Religion<\/span> (Wis): An essential Knowledge\n\t\tskill, and you have the Wisdom to back it up.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Guidance<\/span>: Stuck?

Situational, but if you like to rely on spells which\n\t\tmanipulate weather you can put yourself at a significant advantage. Your\n\t\tallies might get annoyed by constantly struggling to see in fog or driving\n\t\train, but you&#8217;ll be just fine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Verdant Weapon<\/span>: The intended benefit is\n\t\tthat you can hide or stow your weapon undetected and without concern for\n\t\tBulk. However, the action economy here is attrocious. You still need to\n\t\tspend an Action to Interact to take the seed out of your pockets or whatever\n\t\tbefore spending an Action to turn it into a weapon. Even if I&#8217;m misreading\n\t\thow actions work here, the benefits are too situational to justify a Class\n\t\tFeat. It&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll turn your seed into a weapon and leave it that\n\t\tway until you need to hide a weapon, so you might take this feat and only\n\t\tuse it once every few levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Widen Spell<\/span>: Essential for blasters. Even\n\t\ta minor boost could mean one or two additional targets with a single spell,\n\t\twhich can dramatically improve how much you get out of your spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Shape<\/span>: Only accessible by taking the\n\t\tWild Order. Wild Shape itself is great, but not until you get access to\n\t\tAnimal Shape when you get 2nd-level spells.

To get the Order&#8217;s Order Spell you will need to take\n\t\tOrder Magic. This is a good option if you want an Order&#8217;s feat, but you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t care about its Order Spell. For example: The Wild Domain&#8217;s 1st-level\n\t\tfeat is Wild Shape, but its Order Spell is Wild Morph. Wild Shape is great,\n\t\tbut Wild Morph is terrible, so Order Explorer is a great way to get access\n\t\tto Wild Shape.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Poison Resistance<\/span>: Damage resistance is\n\t\talways welcome, and if you&#8217;re going for a Wild Shape build you definitely\n\t\twant this to improve your durability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Druid-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Summons<\/span>: Situational. the 10\n\t\tminutes spent here will keep you busy while allies Refocus, and your GM\n\t\tmight let you Refocus at the same time, so the time cost isn&#8217;t a huge\n\t\tdeterrent.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Form Control<\/strong>: For help with Wild Shape and related feats,\n\t\tsee our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Leshy Familiar Secrets<\/span>: You gain an\n\t\textra Familiar Ability from a list of three options not available anywhere\n\t\telse.

Obviously places with lots\n\t\tof plants will make this more useful, but even in more sparse environments\n\t\tyou may be able to get something useful out of this.

You can no longer stockpile\n\t\tGoodberries for an easy cache of healing between combats. At 1st level,\n\t\t1d6+4 healing can save your life, and as Goodberry&#8217;s level scales you can\n\t\teat additional berries to gain additional healing so that it remains viable\n\t\tin combat. As long as you have enough time to Refocus you have infinite\n\t\thealing. You can also get similar results from using the Medicine skill&#8217;s\n\t\tTreat Wounds Activity, but to match the effects of Goodberry you&#8217;ll need to\n\t\tinvest several skill feats and you will still need to eat regular food. If\n\t\tyou have the first printing of the Core Rulebook, Goodberry recieved a\n\t\tsignificant rewrite so be sure to check the new text of the spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal Animal<\/span>: If you have an animal\n\t\tcompanion, you need a way to keep it healed without making it an extra mouth\n\t\tto consume your party&#8217;s limited resources, and there are few better\n\t\trechargeable resources than Focus Spells. The single-action version of the\n\t\tspell can be used the same turn as casting a 2-Action spell (which is most\n\t\tspells), but generally you want to use the 2-Action version because it&#8217;s so\n\t\tmuch more effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tempest Surge<\/span>: Better than a cantrip, and\n\t\tthe Clumsy effect is a decent debuff. As you gain levels, you can take the\n\t\tStorm Retribution to use this as a Reaction, but that requires that you\n\t\tsuffer critical hit in melee. You shouldn&#8217;t be in melee, and you shouldn&#8217;t\n\t\twant to suffer a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Morph<\/span>: At 1st level, this turns\n\t\tyour hands into the equivalent of short swords. As you gain levels, you can\n\t\texpand the effects by taking Wild Shape feats. However, this spell has some\n\t\tproblems due to the design of other parts of the class. First, the Druid\n\t\tdoes not belong in melee combat; your AC is too poor and you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tenough hit points. Second, the feats which improve Wild Morph are the worst\n\t\tWild Shape form feats. Third, if you&#8217;re going to use a Focus Spell to be\n\t\tgood in melee, Wild Shape is more effective. I think the intent of this\n\t\tspell is that it allows the Druid to focus on spellcasting, but to have some\n\t\tmelee options without giving up spellcasting like you do with Wild Shape.\n\t\tWhile it technically meets that goal, it doesn&#8217;t do it well enough that Wild\n\t\tMorph is appealing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Shape<\/span>: Powerful, but extremely\n\t\tcomplex. For help with Wild Shape, see our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stormwind Flight<\/span>: The fact that this is a\n\t\tFocus Spell means that you can cast it repeatedly, and you only need to\n\t\tRefocus to regain the ability to cast it. However, the 1-minute duration\n\t\tmeans that you are likely to only use it in combat or to quickly bypass\n\t\tspecific obstacles, and the 2-Action casting time an the fact that you must\n\t\tspend an Action every turn to Sustain the spell means that you will only\n\t\twant to use this in combat if it&#8217;s absolutely necessary.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Summons<\/span>: This adds a lot of\n\t\tversatility to your summoning options. The ability to add a fly speed or a\n\t\tswim speed makes land-bound options (which are often the strongest) much\n\t\tmore powerful and allows them to be used nearly anywhere. However, the Water\n\t\toption notably omits the ability to breath water, so your summons may still\n\t\tneed to hold their breath if you&#8217;re fighting underwater.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impaling Briars<\/span>: Complicated but\n\t\teffective. The area of effect is vast, allowing you to easily affect large\n\t\tbattlefields. Against multiple foes you will want to use the Impede and Wall\n\t\toptions, but against single targets you can rely on the Entangle option to\n\t\t(hopefully) prevent the target from moving. After you sustain the spell\n\t\t(which takes an Action), you can spend a second Action to attempt to both\n\t\tharm a target and impede its movement. 10d6 damage for an Action is better\n\t\tthan you&#8217;ll get from a Cantrip, so this is a great way to get consistent\n\t\tdamage over the course of several rounds. However, spending a total of 2\n\t\tActions to continue this spell every turn means that you don&#8217;t have the 2\n\t\tActions required to cast most spells. You can take Effortless Concentration\n\t\tto get back one of the Actions, likely allowing you to impale something and\n\t\tcast another spell on the same turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Storm Lord<\/span>: Very similar to Impaling\n\t\tBriars in some ways, but obviously a very different theme. Impaling Briars\n\t\thas more useful effects when you sustain the spell, but Impaling Briars\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t work in the air, and it can only attack enemies up to 20 ft. off the\n\t\tground. The biggest problems with Storm Lord are that the Calm and Rain\n\t\toptions are mostly useless, and the Fog option replicates a 2nd-level spell\n\t\tthat you&#8217;ve been abusing for 14 levels. The big draw is the lightning bolts\n\t\tevery round, and everything else is secondary. Hopefully you took Effortless\n\t\tConcentration to save yourself the Action to Sustain the spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Druid&#8217;s Vestments<\/span>: 1,000gp is a lot for\n\t\twhat you get. +2 to Nature checks isn&#8217;t enough on its own, and one emergency\n\t\tFocus point per day (which is restricted to Order spells) still isn&#8217;t\n\t\tenough.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gorget of the Primal Roar<\/span>: This item is\n\t\tclearly designed for spellcasters using Polymorph spells, such as a druid\n\t\tusing Wild Shape. However, the rules of the Polymorph trait state that &#8220;Your\n\t\tgear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still\n\t\tfunction, but <em>you can\u2019t activate any items<\/em>.&#8221; So even if you had an\n\t\tally strap this to you after you use Wild Shape, it&#8217;s totally useless.
