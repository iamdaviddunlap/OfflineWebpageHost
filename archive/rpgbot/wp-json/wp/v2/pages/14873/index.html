They\u2019re the best at talking, they\u2019re the best at making sure their control spells land, and they\u2019re the most inspiring. They don\u2019t have any fancy buttons to press like Creation or Glamour, but all of their abilities are <em>really good<\/em>. I realize that small paragraph is basically the text on the subclass guide page put through a synonym generator, but it\u2019s true enough that the example build at the bottom of this handbook is a character I actually played and enjoyed immensely. You can listen to some of his adventures <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-episode-11\/\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-episode-20\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While there aren\u2019t many decision points in the build itself, the real elevation of piloting this subclass is knowing when to use your inspiration on your party and when to use it to power Unsettling Words. Especially at levels 3 and 4 (when you get access to it but before you have Font of Inspiration), it can be very easy to burn through all your uses early in a day and then feel underwhelming in combat as you\u2019re no better than an unspecialized Bard and you don\u2019t have much to do to help your friends. With that in mind, we\u2019ll be looking at some ways to help fix that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">College of Eloquence Bard Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-eloquence-bard-ability-scores\">College of Eloquence Bard Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-eloquence-bard-races\">College of Eloquence Bard Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-eloquence-bard-feats\">College of Eloquence Bard Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-eloquence-bard-weapons\">College of Eloquence Bard Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-eloquence-bard-armor\">College of Eloquence Bard Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-college-of-eloquence-bard-build-amiable-jack\">Example Build College of Eloquence Bard Build &#8211; Amiable Jack<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The Rogue&#8217;s\n\t\tReliable Talent feature provides the same benefit, but that&#8217;s an 11th-level\n\t\tfeature. Combined with access to Expertise (which you also get at 3rd\n\t\tlevel) you&#8217;re nearly incapable of failing Charisma (Deception) and Charisma\n\t\t(Persuasion) checks. With a +3 Charisma modifier and Expertise in one of the\n\t\taffected skills, your minimum roll at this level is already a 17, and will\n\t\trapidly improve as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unsettling Words<\/span>: Use this as a Bonus\n\t\tAction, then hit the target with a save-or-suck effect.\n\t\tAdvantage\/Disadvantage are worth a little more than +3\/-3, and the average\n\t\tvalue of your d6 Bardic Inspiration die is 3.5, and increases as you gain\n\t\tlevels, so this is already mathematically better than imposing Disadvantage,\n\t\tand it only gets more effective as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unfailing Inspiration<\/span>: Bardic Inspiration\n\t\tis one of the Bard&#8217;s core features, and while it&#8217;s very powerful it&#8217;s still\n\t\tlimited by a small number of dice. This provides a powerful insurance\n\t\tpolicy, making it much easier to risk a die even if it&#8217;s unlikely to make a\n\t\troll succeed. Between this and Font of Inspiration, you can afford to throw\n\t\tinspiration dice around like confetti.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Universal Speech<\/span>: A limited version of\n\t\tTongues for one hour for free every day, and you can do it again by spending\n\t\ta spell slot. You may still want to learn Comprehend Languages so that you\n\t\tcan understand other creatures, especially if your party has access to\n\t\tritual spellcasting.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infectious Inspiration<\/span>: Consider this\n\t\talongside Unfailing Inspiration. If a creature adds a die and fails, they\n\t\tkeep the die. If they pass, you spend your Reaction to pass the die to a\n\t\tdifferent creature, and the process starts over. You get to do this a number\n\t\tof times equal to your Charisma modifier, so it&#8217;s effectively 5 additional\n\t\tuses of Basic Inspiration per day, not counting the ones which fail but\n\t\tdon&#8217;t result in a lost die.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-eloquence-bard-ability-scores\">College of Eloquence Bard Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No change from standard Bard.

This is a conversation to have with your group and deciding the answer is beyond the scope of this article, but I have a suggestion for how to run it: because you choose to roll the Psi-die after you see what you rolled and the results of the initial d20 roll, my suggestion is that the Psi-die is only considered spent if the results are different after rolling it.\u201d<br><br>Moving on. Sleep has outlived its usefulness, and we have two excellent support spells we need to pick up. We\u2019ve already discussed why JoAT makes us the second-best dispellers behind only Abjurer Wizards, and Tiny Hut is the way to make sure you can actually sleep and get your spells back while out and about.<br><br>Universal Speech is here to make sure our enormous Deception and Persuasion transcend any language barrier.<br><br>Countercharm is also present in case you expect your whole party to get feared next round by some overly telegraphed mechanic or something.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Charm Monster<\/td><td>Last level was jam-packed with stuff, so this one\u2019s a breather by comparison. With that said, I want to point out a couple important things about the interaction with the Lute. First is that the Disadvantage-on-saves function of the Lute doesn\u2019t have a usage limit. Second is that it applies to <em>all <\/em>targets, so if you upcast Charm Monster later, you can turn half an encounter against the other half of the encounter with a little bit of \u201chelp, your friends are going crazy and attacking us,\u201d and let your party grab a drink while the battle fights itself.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Cha 18 -&gt; 20<br><br>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Greater Invisibility<br><br>Retrain Spell:<br>Crown of Madness -&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">Polymorph<\/a><\/td><td>Now that we have a couple spell slots at this level, we\u2019ll trade out Crown since we have Charm that does something very similar but has no targeting restrictions.

This is the antidote to several party members dropping all at once to an upcast Fireball.<br><br>Trading out Lesser Restoration for Greater is required since we\u2019re short on spells known, and the diamond dust component doesn\u2019t really matter because 5e\u2019s economy doesn\u2019t make sense and <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/gold-rpgbot-news-s2e70\/\">gold isn\u2019t very useful<\/a>.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Bardic Inspiration Improvement<br><br>Expertise:<br>&#8211; Intimidation<br>&#8211; Perception<br><br>New Cantrip:<br>&#8211; Minor Illusion<br><br>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Revivify<br>&#8211; Find Greater Steed<\/td><td>We take Expertise in the remaining Charisma-based conversation skill and Perception because Expertise is as good as 18 Wisdom right now for that purpose.<br><br>For the new Cantrip, summon a bad MS Paint drawing of something to hide behind.

That may not seem like a lot at this level, but on an average party of 4 members, in a day where we wake up, have a fight, short rest, have another fight, short rest again, fight one last time, and then sleep, that\u2019s over 200 points of possible healing we don\u2019t have to do.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Forcecage<br><br>Retrain Spell:<br>Tiny hut -&gt; Magnificent Mansion<br><br>Song of Rest Improvement<\/td><td>Forcecage is one of the best spells in the game.
