They don&#8217;t seem to favor any one role in the party, which leaves you a lot of room to build an effective Warlock without being pushed toward one play style. Weapon-focused and spell-focus warlocks both work well, but higher-level features like Eldritch Hex and Create Thrall do encourage you to favor spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the 2024 Great Old One Warlock.

The duration is short, so you&#8217;re going to\n\t\tuse it at short range simply because you can&#8217;t get very far before the\n\t\tduration expires. It has almost no mechanical impact until you pick up\n\t\tClairvoyant Combatant.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Old One Spells.<\/span>: An eclectic mix\n\t\twith a good mix of debuffs, save-or-suck, area control, and utility options.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1<\/span>: Two great single-target\n\t\t\t\tcontrol effects, but they will become obsolete beyond low levels since\n\t\t\t\tthey don&#8217;t scale with upcasting.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Detect Thoughts is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful. Phantasmal Force is a powerful save-or-suck\n\t\t\t\toption.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 3<\/span>: Clairvoyance is a fantastic\n\t\t\t\tscouting option if you have a normal number of spell slots like\n\t\t\t\tliterally any other spellcaster, but Warlocks really need to save their\n\t\t\t\tspell slots for something more significant and impactful. Hunger of\n\t\t\t\tHadar is absolutely amazing area control.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Confusion is unreliable, but\n\t\t\t\tSummon Aberration is great.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5<\/span>: Modify Memory is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but with Eldritch Hex you can cast it without\n\t\t\t\tSomatic\/Verbal components, allowing you to safely use it\n\t\t\t\tmid-conversation, thereby making it much more powerful. Telekinesis is a\n\t\t\t\tgreat utility, and you can use it to hoist melee-only enemies into\n\t\t\t\tmid-air.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Spells<\/span>: Psychic damage is rarely\n\t\tresisted, allowing you to use direct damage spells with much less caution\n\t\tthan many spellcasters. The ability to cast Enchantment\/Illusion components\n\t\tsubtly can be very helpful in social situations where casting spells can be\n\t\tconsidered hostile.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Clairvoyant Combatant<\/span>: Excellent both\n\t\toffensively and defensively. Melee Pact of the Blade builds will enjoy the\n\t\tdefensive benefits more than most Warlocks, but any Warlock will enjoy\n\t\tAdvantage with Eldritch Blast. Of course, you can do the same thing with\n\t\tDarkness and Devil&#8217;s Sight with a better duration and no saving throws.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This competes for your Bonus Action with Hex, so you&#8217;ll need to pick\n\t\t\twhich one you want to use first. You can reapply Hex, but not Clairvoyant\n\t\t\tCombatant, so save Clairvoyant Combatant for powerful single enemies, then\n\t\t\tuse it before applying Hex until you get Eldritch Hex, at which point you\n\t\t\tshould reverse the order so that your target has Disadvantage on the\n\t\t\tWisdom save.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You only get to use this once per Short or Long Rest, so you can&#8217;t afford\n\t\t\tto use it in every fight. You can recharge it with a spell slot, but only\n\t\t\tdo that if you have multiple fights with single powerful foes that justify\n\t\t\tit.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Hex<\/span>: Disadvantage on saves\n\t\tagainst a chosen ability score allows you and your party to easily\n\t\tsave-or-suck your target to death. The only problem is that most\n\t\tsave-or-suck spells require Concentration, and, if you cast a Concentration\n\t\tspell, you stop concentrating on Hex, thereby losing the benefits of Eldritch\n\t\tHex. You&#8217;ll need to rely on your friends or look for spells that don&#8217;t need\n\t\tConcentration.\n\t\t<p>This works very well with Clairvoyant Combatant.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Create Thrall<\/span>: Summon Aberration is a\n\t\tgood spell. The ability to remove the Concentration requirement is great,\n\t\ttoo, allowing you to keep Concentration on Hex so that you and your\n\t\taberration can get a damage bonus. The Temporary Hit Points also mean that\n\t\tyour aberration is unusually durable.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, you&#8217;re casting Summon Aberration at level 5, and it will never\n\t\t\timprove. This means that your aberration will become relatively less\n\t\t\tthreatening as you gain levels, making it less and less impactful over\n\t\t\ttime. It&#8217;s still good, but it won&#8217;t keep pace with regular spellcasters\n\t\t\twho are summoning creatures.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Great Old One Warlock Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/#backgrounds\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Warlocks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"species\">Great Old One Warlock Species<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/#species\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Warlocks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Great Old One Warlock Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Warlocks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Great Old One Warlock Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Warlocks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Great Old One Warlock Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Warlocks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Great Old One Warlock Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Warlocks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Great Old One Warlock Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/warlock\/#multiclassing\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27771\">other Warlocks<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Great Old One Warlock Build &#8211; Mind Games<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In this build, we&#8217;re going to lean into spellcasting.

One With Shadows allows us to cast Invisibility almost whenever we want, so there&#8217;s rarely an excuse to be visible when combat starts unless you&#8217;re concentrating on Hex or something.<br><br>If enemies are crowded together at a safe distance, hit them with Hunger of Hadar and use Ray of Frost to slow their escape. Remember that you can change the damage type of both spells with Psychic Spells. If they&#8217;re too close to you, hit them with Fear and force them to drop what they&#8217;re holding and run away. Remember that it&#8217;s subtle thanks to Psychic Spells.<br><br>Cantrips improve at this level, too.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Clairvoyant Combatant<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Vampiric Touch<\/td><td>Clairvoyant Combatant immediately changes our tactics. Against single enemies, we&#8217;re not suddenly very dangerous. Use Grasp of Hadar to pull enemies into melee with you. They&#8217;ll have Disadvantage to hit you, which at least partially offsets your middling AC, while you have Advantage to hit them, and can attack safely in melee thanks to Spell Sniper.<br><br>Just keep an eye on your hit points. Use Vampiric Touch and borrow some of your enemy&#8217;s if it becomes a problem.<br><br>Remember that Clairvoyant Combatant allows a save. If you&#8217;re worried at all, use Mind Sliver to penalize their save.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Ghostly Gaze<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Banishment<br>&#8211; Confusion*<br>&#8211; Summon Aberration*<\/td><td>Ghostly Gaze lets you see through walls. You need to see your target to use Clairvoyant Combatant. Therefore, you can see through the wall, then hit your target with Clairvoyant Combatant before combat starts. Neat. You can also do this with Clairvoyance, but Ghostly Gaze is portable and doesn&#8217;t eat one of your 2 spell slots.<br><br>Unfortunately, it requires Concentration, and you immediately end Concentration when you start casting another spell that requires Concentration, so you can&#8217;t use it to drop Hunger of Hadar or Summon Aberration on the other side of a wall. You also can&#8217;t attack through solid walls. But you <em>can<\/em> use Mind Sliver with no components, allowing you silently deal psychic damage while your target(s) panics and dies.<br><br>When you&#8217;re in combat, use Eldritch Blast with Grasp of Hadar to pull enemies into melee with your summoned creature. If you summon a Mind Flayer, they do automatic damage to adjacent enemies. Have your summon Dodge if your enemies try to attack it, then hold them in place with some combination of Grasp of Hadar and Ray of Frost.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: War Caster (Cha 18 -&gt; 19)<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Charm Monster<\/td><td>War Caster both helps us maintain Concentration and allows us to hit enemies with spells in place of an Opportunity Attack. This works very well if you pull enemies into melee with you using Grasp of Hadar. You can then hit them with Ray of Frost to slow them, making it easier to pull them back toward you. If they want to stay in melee, either let your mind flayer eat them or hit them with Vampiric Touch.<br><br>An extra silly trick: You can make an opportunity attack when a creature leaves your reach. You can change your reach using a weapon, even if you&#8217;re not proficient in that weapon. You can, therefore, use a whip to extend your reach and then use War Caster when they leave. Use Grasp of Hadar to pull enemies into your 10-foot reach without pulling them adjacent to you. They may still walk up to you, of course.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Visions of Distant Realms<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Hold Monster<br>&#8211; Modify Memory*<br>&#8211; Telekinesis*<\/td><td>Visions of Distant Realms gives us a very safe way to scout at no cost. If you can walk it around walls or corners, you can accomplish the same things that you could with Ghostly Gaze, so you might retrain Ghostly Gaze into something else like Gift of the Protectors or Repelling Blast.<br><br>Hold Monster is our big single-target off switch. Hit enemies with Mind Sliver first if you can, and remember that you can cast it without V\/S components.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Eldritch Hex<br>Thought Shield<br>New Cantrip:<br>&#8211; Synaptic Static<\/td><td>Eldritch Hex is why we didn&#8217;t build around weapons. Imposing Disadvantage on saves against all of our spells is very powerful. However, it requires that we concentrate on Hex, which means that we need to focus on instantaneous damage spells like Blight and Synaptic Static. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t get a ton of great options for that. Cantrips work, of course, but, if you&#8217;re resorting to Cantrips, you can use Eldritch Blast and attack with Advantage.<br><br><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Eyebite<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Eyebite is just really, incredibly good. If you&#8217;re tired of Eyebite, consider Create Undead so that you can have pet ghouls. Use Hold Monster<br><br>At this point our extra space for prepared spells is very flexible. Use any further prepared spells to collect Ritual spells unless you have other ideas that you&#8217;re excited about.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: ASI<br>&#8211; Dex 15 -&gt; 16<br>&#8211; Cha 19 -&gt; 20<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>The ASI is boring, but the math is good.<br><br>There also aren&#8217;t any new invocation options at this level that work for us. Consider Repelling Blast if you haven&#8217;t already retrained something to get it. You might also take Pact of the Chain to get a cool pet.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Finger of Death<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Finger of Death isn&#8217;t great because it&#8217;s a Con save. But, if you can hit a creature with both Mind Sliver and Eldritch Hex, they have Disadvantage <em>and<\/em> -1d4 on their save, which works out to roughly -6 on average. That&#8217;s pretty great. Also, Finger of Death is one of very few spells that can get you a permanent pet undead without a daily spell slot tax, so it&#8217;s very tempting to start a collection.<br><br>If you want to play it safe, Forcecage is still great.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Create Thrall<\/td><td>This does a lot to keep your spell slots relevant in combat once Mystic Arcanum comes online, though remember that your summons&#8217; stats won&#8217;t scale since your spell slots are capped at level 5. If you&#8217;re using Arcane Eye or Ghostly Gaze to see stuff around corners or behind walls, you can cast Summon Aberration and drop a monster into the room to do stuff for you.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Befuddlement<br>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Witch Sight<br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Use Arcane Eye to find an enemy spellcaster. Hit them with Hex from around a corner, then hit them with Befuddlement. You&#8217;ve made no sound, they&#8217;ve had no opportunity to see you, and they&#8217;re making an Intelligence save (consistently the lowest save on average) with Disadvantage. That fight is now functionally over before it began.<br><br>Witch Sight isn&#8217;t super exciting and it&#8217;s not always useful, but it does work through Arcane Eye, which is pretty great.<br><br>If you haven&#8217;t already retrained it, retrain One With Shadows into Shroud of Shadow from Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient (Con 14 -&gt;15)<\/td><td>A massive boost to our Constitution saves. Between this and Advantage on saves for Concentration from War Caster, you&#8217;re in great shape.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/true-polymorph-and-shapechange\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11230\">True Polymorph<\/a><br>New Prepared Spells<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Using Power Word Kill around a corner feels very on brand for this build, but it&#8217;s just not a good spell even with the 2024 damage buff, so we&#8217;ll go for True Polymorph and turn ourselves into a problem.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>New Eldritch Invocation:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>I honestly have no idea what to do with another Invocation at this level.

Weapon-focused and spell-focus warlocks both work well, but higher-level features like Eldritch Hex and Create Thrall do encourage you to favor spellcasting.
