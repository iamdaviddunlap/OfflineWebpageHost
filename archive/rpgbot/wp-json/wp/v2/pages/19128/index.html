With two excellent Channel options, you end up having to decide very carefully how you use your resources if you\u2019re allowed the Harness Divine Power Optional Class Feature, because basically anything you could do with it would be a good idea given the right circumstance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>As usual for a Paladin, it\u2019s also an excellent Defender, taken to new heights by that unique protection mechanic.

You can&#8217;t even use Rebuke the Violent without negating this\n\t\tfeature for that creature for the day.\n\t\t<p>Note that the damage which you deal to other creatures is half of what\n\t\t\tyou take <em>after<\/em> applying resistances, so if a creature deals 4\n\t\t\tdamage, you take 2 and they take 1. That&#8217;s not going to kill anything in a\n\t\t\thurry, but it might be abough to scare them off. If you have enough hit\n\t\t\tpoints, you could risk walking around unarmored and let people beat you\n\t\t\tuntil they get tired of taking radiant damage. Protective Spirit is\n\t\t\thealing you for 16+10 every turn when you&#8217;re below half hp, so you can\n\t\t\tafford to do this somewhat safely depending on your enemies&#8217; damage\n\t\t\toutput.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-redemption-ability-scores\">Oath of Redemption Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Oath of Redemption\u2019s best spells and features rely on a high Charisma to function, so Blessed Warrior is a strong choice, meaning you\u2019re going to have a rough level one but then you\u2019ll scale very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Start it at 15 for the plate you\u2019re going to eventually wear and keep it there.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dex<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Third in importance.

This doesn\u2019t jive with Jeremy Crawford\u2019s depiction of RAI, but even he admits that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/722860204459630592\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RAW is unclear<\/a>.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Improved Divine Smite<\/td><td>I wish I could tell you that Sacred Flames is finally better DPR than swinging a sword. It\u2019s not. Unless your opponent fails the Dex save on a d20 roll of a 16, the fact that we just added a d8 to each attack means that the math stays in favor of using the Attack action against a single target.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Dwarven Fortitude<\/td><td>Con goes up to an odd number, but we now get a really nice benefit from Dodging while maintaining concentration on Compelled Duel and using our Reaction to take damage for our friends.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>New Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Find Greater Steed<br>&#8211; Death Ward<br>&#8211; Resilient Sphere<br>&#8211; Stoneskin<\/td><td>Drop whatever you started preparing at level 8 for Death Ward and start using Find Greater Steed to get a celestial pegasus instead of a warhorse. Death Ward yourself and have it apply to the horse too. This is especially good because it means we can do something like tank a Disintegrate for our friend if we need to, confident that Death Ward will keep us up.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Cleansing Touch<\/td><td>Boop.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Protective Spirit<\/td><td>This is definitely excellent, but it only works when we\u2019re below half. What if I want HP when I\u2019m above half?<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Durable<br><br>New Spell Prepared:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Con goes up again, and we can now regain 12-14 HP every time we take the Dodge action instead of 4-13 like it was last level. Just keep an eye on your number of hit dice.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>New Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Holy Weapon<br>&#8211; Destructive Wave<br>&#8211; Hold Monster<br>&#8211; Scrying<\/td><td>Sacred Flame would finally be better single-target damage, but it\u2019s a little late to stop using Guidance. We take two spells that we prefer not to use, but will in a pinch because there\u2019s nothing else better for us. Especially with Destructive Wave already having our full save DC.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Aura Improvements<\/td><td>This makes positioning much easier.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement: Constitution 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>So many hit points, so much Concentration.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Emissary of Redemption<\/td><td>The Resistance we get from this won\u2019t apply to damage taken from Warding Bond or Aura of the Guardian, but it still stretches our hit points on attacks we take directly, which is nice.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Oath of Redemption is an interesting subclass that attempts to take a Paladin in a more Controller direction via excellent spells, while protecting their party with a unique mechanic that allows them to literally take damage in place of others. With two excellent Channel options, you end up having to decide very carefully how you use your resources if you\u2019re allowed the Harness Divine Power Optional Class Feature, because basically anything you could do with it would be a good idea given the right circumstance.
