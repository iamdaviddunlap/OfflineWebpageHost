Mote of Potential expands on Bardic Inspiration by adding unique rider effects, and the other subclass features grant the ability to create and animate objects. As the Bard gains levels, you can create larger and more valuable items, allowing you to produce tools to solve a variety of problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because half of the College of Creation&#8217;s class features are tied up in Performance of Creation, it&#8217;s crucial that you and your DM are on the same page about how it works. The effect is less specific than spells like Creation or Fabricate, which can make it both unpredictable and abusable. Your DM might reasonably limit you to published items (Adventurer&#8217;s league went that route), which dramatically handicaps the feature because the items published in the Player&#8217;s Handbook and other sources are tools and items catered to adventurers but typically omit common items which might be useful in real-world scenarios (though some variety of artisans tools suffice in many cases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: 5e&#8217;s published rules don&#8217;t include stats for a plow, so if your DM limits you to the Player&#8217;s Handbook and you need to help a farmer plow their field, you&#8217;re out of luck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/subclasses\/creation\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14607\">College of Creation Bard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mote of Potential<\/span>: Add some rider effects\n\t\tto uses of Bardic Inspiration. All three work well in the right situations, but don\u2019t let this ability dictate how you use Bardic Inspiration. It\u2019s mostly a bonus on top of the primary function.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Check<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using Bardic\n\t\t\t\tInspiration on an Ability Check it&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t afford to fail.\n\t\t\t\tRolling a 1 on that die hurts, so rerolling and using the better result\n\t\t\t\tis great insurance.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attack Roll<\/span>: The damage is fairly\n\t\t\t\tminor, but if you have an ally attacking into a crowd the total damage\n\t\t\t\tcan add up quickly. Think of this like the Ranger&#8217;s Hail of Thorns spell\n\t\t\t\t(except that you get to pick targets so you can&#8217;t hurt allies) and use\n\t\t\t\tit wherever you would use Hail of Thorns.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saving Throw<\/span>: Using Bardic Inspiration\n\t\t\t\ton saving throws is one of the best ways to use it, and adding temporary\n\t\t\t\thit points on top of that benefit is excellent because the target is\n\t\t\t\teither going to take damage from the effect (which the temporary hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints will mitigate) or something else nasty is going to happen to them\n\t\t\t\tand the temporary hit points will help protect them while they\n\t\t\t\trecover.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Performance of Creation<\/span>: This is a great\n\t\tway to solve problems that require large, bulky, or expensive non-magic items that you\n\t\tmight not want to haul around with you all the time, as well as to get\n\t\taccess to expensive single-use nonmagical items. You might create an anvil\n\t\tor a block of stone if you need something extremely heavy, a row boat to\n\t\tcross a stream, or a battering ram to break down a door. Limiting the item&#8217;s\n\t\tsize to medium is mildly annoying, but the size quickly increases to large at\n\t\t6th level so most items in the Player&#8217;s Handbook will be available within a\n\t\tfew levels. The 20gp\/level cost will cover most things in the player&#8217;s\n\t\thandbook with the exception of some heavy armor (which can be very pricey).\n\t\tYour DM may also let you go beyond the player&#8217;s handbook, allowing you to\n\t\tcreate things like walls to hide behind, bridges to span chasms, columns to\n\t\tprop up falling ceilings, or pieces of furniture to flip over in a fit of\n\t\trage. Check with your DM to see what they&#8217;ll allow.\n\t\t<p>This notably doesn&#8217;t require materials like the Fabricate spell, doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\trequire any tool proficiencies, and doesn&#8217;t specify how detailed or\n\t\t\tintricate the item can be. You may be able to create valuable items like\n\t\t\tpoisons, blocks of gold, or jewelry, and you may be able to create\n\t\t\tcomplex, moving items like crossbows, wagons, or siege engines (cheap\n\t\t\tones). You may even be able to produce items made of special materials\n\t\t\tlike adamantine weapons. Again, check with your DM to see what they&#8217;ll allow.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You can use this once per day for free and can refresh it by spending a\n\t\t\t2nd-level slot, but remember that you can only have one item at a time.\n\t\t\tYou may want to wait to use Performance of Creation until you need it in\n\t\t\torder to avoid paying the spell slot cost to use it a second time, but on\n\t\t\tdays when you&#8217;re not adventuring definitely use it to create something\n\t\t\tsmall, portable, and useful like an expensive poison.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The option to refresh Performance of Creation means that you can compare\n\t\t\tany given item you might create to the benefits of a second-level spell.\n\t\t\tFor example: If you use this to create expensive disposable nom-magic items\n\t\t\tlike poisons, explosives, and things like alchemist&#8217;s fire, compare the\n\t\t\teffects of that item to casting a spell like Shatter.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animating Performance<\/span>: Similar in many\n\t\tways to summoning a creature for an hour. Your Dancing Item will have a\n\t\tdecent number of hit points, and gets one attack that deals a reasonable\n\t\tamount of force damage. Since it&#8217;s an object, it&#8217;s not very smart but it&#8217;s\n\t\talso immune to poison, psychic damage, and some mental status effects like\n\t\tcharm. It&#8217;s a decent combat pet, and it&#8217;ll keep your Bonus Action busy every\n\t\tturn that it attacks (though you can share that action with granting Bardic Inspiration), but the Dancing Item&#8217;s Irrepressible Dance aura still slows down or speeds up nearby creatures, so don\u2019t worry if you have to miss a few pet attacks by casting a bonus action spell or something.\n\t\t<p>The expectation is that you&#8217;ll cast this on something like a statue, but\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t let that limit your choices. The item needs to be large or smaller,\n\t\t\tso you&#8217;re allowed to cast this on small things like a tankard or a necklace,\n\t\t\tas well as large things like a cart or even a carpet which might be large\n\t\t\tenough to carry you and your allies with the dancing item&#8217;s 30-foot fly\n\t\t\tspeed. At 18 Strength a large dancing item has a carrying capacity of 540\n\t\t\tpounds, allowing it to comfortably accommodate 2 medium creatures and their\n\t\t\tequipment. This becomes even easier if you and your party are mostly small\n\t\t\traces like halflings, and, since it&#8217;s immune to exhaustion, you can ride it\n\t\t\tas long as you&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You can use this once per day for free, but you can also refresh the\n\t\t\teffect by spending a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, essentially making\n\t\t\tthis equivalent to a third-level spell. Considering that the spell Fly is\n\t\t\t3rd-level, has a duration of just 10 minutes, and requires Concentration;\n\t\t\tusing your Dancing Item as a combination flying mount and combat pet is an\n\t\t\textremely effective use of a spell slot.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Animating performance received errata to specify that it doesn&#8217;t work on attended\n\t\t\tobjects, so sadly you can no longer use this on enemy&#8217;s clothes or armor\n\t\t\tand cause them to be held aloft by their own pants. But you can simply take off your own pants, animate them, then put them back on to fly by the seat of your pants.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Creative Crescendo<\/span>: Not quite as good as\n\t\tusing Performance of Creation 5 times at once, but close. One item uses the\n\t\ttypical size rules and the rest must be small or tiny, but small is as big\n\t\tas a 3-foot tall humanoid and that&#8217;s plenty to work with. Most weapons could\n\t\tbe considered small, and many extremely valuable items like jewels and\n\t\tjewelry are tiny. You could use the big item to make a small catapult and\n\t\tuse the other items to make projectiles like urns full of alchemist&#8217;s fire.\n\t\tYou can use all 5 items (because you have 20 Charisma by this level) to make\n\t\texpensive poisons, then hand them off to your party&#8217;s rogue. Get\n\t\tcreative. But you could also create 5\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/equipment\/antimatter-rifle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Antimatter Rifles<\/a>\n(provided that they\u2019re available in your game) and hand out weapons to your party that do 6d8 necrotic damage. They comply with the size restriction and there\u2019s no longer a price restriction either.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eloquence\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/bard#CollegeofEloquence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">College of Eloquence<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MOoT \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>This may be the bard-est bard that ever did bard. While most bard colleges add some fun new mechanics or options to the Bard, College of Eloquence emphasizes the Bard&#8217;s core features: namely Bardic Inspiration and the Bard&#8217;s uncontested mastery of Charisma-based skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing in the subclass is complicated or hard to manage, and in fact the insurance provided by Silver Tongue and by Unfailing Inspiration make this an excellent option for new players and for players with habitually poor rolls, but any player looking to enjoy a mechanically simple but profoundly effective bard will find everything that they need here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/subclasses\/eloquence\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14873\">College of Eloquence Bard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silver Tongue<\/span>: It is difficult to find an\n\t\tability which is so effective at making a key skill reliable. The Rogue&#8217;s\n\t\tReliable Talent feature provides the same benefit, but that&#8217;s an 11th-level\n\t\tfeature. Combined with access to Expertise (which you also get at 3rd\n\t\tlevel) you&#8217;re nearly incapable of failing Charisma (Deception) and Charisma\n\t\t(Persuasion) checks. With a +3 Charisma modifier and Expertise in one of the\n\t\taffected skills, your minimum roll at this level is already a 17, and will\n\t\trapidly improve as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unsettling Words<\/span>: Use this as a Bonus\n\t\tAction, then hit the target with a save-or-suck effect.\n\t\tAdvantage\/Disadvantage are worth a little more than +3\/-3, and the average\n\t\tvalue of your d6 Bardic Inspiration die is 3.5, and increases as you gain\n\t\tlevels, so this is already mathematically better than imposing Disadvantage,\n\t\tand it only gets more effective as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unfailing Inspiration<\/span>: Bardic Inspiration\n\t\tis one of the Bard&#8217;s core features, and while it&#8217;s very powerful it&#8217;s still\n\t\tlimited by a small number of dice. This provides a powerful insurance\n\t\tpolicy, making it much easier to risk a die even if it&#8217;s unlikely to make a\n\t\troll succeed. Between this and Font of Inspiration, you can afford to throw\n\t\tinspiration dice around like confetti.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Universal Speech<\/span>: A limited version of\n\t\tTongues for one hour for free every day, and you can do it again by spending\n\t\ta spell slot. You may still want to learn Comprehend Languages so that you\n\t\tcan understand other creatures, especially if your party has access to\n\t\tritual spellcasting.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infectious Inspiration<\/span>: Consider this\n\t\talongside Unfailing Inspiration. If a creature adds a die and fails, they\n\t\tkeep the die. If they pass, you spend your Reaction to pass the die to a\n\t\tdifferent creature, and the process starts over. You get to do this a number\n\t\tof times equal to your Charisma modifier, so it&#8217;s effectively 5 additional\n\t\tuses of Basic Inspiration per day, not counting the ones which fail but\n\t\tdon&#8217;t result in a lost die.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"glamour\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/bard#CollegeofGlamour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">College of Glamour<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>College of Glamour is great for a bard looking to play a support role, and to lean into Charm effects. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s limited by the frustratingly small number of spells which actually make targets charmed (it&#8217;s basically just Charm X and Dominate X) and by the completely mundane ability of other creatures to decide to ignore you despite how glamorous and amazing your are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While College of Glamour is certainly a fine subclass, it&#8217;s hard to find a place where it really shines. Mantle of Inspiration is their signature combat ability, but Tasha&#8217;s College of Everything added Aid to the Bard&#8217;s spell list, so bards already have a way to improve their parties hit points. Enthralling Performance is neat, but Charm Person mostly does the same thing. Mantle of Majesty is great for locking down a single target, but you need to make them Charmed which means that you need to cast a leveled spell anyway, so why not skip the complications and cast Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter or Dominate Person? Unbreakable Majesty is excellent, but Sanctuary is a 1st-level spell and replicates half of the effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/subclasses\/glamour\/\">College of Glamour Bard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mantle of Inspiration<\/span>: Reposition your\n\t\tentire party <em>and<\/em> grant temporary hit points. You won&#8217;t need to use\n\t\tthis in every fight, but certainly don&#8217;t hesitate to use it if you think it\n\t\twill be helpful.\n\t\t<p>The temporary hit points don&#8217;t have a specified expiration, so they\n\t\t\texpire when you complete a long rest. If you use Mantle of Inspiration\n\t\t\tearly in the day, the temporary hit points may last all day long. Once you\n\t\t\tget Font of Inspriation at 5th level, be sure to use Mantle of Inspiration\n\t\t\tbefore you take a Short Rest to squeeze some benefit out of any remaining\n\t\t\tBardic Inspiration dice.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enthralling Performance<\/span>: Similar to\n\t\t<em>Charm Person<\/em> with a 1-minute casting time, during which you need to\n\t\tsomehow hold that target(s)&#8217;s attention and during which you can&#8217;t be\n\t\tinterrupted. <em>Charm Person<\/em> is a 1st-level spell, it will have the\n\t\tsame save DC, and creatures don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;ve targeted them with the\n\t\tspell so you can cast <em>Charm Person<\/em> even while being observed, and\n\t\tso long as the creature can&#8217;t identify the spell and isn&#8217;t naturally\n\t\tinclined to be hostile about you casting spells, you could try repeatedly\n\t\tuntil the target fails its save.\n\t\t<p>Where Enthralling Performance shines is when you need to charm a group.\n\t\t\tEnthralling Performance can affect up to 5 creatures once you hit 20\n\t\t\tCharisma, which would cost a 5th-level spell slot to replicate with\n\t\t\t<em>Charm Person<\/em>. The effect goes a bit beyond the basic effects of\n\t\t\tCharmed, too, so you can easily turn your new fans toward various\n\t\t\tnon-violent purposes like using them to force your way into a fancy party,\n\t\t\tto ward off local law enforcement, or to improve your reputation by having\n\t\t\tthe crowd tell random strangers how great you are.<\/p>\n<p>However, since\n\t\t\tEnthralling Performance recharges on a Short or Long Rest, you generally\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t exceed a 5-person crowd size (though magical options like Catnap to\n\t\t\ttake a 10-minute short rest may make it possible).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The biggest problem with Enthralling Performance is finding a suitable crowd who\n\t\t\talready likes you enough to listen to your for a full minute in a place\n\t\t\twhere you can put them to a useful purpose without restorting to violence.\n\t\t\tThis might be very easy dependening on the nature of your campaign, but in\n\t\t\tmost DnD campaigns you&#8217;ll spend long periods isolated from polite society\n\t\t\t(there are very few taverns in dungeons) or in locales with sparse\n\t\t\tpopulations of friendly humanoids.<\/p>\n<p>In campaigns which frequently involve\n\t\t\tlarge cities, this could be much more useful, but if you try to solve\n\t\t\tevery problem by inciting a mob of your fans, your DM might have the\n\t\t\tguards run you out of town. Look for opportunities to use this, but don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tabuse it.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantle of Majesty<\/span>: By charming a creature\n\t\tand using <em>Command<\/em> to prevent the creature from using their turn\n\t\t(Drop and Grovel are great options), you can mostly paralyze a creature.\n\t\tUnfortunately, since you don&#8217;t use a spell slot for Mantle of Majesty,\n\t\t<em>Command<\/em> is cast at its minimum spell level and will only affect one\n\t\tcreature. This will work great to lock down strong single enemies, but in a\n\t\tfight against a group you probably don&#8217;t want to use this.\n\t\t<p>The auto-failure effect with <em>Command<\/em> is also weird since Mantle\n\t\t\tof Majesty doesn&#8217;t charm things, so you need to do that part on your own\n\t\t\twith a different effect, such as Charm Person.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that Mantle of Majesty still causes you to\n\t\t\tcast a leveled spell, so on turns where you&#8217;re casting <em>Command<\/em> as\n\t\t\ta Bonus Action you&#8217;re unable to cast any other spells except cantrips.\n\t\t\tAgain: fine for big single foes, but dangerous in encounters with multiple\n\t\t\tenemies.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unbreakable Majesty<\/span>: This is an amazing\n\t\toption both defensively and offensively.

This is really fun, but it&#8217;s unpredictable, and\n\t\tunpredictability in class features makes me nervous. You generally don&#8217;t\n\t\twant to use this in combat because you could spend your Bonus Action to draw\n\t\tsomething that&#8217;s not helpful. Instead, you&#8217;re more likely to use this after\n\t\ta Short Rest and hang onto your Tale until you can use it or it expires.\n\t\t<p>Since this costs an inspiration die and expires when you take a Short or\n\t\t\tLong Rest, it&#8217;s costly at levels 3 and 4, but it gets much much more\n\t\t\tmanageable at level 5 when you pick up Font of Inspiration. Even then,\n\t\t\tsome of the effects may not be worth the inspiration die to get them.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Because you roll a Bardic Inspiration die to get your tale, your options\n\t\t\tare limited by the size of your die. The higher-numbered options are\n\t\t\tgenerally better, so there&#8217;s new stuff to look forward to as you gain\n\t\t\tlevels. Of course, this also means that you&#8217;re less likely to roll your\n\t\t\tfavorites as your die size grows, but, fortunately, Mystical Connection will\n\t\t\tprovide some help once you hit level 14.<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clever Animal<\/span>: Situational. You&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tmost likely to use this in social situations, but it might also be\n\t\t\t\tuseful for Dispel Magic and Counterspell. If you can get this running\n\t\t\t\tbefore a social situation, the benefits are absolutely massive.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Renowned Duelist<\/span>: Decent\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target damage, but it&#8217;s not much better than just casting a\n\t\t\t\tcantrip, especially once you add the damage bonus from Spiritual Focus\n\t\t\t\tat level 6. Weirdly, this works at range but still calls for a melee\n\t\t\t\tspell attack. That usually doesn&#8217;t matter, but sometimes there are\n\t\t\t\tthings which affect melee and ranged attacks differently, like Tale of\n\t\t\t\tthe Avenger.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beloved Friends<\/span>: Nearly always useful.\n\t\t\t\tThe temporary hit points don&#8217;t have a specified expiration time, so they\n\t\t\t\tlast until you rest. If you roll this, use it early when it&#8217;s easy to hit\n\t\t\t\ttwo targets and consider getting another Tale.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Runaway<\/span>: Reposition your entire party.\n\t\t\t\tEscape grapples, bindings, and dangerous positions. You do need to be\n\t\t\t\table to see the destination, but that&#8217;s still enough to solve a lot of\n\t\t\t\tproblems.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Avenger<\/span>: Throw this on your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tDefender. It only works for melee attacks, unfortunately, but the damage\n\t\t\t\tfrom this can add up very quickly.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Traveler<\/span>: Trade the second target\n\t\t\t\tfrom Beloved Friends for a +1 AC bonus and some extra speed. Given the\n\t\t\t\tchoice between the two and no other information I would likely take\n\t\t\t\tBeloved Friends, but in situations where enemies are making large\n\t\t\t\tnumbers of attacks a +1 AC bonus can make a big difference.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beguiler<\/span>: Rob a single target of the\n\t\t\t\timportant parts of their turn. I&#8217;d be excited about this even if it didn&#8217;t deal damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phantom<\/span>: Being invisible will \n\t\t\t\tgive your target Advantage on their attack, which is always welcome, and\n\t\t\t\tmay allow them to avoid things like Opportunity Attacks. Your best bet\n\t\t\t\tis to put this on a rogue, but even if your party doesn&#8217;t include a\n\t\t\t\trogue, the extra damage and Advantage are welcome for any character who\n\t\t\t\trelies on attacks. Making the target of the attack Frightened without a\n\t\t\t\tsave is great, too.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brute<\/span>: Turn an ally into the center\n\t\t\t\tof a fireball. The AOE is big, the damage type is good, and your target\n\t\t\t\tcan pick which creatures take damage. This can&#8217;t match the spell\n\t\t\t\tFireball, but three Bardic Inspiration dice is still a decent pile of\n\t\t\t\tdamage for the cost to get this. If you have melee allies acting soon\n\t\t\t\tafter you in initiative, knocking foes Prone will also provide Advantage\n\t\t\t\ton their attacks.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dragon<\/span>: The damage is slightly\n\t\t\t\thigher than Tale of the Brute, but the AOE is much smaller, doesn&#8217;t omit\n\t\t\t\tyour allies, doesn&#8217;t provide a status condition, and does a much worse\n\t\t\t\tdamage type.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Angel<\/span>: Lesser Restoration plus a bit\n\t\t\t\tof healing. Not always required, but always handy.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mind-Bender<\/span>: Literally just Beguiler\n\t\t\t\tbut better (unless the target is immune to being Stunned).<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Session<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\tMagical Secrets, but considerably more complicated and with some additional\n\t\tlimitations in exchange for the ability to change the spell daily. Because\n\t\tthis only teaches you the spell temporarily, it&#8217;s great for odd, situational\n\t\tspells that you typically can&#8217;t justify learning permanently. However, the\n\t\tlimitation to divination and necromancy spells does narrow your options\n\t\tconsiderably.\n\t\t<p>If you want to simplify this, you can just do the ritual after a Long Rest\n\t\t\tto learn the same spell every day (Revivify and Summon Undead are good\n\t\t\texamples), but at that point just play College of Lore. This is great for\n\t\t\tthings like Lesser Restoration or Raise Dead, but don&#8217;t forget that the\n\t\t\tspell level is capped at your Proficiency Bonus.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You&#8217;re required to include some &#8220;willing creatures&#8221; in the Spirit\n\t\t\tSession, but there&#8217;s no restriction on what those creatures are, what else\n\t\t\tthey&#8217;re doing, their positions, etc. so it&#8217;s entirely possible that having\n\t\t\t5 tamed birds in a cage nearby (or a bag of rats) will suffice. I think\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re intended to use your party members, but if the requirement is just\n\t\t\tfriendly humanoids you could easily find some commoners to hang out with\n\t\t\tyou for an hour.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Spiritual Focus<\/span>: The actually impactful\n\t\tpart of Spiritual Focus comes online at 6th level. Bards don&#8217;t have as many\n\t\toptions for spells which restore hit points or deal direct damage as classes\n\t\tlike the Cleric and the Wizard, which is a huge problem for College of\n\t\tSpirits. The d6 is added to one damage\/healing roll of a spell, so AOE\n\t\tspells (Shatter) and some multi-target spells are great ways to capitalize\n\t\ton the extra effect, but again, the Bard&#8217;s options here are pitifully small.\n\t\tThis works with cantrips in theory, but there are none that qualify.\n\t\t<p>The problem is easy to overlook (I did it on my initial read): Spiritual\n\t\t\tFocus&#8217;s bonus only works for spells which are cast through the focus,\n\t\t\twhich means that it only applies to spells with inexpensive material\n\t\t\tcomponents that aren&#8217;t consumed by the spell. RAW you can&#8217;t choose to use\n\t\t\ta focus when it&#8217;s not needed, so for most spells Spiritual Focus simply\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t apply (see the\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/articles\/sage-advice\/rules-spellcasting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sage Advice on Spellcasting Rules<\/a>). Spells like Shatter work, but spells like Cure Wounds and Healing Word\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t since they don&#8217;t have inexpensive material components and therefore\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t be cast through a focus.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The rules around spellcasting foci are a mess, so discuss how your DM\n\t\t\twants to handle this. RAI I think you&#8217;re intended to be able to use this\n\t\t\tbonus whenever you cast a spell with your focus in hand, but RAW the\n\t\t\tlimitations make this difficult to use. With the RAW restrictions, there\n\t\t\tare no bard cantrips which qualify, the only healing spell on the Bard&#8217;s\n\t\t\tspell list that qualifies is Regenerate, and just five damage spells on\n\t\t\tthe Bard&#8217;s spell list qualify, and the only one that synergizes well with\n\t\t\tthe damage bonus is Shatter. You can fix this somewhat with Magical\n\t\t\tSecrets at high levels by picking up something like Fireball, but that&#8217;s\n\t\t\ttoo little, too late.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mystical Connection<\/span>: By this level you&#8217;re\n\t\trolling a d10 for inspiration, and you get d12 at level 15, so Tales From\n\t\tBeyond is totally unpredictable.

However, the subclass&#8217;s resource management and the need to split focus between Dexterity and Charisma makes it very difficult to play without a Hexblade dip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/subclasses\/college-of-swords\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"25141\">College of Swords Bard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor is nice\n\t\tuntil you get to 18 or 20 Dexterity, but you don&#8217;t get shields, so your AC\n\t\twon&#8217;t be as good as a College of Valor Bard. Scimitars are useful if you\n\t\tplan to use two-weapon fighting, which looks viable thanks to\n\t\tFighting Style. This class feature also allows you to use weapons in which\n\t\tyou are proficient as a spellcasting focus. This is useful when\n\t\tyou need to cast spells in the middle of combat, but the rules for Somatic components\nin 5e are incredibly frustrating, so two-weapon fighting builds will still need to juggle weapons in\norder to cast most spells.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighting Style<\/span>: An improvement to your\n\t\toffensive abilities with weapons, but it largely locks you into using melee\n\t\tor thrown weapons. Without a shield, fighting in melee is hard for a class\n\t\twith d8 hit dice, and, unlike the Rogue you don&#8217;t have Uncanny Dodge to\n\t\tmitigate damage when your AC doesn&#8217;t hold up.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dueling<\/span>: Bards are spellcasters\n\t\t\t\tfirst, and having a free hand to perform Somatic Components means that\n\t\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t need to constantly juggle one of your weapons to cast a spell\n\t\t\t\twhich requires Somatic Components but not Material Components. Remember:\n\t\t\t\tyou can use a hand holding a Focus to perform somatic components\n\t\t\t\t<em>only<\/em> if the spell requires a material component without a\n\t\t\t\tlisted price.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: While this\n\t\t\t\tpresents a considerable boost to your weapon damage output, bards\n\t\t\t\talready have several abilities which consume their Bonus Action,\n\t\t\t\tincluding Bardic Inspiration and some spells, so in many turns you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tneed to give up your additional attack in order to do something more\n\t\t\t\timportant.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blade Flourish<\/span>: Every flourish applies\n\t\tthe Inspiration die roll as extra damage to the creature, but the damage\n\t\tfeels like it was thrown on to make this feel more appealing, and I don&#8217;t\n\t\tthink it worked. The effects just aren&#8217;t good enough to justify spending a\n\t\tBardic Inspiration die.\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s not totally clear how the extra damage here works on a critical hit.\n\t\t\tNormally you can tell if an effect like Divine Smite or Hex is multiplied\n\t\t\tbecause it adds &#8220;extra damage&#8221; equal to some number of dice. Blade\n\t\t\tFlourish adds the number rolled on your inspiration die, so it&#8217;s\n\t\t\ttechnically a static numerical bonus like your ability modifier, even\n\t\t\tthough you roll for the damage. I haven&#8217;t found an answer on this one from\n\t\t\tJeremy Crawford, so the RAI is unclear. As a DM, I would allow the damage\n\t\t\tto be multiplied, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the intent, and I haven&#8217;t found\nan official answer.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defensive Flourish<\/span>: You never roll\n\t\t\t\tmore than one die for your Bardic Inspiration, so it&#8217;s entirely possible\n\t\t\t\tthat you&#8217;ll roll a 1. The 1-round duration means that you&#8217;re spending\n\t\t\t\tone of your most powerful limited resources for an unpredictable,\n\t\t\t\tunreliable, and short-lived bonus to AC. The average value is pretty\n\t\t\t\tgood, but gambling with your defenses like this is risky. If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tdesperate for AC, take the Dodge action. If you want lasting defenses,\n\t\t\t\tcast a spell.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slashing Flourish<\/span>: It&#8217;s nice that\n\t\t\t\tthis applies damage to\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/934969036948914177\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">any number of qualifying creatures<\/a>, but the damage isn&#8217;t very good, so you only want to use this when\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re going to hit numerous targets. Of course, casting Thunderclap\n\t\t\t\twill have similar effects, and may deal considerably more damage without\n\t\t\t\tconsuming a limited resource.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mobile Flourish<\/span>: I would just assume\n\t\t\t\tthat you won&#8217;t get more than the base 5 feet of pushing since the\n\t\t\t\taverage roll of your inspiration die won&#8217;t exceed 5 feet until level 10,\n\t\t\t\tand even then your odds are only slightly better than 50%. Generally if\n\t\t\t\tan effect doesn&#8217;t move you a full 5 feet, it gets ignored because most\n\t\t\t\tpeople use combat grids. The 5 feet is still enough to break grapples or\n\t\t\t\tget out of an enemy&#8217;s reach in most cases, but you could also Shove or\n\t\t\t\tuse a spell to solve the same problem.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: A considerable improvement\n\t\tto your damage output with weapons. If you insist on using weapons instead\n\t\tof spells, this is crucial.\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, you don&#8217;t have a big damage boost like most martial\n\t\t\tclasses do (Sneak Attack, Improved Divine Smite, etc.), so if you can get\n\t\t\ta weapon cantrip like Booming Blade it will be considerably more effective\n\t\t\tto use Booming Blade instead of making two attacks. Even with the damage\n\t\t\tbonus from Dueling, Booming Blade can still do more damage if the\n\t\t\tsecondary damage triggers (see my article on\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master&#8217;s Flourish<\/span>: Blade Flourish is\n\t\tmostly fine, but is hugely limited by your tiny pool of Bardic Inspiration\n\t\tdice. Allowing you to use it every round, even with a smaller die, makes it\n\t\ta reliable and meaningful part of your tactics in any turn where you&#8217;re not\n\t\tprimarily casting spells. This is especially nice with two-weapon fighting\n\t\tbecause you get three attacks with which to apply a flourish. Unfortunately,\n\t\tyou&#8217;ve spent 13 levels limping along before Master&#8217;s Flourish came along and\n\t\tmade you useful.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"valor\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/bard#CollegeofValor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">College of Valor<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>A martially-minded Bard may prefer College of Valor. By improving the Bard&#8217;s ability to wade into melee safely, the Bard can fill nearly every role in a party. If you&#8217;re in a small party, this is an exciting option. However, in a party of 4 or more the Valor Bard&#8217;s lack of focus will make it hard for the College of Valor Bard to truly shine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When DnD 5e was just the core rules, College of Valor allowed the bard to toe the line between sorcerer-like spellcasting and fighter-like martial capabilities. However, newer, similar options like the Bladesigner Wizard, the Hexblade Warlock, and the Artificer have all left College of Valor far behind them in effectiveness. It remains a simple, approachable bard option that&#8217;s both effective and appealing for newer players, but it&#8217;s not going to impress you mechanically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/subclasses\/valor\/\">College of Valor Bard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor and a\n\t\tshield will significantly improve your AC. With 14 or more Dexterity, a\n\t\tbreastplate, and a shield, you&#8217;re looking at a respectable 18 AC, enough to\n\t\tmatch a fighter in full plate (without a shield). Half-plate will get you\n\t\tmore AC, but you might prefer to avoid Disadvantage on Stealth checks. If\n\t\tyou eventually get to 18 Dexterity, consider switching back to light armor.\n\t\tYou also get access to all martial weapons, but you&#8217;re probably going to\n\t\twant to stick to a Rapier, and all Bards get proficiency with rapiers.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Inspiration<\/span>: The ability to add\n\t\tthe inspiration die to damage is wasteful (unless it gets used on a critical\n\t\thit, in which case it&#8217;s multiplied since it&#8217;s &#8220;extra damage&#8221; rather than an\n\t\tadditional source of damage). You&#8217;ll have much better results using\n\t\tinspiration to prevent attacks. This isn&#8217;t quite as good as the College of\n\t\tLore&#8217;s Cutting Words ability, but it allows your allies to make the decision\n\t\tto use the die themselves, which is a nice mental load off of your\n\t\tshoulders.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: A considerable improvement\n\t\tto your damage output with weapons. If you insist on using weapons instead\n\t\tof spells, this is crucial. Thanks to our access to full spellcasting as well as Magical Secrets, we can take full advantage of some unique buffs in place of a traditional martial\u2019s damage boost (Sneak Attack, Improved Divine Smite, etc.). Spells like Shadow Blade, Elemental Weapon, and Holy Weapon pair incredibly well with Extra Attack.\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, because you don&#8217;t have a damage boost like most martial classes do,\nif you can obtain a weapon\n\t\t\tcantrip like Booming Blade it will be considerably more effective to use\n\t\t\tBooming Blade instead of making two attacks when using the aforementioned buff spells is inconvenient (such as your Concentration being already occupied). Booming Blade can still do\n\t\t\tmore damage if the secondary damage triggers (see my article on\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Magic<\/span>: An excellent use of your\n\t\tBonus Action, but your Bonus Action is also used for Bardic Inspiration, so\n\t\tthere will frequently be turns where you can&#8217;t use Battle Magic. If you\n\t\tlearn Booming Blade and\/or Green-Flame Blade, you can still manage to make\n\t\ttwo weapon attacks in a single turn, similar to the Bladesigner or the\n\t\tEldritch Knight once they get War Magic.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whispers\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/bard#CollegeofWhispers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">College of Whispers<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t consider College of Whispers for a normal adventuring campaign, but if your game is heavy on roleplaying and light on common things like dungeon crawling and heavy on things like political intrigue and social interaction, College of Whispers offers some useful options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/subclasses\/college-of-whispers\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"25908\">College of Whispers Bard Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Psychic Blades<\/span>: This works with\n\t\tranged weapons, so you&#8217;re not forced to go swing a rapier, however, the\n\t\tdamage is pitiful compared to how useful a Bardic Inspiration die is. You\n\t\tcan decide to use this after rolling a critical hit so that you can double\n\t\tthe damage dice (similar to effects like Divine Smite or Hunter&#8217;s Mark), but\n\t\tCollege of Whispers never gets Extra Attack, so you&#8217;re gambling on a single\n\t\tattack each turn with a 5% chance to crit when you should be casting spells\n\t\tinstead. You could explore two-weapon fighting for another chance to hit and\n\t\tpotentially deliver Psychic Blades, but that&#8217;s a lot to commit for a chance\n\t\tto deal a little bit of damage.\n\t\t<p>The issue isn&#8217;t that Psychic Blades is bad. In a vacuum, it&#8217;s decent\n\t\t\tdamage of a good damage type. The issue is that it costs a precious\n\t\t\tresource to do nothing but damage, and while damage is decent, you can deal\n\t\t\tdamage with your spells, but you don&#8217;t replicate Bardic Inspiration with\n\t\t\tspells. If you want direct single-target damage, you can find more\n\t\t\treliable and more damaging options on your spell list without the need to\n\t\t\tinvest in making weapon attacks reliable.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Words of Terror<\/span>: It is hard to use this with any frequency. It&#8217;s very difficult to\n\t\tmeet the requirements of the feature without a ton of effort to bring it to\n\t\tbear against a suitable humanoid. Even if you manage to make it work,\n\t\tit&#8217;s rarely more impactful than spells like Cause Fear or Fear.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantle of Whispers<\/span>: Situational, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tnotably better than options like Disguise Self due to your ability\n\t\tto glean mundane information about the person you&#8217;re impersonating. I can&#8217;t\n\t\tthink of how many times a disguise has been foiled by something as simple as\n\t\tthe assumed identity&#8217;s associates attempting to make small-talk. You could\n\t\talso combine this with Words of Terror to infiltrate somewhere in disguise\n\t\tand get someone talking long enough to make them Frightened before your\n\t\tparty jumps out of a closet or something.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Lore<\/span>: Once per day you get a\n\t\tsomewhat diminished version of <em>Dominate Monster<\/em> with an 8-hour\n\t\tduration. Charm bosses and force them to give you their treasure. Charm NPCs\n\t\tand force them to reveal plot secrets. Get creative. Unfortunately, you need\n\t\tto share a language with the target, so be sure to  research your target ahead of time to check if you need to cast Tongues beforehand.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-pale\">3rd-Party Publishers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT has covered some 3rd-party content from our favorite creators.
