Having bonuses to healing magic as well as a Channel Divinity on top of that can easily trap a player into wanting to always heal all the time, but Clerics are far more than just <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/healbot-olympics\/\">healbots<\/a>. Healing in combat is usually highly inefficient unless your action saves an ally\u2019s action, which we don\u2019t have to be a Life Cleric to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>So then, why are we a Life Cleric? Because the Disciple of Life domain power allows some of the most efficient out of combat healing in the game and the Channel Divinity: Preserve Life is one of the few ways to perform some efficient in-combat healing. I\u2019ve seen parties that struggle to stay on their feet after just one or two fights, but the Life Cleric has ways to get everyone back to full after nearly every fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The example build, Lifeberry the Tank Engine, shows off a little dwarven flavor but sticks pretty close to what a Cleric should be doing in the party. By that I mean mopping the floor with your foes by subjecting them to a hurricane of pain. Oh don\u2019t worry there will be plenty of time to heal your friends when you\u2019re off initiative. Additionally the build shows off a synergy with the Goodberry spell.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Life Domain Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-domain-ability-scores\">Life Domain Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-domain-races\">Life Domain Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-domain-feats\">Life Domain Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-domain-weapons\">Life Domain Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-domain-armor\">Life Domain Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-domain-multiclassing\">Life Domain Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-life-cleric-build-lifeberry-the-tank-engine\">Example Life Cleric Build &#8211; Lifeberry the Tank Engine<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#whats-a-dwarven-urgosh\">What&#8217;s a Dwarven Urgosh?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#but-i-dont-want-to-multiclass\">But I don&#8217;t want to Multiclass?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#why-did-we-delay-wisdom-in-favor-of-resilient-constitution\">Why did we delay Wisdom in favor of Resilient (Constitution)?<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Unfortunately, the high level\n\t\t\toptions are less useful.\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">1st Level<\/span>: Bless is nearly a win\n\t\t\t\t\tcondition at low levels where adding 1d4 to a roll can exceed your\n\t\t\t\t\tproficiency bonus, and it remains a staple buff at basically any level\n\t\t\t\t\tso long as you don&#8217;t need your Concentration for something else. Cure\n\t\t\t\t\tWounds is a fine healing spell, but in combat you want to rely on\n\t\t\t\t\tHealing Word and spend your Action on offense.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Lesser Restoration is\n\t\t\t\t\tnice to have handy, but much of the time the effects which it removes\n\t\t\t\t\tcan wait until you can rest and prepare spells to fix them. Spiritual\n\t\t\t\t\tWeapon is among the Cleric&#8217;s most efficient uses of both spell slots\n\t\t\t\t\tand Bonus Actions.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Beacon of Hope is\n\t\t\t\t\tsituational, but can be nice to cast before a rest to maximize the\n\t\t\t\t\teffectiveness of your healing spells when Hit Dice are running short.\n\t\t\t\t\tRevivify is the &#8220;Cleric Tax&#8221;, so getting it for free is really\n\t\t\t\t\tnice.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: Two interesting options\n\t\t\t\t\twith 8-hour durations, but Death Ward is definitely the better of the\n\t\t\t\t\ttwo.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-red\">9th Level<\/span>: Mass Cure is redundant\n\t\t\t\t\twith Preserve Life, and if you need Raise Dead prepared every day you\n\t\t\t\t\tare either in a terrible game or in a game with a Zealot\n\t\t\t\t\tBarbarian.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Proficiency<\/span>: With heavy armor and\n\t\t\ta shield, you can work on the front lines as well as any Fighter. The\n\t\t\timproved AC will also help to reduce the need to heal yourself instead of\n\t\t\thealing or supporting your allies, especially when supplemented by spells\n\t\t\tlike Shield of Faith and Sanctuary.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Disciple of Life<\/span>: This isn&#8217;t a ton of\n\t\t\thealing all at once, but it will be especially useful with Healing Word,\n\t\t\twhich is a good combination because it uses a Bonus Action, but normally\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t heal for a particularly large amount. Over the course of your\n\t\t\tcareer, the total amount of additional healing will be significant, so I\n\t\t\tencourage you to keep a running score if for no other reason than to\n\t\t\tremind your party members how badly they need you to survive.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Preserve Life<\/span>:\n\t\t\tFantastic when you&#8217;re looking at a possible TPK. Since you&#8217;re healing so\n\t\t\tmuch, most characters of your level will go from 0 to half hit points,\n\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re looking at someone like a Barbarian with d12 hit dice and 20\n\t\t\tConstitution or if you&#8217;re splitting the points between multiple allies.\n\t\t\tEven so, the scaling is excellent as you gain additional uses of Channel\n\t\t\tDivinity this will quickly become your go-to option for large amounts of\n\t\t\thit point recovery while in combat.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessed Healer<\/span>: Coupled with your\n\t\t\texcellent AC, there is now almost never a reason to cast a healing spell\n\t\t\ton yourself instead of helping your allies. However, casting a healing\n\t\t\tspell to restore hit points should not happen frequently during combat, so\n\t\t\tthis may not trigger as frequently as you would like.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Strike<\/span>: Radiant damage is among\n\t\t\tthe most reliable damage types available. See also:\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\">Divine Strike vs. Cantrips<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Supreme Healing<\/span>: As you add more and\n\t\t\tmore dice, your rolls will skew toward the statistical average, meaning\n\t\t\tthat each d8 from Cure Wounds is effectively 4.5 points of healing.\n\t\t\tMaximizing the die improves this to 8 points of healing, almost doubling\n\t\t\tthe effects of your healing spells and thereby making your spell slots\n\t\t\tspent on healing much more efficient, allowing you to reserve high-level\n\t\t\tspell slots for more interesting things. However, since in-combat healing\n\t\t\tis generally not a good idea, there are few situations where this will be\n\t\t\tsignificantly impactful. In a fight, if you need healing you should cast\n\t\t\tHeal or Mass Heal, neither of which involve dice.\n\t\t\t<p>Knowing how best to apply this requires a little bit of math. For\n\t\t\t\tsingle-target healing, anything of 6th level or above should still be\n\t\t\t\tHeal or a 9th-level spell like Mass Heal. The Cure Wounds spell cast at 6th level heals\n\t\t\t\tjust 48+Wis hit points compared to Heal&#8217;s 70 (without considering\n\t\t\t\tDisciple of Life which applies the same bonus to either). For\n\t\t\t\tmulti-target healing, Prayer of Healing is your best option, but with a\n\t\t\t\t10-minute casting time you&#8217;re more likely to use Mass Healing Word.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"life-domain-ability-scores\">Life Domain Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We are a Cleric and we have Heavy Armor.

It\u2019s not 100% accurate because the back end of a real Urgosh would be piercing damage, but hey if you ask your DM nicely I don\u2019t think they would really mind letting it be piercing if a Cleric wanted to occasionally make the suboptimal choice to swing a weapon for fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re taking the Marine background for Athletics, Survival, and both Land and Sea Vehicles.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Dwarves have a lot of weapon proficiencies and Mountain Dwarves add to that pile with Light and Medium Armor. We can trade all of these for <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/tools\/\">tools<\/a>. For this example, because we\u2019re taking Marine for a background, we\u2019re taking some related tools: Carpenter\u2019s, Cartographer\u2019s, Mason\u2019s, Navigator\u2019s, Smith\u2019s, and Thieves\u2019 Tools (maybe trade these for something else if your party already has this covered). That\u2019s all but one of the proficiencies, which we will trade for Double-Bladed Scimitar, for flavor reasons. The aforementioned Marine Background will give us Land and Sea Vehicles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For skills, we\u2019re picking Insight and Religion from Cleric and are granted Athletics and Survival from Marine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, the Skill Expert feat gives us both Perception Proficiency and Expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to dip Stars Druid into this build to get goodberry and to pick up the Starry Forms. We\u2019ll take the first Druid level at second character level because getting Goodberry early is very useful. We\u2019ll delay the second Druid level until sixth character level so that we don\u2019t push our first ASI too far off. Alternatively we could put this off until the tenth character level to put it right after our second ASI.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"but-i-dont-want-to-multiclass\">But I don&#8217;t want to Multiclass?<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Overall, the two big things we lose from removing the Circle of Stars dip are the interaction of goodberry and Life Domain and the Starry Form: Dragon giving us such a powerful boost to maintaining Concentration. Because of this, War Caster becomes more attractive than Resilient (Constitution) this early. We still want to take Resilient, but later around 12th or 16th level, and we&#8217;ll be able to simply shift the rest of our choices because we&#8217;ll get the ASI from 19th-level Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At fourth Cleric, fifth overall, we take Resilient (Constitution) unless we\u2019ve decided to take Skill Expert early for the Wisdom. We take this instead of pushing Wisdom because it improves the floor of our Dragon Starry Form when we pick that up. This in turn will make it almost impossible for us to drop Spirit Guardians early.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentioned above, we\u2019re taking Skill Expert at eighth Cleric level (tenth character level), choosing Perception for both Proficiency and Expertise. Alternatively, if the party already has plenty of Perception, Chef is a good choice and goes well thematically with our choice to make far too many goodberries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth Cleric, fourteenth overall, we take an ASI for +2 Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth Cleric, eighteenth overall, Tough shores up our hit points. As you\u2019ll see below, the +1 to Con saves from a +2 Constitution increase won\u2019t matter much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1-Cleric 1<\/td><td>Divine Domain: Life<br>\u2013Disciple of Life<br>\u2013Heavy Armor<br><br>Skills<br>-Athletics<br>-Insight<br>-Religion<br>-Survival<br><br>Tools<br>-Carpenter\u2019s Tools<br>-Cartographer\u2019s Tools<br>-Mason&#8217;s Tools<br>-Navigator&#8217;s Tools<br>-Smith&#8217;s Tools<br>-Thieves&#8217; Tools<br>-Vehicles (Land)<br>-Vehicles (Water)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-Cantrips<br>\u2013Toll the Dead<br>\u2013Word of Radiance<br><br>-1st-level Cleric Spells<br>\u2013Bless\u2013Cure Wounds<br>\u2013Healing Word<\/td><td>A 1st-level Cleric walks out with chain mail, a shield, and a mace, which is good because we need that AC to survive at this point.<br><br>Typically in combat this early we want to put up Bless on the attack roll-dependent party members so we can beat math.<br><br>Other than that, avoid dying and use your healing magic whenever it would save an ally\u2019s turn.<br><br>Our very wide assortment of tools gives us plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/tools\/\">additional utility options<\/a>.

Except we have a 4th-level slot because of the multiclassing and no 4th-level spells to cast yet, so we can upcast this to 4d8 damage.<br><br>We will make sure to protect our concentration on this spell with the Dragon Starry Form.
