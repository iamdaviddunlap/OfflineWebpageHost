The bonus damage isn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s reliable and consistent. The\n\tresistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage\n\tmultiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but your\n\tnumber of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid\n\tit.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Unarmored Defense<\/span>: 13 + CON and you don&#8217;t need to worry about DEX even slightly.

With Reckless Attack and the improved crit range, you crit on 19% of your attacks, making critical hits reasonably common.

If your scores are\n\tgood enough, you can forgo armor, so it&#8217;s nice to have adequate Dexterity and\n\tConstitution to beat the AC bonus provided by half plate. However, that&#8217;s also\n\tvery expensive, so it&#8217;s rarely worth the effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with many other classes, the temptation to take an 18 with point buy is hard to resist. In my opinion, it&#8217;s better for the Barbarian to spread those points across multiple ability scores.

It also provides a crucial defense against Charm and Fear effects, both of which are common and which target our weak mental saves.<br><br>Remember that Temporary Hit Points don&#8217;t stack, so this won&#8217;t stack with our Cottage Heritage temp hp, but those points won&#8217;t last long, so Mindless Rage is a great way to replace them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; STR 19 -&gt; 20<br>&#8211; Talent: Weapon\n\t\t\t\t\tDiscipline<\/td><td>By capping our Strength and adding Weapon Discipline, we improve our attack bonus and damage bonus with our maul by +2 in a single level, which feels really good.<br><br>We also get an early taste of Brutal Critical&#8217;s damage boost, though without the expanded crit range we still only crit a little less than 10% of the time when we attack with Reckless Attack.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Brutal Critical (1 die)<br>Rage Damage +3<\/td><td>With the expanded critical hit range and with Reckless Attack providing consistent advantage, we have a 19% chance to crit on any given attack, so we&#8217;re critting almost 1 in 5 times. With three attacks per turn (Multiattack+Frenzy), we have a 47% chance to crit on a turn where we use Frenzy. When we do crit, we roll a total of 4d12 before we add modifiers, and that feels awesome.<br><br>Crits also mean Temporary Hit Points from Mindless Rage, so we&#8217;re restoring temp hp frequently, further stretching our truly massive pool of hit points.<br><br>PB increases at this level, allowing us to share our Cottage Heritage Temporary Hit Points with another ally and increasing the hp to 8. In a typical party of 4 players, we can now cover the whole party. We also increase the damage bonus from Furious Charge.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Heroic Boon: Instant Rage<\/td><td>Initiative is rolled, you move 20 feet and immediately Rage without\n\t\t\t\t\tspending an action of any kind. This frees your Bonus Action on turn 1\n\t\t\t\t\tfor other activities, such as the additional attack from Frenzy.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Intimidating Presence<\/td><td>Most of our tactics are simple, fairly blunt instruments, but Intimidating Presence is complicated. Use it against crowds while you and your party focus on a few enemies at a time. Frightened prevents movement toward you, so clever use of Furious Charge or Shove will let you place enemies where they can&#8217;t reach your allies in melee.<br><br>You might look at the DC and think &#8220;Oh no, it&#8217;s Charisma-based!&#8221;, but remember that we get to add our current number of Temporary Hit Points from Mindless Rage. At this level with 16 CON, that&#8217;s +7 to our DC. Even with -1 Charisma, our save DC is 20. A full caster&#8217;s save DC will be 19 at the same level (ignoring Talents, etc.). We&#8217;re doing fine.<br><br>Don&#8217;t use Intimidating Presence just for the damage bonus. The damage of using that same Bonus Action to make your Frenzy attack is massively more damaging. The damage bonus is there so that you don&#8217;t feel as bad giving up the attack to use Intimidating Presence. Your party members might have ways to frighten enemies, which is your best-case scenario.<br><br>This is the last big tactical change in the entire build. From here, your numbers increase and you&#8217;ll get more powerful, but you don&#8217;t need to learn anything new.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Rage 5\/day<br>Improvement<br>&#8211; CON 16 -&gt; 17<br>&#8211; Talent: Heavy Weapon Mastery<\/td><td>Heavy Weapon Master is solely for the additional attack when we crit. No tactical changes; just more damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Brutal Critical (2 dice)<\/td><td>5d12+mods when we crit.<br><br>PB increases at this level,\n\t\t\t\t\tallowing us to share our Cottage Heritage Temporary Hit Points with\n\t\t\t\t\tanother ally and increasing the hp to 10, as well as increasing the\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage bonus from Furious Charge.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Persistent Rage<\/td><td>No tactical changes, but it&#8217;s nice to not get knocked out of Rage so easily.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Retaliation<\/td><td>Picture this: An enemy is 20 feet away. They attack you at range. You&#8217;re infuriated by this, and decide to retaliate. As a Reaction you move half of your speed (conveniently 20 feet), which triggers Furious Charge, and you beat them into a fine paste with your maul.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; CON 17 -&gt; 18<br>&#8211; Talent: Physical Fortitude<br>Rage Damage +4<\/td><td>Physical Fortitude further improves our excellent physical defenses.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Rage 6\/day<br>Brutal Critical (3 dice)<\/td><td>6d12+mods when we crit.<br><br>PB increases at this level,\n\t\t\t\t\tallowing us to share our Cottage Heritage Temporary Hit Points with\n\t\t\t\t\tanother ally and increasing the hp to 12, as well as increasing the\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage bonus from Furious Charge.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Unyielding Might<\/td><td>A floor on our Strength checks makes grappling a lot easier. The\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage bonus against objects is neat, but rarely impactful. Still,\n\t\t\t\t\ttaking your maul to the side of a castle suddenly feels very\n\t\t\t\t\teffective.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Improvement<br>&#8211; CON 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>We now have full plate AC.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Epic Boon: Primal Champion<\/td><td>24 Strength, 24 Constitution. Our AC is now 20 while completely\n\t\t\t\t\tunequipped. Our attack bonus is crazy, our damage is high, we have a\n\t\t\t\t\tstupefying 345 hit points, and we get fresh Temporary Hit Points every\n\t\t\t\t\tother turn on average.\n\t\t\t\t<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Barbarians are all about getting angry, dealing damage, and shrugging off enemy&#8217;s attacks. They have a ton of hit points, resistance to weapon damage while raging, and Rage gives a nice bonus to damage. Barbarians don&#8217;t get much in the way of skills, unfortunately, but they&#8217;re a ton of fun to play. Because their tactics are frequently very simple (rage, smash the nearest enemy, repeat), some players find the Barbarian unappealing compared to classes that have more diverse and complex options. But don&#8217;t let the simplicity deter you: charging into melee, turning Reckless Attack, and shrugging off paltry amounts
