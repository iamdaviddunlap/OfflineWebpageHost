What we end up with is a weirdly melee-range Druid with no real defensive capabilities and a primary gimmick that targets the worst save to ask a monster for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, you end up with something that\u2019s going to feel a whole lot like a Druid with no subclass that sometimes gets lucky and yeets enemies for cold damage. WotC has finally made a nautical themed Druid that\u2019s just as good on land as it is underwater\u2026 by making it pretty bad in both places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, it can absolutely still be optimized, and the flavor of it is definitely very good. If this subclass appeals to you, ask your DM to consider allowing Wrath of the Sea to target Dex saves instead of Con saves. I would say that puts this subclass up to a Blue rating, but not so powerful as to be problematic. The damage of Wrath of the Sea scales very little, so you\u2019re basically a slightly-better Rogue Striker at early levels and then have to figure out other optimization to stay relevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Circle of the Sea Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Circle of the Sea Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Circle of the Sea Species<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Circle of the Sea Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Circle of the Sea Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Circle of the Sea Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Circle of the Sea Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Circle of the Sea Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Circle of the Sea Build &#8211; Circle of the Sea(bass)<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#species\">Species<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skill-and-tool-proficiencies\">Skill and Tool Proficiencies<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats-and-ability-score-increases\">Feats and Ability Score Increases<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Speed debuffs are abundantly available, so stacking\n\t\t\t\tspeed debuffs on high-priority enemies is often a winning strategy.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 1 Spells<\/span>: Both spells are only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 2 Spells<\/span>: Gust of Wind is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful. Shatter isn&#8217;t consistently effective since it\n\t\t\t\ttargets Constitution saves, but it&#8217;s passable AOE damage until you can\n\t\t\t\tget better options.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 3 Spells<\/span>: Lightning Bolt is\n\t\t\t\tfine damage, but line AOE&#8217;s make it difficult to hit more than two\n\t\t\t\ttargets. You may be able to force enemies into position to hit more of\n\t\t\t\tthem by using Wrath of the Sea&#8217;s push effect. Water Breathing is useful\n\t\t\t\tin aquatic campaigns, but otherwise useless.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 4 Spells<\/span>: Control Water is\n\t\t\t\textremely situational, and Ice Storm just isn&#8217;t very good.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5 Spells<\/span>: A good summon and a\n\t\t\t\tgood save-or-suck. Unfortunately, summon spells that monopolize your\n\t\t\t\tBonus Action may see little use thanks to Wrath of the Sea.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wrath of the Sea<\/span>: Circle of the Sea&#8217;s\n\t\tsignature feature. The damage is good, especially for a Bonus Action that\n\t\tyou can use so frequently, and the push effect is significant. The text says\n\t\t&#8220;away&#8221; rather than &#8220;directly away&#8221;, which means that you can use this to\n\t\tlaunch enemies into the air for easy fall damage. The 10-minute duration\n\t\tmeans that you can easily use it before jumping into combat, but it&#8217;s also a\n\t\tBonus Action to activate, so you don&#8217;t really need to do so until you get\n\t\tStormborn and get flight and damage resistance while Wrath of the Sea is\n\t\tactive.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, this does have some challenges. The radius of the emanation is\n\t\t\tproblematically small at this level, forcing you to move into melee to use\n\t\t\tit until you get Aquatic Affinity at level 6. The Constitution save also\n\t\t\tmeans that this won&#8217;t work reliably, as Constitution saves are\n\t\t\tconsistently high throughout the CR range. You can&#8217;t dive into melee and\n\t\t\texpect this to always keep you out of trouble.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aquatic Affinity<\/span>: Increasing the area of\n\t\tWrath of the Sea means that you no longer need to get into melee to use it unless your target has reach,\n\t\twhich makes it a bit more powerful. The swim speed is nice, but in most\n\t\tgames it won&#8217;t have an impact.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stormborn<\/span>: Flight and resistance to three\n\t\tdamage types. None of them are particularly common, but three damage types\n\t\tis still a lot of protection.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Oceanic Gift<\/span>: Throwing this on your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s front-line martial characters can give them a huge boost, providing\n\t\tflight, damage resistances, and the Bonus Action damage and push effect. At\n\t\tthis level you get 3 Wild Shape uses per Short or Long Rest, so you can\n\t\tfrequently afford to put Wrath of the Sea on yourself and on an ally at the\n\t\tsame time. It gets even easier when you hit level 7 and get 4 uses per\n\t\trest.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Circle of the Sea Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different than <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-druid\/#backgrounds\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27763\">other Druids<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Circle of the Sea Species<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We definitely want to lean into good defensive options like the Tortle or Loxodon so that we don\u2019t immediately die when trying to use our defining feature in melee range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Circle of the Sea Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: With our limits on armor proficiencies, this needs to be at least a 14 most of the time and higher is better most of the time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Useful for maintaining Concentration (and remaining alive).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Druids run on Wisdom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Circle of the Sea Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different than <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-druid\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27763\">most Druids<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Circle of the Sea Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different than <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-druid\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27763\">most Druids<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Circle of the Sea Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing different than <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-druid\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27763\">most Druids<\/a>, though our penchant for getting up into melee almost certainly means we want to use a shield.

Summon Beast neatly handles both tasks at once.<br><br>Keep in mind that we can punt people straight up and away from us with Wrath of the Sea. 15 feet will cause them to take falling damage, upping your DPR and causing them to fall prone. Why do we care about Prone? Because that Shillelagh you\u2019ve been recasting every 9 rounds when you\u2019re in any situation that might lead to a fight will now let you Booming Blade them and walk away. They\u2019ll make Opportunity Attacks against us at Disadvantage for being Prone, and we\u2019ll have Advantage on the attack roll for the same reason. Plus we have Shield to help keep us safe.<br><br>If you\u2019re confident they\u2019ll fail the save (maybe you\u2019re fighting something that\u2019s been Baned or hit with Mind Sliver), you can Booming Blade them instead and then punt them away at an angle so that they\u2019re both prone and not next to you, forcing them to take the secondary damage from Booming Blade to so much as attack anyone.<br>Of course, that only works if they fail the Con save. If not, Booming Blade still does a nice extra pile of damage if they move, and hopefully they attack our Beast instead of attacking us.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Inspiring Leader<br>(Wis 17 -&gt; 18)<br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Aid<br><br>Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Guidance<\/td><td>Putting a bunch of Temporary Hit Points on before you go wading into melee is a great idea, and your party will benefit greatly, too. Aid will further increase our survivability.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Aura of Vitality<br>&#8211; Revivify<br><br>Wild Resurgence<\/td><td>We pay the Revivify tax and grab the spell that lets us burn one spell slot for 20d6 healing. You should never do this in combat, but it\u2019s an incredible replacement for a Short Rest at nearly any level if the only thing the party is low on is health.<br><br>Wild Resurgence is there in case we\u2019re somehow having more fights than Wrath of the Sea charges. It\u2019s also good for summoning Familiars to be extra targets for enemies. Every hit on a familiar is a hit that\u2019s not on someone who can permanently die, and the familiars are valid targets for Inspiring Leader.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Aquatic Affinity<br><br>Wild Shapes per Rest:<br>2 -&gt; 3<br><br>Spell Prepared:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Aquatic Affinity allows us another option for tactics: we can now safely attempt to punt someone sideways instead of up and then hit them with Ray of Frost if they fail, putting them 25 feet (10 feet of reach, 15 feet of push) away from us and with a reduced chance of making it back due to the speed penalty from Ray of Frost. This is nowhere near as much damage as the other options, but it\u2019s substantially safer.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Fire Shield<br>&#8211; Summon Elemental<br><br>Elemental Fury:<br>&#8211; Potent Spellcasting<br><\/td><td>Disappointingly, Potent Spellcasting won\u2019t work on Booming Blade because it\u2019s not a Druid Cantrip. With that said, let\u2019s check the DPR comparison:<br><br>Assuming the target fails the Con save against Wrath of the Sea and lands next to you, you Booming Blade them with Advantage and walk away, so they\u2019re forced to trigger the rider to move on their next turn: 42.06 and they get one prone Opportunity Attack against us and maybe get one Attack action if they have enough speed to get back into melee.<br><br>Assuming the target fails the Con save and gets thrown horizontally so that you don\u2019t take Disadvantage for attacking a Prone target at range: 27.05, and the target maybe gets one Attack action if they have enough speed to get back into melee.<br>Both of those are strong assumptions, though, considering that Con is always the best save for monsters, as we called out above. If the target <em>doesn\u2019t<\/em> fail the Con save, we\u2019re looking at 15.5 vs just 9.5, or the difference between being over target DPR and only being halfway between low and target.<br><br>That said, we pick up some Fire Shield to keep ourselves safe, and trade the spell we started preparing at level 6 for Summon Elemental to get Earth Elemental Spirits. With resistance to 2\/3rds of the physical damage types, a higher AC than ours (when we\u2019re not casting Shield), 2 attacks, and 50hp, they\u2019re nearly as effective as a Barbarian of our level. We hope we can hide behind them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: Wis 18 -&gt; 20<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">Polymorph<\/a><\/td><td>Nothing stops us from turning on Wrath of the Sea and then turning into a T-Rex. Put that Prone Advantage to good use and enjoy the huge pile of THP that keeps us safe. I wouldn\u2019t call this a primary tactic (I still think just upcasting Earth Elementals is better, especially as we scale past the range of usefulness of a T-Rex), but it\u2019s a good thing to have in our back pocket.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Greater Restoration<br>&#8211; Wall of Fire<\/td><td>Yeeting people through Wall of Fire repeatedly is a hilarious way to make sure they either keep taking the damage to get back to you or they surrender.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Stormborn<br><br>Spell Prepared:<br>&#8211; Commune with Nature<br><br>Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Druidcraft<\/td><td>Nothing particularly interesting at this level except that we can fly all the time now. This does nearly nothing for our tactics since we want to be in melee anyway and have invested an Origin Feat, a General Feat, and a decent chunk of Con into being pretty sturdy for a Druid. It does mean that flying enemies won\u2019t escape our shenanigans, though.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Heal<\/td><td>The only combat healing worth casting that isn\u2019t Healing Word to stabilize someone.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Rune Carver<br>&nbsp;<\/td><td>Things are starting to hit harder and more often against our lack of defensive scaling. What do we do about that? Learn Armor of Agathys, of course, arguably the best defensive spell in the game for melee characters. The temporary hit points won\u2019t stack with Inspiring Leader, but you can cast Armor of Agathys once you\u2019re through Inspiring Leader\u2019s THP if it\u2019s not yet time for another Short Rest.<br><br>We can also pick up the King rune for Command, easily one of the best low-level save-or-sucks for how well it scales.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Reverse Gravity<\/td><td>It\u2019s still one of the best area control spells in the game.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Oceanic Gift<\/td><td>Now you can put Wrath of the Sea on you and your Summoned Earth Elemental which previously had no use for its Bonus Action. This doubles our chances of getting the target to fail the save and doesn\u2019t force someone else in your party who\u2019s probably been optimizing their own Bonus Actions for 14 levels to suddenly have to think about your gift. Of course, they might just want the flight speed.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/practical-guide-to-animal-shapes\/\">Animal Shapes<\/a><br><br>Improved Elemental Fury<\/td><td>As previously discussed, we\u2019re largely built for melee combat.

If you don\u2019t have such a willing friend\/Simulacrum\/hired underling who will follow you around doing this, at this level, we have access to enough resources like spells and money that we can feasibly just ask the DM what it would take to craft an item that had Darkness on it permanently.
