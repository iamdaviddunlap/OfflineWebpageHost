Someone <em>finally<\/em> fixed the Monk. Since 3.0, the Monk has been the laughingstock of classes. No amount of splat books, errata, archetypes, or alternate class features could make the Monk work. Monks have always faced two problems:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>First, they are difficult to play. The Monks biggest class features were incompatible. The class was a front-line class with garbage AC and no hit points. Monks needed high scores in <em>every<\/em> ability score. Second, Monks couldn&#8217;t <em>do anything<\/em>. Their best trick was to punch things, and basically every martial class in the game could do that better. Brawlers were especially insulting since they dropped all of the Monk&#8217;s problems but kept their unarmed combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Unchained Monk dramatically improves the Monk&#8217;s customizability, versatility, and utility. A whole host of new options allow Monks to function as a Defender in addition to their existing abilities as a Striker, bringing them at least up to the capabilities of a Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the Unchained Monk. For the vanilla Monk, see my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk\/\">Monk Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>. If you would like help with Pathfinder options not covered here, please <a href=\"mailto:RPGBOT@RPGBOT.net\">email me<\/a> and I may be able to provide additional assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks. Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-new\">What&#8217;s New?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Unchained Monk is the most significantly changed Unchained class. It drops all of the lingering nastiness that monks retained from 3.5 and finally makes the monk simple to build without relying on 2+ archetypes to get a functional vanilla monk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Ki Powers<\/strong>: Ki Powers add a talent-style customization option to Monks, allowing for much more diversity among Monk builds. The list of options includes powers which monks were previously locked into like Slow Fall and Quivering Palm, as well as a handful of exciting new options. Qinggong Monks players may find the mechanic familiar.<\/li><li><strong>Style Strikes<\/strong>: Unique strikes to add as rider effects once or twice each time you use Flurry of Blows, adding a lot of interesting options to the Monk&#8217;s favorite combat option.<\/li><li><strong>Flawless Mind<\/strong>: You&#8217;ll notice that Unchained Monks get low Will saves. This will fix it, but not until 19th level.<\/li><li><strong>Updated Numbers<\/strong>: d10 hit points, full BAB, and low Will saves. Altogether, a dramatic improvement that brings the monk on par with the fighter. You can fix bad will saves with Iron Will, while vanilla monks need to fix their hit points with Toughness and have no way to fix their medium BAB.<\/li><li><strong>No Archetypes<\/strong>: Any archetype published for the vanilla Monk is not compatible with the Unchained Monk. While the loss of variety is unfortunate, the improvement to the class is so significant that I think it&#8217;s a fair trade.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Unchained Monk Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: Finally! The Monk has normal\n\thit points for a martial character.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s primary\n\toffensive option, Flurry of Blows, pretended that the Monk had full BAB. Not\n\tactually giving Monks full BAB was an absurd and complicated aspect of the\n\tclass which had no discernable positive effect on the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Good Fortitude and Reflex saves.\n\tVanilla Monks also get good Will saves, so this is a minor setback, but Monks\n\tneed Wisdom anyway so your Will save should be fine.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Monks get a really bizzarre\n\tcollection of exotic weapons, but many of them provide bonuses to combat\n\tmaneuvers, and the ability to use Flurry of Blows with monk weapons allows you\n\tto get the same number of attacks as a TWF build, but with the damage output\n\tof a two-handed build.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: No change here. Monks still have\n\tgarbage skills, which makes it very difficult for them to fill non-combat\n\troles in the party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">AC Bonus<\/span> (Ex): The Monk AC bonus helps to\n\toffset the monk&#8217;s lack of armor. The scaling is fairly negligible, but it\n\tstill feels good to have. However, your AC will still be awful without\n\tadditional items and AC improvements.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Blows<\/span> (Ex): This is the Monk&#8217;s\n\ticonic attack. It follows the same progression as a fighter maximizing the\n\ttwo-weapon fighting feats, but you have no &#8220;off-hand&#8221; attacks. You don&#8217;t even\n\tneed free hands. You can use your feet if your hands are full. You can also\n\talternate freely between weapons and unarmed strikes, and you can substitute\n\tdisarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmed Strike<\/span>: This is why you generally\n\tplay a monk: because you want to hit things with your bare hands\/feet\/etc. The\n\tdamage dice starts off fairly small, but when you hit d8 at level 4, it begins\n\tto outpace whatever weapons you might be two-weapon fighting with. At level\n\t12, your fists are greatswords. You can also deal nonlethal damage without\n\tpenalty, which is situationally useful. It&#8217;s important to note that your\n\tunarmed strike damage is heavily size-based, so you want to do everything you\n\tcan to increase your effective size. Get enlarged and throw Impact on an\n\tAmulet of Mighty Fists. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the damage\n\tprogression stops at 20th-level, so items like a Monks Belt stop being useful\n\tat high levels unless you multiclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"size_table\" class=\"wp-block-table zebra-striped is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Small<\/th><th>Medium<\/th><th>Large<\/th><th>Huge<\/th><th>Gargantuan<\/th><th>Colossal<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1st-3rd<\/td><td>1d4<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4th-7th<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8th-11th<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>1d10<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12th-15th<\/td><td>1d10<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16th-19th<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20th<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>2d10<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><td>12d8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Brawler\/Monk Unarmed Strike Damage by Size and Level<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This table is taken from the 3.5 rules. They should be the same in Pathfinder, but Pathfinder doesn&#8217;t provide official rules for monks smaller than small or larger than large. Check with your GM before using this table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: With the addition of the\n\tAdvanced Player&#8217;s Guide and Ultimate Combat, the Monk has a lot of great bonus\n\tfeat options. And the best part: &#8220;A monk need not have any of the\n\tprerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.&#8221; This is\n\tespecially great for the high level style feats, since many of the\n\tprerequisites are fairly awful.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>1st Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Catch Off-Guard<\/span>: There isn&#8217;t a single\n\t\t\t\ttime when an improvised weapon will deal more damage than a Monk&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tUnarmed Strike.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Attacks of\n\t\t\t\tOpportunity let you control the battlefiend, and this combines well with\n\t\t\t\tGreater Trip.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflect Arrows<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dodge<\/span>: The Monk generally has low AC,\n\t\t\t\tand an extra point is a big help.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Grapple<\/span>: Essential for any\n\t\t\t\tgrappler..<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scorpion Style<\/span>: You give up your full\n\t\t\t\tattack for a slightly annoying debuff. Oh, and if you miss or they save\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re totally hosed.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Throw Anything<\/span>: Monks are not usually\n\t\t\t\tranged characters, and those who are use bows or thrown weapons.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>6th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gorgon&#8217;s Fist<\/span>: Getting this without\n\t\t\t\tprerequisites makes it non-functional because Gorgon&#8217;s Fist only works\n\t\t\t\ton enemies already affected by Scorpion Style.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Bull Rush<\/span>: Too\n\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Disarm<\/span>: You can bypass\n\t\t\t\tCombat Expertise, but this is still situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Feint<\/span>: You are not a\n\t\t\t\tRogue.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Trip<\/span>: Getting this without\n\t\t\t\tCombat Expertise is fantastic.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mobility<\/span>: If you are within reach of\n\t\t\t\tsomething, you should be punching it.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>10th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Critical<\/span>: Going from 20 to\n\t\t\t\t19-20 isn&#8217;t a big enough leap to justify a feat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Throw<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Medusa&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: Skipping Scorpion\n\t\t\t\tStyle and Gorgon&#8217;s Fist makes this <em>extremely<\/em> potent. Lead off a\n\t\t\t\tcombo with Stunning Fist, and get two free attacks! At level 12 you can\n\t\t\t\tmake foes staggered for 1d6+1 rounds, allowing you to continue to use\n\t\t\t\tthis feat without spending additional Ki.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snatch Arrows<\/span>: Situational and\n\t\t\t\tinneffective.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spring Attack<\/span>: You need to full attack\n\t\t\t\tto do damage as monk.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>14th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Binding Throw<\/span>: This is a hard feat\n\t\t\t\tto make work. You need Ki Throw, but if you have both you can easily\n\t\t\t\tstart a grapple with an opponent you just tripped.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Ki Throw<\/span>: Still very\n\t\t\t\tsituational, and skipping the prereq doesn&#8217;t get you anything.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning First<\/span> (Ex): Another iconic Monk\n\tability, stunning fist gets better as you advance. A\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">stunned<\/span> creature drops everything held (free\n\tdisarm!), can&#8217;t take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its\n\tDexterity bonus to AC (if any). This makes the rest of your iterative attacks\n\tmuch better, and prevents the target from taking attacks of opportunity when\n\tyou make Combat Maneuver attempts in place of your iterative attacks. At\n\thigher levels you can instead make the target\n\t<span class=\"rating-red\">fatigued<\/span> (-2 to CMD due to reduced str and\n\tdex), <span class=\"rating-orange\">sickened<\/span> (-2 to saves so you can more\n\treliably apply other affects),\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">staggered<\/span> (only one action per turn),\n\tpermanently <span class=\"rating-blue\">blinded<\/span> or\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">deafened<\/span> (permanently flat-footed or\n\tpermanently bad at casting spells), and finally\n\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">paralyzed<\/span> (lol). The only issue is that it&#8217;s\n\ta fortitude save, which is typically high for monsters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Always fantastic, Evasion\n\tworks well with your reasoanbly high dexterity and strong saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Movement<\/span> (Ex): Extra speed lets you\n\tget into position to stop moving sooner. Past round 1, hope that you won&#8217;t\n\tneed this much speed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Pool<\/span> (Su): Damage reduction is the\n\tbiggest problem for builds which rely on large numbers of attacks with\n\trelatively low damage. Ki Pool lets you treat your attacks as magic, silver,\n\tcold iron, lawful, and finally adamantine. While very few things have\n\tDR\/lawful, the others are excellent and cover a broad spectrum of enemies. At\n\tlow levels, you may need to carry weapons to handle DR silver and DR cold\n\tiron, but Ki Pool will handle things at higher levels so long as you have a\n\tpoint in your Ki Pool. You can spend points from your ki pool as a swift to\n\tget an <span class=\"rating-blue\">extra attack<\/span>,\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">boost your speed<\/span>, or\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">boost your AC<\/span>. When things get serious,\n\tthese boosts can make or break your monk.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Power<\/span>: Ki Powers are the Unchained Monk&#8217;s\n\ttalent equivalent, and they open up some really fun and exciting options for\n\tcustomizing your Monk.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Abundant Step<\/span> (Su): Sometimes your speed\n\t\tcan&#8217;t get you where you need to go, and you can use this a move action.\n\t\tHowever, keep in mind that you can&#8217;t take additional actions after using it.\n\t\tMake sure to do something with your other actions before teleporting, even\n\t\tif it&#8217;s just to Fight Defensively for the AC bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cobra Breath<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Diamond Body<\/span> (Su): The vanilla Monk&#8217;s\n\t\tversion is passive, and doesn&#8217;t eat your Ki. At high levels a lot of enemies\n\t\tuse poison, which can make the orginal Diamond Body very useful. Instead of\n\t\tthis, buy a pile of antitoxins.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Diamond Mind<\/span> (Su): Situational, and fear\n\t\teffects tend to be fairly gentle.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Diamond Resilience<\/span> (Ex): DR can be\n\t\tfantastic for low-AC melee characters like Monks, and the scaling is\n\t\tdecent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Diamond Soul<\/span> (Ex): Spellcasters are very\n\t\tscary, but Monks already have among the best saves in the game, so you\n\t\tshouldn&#8217;t need to worry about them too much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Fury<\/span> (Su): Not always useful\n\t\tdepending on your enemies&#8217; resistances, but with the Monks crazy number of\n\t\tattacks it&#8217;s easy to get quite a bit of damage out of this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Burst<\/span> (Su): Decent damage in a\n\t\tcone.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Empty Body<\/span> (Su): Punch ghosts and walk\n\t\tthrough walls.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Feather Balance<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Formless Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Only works against\n\t\tenemies in a stance from a style feat. Go grab every Bestiary volume and\n\t\tcount how many of those there are. There are none. Then count how many NPC\n\t\tmonks you&#8217;ve ever fought. Probably single digits unless you&#8217;ve played a &#8220;far\n\t\teast&#8221; style game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Furious Defense<\/span> (Ex): Formless Mastery\n\t\tis strictly better. You can use both together, but spending 3 Ki to boost\n\t\tyour AC for one round seems a bit expensive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">High Jump<\/span> (Ex): Jumping is silly in a game\n\t\twhere flying is so easily accessible. Potions of Jump cost 50 gp.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Insightful Wisdom<\/span> (Su): This allows you to\n\t\tgive your allies a reroll on save-or-die rolls. Everyone needs this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Blocker<\/span> (Su): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ki Guardian<\/span> (Su): This is hard to use\n\t\tbecause it requires your allies to remain adjacent to you, but it&#8217;s great\n\t\tagainst traps and ambushes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Hurricane<\/span> (Ex): You might use this once.\n\t\tYou&#8217;ll immediately realize that it eats half of your daily Ki pool, then\n\t\tnever use it again. If you really need to move during your attacks, pick up\n\t\tthe Flying Kick Style Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Metabolism<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ki Mount<\/span> (Su): This is basically\n\t\tcopy+pasted from the Sohei Monk. Ki Mount allows you to take any random\n\t\tmundane mount and turn it into an effective option for a few hours. If your\n\t\thorse dies, go grab another and feed it a Ki point and you&#8217;re back in\n\t\tbusiness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Range<\/span> (Su): Only useful for thrown\n\t\tweapon builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Visions<\/span> (Su): Interesting, but if you\n\t\tneed divination magic go find a Cleric.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Volley<\/span> (Su): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Light Steps<\/span> (Ex): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">One Touch<\/span> (Su): You shouldn&#8217;t need to\n\t\tdepend on this, but it can be a great way to disable difficult enemies using\n\t\tStunning Fist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Qinggong Power <\/span> (Su): The Qinggong Monk\n\t\twas one of the biggest power boosts which Monks saw prior to the Unchained\n\t\tMonk. Many of the Qinggong Monk&#8217;s powers are fantastic, adding them to the\n\t\tUnchained Monk&#8217;s list of available Ki Powers adds a huge number of\n\t\tadditional options. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk\/archetypes#qinggong-monk\">Monk Archetypes Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\tfor help choosing Qinggong powers. You can select this option moret han\n\t\tonce, so in theory you could rely solely on Qinggong powers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quivering Palm<\/span> (Su): Miles better than the\n\t\toriginal version solely because you can do it more than once per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Slow Fall<\/span> (Su): Buy a Ring of Feather\n\t\tFalling if you&#8217;re thise worried about gravity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sudden Speed<\/span> (Su): Seriously? You&#8217;re not\n\t\tfast enough already? This is only useful if you make frequent use of the\n\t\tFlying Kick Style Strike to move around during your Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Sprint<\/span> (Su): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wind Jump<\/span> (Su): This is fun, but it\n\t\tprevents you from full attacking mid-flight. Get a Broom of Flying\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wholeness of Body<\/span> (Ex): At the end of\n\t\tthe day when you&#8217;re about to rest, this is a good way to empty your Ki Pool,\n\t\tbut I don&#8217;t think it will see a lot of use if you still have things to fight\n\t\ttoday.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Still Mind<\/span> (Ex): Your saves are already\n\tgreat, but a bonus against enchantments and compulsions can save you from some\n\treally awful effects. This is especially helpful since the Unchained Monk has\n\tlow Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Purity of Body<\/span> (Ex): Immunity to diseases\n\tis nice, but rarely useful. With the exception of Contagion spell, you\n\ttypically have enough time to have someone cast Remove Disease before disease\n\tbecomes a problem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Style Strike<\/span>: Style Strikes add some\n\tversatility and utility to the Monk&#8217;s Flurry of Blows, allowing you to add\n\tsome helpful bonus effects to one or two of your attacks every time you\n\tflurry. You get 5 choices over time, which is perfect because 5 of the options\n\tare worthwhile. If you use the Enforcer feat, Elbow Smash becomes a good 6th\n\toption, and if you skip Improved Trip for whatever reason Leg Sweep becomes a\n\tgood 7th.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Spin<\/span>: AC is one of the Monk&#8217;s\n\t\tbiggest problems, and +4 is a considerable bonus. It only applies to the\n\t\ttarget of the attack, so look for other options when facing multiple\n\t\tfoes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elbow Smash<\/span>: An extra attack is great,\n\t\tbut it&#8217;s nonlethal damage. If you plan to use the Enforcer feat, this could\n\t\tbe an option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flying Kick<\/span>: The ability to move and full\n\t\tattack in the same turn is a powerful and extremely potent ability. This\n\t\twon&#8217;t get you very far at low levels, but as your fast movement bonus\n\t\tincreases your range on the battlefiend will increase sharply.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Foot Stomp<\/span>: Unless you pick up Improved\n\t\tTrip (and you really should), Monks don&#8217;t have a lot of options to prevent\n\t\tenemies from moving out of the Monk&#8217;s reach. This addresses that issue very\n\t\tnicely, and if the target wants to move away they waste their Standard\n\t\tAction just to get an attempt to do so. The action economy on this is\n\t\tspectacular.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hammerblow<\/span>: Nothing fancy: just a big a\n\t\tpile of damage. Sometimes that&#8217;s all you need. Captain Kirk would\n\t\tapprove.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Head-Butt<\/span>: Staggering an enemy is a good\n\t\ttrick, but Stunning Fist can already do that, and you don&#8217;t take a -8\n\t\tpenalty to hit with it when you&#8217;re not fighting a humanoid.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knockback Kick<\/span>: Basically Bull Rush with\n\t\tdouble the movement distance. Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Leg Sweep<\/span>: This is very similar to\n\t\tImprove Trip, but there some key differences. With Leg Sweep you attack\n\t\tfirst, then get the trip attempt if you hit. With Improved Trip you trip\n\t\tfirst, but only get a free attack with Great Trip, which will require Combat\n\t\tExpertise. Leg Sweep can only be used once or twice per round, while\n\t\tImproved Trip can be used in place of any of your attacks. Improved Trip\n\t\tprovides a bonus to trip attacks, and can be used for attacks of\n\t\topportunity, while Leg Sweep must be used as part of Flurry of Blows. Oh,\n\t\tand you can use a weapon with Improved Trip to get a bonus to your CMB. I\n\t\tthink it&#8217;s fair to say that Improved Trip is a little bit better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shattering Punch<\/span>: Overcoming DR is a big\n\t\tproblem for Monks because they get by on a flurry of low-damage attacks.\n\t\tOvercoming DR on one of those attacks is a nice gurantee, but your damage\n\t\toutput will still be very low unless you can completely overcome the\n\t\ttarget&#8217;s DR.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spin Kick<\/span>: This is a great option against\n\t\tfoes with lots of Dexterity or a dodge bonus to AC. Unfortunately that&#8217;s not\n\t\ta lot of foes. It&#8217;s also helpful to use this with your weakest iterative\n\t\tattacks, which will have the most trouble hitting normally.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Always amazing and\n\treliable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/span> (Ex): You can talk\n\tto anything, but you&#8217;re not particularly good at it with no Diplomacy and\n\tlousy charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Timeless Body<\/span> (Ex): Stay young and pretty\n\tuntil you die of old age. Leave a pretty corpse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flawless Mind<\/span>: A reroll on Will saves will\n\tabsolutely compensate for the Unchained Monk&#8217;s low Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Perfect Self<\/span>: Suddenly you can&#8217;t use Enlarge\n\tPerson. The DR is cute, and you become immune to things like Dominate Person,\n\tbut things which require you to be a humanoid have generally been abandoned\n\tfor several levels. I would argue that this ability actually makes you\n\t<em>worse<\/em> since you can&#8217;t benefit from Enlarge Person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks are primarily a striker, and their damage comes from their Strength, so Strength needs to be their biggest ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: As a melee character, strength is the\n\tmonk&#8217;s most important ability. It contributes to your melee attacks and\n\tdamage, shuriken damage, and combat maneuvers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Crucial for the monk&#8217;s relatively low\n\tAC, and contributes to several monk skills. Reflex saves are also a good point\n\tto focus on since you get Evasion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Monks are combat characters with d8\n\thit points, so Constitution is crucial. Fortitude saves are also important for\n\tcombat characters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Dump to 8.

Their\n\t\tpenalty is to the Monk&#8217;s dump stat, and their low speed is offset by the\n\t\tmonk speed bonus. Darkvision is great, and they get a +2 to saves against\n\t\tspells on top of the Monk&#8217;s already impressive saves. Unfortunately, the\n\t\tfavored class bonus is worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: -2 to con is brutal, and their only\n\t\thelpful bonus is a +2 to dexterity. Many of the Elf&#8217;s bonuses relate to\n\t\tspellcasting, which monks can&#8217;t do, and the alternate racial traits are not\n\t\tspecifically helpful to the Monk. The favored class bonus provides a wholly\n\t\tunnecessary bonus to the Monk&#8217;s speed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Small monks? A -2 to strength is\n\t\tcrippling, especially since your damage dice will be smaller, and Enlarge\n\t\tPerson won&#8217;t give you reach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Elf<\/span>: +2 to strength and low-light\n\t\tvision, but that&#8217;s really all we get here. The Half-Elf&#8217;s alternate racial\n\t\ttraits don&#8217;t offer anything helpful, and the Half-Elf&#8217;s favored class bonus\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t help much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: +2 to strength, and Ferocity\n\t\tcan be helpful if you want to use Intimidate. Darkvision is fantastic, too.\n\t\tThe Half-Orc favored class bonus is garbage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: Small monks are typically\n\t\tterrible, but Halflings might be viable thanks to their racial feats.\n\t\tEmphasizing Fight Defensively (see my Practical Guide to Fighting\n\t\tDefensively) and taking Risky Striker can provide a significant damage\n\t\tboost, though the total number of feats you&#8217;ll need to succeed may be\n\t\tprohibitive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: +2 strength and a feat is pretty\n\t\tnice, but most decent Monk feats aren&#8217;t available at first level. The skill\n\t\tpoints don&#8217;t hurt, but they&#8217;re not doing us any big favors. The Human\n\t\tfavored class bonus provides a bonus to the Monk&#8217;s Ki pool, which is\n\t\tespecially helpful if you don&#8217;t take an archetype which allows you to\n\t\trecharge your Ki.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anatomist<\/span> (combat): Critical hits are not\n\t\tfor monks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (combat): You may spend a\n\t\tgreat deal of time going one-on-one against enemies, and with your multiple\n\t\tattacks this +1 bonus will add up to a lot of points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodthirsty<\/span> (combat): This is just a bad\n\t\ttrait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bullied<\/span> (combat): If you are building\n\t\tyour Monk as an area control defender, this may be useful.

This is\n\t\tespecially amazing if you&#8217;re using a monk weapon two-handed since you still\n\t\tget the extra attacks but also get 50% more damage bonus from your Strength\n\t\tand from Power Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vital Strike<\/span>: I wanted to badly for Vital\n\t\tStrike to be a meaningful way for the Unchain Monk to use a Standard Action.\n\t\tUnfortunately, the damage output still doesn&#8217;t come close to what a weapon\n\t\tweilder can do. Instead, try to find ways to directly solve your movement\n\t\tproblem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While you will most likely be fighting unarmed, monk weapons offer you a lot of really fantastic options, including bonuses to combat maneuvers. Monks who aren&#8217;t specialized with weapons should still carry a couple to bypass DR until Ki Pool covers the bases, and for bonuses on CMB checks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monks can use a single weapon for flurry of blows, which removes the need for double weapons or two-weapon fighting. This also increases the importance of damage enhancements on your weapon because you get a large number of low-damage attacks. If you plan to use weapons, be sure to pick up some damage enhancements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">bo staff<\/span>: Basically a quarterstaff with\n\t\tthe blocking property. d6 damage, 20&#215;2 crit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">brass knuckles<\/span>: Just like unarmed strike,\n\t\tbut less damage and enchantable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">butterfly sword<\/span>: Basically a fancy version\n\t\tof a dagger that you can&#8217;t throw. d4 damage, 19-20&#215;2 crit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">cestus<\/span>: Allows bludgeoning\n\t\t<em>or<\/em> piercing damage, which adds some nice versatility. d4 damage,\n\t\t19-20&#215;2 crit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">dan bong<\/span>: Despite doing 1d3 bludgeoning\n\t\tdamage, the Dan Bong is fantastic. It adds an incredibly rare +2 bonus to\n\t\tgrapple checks, has the blocking property, and can be thrown. Also it has\n\t\t19-20&#215;2 crit for some reason. It doesn&#8217;t actually have the Grapple property,\n\t\tso you can&#8217;t apply other weapon bonuses (masterwork\/enhancement) to your\n\t\tgrapple checks by using a dan bong. However, since you&#8217;re not using it to\n\t\tgrapple, you can use your unarmed strike damage when grappling.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">double chained kama<\/span>: The double property\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t really matter, but reach does. The double-chained kama also has the\n\t\tTrip property, which means you can use it to trip, drop one end to prevent\n\t\tyourself from being tripped back, then pick up the dropped end as a free\n\t\taction by pulling the chain. The description mentions using it to disarm,\n\t\tbut the table doesn&#8217;t list the disarm property, and normal Kamas don&#8217;t have\n\t\tdisarm. Keep in mind that because this is a double weapon, each end of the\n\t\tweapon can be a different material and can be enchanted seperately.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">double chicken saber<\/span>: A short sword with\n\t\tDisarm. 1d6 slashing damage and 19-20 crit. A solid choice, though not very\n\t\texciting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">emei piercer<\/span>: The wording is confusing.\n\t\tDespite the d3 damage, the description says that emei piercers turn unarmed\n\t\tstrikes into piercing damage. General consensus in rules discussions seems\n\t\tto be that the weapon overrides unarmed strike damage, but is otherwise\n\t\ttreated as an unarmed strike. If you just need a source of piercing damage,\n\t\tthere are better options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">fighting fan<\/span>: Leave these for ninjas.\n\t\tPoison is not your thing, and neither is feinting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">jutte<\/span>: 1d6 bludgeoning damage and\n\t\tdisarm. Not awful, but you will be better served getting a weapon with a\n\t\tdifferent damage type so that you don&#8217;t have to carry a pile of weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">kama<\/span>: 1d6 slashing damage and trip. One\n\t\tof the best options in the core rulebook. It&#8217;s light, which doesn&#8217;t do much\n\t\tfor monks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">kusarigama<\/span>: Similar to the double-chained\n\t\tkama, but the kusarigama trades some of the off-hand weapon damage for the\n\t\tgrapple property. The Grapple property gives you a +2 to grapple, and you\n\t\tcan add weapon enhancement bonuses to your grapple checks, but you use the\n\t\tweapon&#8217;s damage when grappling in place of your unarmed strike damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">kyoketsu shoge<\/span>: The description doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tappear to match the stats: it says that you can swing the ring around, but\n\t\tthe stats don&#8217;t say that you can deal bludgeoning damage. For what it does,\n\t\tthe Kusarigama and double-chained kama are better options, but the sword can\n\t\tdo slashing or piercing damage, which covers both of your missing damage\n\t\ttypes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">lungchuan tamo<\/span>: 1d4 damage, piercing or\n\t\tslashing damage, and throwable. This is a very versatile option if you don&#8217;t\n\t\tplan to use combat maneuvers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">monk&#8217;s spade<\/span>: 1d6 damage of any type. The\n\t\ttable is a bit misleading, though; the two ends do different types of\n\t\tdamage. This seems like a solid option, but it&#8217;s two-handed, which limits\n\t\tyour options in a fight, and it doesn&#8217;t give you bonuses to combat\n\t\tmaneuvers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">nine-ring broadsword<\/span>: The monk&#8217;s\n\t\tbattleaxe. Solid 1d8 slashing damage, and x3 crit, but nothing for combat\n\t\tmaneuvers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">nine-section whip<\/span>: 1d8 bludgeoning damage,\n\t\t19-20&#215;2 crit, blocking, distracting, and trip. Blocking and trip on one item\n\t\tis great, but the damage isn&#8217;t spectacular because it&#8217;s bludgeoning. Still,\n\t\tthis would be a great item at low levels before your unarmed strike damage\n\t\texceeds 1d8. You can hold it in one hand to take advantage of the blocking\n\t\tproperty while still fighting unarmed, which is great for Crane Style\n\t\tmonks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">nunchaku<\/span>: 1d6 bludgeoning damage and\n\t\tdisarm. Not awful, but there are better options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">quarterstaff<\/span>: Bo Staff is strictly\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">rope dart<\/span>: 1d4 piercing damage, blocking,\n\t\tdistracting, and throwable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">sai<\/span>: Less damage than the nunchaku, but\n\t\talso provides a +2 bonus when sundering weapons. Sundering isn&#8217;t a\n\t\tparticularly popular option, so the nunchaku is probably a better\n\t\tweapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">sansetsukon<\/span>: 1d10 bludgeoning damage is\n\t\tpretty great, and meets your unarmed strike damage until level 12. 19-20&#215;2\n\t\tcrit is great, and blocking and disarm are great on one weapon. The damage\n\t\tis good enough that, even at high levels where your unarmed strikes exceed\n\t\t1d10 damage, the Sansetsukon may be a viable option. The ability to attack\n\t\twith a two-handed weapon with as many attacks as two-weapon fighting builds\n\t\tmeans that the additional damage from Strength (not to mention Power Attack\n\t\tif you take it) could easily close the gap in damage output. However, you\n\t\tstill need to overcome the RAW numerical advantage provided by permanent +5\n\t\tunarmed strikes, which will be difficult to do.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">seven-branched sword<\/span>: 1d10 slashing\n\t\tdamage with x3 crit is pretty good, and it has disarm. You can also do an\n\t\talmost-trip to make targets flat-footed for a round, which is a weird\n\t\tsituationally useful trick.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shang gou<\/span>: 1d4 slashing damage, but it\n\t\tcan be used for disarm <em>or<\/em> trip, which adds some excellent\n\t\tversatility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shuriken<\/span>: Because they are drawn as a\n\t\tfree action like ammunition, shuriken can be used with Flurry of Blows.\n\t\tHowever, they are destroyed when used, which makes it difficult to justify\n\t\tenchanting them. Carry a few mundane shuriken for the rare case where you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t just run up and punch things.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">siangham<\/span>: 1d6 piercing damage. There are\n\t\toptions which deal the same damage and have special properties.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">tiger fork<\/span>: 1d8 piercing damage, and it can\n\t\tbe set against charges. Basically a bad trident.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">tonfa<\/span>: 1d6 bludgeoning damage and blocking.\n\t\tNine-section whip is strictly better unless you need a light weapon for some\n\t\tweird reason.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">tri-point double-edged sword<\/span>: &#8220;sword&#8221; is\n\t\tsomewhat of a minsomer; this thing is more of a polearm. 1d10 slashing\n\t\tdamage, x3 crit, and reach. Despite being in the &#8220;monk&#8221; weapon group, but\n\t\tlacks the Monk property, so you can&#8217;t use it with Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">unarmed strike<\/span>: Tried and true. Your\n\t\tdamage scales with level, you can&#8217;t be disarmed, and you technically don&#8217;t\n\t\tneed your hands free to fight unarmed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">urumi<\/span>: 1d8 slashing damage an impressive\n\t\t18-20&#215;2 critical. Distracting won&#8217;t get you much because Monks generally\n\t\tdon&#8217;t feint. Despite being in the &#8220;monk&#8221; weapon group, but lacks the Monk\n\t\tproperty, so you can&#8217;t use it with Flurry of Blows.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">wushu dart<\/span>: 1d3 piercing damage and\n\t\tthrowable. There are many more interesting options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend carrying a sansetsukon as your primary weapon due to the high damage and critical threat range, but be prepared to drop it once you get Ki Strike if you need to bypass DR\/magic, or abandon it completely once you can get enhancement bonuses on your fists reliably. The sansetsukon can also be used to disarm, but when you stop using it as your primary weapon replace it with something lighter like a double-chicken saber (for the slashing damage). Also carry a double-chained kama for tripping and for reach. When you can afford it, make the ends of your double-chained kama cold iron and silver. Piercing damage isn&#8217;t as important, but carry a Lungchuan Tamo or two just to be safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks can&#8217;t use armor, so I recommend getting someone in your party to cast Mage Armor on you. With hours\/level duration even a low level wizard can cover you for the full adventuring day. If your pet Wizard is stingy with his spell slots, drop 1000 gold pieces to buy him a Pearl of Power 1 so you can both share Mage Armor from one slot. The +4 bonus from Mage Armor is enough to make up most of the AC gap between a Monk and typical front-line character like a Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blade of the Sword-Saint<\/span> (75,350 gp):\n\t\t18-20 threat range and you can use it two-handed. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s worth\n\t\tthe cost because Ki Intensifying isn&#8217;t very good, but sometimes you just\n\t\treally want to double-down on the far-east feel of a monk swinging a\n\t\tkatana.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Brawling<\/span> (+1): Add your enhancement bonus\n\t\tto all of your combat maneuvers. Conveniently, unarmed strikes are light\n\t\tbludgeoning weapons so you could put this on an Amulet of Mighty Fists if\n\t\tyou wanted to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Furyborn<\/span> (+2): The best case scenario\n\t\tfor this weapon ability is for a monk to put it on an amulet of mighty\n\t\tfists. You need to be attacking with the same weapon a large number of times\n\t\tto make the ability work, and monks are the best way to do that.\n\t\tUnfortunately, it&#8217;s not clear if the maximum bonus of +5 is +5 in total with\n\t\tother enhancement bonuses (like your +5 unarmed strikes) or if it&#8217;s +5 just\n\t\tfrom Furyborn. If it&#8217;s the latter, the appeal of attacking with a +10\n\t\tenhancement bonus is hard to ignore. Of course, you still face the issue\n\t\tthat you should be killing enemies too quickly for this to ramp up, in which\n\t\tcase you&#8217;re sinking a bunch of money into an ability that rarely\n\t\tmatters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Focus<\/span> (+1): If you insist on using\n\t\tweapons, you need to have this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Intensifying<\/span> (+2): Basically Ki Focus\n\t\tbut you get to add half of your enhancement bonus to relevant special\n\t\tabilities. If you plan to put a bunch of money into an enhancement bonus\n\t\tthis might work, but I would wait until you have a <em>ton<\/em> of spare\n\t\tmoney before you even consider this ability. Enhancing your Wisdom will do\n\t\tmuch more for you for much less money.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wounding<\/span> (+2): Because the bleed stacks\n\t\twith itself, Wounding works best when you make a huge number of attacks with\n\t\ta single weapon, which is where monks specialize. Unfortunately, most of the\n\t\ttime you&#8217;ll get more damage out of abilities like Flaming because bleed\n\t\tdamage takes so long to deal significant of damage. This could be great\n\t\tagainst enemies with huge pools of hit points, but even against those foes\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll do more damage hitting them more on successive rounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wyroot<\/span> (1,000\/2,000\/4,000): An\n\t\teasily-overlooked method for recovering Ki. Attacking a helpless target is\n\t\tan automatic critical hit, so you can use this to farm Ki from unconscious\n\t\tenemies. If you deal nonlethal damage you can beat the same target\n\t\trepeatedly to fully restore your Ki pool, then fill the weapon to recharge\n\t\tlater. I would only get the first tier of the effect unless you&#8217;re high\n\t\tlevel and built to emphasize critical hits..<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection<\/span>: You need all the AC you can\n\t\tget.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cure Light Wounds<\/span>: You can&#8217;t use it, so\n\t\tbuddy up to someone who can. Your hit points will go up and down very\n\t\tsharply on a normal day, so this will see a lot of use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Armor<\/span>: You can&#8217;t use it, so buddy up\n\t\tto someone who can. It has a one-hour duration, which should last through\n\t\tseveral fights if you have time to cast it ahead of time. It provides as\n\t\tmuch AC as Bracers of Armor +4, which cost 16000gp. That&#8217;s more than 23\n\t\twands worth of GP. If you go through 1 wand per level (I don&#8217;t know how you\n\t\twould manage to do that) you will still save money.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Amulet of Mighty Fists<\/span>: This allows you to\n\t\tadd special weapon abilities to your unarmed strikes. Notably, it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire a +1 enhancement bonus like a weapon does, so you can go straight to\n\t\tthe fun stuff. The Impact enhancement is tempting since it lets you use a\n\t\tlarger damage scale, but Paizo has ruled that unarmed strikes count as light\n\t\tweapons and Impact can&#8217;t be placed on light weapons. Instead, consider\n\t\toptions like shocking, speed (oh look more attacks), or holy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Belt of Physical Perfection<\/span>: Get one\n\t\tearly, and upgrade it often.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bracers of Armor<\/span>: A wand of Mage Armor\n\t\tprovides as much AC as +4 bands, and for the same cost you can guy a huge\n\t\tbox of wands, and get the AC bonus at much lower level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\tforego.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deliquescent Gloves<\/span>: For just 8,000 gp\n\t\tyou can add +1d6 acid damage to attacks made with your hands. You&#8217;ll need to\n\t\tuse your hands for unarmed strikes to get the damage, but if you&#8217;re not\n\t\tusing a weapon that&#8217;s probably not a problem. These cost as much as a +2\n\t\tweapon, so wait to get these until your Amulet of Mighty Fists is already\n\t\t+2-equivalent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ioun Stone (Dusty Rose)<\/span>: At only 5000gp,\n\t\ta Dusty Rose Ioun Stone provides a cheaper boost to AC than upgrading your\n\t\tRing of Protection from +1 to +2. The bonus is an insight bonus, which makes\n\t\tit easy to stack because insight bonuses to AC are extremely rare.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of inspired wisdom<\/span>: Get one for\n\t\tthe extra AC, ki pool, and boost to your saves, but your belt is more\n\t\timportant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk&#8217;s Belt<\/span>: Your belt of Physical\n\t\tPerfection will be considerably more effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monk&#8217;s Robe<\/span>: Similar to the Monk&#8217;s Belt,\n\t\tbut you pretend to be 5 levels higher instead of 4 and it takes your mostly\n\t\tuseless robe slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longarm Bracers<\/span>: Functionally similar to\n\t\tthe Lunge feat, but they only work 3 times per day and they don&#8217;t impose a\n\t\tpenalty on attack rolls for your unarmed strikes. Lunge is too situational\n\t\tto justify a feat in my opinion, so these are a fantastic option for\n\t\tcovering those rare situations when you need some extra reach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Runner&#8217;s Shirt<\/span>: Tragically, the\n\t\terrataed version is useless to us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enlarge Person<\/span>: Large size brings a nice\n\t\tStrength bonus, reach, a considerable increase in the Monk&#8217;s unarmed strike\n\t\tdamage, and a size bonus to CMB\/CMD.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Fang<\/span>: For roughly 3000gp (2500 for\n\t\tpermanent magic fang, 450 for an NPC spellcaster casting Permanency, and\n\t\tprobably 90gp for that same spellcaster to actually cast Magic Fang) you can\n\t\thave permanent +1 to attack and damage.
