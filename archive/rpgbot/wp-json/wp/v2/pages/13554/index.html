For example, the Starry Form ability repurposes Wild Shape uses into one of three stances that can either make it easier to maintain concentration, increase the healing output of healing magic, or shoot lasers. Or maybe allow the stars to adjust fate throughout the day with the Cosmic Omen feature, giving the ability to add or subtract from nearby d20 rolls as a reaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With all of this versatility comes the cost of time. We can do all of these wonderful things, but not all at the same time. The Stars Druid is a balancing act of predicting what needs to be done. We\u2019ll give some guidance on this, but ultimately every combat is unique and it will take practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With our example build, we\u2019ll show off a racial choice that gives us the leeway we need to spread our attributes into being the party Scholar without sacrificing the rest of our build. This gives us the option for some additional out of combat uses of the Dragon Starry Form with skill checks.

I&#8217;ve hoped for\n\t\t\t\tmore unique spellcasting focuses for years and this is the first time\n\t\t\t\twe&#8217;ve gotten one (the common magic item focuses in Xanathar&#8217;s barely\n\t\t\t\tcount since they&#8217;re still generic focuses with added stuff). I also love\n\t\t\t\tthe idea of a druid running around with a big heavy stone slab or a\n\t\t\t\tdelicate collection of glass disks, especially since even a tiny amount\n\t\t\t\tof damage to either would jeopardize years of delicate work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guidance<\/span>: The best support cantrip,\n\t\t\t\tand you get it for free so you can enjoy other cantrips without feeling\n\t\t\t\tlike Guidance is a cantrip tax because it&#8217;s too good to skip.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guiding Bolt<\/span>: Very solid at low levels\n\t\t\t\tboth as a support option and for damage output, and radiant damage is a\n\t\t\t\trarity for the Druid.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Free Guiding Bolts<\/span>: Not only can you\n\t\t\t\tcast Guiding Bolt using your spell slots, you get to cast it for free a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of times per day equal to your Proficiency Bonus. This is done as\n\t\t\t\ta 1st-level spell, but 4d6 damage and Advantage on the next attack\n\t\t\t\tagainst that creature is better than any damage cantrip, even at 17th\n\t\t\t\tlevel. (Eldritch Blast+Invocations don&#8217;t count.) You won&#8217;t get enough\n\t\t\t\tfree uses of Guiding Bolt to totally replace attack cantrips,\n\t\t\t\tunfortunately.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Starry Form<\/span>: Turning Wild Shape into a\n\t\tbuff rather than a utility option was first done in Circle of Spores, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s just as cool on Circle of Stars. Starry Form is Arguably even cooler\n\t\tbecause instead of locking you into a combat mode, Starry Form has an attack\n\t\tmode, a healing mode, and a utility\/casting mode. Much like Circle of the\n\t\tMoon and Circle of Spores, expect to use Starry Form in any noteworthy\n\t\tcombat, but remember that you only get two uses per short rest so you&#8217;ll\n\t\tstill need to be functional without it sometimes.\n\t\t<p>Choosing which constellation to use is one of the most important tactical\n\t\t\tdecisions that you can make in an encounter. If you&#8217;re in close quarters\n\t\t\tand need to keep your spells going, go for Dragon. If your party is short\n\t\t\ton hit points going into the encounter, or if there&#8217;s some kind of hit\n\t\t\tpoint attrition issue (enemy has big AOE damage, or you&#8217;re fighting in a\n\t\t\tburning building), go for Chalice.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, go for Archer and pump out\n\t\t\tdamage as fast as you can. This tactical decision goes away at level 10\n\t\t\twhen you get Twinkling Constellations (In a way. Keep reading.), but until\n\t\t\tthen this will be among the hardest and most impactful choices that you\n\t\t\tmake in a fight.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archer<\/span>: 1d8+Wis radiant damage as a\n\t\t\t\tBonus Action. It&#8217;s a spell attack so the attack uses your Wisdom\n\t\t\t\tmodifier and doesn&#8217;t benefit from things like the Sharpshooter feat.\n\t\t\t\tThis is a great offensive option, and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t stop you\n\t\t\t\tfrom casting a leveled spell on the same turn is just spectacular. This\n\t\t\t\tis likely your go-to option in combat because it&#8217;s going to be useful in\n\t\t\t\tevery combat on every turn at any level. The damage improves at level\n\t\t\t\t10, but honestly if it didn&#8217;t this would still be great.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Chalice<\/span>: More than doubles the total\n\t\t\t\tamount healed by Healing Word, and you can target a creature not\n\t\t\t\ttargeted by your spell so you can heal two creatures at once. However,\n\t\t\t\tthis also encourages healing in combat which you should try very hard to\n\t\t\t\tavoid doing. The best use case for this is to use it right before a\n\t\t\t\tShort Rest if you have a Wild Shape usage left over. The healing\n\t\t\t\timproves at level 10.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon<\/span>: Druids have a lot of\n\t\t\t\tConcentration spells, so guaranteeing a minimum roll of 10 on those\n\t\t\t\tchecks is really helpful. Guaranteeing a minimum roll of 10 on\n\t\t\t\tIntelligence and Wisdom checks allows you to use this outside of combat,\n\t\t\t\twhich is a great utility option if you have knowledge skills like Arcana\n\t\t\t\tor Nature. At level 10, this adds a 20-foot fly speed, allowing you to\n\t\t\t\tfly while keeping your Concentration on a spell.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cosmic Omen<\/span>: Tactically similar to the\n\t\tBard&#8217;s Bardic Inspiration and Cuttings Words features. You won&#8217;t be able to\n\t\tuse this as often as a bard can use Bardic Inspiration, but 3 to 6 times per\n\t\tday is still extremely impactful, especially since you can use this as a\n\t\tReaction. The Weal\/Woe options are roughly equivalent, so when you roll to\n\t\tsee which one you get you&#8217;re essentially deciding if you get to use this\n\t\toffensively (weal) or defensively (woe) that day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Twinkling Constellations<\/span>: More damage from\n\t\tArcher, more healing from Chalice, and flight from Dragon (even at just 20\n\t\tft. speed) are all big improvements. The ability to change your\n\t\tconstellation each turn <em>without spending an action<\/em> means that the\n\t\tdifficult tactical decision which you normally make when you activate Starry\n\t\tForm goes away, making your life much easier. Now you get to make that\n\t\tdecision every turn instead. Do you suffer from Analysis Paralysis? This\n\t\twill either make it way better or way worse.\n\t\t<p>Do you have an ally down at 0 hit points? Switch to chalice and heal\n\t\t\tthem. Need to maintain a Concentration spell? Turn on dragon, fly out of\n\t\t\treach and do your thing. The rest of the time? Archer.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Full of Stars<\/span>: A bit late, and strange on\n\t\ta subclass that&#8217;s so clearly intended to fill a back-line role, but consider\n\t\tthat the Druid has notoriously poor AC and just d8 hit points this is a\n\t\tfantastic improvement to your durability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-stars-ability-scores\">Circle of Stars Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Druid subclasses tend to follow the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/#ability-scores\">core Druid<\/a> very closely in terms of stat spread, but since Wild Shape uses fuel our Starry Form usage we can\u2019t rely on being an animal form for physical stats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: We don\u2019t want to be in melee.
