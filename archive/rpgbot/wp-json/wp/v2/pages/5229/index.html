Giving up Heavy Armor proficiency can be fixed with a feat, and Expert Trainer is fairly useless. The ability to have something cool like a dinosaur for a mount adds a ton of options to your Cavalier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Giving up heavy armor is\n\t\tannoying, but you can fix it with a feat if you can&#8217;t afford to invest in\n\t\tdexterity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exotic Mount<\/span> (Ex): This opens up the\n\t\tAnimal Companion list for your choice of mount, and specifies exactly which\n\t\tanimals can be used as a mount. For help selecting your mount, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/animal_companions\">practical guide to animal companions<\/a>. The additional ability to make other attacks in place of hoof attacks is\n\t\tan excellent addition to effects like Trample and Overrun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Mount, Proficiencies, Expert Trainer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Emissary, Gendarme, Honor Guard, Luring Cavalier<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"daring-champion\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/daring-champion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daring Champion<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most Cavaliers, the Daring Champion is a non-mounted archetype, and depends on Weapon Finesse. Daring Champion also introduces the Swashbuckler&#8217;s fantastic Panache ability, and several Swashbuckler Deeds with which to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Champion&#8217;s Finesse makes this archetype a fantastic option for a one-level class dip for characters who want to use Weapon Finesse and Combat Expertise, but don&#8217;t want to have enough intelligence for Combat Expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: The Daring\n\t\tChampion uses Weapon Finesse, and should have enough Dexterity that medium\n\t\tarmor is a safe option. Don&#8217;t pick up a buckler unless it&#8217;s masterwork, or\n\t\tthe -1 armor check penalty will inhibit your attacks. Also remember that\n\t\tNimble gives you a free, permanent Dodge bonus to AC while wearing light\n\t\tarmor, so pick up a Mithral Breastplate as soon as you can afford it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion&#8217;s Finesse<\/span> (Ex): This is a\n\t\tfantastic option for a class dip for a ton of builds. You can use Weapon\n\t\tFinesse with any light or one-handed piercing weapons, which includes things\n\t\tlike heavy picks and spiked heavy shields. The ability to use Charisma in\n\t\tplace of Intelligence for Combat Feats means that you can get Combat\n\t\tExpertise without the requisite 13 intelligence and pick up all of the cool\n\t\tcombat maneuver feats which require it. Remember that Slashing Grace allows\n\t\tyou to treat your selected slashing weapon as piercing for feats and such,\n\t\tso you can use a scimitar or with sawtooth sabres if you plan to use\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nimble<\/span> (Ex): Free AC is great. Remember\n\t\tthat Mithral versions of medium armor count as light, so pick up a Mithral\n\t\tBreastplate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache and Deeds<\/span> (Ex): All of the best\n\t\tlow level Swashbuckler Deeds. You won&#8217;t have as many options for using your\n\t\tPanache as really Swashbuckler, but that gives you more points to dedicate\n\t\tto the few Deeds that you do get.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dodging Panache<\/span> (Ex): The bonus to AC\n\t\t\tis nice, but the real appeal comes at high level when you can use this to\n\t\t\tmove away from creatures making a Full Attack to get out of reach of their\n\t\t\titerative attacks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Opportune Parry and Riposte<\/span> (Ex): This\n\t\t\tis a great way to defend yourself and get free attacks, but it will also\n\t\t\tburn through your Panache very quickly if you depend on it too much. Save\n\t\t\tthis for particularly scary single attacks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Strike<\/span> (Ex): This is a ton of\n\t\t\textra damage, though you only get to use it if you don&#8217;t use Two-Weapon\n\t\t\tFighting. Remember that it&#8217;s precision damage, so it won&#8217;t get multiplied\n\t\t\ton all of those critical hits that you should be getting. You can spend\n\t\t\tPanache to double the damage bonus on one attack, but that&#8217;s a very bad\n\t\t\tway to waste Panache.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swashbuckler Initiative<\/span> (Ex): Initiative\n\t\t\tbonuses are great. Most people probably won&#8217;t both with Quick Draw, but\n\t\t\tthe second half of this ability is cool if you do.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Advanced Deeds<\/span> (Ex): Some of the options\n\t\tare very situational, but as a whole this set of deeds give you some very\n\t\tversatile options.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Superior Feint<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Targeted Strike<\/span> (Ex): This adds some\n\t\t\tnice versatility, and provides some options to replace the Disarm and Trip\n\t\t\tcombat maneuvers.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arms<\/span>: Good, and nice to have\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause Improved Disarm is rarely a worthwhile feat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Head<\/span>: Confused is garbage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Legs<\/span>: Good, but Improved Trip won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tcost you Panache.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Torso or Wings<\/span>: Staggering a\n\t\t\t\t\tcreature is a great way to prevent it from running away or making a\n\t\t\t\t\tFull Attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Subtle Blade<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dizzying Defense<\/span> (Ex): Many\n\t\t\tSwashbucklers will have Combat Expertise, which will provide a better\n\t\t\tbonus to AC by this level, but you can use both at once. It&#8217;s not clear if\n\t\t\tusing Fight Defensively as a swift action allows you to make an attack,\n\t\t\tbut I assume that it does, which means you get a free attack as a Swift\n\t\t\tAction for a Panache point. The bonuses and penalties for fighting\n\t\t\tdefensively are also greatly improved, and 5 ranks in Acrobatics will give\n\t\t\tyou an extra +1 to AC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Champion&#8217;s Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Your keen\n\t\trapier now has 15-20\/x3 crits. That&#8217;s pretty fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Cavalier&#8217;s Charge, Expert Trainer, Mighty Charge, Mount, Proficiencies, Supreme Charge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"emissary\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/emissary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emissary<\/a>\n\t<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like the Tactician ability, Emissary is a good reason to get rid of it. Emissary gives up Banner and Tactician in favor of some excellent abilities to increase the Cavalier&#8217;s mobility, and a few free feats that any good mounted build should take anyway. There is some overlap with the Gendarme, but where the Gendarme is all about charging, the Emissary is all about mobility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Giving up heavy armor is\n\t\tannoying, but you can fix it with a feat if you can&#8217;t afford to invest in\n\t\tdexterity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: None of those feats are worth\n\t\ttaking, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt you to have them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">In or Out of the Saddle<\/span> (Ex): Free feat!\n\t\tPotentially worth a class dip for mounted characters using other classes.\n\t\tTactician is hard to use, so trading it for a feat which you would need\n\t\tanyway is great. The ability to move at normal speed in medium armor is a\n\t\tnice consolation prize when you&#8217;re not mounted.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Battlefield Agility<\/span> (Ex): Mobility is\n\t\tnice for charging past enemies to hit something important. Giving up Banner\n\t\tmight seem disappointing, but morale bonuses are the most common bonuses in\n\t\tthe game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mounted Acrobatics<\/span> (Ex): Trick Riding\n\t\tallows you to use Ride in place of your mount&#8217;s AC an additional time per\n\t\tround, which is excellent. The ability to use Trick Riding while wearing\n\t\tlight armor is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mounted Dervish<\/span> (Ex): Mounted Skirmisher\n\t\tis basically a given for mounted builds. You can&#8217;t use it with a charge, but\n\t\tthat doesn&#8217;t make it any less amazing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Erratic Charge<\/span> (Ex): Get an extra attack,\n\t\tthen stick your lance in something with Spirited Charge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Tactician, Banner, Greater Tactician, Greater Banner, Supreme Charge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Beast Rider, Honor Guard<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"gendarme\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/gendarme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gendarme<\/a>\n\t<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gendarme can get Spirited Charge at first level, and that alone justifies the existence of the archetype. Spirited Charge is the core mechanic of most mounted melee builds, and the Gendarme is an excellent way to go about it. You give up Tactician for better bonus feats, but you get to keep Banner, unlike the Emissary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Limiting your bonus feats\n\t\tlimits your options, but the list of feats make sense of the archetype. You\n\t\tget bonus feats at 1st, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th level, so you\n\t\twill take all 7 of the feats as bonus feats unless you take them as normal\n\t\tfeats. However, because you need many of the feats to make your build make\n\t\tsense, you probably want to take them early. I&#8217;m not 100% certain what\n\t\thappens when you are down to Spring Attack and don&#8217;t have the prerequisites,\n\t\tand the eratta and FAQ haven&#8217;t addressed it. If I were the GM, I might allow\n\t\tthe Cavalier to skip any feats for which the Cavalier does not qualify.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Bull Rush<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mounted Combat<\/span>: Essential. Probably your\n\t\t\tselection at level 1, but you may want to use your level 1 feat for\n\t\t\tMounted Combat, and use your Genarme bonus feat to get Ride-By Attack.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Attack<\/span>: Essential for damage, but\n\t\t\tnot as essential as Spirited Charge or Ride-By Attack. Wait until level 5\n\t\t\tunless you really need the extra damage on top of Spirited Charge for some\n\t\t\treason.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ride-By Attack<\/span>: Essential.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirited Charge<\/span>: Essential. You can take\n\t\t\tthis at first level if you are a human (take Mounted Combat and Ride-By\n\t\t\tAttack as your 1st level feat and human bonus feat), and start trippling\n\t\t\tyour damage right off the bat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spring Attack<\/span>: This is what Ride-By\n\t\t\tAttack is for.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unseat<\/span>: Worthless.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Transfixing Charge<\/span> (Ex): Similar to\n\t\tSupreme Charge, but more damage instead of the Stunned effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Tactician, Bonus Feat, Greater Tactician, Master Tactician, Supreme Charge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Beast Rider, Honor Guard<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"honor-guard\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/honor-guard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Honor Guard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an archetype for NPCs. A player who takes this can expect to spend all of their turns using Aid Another and standing still.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Sworn Defense<\/span> (Ex): Very cool flavor-wise,\n\t\tbut the bonus is pathetic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intercept<\/span> (Ex): Nice for protecting your\n\t\ttarget, and it gives you an obvious action to use every turn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warding Charge<\/span> (Ex): A free charge on your\n\t\tenemies turn is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Challenge<\/span> (Ex): Nice debuff,\n\t\tbut the bonus is very small for such a high level abulity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Challenge, Cavalier&#8217;s Charge, Mighty Charge, Demanding Challenge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Beast Rider, Emissary, Gendarme, Musketeer, Strategist<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"luring-cavalier\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/luring-cavalier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luring Cavalier<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Luring Cavalier is an attempt to make the Cavalier into a mounted archer, while simultaneously making it some kind of aggro defender. While the attempt is certainly noble, and contains some good ideas, the Luring Cavaliers most notable abilities don&#8217;t work well until 20th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Far Challenge<\/span> (Ex): Basically the\n\t\tCavalier&#8217;s challenge, but you can deal the bonus damage with ranged attacks,\n\t\tand your target gets a +4 bonus to hit you. Note that you don&#8217;t get your\n\t\torder modification to your challenge until you are hit with a melee attack\n\t\tby the target of your challenge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Careful Aim<\/span> (Ex): Unless you&#8217;re using a\n\t\tfirearm, you&#8217;re probably using a Longbow with 100+ range, so you should have\n\t\tenough range that you don&#8217;t need to worry about it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infuriating Aim<\/span> (Ex): Because this only\n\t\tapplies to attacks made at your highest base attack bonus, you get your\n\t\tfirst attack and your extra attack from Rapid Shot. However, the best\n\t\tcritical threat range you will find is with a crossbow, which means your\n\t\tbest option is a crossbow. And if your best ranged weapon option is a\n\t\tcrossbow, you are a very sad archer. If you can somehow make this ability\n\t\treliable (keen crossbow), it&#8217;s fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Versatile Challenge<\/span> (Ex): By now you are\n\t\tvery heavily invested in ranged combat, and switching to melee would be a\n\t\tlethal mistake. However, this may mean that you can reactivate Far Challenge\n\t\tafter getting hit with a melee attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Supreme Aim<\/span> (Ex): You spent 20 levels\n\t\ttrying to find a way to make your abilities useful, and you get handed one\n\t\tat level 20. All of those feats and optimization choices suddenly don&#8217;t\n\t\tmatter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Challenge, Cavalier&#8217;s Charge, Mighty Charge, Supreme Charge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Beast Rider, Musketeer, Strategist<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"musketeer\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/musketeer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Musketeer<\/a>\n\t<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The musketeer gives up the Cavalier&#8217;s mount in favor of firearms. While it is nice the other Cavalier abilities are left in place, firearms simply aren&#8217;t useful enough to justify how much damage this does to the Cavalier. The description of the archetype suggests that you should start fights with a gun then switch to melee, but there is nothing in the archetype to support that, and Pathfinder generally doesn&#8217;t support switch-hitting like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Giving up\n\t\tHeavy Armor is unfortunate, but you get firearm proficiency for free, and\n\t\tyou get access to feats like Weapon Specialization and Point-Blank\n\t\tMaster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gifted Firearm<\/span> (Ex): You get a free gun\n\t\tand Gunsmithing like many firearm-centric classes and archetypes. The unique\n\t\tpart is the focus ability. At 8th level you get to go into focus mode and\n\t\tadd some cool abilities which replicate feats and weapon enhanhcements.\n\t\tHowever, these abilities are generally small enhancements, so they won&#8217;t go\n\t\ta long way improve your effectiveness. At level 20 you can ignore reload\n\t\ttimes, which would be great if Rapid Reload didn&#8217;t already let you reload a\n\t\tpistol as a free action.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Swift Powder<\/span> (Ex): Rapid Reload is a\n\t\trequirement for anyone using firearms. Getting it for free is nice. The\n\t\tadded a ability to reload a musket once as a free action is nice, but you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get it until fairly high level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Mount, Expert Trainer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Honor Guard, Luring Cavalier<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"standard-bearer\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/standard-bearer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Standard Bearer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard Bearer focuses on the Cavalier&#8217;s Banner ability. Banner is nice, and provides a decent buff, but it&#8217;s not cool enough or useful enough to support an archetype devoted to it. Standard Bearer is unimpressive, and trades in the Cavalier&#8217;s combat abilities for some incredibly modest buffs which you don&#8217;t receive until high enough level that they are useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Banner<\/span> (Ex): Decent buff, and easy to\n\t\tuse. Getting it early is nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mount<\/span> (Ex): Waiting until level 5 to get\n\t\tyou mount is annoying, but it doesn&#8217;t make your mount any less awesome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Banner of Solace<\/span> (Ex): This is cool, but\n\t\tat 11th level it should provide a considerably larger bonus, or be usable\n\t\tmore than once per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Awesome Pennon<\/span> (Ex): Constant ongoing\n\t\tbonuses are great, but morale bonuses are the most common, and at this level\n\t\ta +1 bonus is nothing. The bonuses to saves are nice, but situational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Mount, Banner, Mighty Charge, Supreme Charge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Strategist<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"strategist\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/cavalier\/archetypes\/paizo-cavalier-archetypes\/strategist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Strategist<\/a>\n\t<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole of this archetype is propped up by Drill Instructor. Without affecting the Cavalier&#8217;s combat abilities, Strategist gives the Cavalier some excellent ways to use and share teamwork feats. If you enjoy teamwork feats, this is a great choice for a Cavalier. Also see my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/teamwork_feats\">Practical Guide to Teamwork Feats<\/a> for additional guidance on making use of teamwork feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tactician<\/span> (Ex): Very slightly improves\n\t\tthe rate at which you gain additional uses of Tactician.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drill Instructor<\/span> (Ex): Tactician\n\t\t<em>wishes<\/em> it were this good. This ability applies to any teamwork feat\n\t\tyou know, which allows you to share cool feats like Coordinated Charge with\n\t\tallies who can&#8217;t get the feats on their own. Keep in mind that this consumes\n\t\tone of your very limited number of Challenge uses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tactical Advantage<\/span> (Ex): This slightly\n\t\tmitigates the fact that you spent a standard action to use Tactician in\n\t\tcombat, but it comes very late in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Strategic Supremacy<\/span> (Ex): Have you ever\n\t\tencountered enemies with Teamwork feats? Neither have I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Tactician, Expert Trainer, Greater Banner, Bonus Feat (18th)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Honor Guard, Luring Cavalier, Standard Bearer<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Archetypes Beast Rider This is a linear improvement to the Cavalier.
