Depending on your choice of Instinct, there are some thematic options which go a bit beyond &#8220;get mad and hit stuff&#8221;, but the majority of the class is absolutely fixated on getting into a fight, getting really angry, and just absolutely wrecking everything in your way. The Barbarian is easily compared to the Fighter, and where the Fighter is a master of martial arms and armor, focusing on using the right techniques at the right time, the Barbarian is often more of a blunt instrument, often addressing problems with a simple mindset. In many ways the Barbarian is a one-trick pony, but when so many of your problems are nails it helps to have a really nice hammer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t normally discuss the fluff text at the beginning of class entries, but I really want to call attention to the Barbarian&#8217;s entry because it&#8217;s such a perfect explanation of the class. During combat encounters: angry and violent. During social encounters: angry and terrifying. While exploring: watching intently for an opportunity to become angry and violent. In downtime: carousing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, the barbarian is a Defender and Striker similar to the Fighter. However, unlike the Fighter you&#8217;re largely locked into melee combat, so your role in the party is fairly limited. You have very little needs from your skills, leaving you ample opportunity to fill skill-based roles in your party, provided that your ability scores can support them. You&#8217;re unlikely to be a Face, but the Barbarian has several excellent options related to Intimidation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Barbarian Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Barbarian Instincts<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#animal-instinct\">Animal Instinct<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dragon-instinct\">Dragon Insinct<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fury-instinct\">Fury Instinct<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#giant-instinct\">Giant Instinct<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spirit-instinct\">Spirit Instinct<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#superstition-instinct\">Supersistion Instinct<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Barbarian-feats\">Barbarian Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Barbarian-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-weapons\">Uncommon Martial Weapons and Advanced Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Barbarian Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Strength. Unsurprisingly, a class about getting angry and hitting things depends on Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hit Points<\/span>: More hit points than anyone\n\telse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: A broad range of\n\tproficiencies give you everything that you need to succeed as a barbarian, and\n\tit&#8217;s easy to expand some of those options with feats.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span>: You start at Expert, putting\n\t\tyou ahead of most characters for a long time, but you don&#8217;t improve to\n\t\tMaster until 17th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Expert in both Fortitude\n\t\tand Will, and you have a mountain of hit points to deal with failing Reflex\n\t\tsaves, which frequently only deal damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Standard starting skills (4+\n\t\ttotal). You&#8217;re locked into Athletics, but you can get quite a bit out of\n\t\tAthletics so it&#8217;s a great choice anyway.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attacks<\/span>: Trained in simple, martial, and\n\t\tunarmed. Not terribly exciting, but you&#8217;ve got a full range of options and\n\t\tyou may be able to access Uncommon weapons using racial feats. Barbarians\n\t\tadvance their weapon proficiencies at the same rate as most martial classes,\n\t\tfalling just behind the Fighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Trained in everything up to\n\t\tmedium armor. Unfortunately, your proficiency improves slower than other\n\t\tfront-line martial class like the Fighter and the Ranger, so your AC will\n\t\tlag behind other front-line martial classes at several points. You might\n\t\teven consider spending a feat to get Heavy Armor Proficiency, then retrain\n\t\tit around 12th level before your armor proficiency increases beyond Trained.\n<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: There aren&#8217;t many barbarian options which rely\n\t\ton your class DC, but many of the ones that do are very good.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rage<\/span>: The Barbarian&#8217;s most defining\n\tcapability. While raging you&#8217;ll deal additional damage and gain some temporary\n\thit points, but you&#8217;ll take a minor penalty to AC (it&#8217;s only -1; you&#8217;ll be\n\tfine) and you can&#8217;t use actions with the Concentrate trait, which prevents you\n\tfrom doing things that require a lot of mental focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Instinct<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Barbarian Instincts&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Barbarian Feats<\/strong>: See Barbarian feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deny Advantage<\/span>: The Barbarian is fairly\n\tgood at perception, but this provides a nice insurance policy. This makes you\n\tvery effective against ambushes, and against enemies which rely on flanking\n\tlike NPC rogues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Brutality<\/span>: More proficiency with your\n\tattacks is great, and Critical Specializations Effects can really add a lot.\n\tYou only get the Critical Specialization Effects while raging, but if you&#8217;re\n\tfighting and not raging you&#8217;re either in a fight than went way too long or\n\tyou&#8217;re not taking the fight seriously.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Juggernaut<\/span>: More Fortitude saves is great,\n\tand you hit Master before any other class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: Better saves never\n\thurts, but you never go beyond Expert. You might consider Canny Acumen at high\n\tlevel to raise your Reflex Saves to Master.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Raging Resistance<\/span>: When you get this, you\n\tshould reasonably expect to have 18 Constitution, and 7 points of damage\n\tresistance is really good. You&#8217;ll likely max out at 8, but that&#8217;s still\n\tsignificant. The usefulness of this ability is defined by your Instinct, and\n\tthe effects vary signficiantly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mighty Rage<\/span>: In many ways, this makes Rage\n\tfree. You&#8217;ll need to have at least one feat which gives you an action with the\n\tRage trait, but considering how many good options are available that&#8217;s not a\n\tproblem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Juggernaut<\/span>: The Barbarian is the\n\tonly class to reach Legendary in Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Medium Armor Expertise<\/span>: Finally, your AC\n\timproves! Your armor proficiencies improve at the absolute slowest rate,\n\tputting the Barbarian on part with the Wizard and similarly non-martial\n\tclasses. Fortunately, you have d12 hit points and temporary hit points from\n\tRage to compensate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Fury<\/span>: Always helpful, and the\n\tBarbarian matches the weapon proficiency progression of most martial\n\tclasses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More\n\tdamage!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Indomitable Will<\/span>: Better saves is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Sense<\/span>: Despite starting with\n\tunusually good Perception, this is the first time your Perception proficiency\n\tincreases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Rage<\/span>: A full turn is nothing. You can\n\tmanage to be just baseline angry for 6 seconds between bouts of violent\n\tfury.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Armor of Fury<\/span>: More AC never hurts, but\n\tthis is very late for a martial class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Devastator<\/span>: Ignoring 10 points of resistance\n\tis a lot of extra damage against creatures which normally resist damage from\n\tyour weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Barbarian Instincts<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"animal-instinct\"><a id=\"animal-instinct\" class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/class\/barbarian\/#Animal_Instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Animal Instinct<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Animal Instinct Barbarians are the monks of barbarians. They rely on unarmed attacks, gaining powerful new unarmed attack options based on their chosen animal. Nearly every unarmed attack granted by Animal Instinct exceeds most Monk unarmed attack options, and between Rage and strict reliance on Strength you&#8217;ll often find that your unarmed attacks are more lethal, though without Flurry of Blows you&#8217;ll perform less attacks than a Monk would. To address this, consider taking the Monk multiclass archetype feats. This is especially easy to do because the Animal Instinct-specific Barbarian Class Feats are awful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you select Animal Instinct, you must also select a type of animal. This determines the unarmed attack(s) you gain when you Rage, and can be a significant part of your build if you choose to rely upon your unarmed attacks. These attacks are often as good as or better than any one-handed weapon you could find, and they rarely require a free hand, so you&#8217;re free to use a shield and to use your free hand for special attacks like grappling and shoving. Becuase you&#8217;re not using a manufactured weapons, expect to invest in Handwraps of Mighty Blows like a monk would. Your choice of animal also affects how Animal Rage works, but Animal Rage is garbage, so don&#8217;t worry about that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ape<\/span>: Grappling is a great option, and\n\t\thaving the Grapple trait on your unnarmed strikes means that you can add the\n\t\tbonus from Handwraps of Mighty Blows to your Athletics checks to grapple.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bear<\/span>: Having an Agile secondary weapon\n\t\tmeans that your additional attacks will be more effective, but using an\n\t\tAgile weapon halves the bonus damage from Rage, and when your Rage bonus\n\t\tdamage is 12 per hit that&#8217;s a lot of damage to lose for a minor reduction in\n\t\tyour Multiple Attack penalty. Unfortunately, access to Agile claws costs you\n\t\tan interesting property on your bite. Animal Rage gets you essentially<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bull<\/span>: Shove is neat, but very\n\t\tsituational. You&#8217;ll get more mileage from Grapple or Trip, and in the rare\n\t\tsituations where you need to Shove you can Shove just like everyone\n\t\telse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cat<\/span>: Idnetical to the Bear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deer<\/span>: The same damage as the Ape, and you\n\t\tget 10 ft. reach at 7th level. You also don&#8217;t need a hand to make the\n\t\tattack, so you can use your hands for other stuff like high-fives and\n\t\tshields. Gaining reach and not needing to use your hand is a massive\n\t\timprovement over the Ape. Note that the\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinder\/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">errata<\/a> replaced the Charge\n\t\ttrait with the Grapple trait and raised the printed damage from d8 to d10,\n\t\tso if you&#8217;re looking at the first printing Core Rulebook the text is\n\t\tincorrect.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Frog<\/span>: Combining the interesting parts of\n\t\tthe Bear\/Cat and the Deer, the Frog gets a secondary Agile attack and\n\t\teventually gets 10 ft. reach (at level 7, of course) with that attack, but\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t have a useful trait on its primary attack. You&#8217;re free to use jaws\n\t\tas your primary attack, then use your tongue when you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to\n\t\tget within 5 ft. of your target.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shark<\/span>: Mostly the same as Ape, but since\n\t\tjaws don&#8217;t use your hand your hands are free, much like the Deer. Also, if\n\t\tyou take Animal Rage you gain the ability to breath underwater while\n\t\traging.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Snake<\/span>: All the same benefits as the\n\t\tShark, but you can&#8217;t take Animal Rage to breath underwater. It&#8217;s technically\n\t\tworse than the Shark, but Animal Rage is awful so realistically there&#8217;s\n\t\tlittle difference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wolf<\/span>: Trip is an absolutely fantastic\n\t\ttrait.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Anathema<\/span>: Be kind to animals. Not all\n\t\tanimals; just ones of the type you picked. You can be a jerk to the\n\t\trest.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Instinct Ability: Bestial Rage<\/span>: The\n\t\tunarmed attacks granted by Betial Rage are fantastic, matching the effects\n\t\tof many two-handed weapons without requiring the use of your hands. However,\n\t\tsince you&#8217;re going to be so dependent on these attacks you&#8217;ll be in a lot of\n\t\ttrouble if you&#8217;re in a fight and not raging.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Specialization Ability<\/span>: More damage, and\n\t\tthe Deer and Frog both get some reach on their attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Raging Resistance<\/span>: The two most common\n\t\ttypes of weapon damage. This is absolutely spectacular for a character who\n\t\tspends as much time in melee as the Barbarian does.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dragon-insinct\"><a id=\"dragon-instinct\" class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/class\/barbarian\/#Dragon_Instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragon Insinct<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Dragon Instinct is easily comparable to other Instinct options, but what sets it above other options is the Instinct-specific feats. Though there are only three feats, they&#8217;re all good and they&#8217;re all usable in any combat situation. Other Instinct options generally only have a handful of good feat options, and their best options frequently come with problematic limitations like the fact that you can&#8217;t grow to Huge size in a 10-foot wide corridor. Dragon Instinct feats give you a breath weapon (both one of the Barbarian&#8217;s best ranged attacks and one of the Barbarian&#8217;s best ways to deal with crowds), easy access to flight, and eventually the ability to fully turn into a dragon while raging. However, you may find that you face issues with relying on a single type of energy damage which is determined by your selected type of dragon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice of patron dragon is an interesting choice. A less-common damage type like acid or lightning will be more usable offensively, but also less useful as a resistance. You also need to choose between a dragon which gives you a cone or a line, and you need to consider how your Anathema will interact with that type of dragon. I think everything balances out in the end, so you&#8217;re probably fine selecting whichever dragon suits you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Anathema<\/span>: One of the more complicated options, you\n\t\tmust also select whether you abhor (hate) or respect your dragon type. If\n\t\tyou hate them, <em>failing<\/em> to defeat dragons of your chosen type is\n\t\tanathema. Conveniently, your Anathema doesn&#8217;t compel you to confront, fight,\n\t\tor intentionally oppose them, and as long as you never try you can never\n\t\tfail. If you choose to respect your dragon type, merely defying dragons of\n\t\tyour type is Anathema, so if a dragon of your type shows up your character\n\t\tmay accidently become a slave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Instinct Ability: Draconic Rage<\/span>: Extra\n\t\tdamage is always great, and the energy damage will frequently bypass\n\t\tresistances to physical damage. If you encounter an enemy which is resistant\n\t\tto your dragon&#8217;s damage type, don&#8217;t forget that you can choose to not use\n\t\tDraconic Rage when you initiate a rage and fall back on the normal Rage\n\t\tdamage bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Specialization Ability<\/span>: More damage is\n\t\talways nice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Raging Resistance<\/span>: Piercing damage is\n\t\tcommon from bites and similar attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fury-instinct\"><a id=\"fury-instinct\" class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/class\/barbarian\/#Fury_Instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fury Instinct<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The most generic of options, Fury Instinct works fine, but doesn&#8217;t do anything expecially exciting. If you just want an uncomplicated barbarian, you&#8217;ll do well with Fury Instinct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Anathema<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get one.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Instinct Ability: <\/span>: You don&#8217;t get one.\n\t\tInstead, you gain an extra 1st-level Barbarian feat, which is nice.\n\t\tUnfortunately there aren&#8217;t many options to choose from and you may not be\n\t\table to use all of them in a meaningful way. As more options are published,\n\t\tthis will become more useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Specialization Ability<\/span>: More damage is\n\t\tgreat, but since it&#8217;s all you get it would be nice if the bonus were bigger.\n\t\tBy comparison, Spirit Instinct does 1 more damage, and it&#8217;s an interesting\n\t\tdamage type too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Raging Resistance<\/span>: Broadly useful, but\n\t\tsince it only applies to weapon damage it won&#8217;t protect you from things like\n\t\tunarmed attacks (claws, teeth, etc.).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"giant-instinct\"><a id=\"giant-instinct\" class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/class\/barbarian\/#Giant_Instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Giant Instinct<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Giant Instinct&#8217;s initial draw is that you get to use a gigantic weapon. That&#8217;s neat, but not actually impactful from a mechanical perspective. The real draw here is the Instinct-specific feats. As you progress, you&#8217;ll gain the ability to increase your size when you rage, as well as increasing your reach. Look at complementary options like reach weapons and the Whirlwind Attack feat, and be cautious pursuing this Instinct if your GM likes to use lots of dungeons with small rooms and narrow corridors where you won&#8217;t be able to grow in size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Anathema<\/span>: You must face any &#8220;personal challenge of\n\t\tStrength&#8221;. The text isn&#8217;t totally clear what that entails, but I think if\n\t\tsomeone were to say &#8220;I bet you can&#8217;t drink that whole barrel of wine&#8221; you&#8217;re\n\t\tobligated to at least try, even if you&#8217;re certain to fail. Hopefully your\n\t\tparty isn&#8217;t a bunch of jerks, or they might abuse this to convince you to\n\t\tjump into pits and attempt other suicidal activities.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Instinct Ability: Titan Mauler<\/span>: You gain\n\t\t<em>access to<\/em> one weapon of a larger size. You still need to buy it\n\t\tyourself out of your starting money, and you only get access to one so you&#8217;d\n\t\tbetter not lose it or break it. You&#8217;re Clumsy 1 while using this weapon,\n\t\twhich essentially means that you&#8217;re taking a -1 AC penalty to get 4 extra\n\t\tdamage from Rage. That&#8217;s probably a fine trade, but be sure to focus on\n\t\timproving your durability to compensate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Specialization Ability<\/span>: Even more\n\t\tdamage!<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raging Resistance<\/span>: An interesting\n\t\tcombination of options. Bludgeoning damage is the least common type of\n\t\tdamage typically dealt be weapons, but you get Fire as an option, and Fire\n\t\tis extremely common. If you already have resostance to Fire damage, get Cold\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spirit-instinct\"><a id=\"spirit-instinct\" class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/class\/barbarian\/#Spirit_Instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spirit Instinct<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Spectacular against undead, and still perfectly functional against other foes, but not especially exciting. You do get access to some Instinct-specific feats like Spirit&#8217;s Wrath, but they&#8217;re not good enough to set Spirit Instinct ahead of other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Anathema<\/span>: Disrespecting the dead is easy\n\t\tto avoid. Even looting, skinning, and eating a corpse can be done\n\t\trespectfully.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Instinct Ability: Spirit Rage<\/span>: A little\n\t\tbit more damage than normal, and you can make it Positive or Negative\n\t\tdamage, which means that few enemies will be able to resist it. You also\n\t\tgain the effects of the Ghost Touch weapon rune, which is great. Ghost Touch\n\t\tis powerful and inexpensive, so it&#8217;s a staple of melee builds, but it also\n\t\teats one of your limited slots for property runes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Specialization Ability<\/span>: More damage is\n\t\talways nice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raging Resistance<\/span>: Negative damage is\n\t\trare, and while resisting all damage from undead is great it&#8217;s also only one\n\t\tcreature type.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"supersistion-instinct\"><a id=\"superstition-instinct\" class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/pf2.d20pfsrd.com\/class\/barbarian\/#superstition-instinct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supersistion Instinct<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Do you hate spellcasters? Do you hate having friends who are spellcasters? Do you hate being buffed by spells? Healed by spells? Do you hate the ability to travel long distances via teleportation? If you&#8217;ve answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to any of these questions you should consider the Superstition Instinct and know that you and I will never be friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jokes aside, this is a bad subclass. It&#8217;s good at killing spellcasters and literally nothing else, and since you give up the ability to benefit from buff spells you&#8217;re reduced to items and the core barbarian class features unless you&#8217;re facing an enemy spellcaster. Unless your campaign is all about fighting spellcasters, you&#8217;ll spend most encounters feeling disappointed that you can&#8217;t use the vast majority of your subclass features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This subclass seriously needs help. As a quick fix: allow the damage bonus against targets under the effect of a beneficial spell, and improve Raging Resistance to apply to all spells. That&#8217;s probably still not enough, honestly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anathema<\/span>: Disallowing buff spells or\n\t\tmagical healing takes a lot of really import options off the table.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Instinct Ability: Superstitious Resilience<\/span>: Aside from the healing (which is nice), the benefits are situational.\n\t\tWhile there are many enemies which can cast spells, they;re still a subset\n\t\tof all enemies so you&#8217;re giving up most of your Instinct Ability in most\n\t\tencounters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Specialization Ability<\/span>: You get a little\n\t\tbetter at killing spellcasters, but literally nothing against other\n\t\tcreatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raging Resistance<\/span>: It&#8217;s really\n\t\tfrustrating that this doesn&#8217;t just apply to all magic. As it stands, you get\n\t\tto resist damage from roughly 50% of spells since you cover two\n\t\ttraditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There is almost no variation in Ability Score spread between barbarian builds. Unsurprisingly, you need a ton of Strength, some Dexterity to fill our your medium armor&#8217;s Dex Cap and raise your poor Reflex saves, Constitution to improve your hit points, and Wisdom for Perception and Will Saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Your defining ability. Start at 18 and\n\tboost it at every opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: How much Dexterity you need varies\n\tonly slightly by build. Most barbarians will be in Breastplate, so you&#8217;ll need\n\tno more than 12 Dexterity. Animal Instinct barbarians will need as much as 16\n\tonce they take Animal Skin at 6th level, but you can start with 14 and\n\tincrease it at 5th level if you want to put your boosts elsewhere at level 1.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: You need as much as you can get. Start\n\tat 16, and boost it at least until you hit 20.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: You get 4+ skills, but can only\n\tmaximize three at most. Dumping Intelligence to 8 is fine if you don&#8217;t need\n\tadditional skills, and you can always use a Skill Feat to take Skill Training\n\tif you need to broaden your skill set.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Perception and Will Saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: If you plan to use Intimidation or\n\tCharisma-based options like Demoralize or Intimidating Howl, you&#8217;ll want a\n\tlittle bit of Charisma to make them effective. If you&#8217;re okay avoiding those\n\toptions, you can dump Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Strength and extra hit points are crucial, so a race that can give you both a Strength Boost and a Constitution Boost are great, and high starting hit points never hurts. If your race offers you the option, you might enjoy access to some Uncommon weapons, but you&#8217;ll do fine without them. Also look for other ways to make yourself more durance, like racial damage resistances or racial feats which can further raise your maximum hit points. Finally, Darkvision is a fantastic option because it opens up Acute Scent without requiring you to waste a feat on Acute Vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catfolk<\/span>: The Catfolk offers the Barbarian\n\tvery little. The Ability Boosts don&#8217;t line up, 8 base hit points, and few (if\n\tany) of the Catfolk&#8217;s feats complement the Barbarian. It&#8217;s not unplayable (put\n\tyour Free Boost into Strength, then take the Cat&#8217;s Luck feat chain), but it&#8217;s\n\tnot great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Constitution, Wisdom, and the Free\n\tBoost goes into Strength, Darkvision, and maximum starting hit points.\n\tAncient-Blooded, Forge, and Strong-Blooded all improve your durability\n\tfurther. Unfortunately, Dwarf Ancestry Feats offer very little that we want.\n\tDwarven Weapon Familiarity is tempting for a free-hand build if you want to\n\tuse a Dwarven War Axe instead of a Bastard Sword, and Mountain&#8217;s Stoutness\n\toffers additional hit points and helps you stabilize while dying, both of\n\twhich are helpful for barbarians. I strongly recommend Adopted Ancestry to get\n\tbroader Ancestry Feat options, and definitely take Toughness to get the\n\tcombined effect with Mountain&#8217;s Stoutness. Since the Dwarf has such poor base\n\tspeed, consider the Fleet general feat, or the Fast Movement Barbarian Class\n\tFeat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: The lowest starting hit points, a\n\tConstituion Flaw, and we don&#8217;t care about either Ability Boost. The Elf&#8217;s\n\tAncestry Feats offer nothing that the Barbarian cares about.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: Possible, but very difficult. The\n\tStrength Flaw needs to be address with the Voluntary Flaw rules, and there is\n\tvery little to be gained the Gnome&#8217;s Ancestry Feats. One notable exception is\n\tthe Gnome Flickmace, which you can make into a Martial weapon with a the Gnome\n\tWeapon Familiarity feat. If you want to go that route, I would still suggest\n\tAdopted Ancestry and using a different Ancestry to get the feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Goblin<\/span>: You might be able to manage a\n\tDragon Instinct build, and capitalize on the Charisma Boost to use\n\tIntimidation and possible other Face skills, but the Goblin has the lowest\n\tpossible starting hit points and few Ancestry Feats that we care about. Even\n\tBurn It! isn&#8217;t helpful since it only applies to spells and alchemical items.\n\tUnbreakable Goblin can raise your hit points from your ancestry, and Junk\n\tTinker can make it easier to craft oversized weapons for Giant Instinct\n\tbuilds, but that&#8217;s not enough to make the goblin broadly appealing. A dwarf\n\twith the Fleet General Feat or the Fast Movement Class Feat will match the\n\tGoblin&#8217;s speed and you can use your Heritage to get something more interesting\n\tthan 4 hit points. If you really want Junk Tinker, take Adopted Ancestry.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: I recommend using the Voluntary\n\tFlaw rules to get an extra Free Ability Boost so that you can boost both\n\tStrength and Constitution, but otherwise the Halfling is a decent option.\n\tThere aren&#8217;t many useful Ancestry Feat options, but there are enough that you\n\tdon&#8217;t absolutely need Adopted Ancestry. Hillock Halfling offers a way to get\n\tsome extra healing out of Treat Wounds, which is great on a class that&#8217;s\n\tnotorious for burning through a huge pile of hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Humans, especially half-orcs, are a\n\tgreat option. Natural Ambition will get you some extra options at 1st level,\n\tand beyond 1st level you have lots of ways to customize and expand your\n\tcapabilities.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Kobold<\/span>: The Ability Boosts aren&#8217;t helpful,\n\tthe Constitution Flaw is a huge problem, and you get just 6 hit points. I\n\twould love to see a kobold barbarian simply for the novelty, but it&#8217;s not a\n\tgood build.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Orc<\/span>: Good Ability Boosts, no Ability Flaw,\n\t10 hit points, and numerous feat options that work well for the Barbarian.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ratfolk<\/span>: A Strength Flaw and 6 base hit\n\tpoints are too much to overcome without significantly hampering the rest of\n\tyour build.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tengu<\/span>: The Ability Boosts work, but aren&#8217;t\n\tespecially helpful, and none of the feats obviously add to the Barbarian.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Boosts to Strength and Constitution are too important to accept anything else, which can severely limit your options, but there are still plenty of great options to choose from.

The\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBarbarian tends to burn through hit points rapidly due to their\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelatively poor AC, and a way to heal yourself in combat can be a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbig help.

Of course, most barbarians won&#8217;t have more than 12 or\n\t\t14 Dexterity, so ranged attacks aren&#8217;t typically a good go-to option.

Absolute garbage.\n\t\tThe damage bonus is small and will become irrelevant quickly as you gain\n\t\tlevels and acquire additional damage bonuses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">No Escape<\/span>: A great way to keep enemies in\n\t\tmelee with you, but it may also pull you out of position to protec your\n\t\tallies. If you take this, consider retraining it once you can get Attack of\n\t\tOpportunity since they both trigger on the same effect and you still only\n\t\tget one Reaction per round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Second Wind<\/span>: A great fallback option, and\n\t\twith the prevalence of Focus Spells you&#8217;re likely to spend 10 minutes after\n\t\tevery fight standing around while your allies Refocus. Once you get Quick\n\t\tRage at high levels this becomes redundant, so be sure to retrain it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shake it Off<\/span>: Frightened goes down by 1\n\t\tautomatically at the end of every turn, and you can already attempt an\n\t\tAction to reduce your Sickened level. This makes that Action much more\n\t\teffective, but that&#8217;s far too situational to justify a feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Barreling Charge<\/span>: Pushing past front-line\n\t\tenemies to reach vulnerable enemies behind them can put in a great tactical\n\t\tposition. However, be careful about abandoning your own vulnerable allies to\n\t\trush off into combat by yourself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Movement<\/span>: More movement is always\n\t\thelpful for a class that functions almost exclusively in melee. This\n\t\tprovides a Status bonus while raging, so it might not stack with spells and\n\t\tsimilar effects, but it stacks with the Fleet feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Oversized Throw<\/span>: This is really fun, but a\n\t\treal weapon will typically be more effective, especially once you&#8217;ve\n\t\tenchanted it, and making a Strike with a weapon only takes 1 Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Raging Athlete<\/span>: Climb and Swim speeds\n\t\tallow you to move easily in a variety of environments, allowing you to\n\t\tovercome many obstacles which normally require magic or struggling along\n\t\twith Athletics checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spiritual Guides<\/span>: Only works once per\n\t\tday, and only on Perception checks and skill checks.

While it&#8217;s\n\t\ttechnically situational, it&#8217;s a common situation to be in. If you take this,\n\t\tI strongly recommend a weapon with the Swipe trait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wounded Rage<\/span>: A great way to save\n\t\tyourself an Action on your next turn. Sadly the Temporary Hit Points from\n\t\tRage don&#8217;t apply until you&#8217;ve already taken the damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-6\">6th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Skin<\/span>: This works out to +1 AC\n\t\tcompared to other barbarians, but you need to be unarmored and raging, which\n\t\tmakes you susceptible to ambushes and further exacerbates Animal Instinct&#8217;s\n\t\tissues fighting while they are unable to rage. However, if you multiclass\n\t\tinto Monk you may be able to combine this with Mountain Style to have a\n\t\tridiculously high AC. That&#8217;s hard to do because you&#8217;ll need to spend two\n\t\tActions to get set up at the beginning of combat, but it may be worth it to\n\t\tmake yourself so difficult to kill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Attack of Opportunity<\/span>: Almost too powerful\n\t\tto forgo. Pathfinder 2e doesn&#8217;t allow you to respond to moving enemies by\n\t\tdefault, so they are often free to walk right past you to attack your\n\t\tless-durable allies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brutal Bully<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to use\n\t\tspecial attacks like grapple and trip anyway, more damage never hurts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cleave<\/span>: Great, but possibly redundant\n\t\twith Swipe, and the Multiple Attack Penalty works as normal, and your eating\n\t\tyour Reaction so you won&#8217;t be able to use Attack of Opportunity if you have\n\t\tboth feats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dragon&#8217;s Rage Breath<\/span>: Barbarians get very\n\t\tfew options for handling crowds of enemies. This will keep pace with the\n\t\tdamage of spells until extremely high levels, and the save DC will be high\n\t\tbecause your Strength will be so high. The limitation on one usage per rage\n\t\tand the 1-hour cooldown on the full damage are both disappointing, but this\n\t\tis still really good. Even against single foes, the amount of damage you can\n\t\tdo to a single target can easily exceed the damage you would do by swinging\n\t\ta weapon with the same two Actions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant&#8217;s Stature<\/span>: -1 to AC is probably the\n\t\tonly drawback that you care about from Clumsy. Large size makes you take up\n\t\ta 10 ft. square, and combined with the additional 5 ft. of reach you can\n\t\tcontrol a much larger portion of the battlefield. Of course, this is\n\t\tconsiderably more useful if you take Attack of Opportunity first, and\n\t\tunfortunately they both become available at the same level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Inner Strength<\/span>: Too situational. Enfeebled\n\t\tis one of a very long list of negative status conditions on Pathfinder 2e\n\t\tand you can&#8217;t afford a feat and an Action to address every one of them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mage Hunter<\/span>: Too situtional, and it&#8217;s only\n\t\tavailable to the Superstition Instinct which is already too specialized in\n\t\tfighting spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nocturnal Sense<\/span>: Scent and Darkvision are\n\t\tboth really good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scouring Rage<\/span>: A bit of free damage for\n\t\tthe instincts which can use it. Not essential, but a good way to handle\n\t\tgroups of foes if you can postpone starting your Rage until you&#8217;re already\n\t\tin melee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirits&#8217; Interference<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\ta 20% miss chance on all ranged attacks against you can be really useful\n\t\tagainst archers, spellcasters, and other creatures that fight at range.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Rage<\/span>: The only benefits you get are\n\t\tthe movement types (which are worse than Raging Athlete in most cases), and\n\t\tpotentially the ability to breath water if your animal type is Shark.\n\t\tAbsolutely not worth a feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disarming Assault<\/span>: Situational because\n\t\tnot all enemies use weapons, but still a useful tactical option against\n\t\tthose which do.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Follow-up Assault<\/span>: Effectively a +1 to\n\t\tyour attack and +1 damage per weapon damage die. Not a huge difference, and\n\t\tmany great weapons for barbarians already have one or both traits.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Friendly Toss<\/span>: If you have other melee\n\t\tallies this is a fantastic tactical option to get them closer to vulnerable\n\t\tenemies. However, it can also isolate your allies away from the party, so be\n\t\tcareful about throwing your allies into a dangerous position.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Furious Bully<\/span>: +2 is a good bonus in PF2.\nAssurance can do a lot to make Athletics reliable against lower-level foes, but if you want\nAthletics to be a consistent part of your tactics, don&#8217;t pass this up.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Instinctive Strike<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using scent\n\t\tto help handle enemies which you can&#8217;t see, this removes the problems\n\t\timposed by the Flat Check to hit then. However, you may find that\n\t\tSupernatural Sense reduced the Flat Check DC enough that making two Strikes\n\t\tis a better use of the same 2 Actions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Renewed Vigor<\/span>: By this level, the extra\n\t\ttemporary hit points are insignificant. Enemies will go through them too\n\t\tquickly to matter. You would be better served by spending your Action on\n\t\tnearly anything else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Share Rage<\/span>: Potentially useful if you have\n\t\tanother similar martial character in the party, the +2 damage per attack\n\t\tfrom your ally almost certainly won&#8217;t match whatever damage you could do\n\t\twith the same Action. By this level you&#8217;ll reasonably have a Striking rune\n\t\ton your weapon and you have Weapon Specialization, so you could easily be\n\t\tdoing 2d8+2+Strength damage. With 19 Strength (expected at this level),\n\t\tthat&#8217;s 2d8+6 damage, averaging 15 damage (assuming that you hit, of course).\n\t\tYour ally needs to hit at least 8 times before your Rage ends to justify the\n\t\tAction. Your damage from your attacks will continue to improve as you gain\n\t\tlevels, but Share Rage won&#8217;t because Rage never actually improves. Your own\n\t\tbonuses improve, abd you get Mighty Rage, but Share Rage doesn&#8217;t spread\n\t\tthose benefits.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sudden Leap<\/span>: An interesting way to handle\n\t\tflying enemies, but it&#8217;s very situational, and by this level magical flight\n\t\tis easily accessible by your party&#8217;s spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thrash<\/span>: A decent, safe us for an Action.\n\t\tGrapple has the Attack trait, so Multiple Attack Penalties become a problem.\n\t\tThrash isn&#8217;t an attack, so it&#8217;s nearly-guaranteed damage. You&#8217;ll do more\n\t\tdamage with a weapon if you hit, but Thrash is a helpful choice if you&#8217;re\n\t\talready looking at a steep Multiple Attack Penalty. Unfortunately, as you\n\t\tadd better Striking runes, your weapon damage will significantly outpace the\n\t\tdamage from Thrash. Note that errata corrected the text &#8220;Ferocious\n\t\tSpecialization&#8221; to &#8220;Weapon Specialization&#8221;, so your Weapon Specialization\n\t\tdamage bonus applies. Unfortunately, nothing specifies what level of\n\t\tproficiency you use to determine your damage bonus in this case. I assume\n\t\tit&#8217;s the one for Unarmed Strikes, but your proficiencies are all the same\n\t\tunless you got access to Advanced Weapons somehow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Come and Get Me<\/span>: This is a big gamble,\n\t\tand I&#8217;m not certain that it pays off. Use with caution. There are nearly no\n\t\t&#8220;taunt&#8221; mechanics in Pathfinder 2e, so this may be worthwhile solely because\n\t\tit motivates enemies to attack you instead of your allies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Determined Dash<\/span>: Situational by design,\n\t\tbut for a class that can&#8217;t provide magical solutions to these sorts of\n\t\tproblems this could be a helpful option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Furious Sprint<\/span>: Too situational. Get a\n\t\thorse instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Great Cleave<\/span>: Too situational. Unless your\n\t\tGM loves to throw hordes of weak enemies at you, you&#8217;ll nearly never see a\n\t\tbenefit from this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Impressive Landing<\/span>: Situational. You\n\t\tmight be able to use this by using Spider Climb to walk on ceilings before\n\t\tdropping onto unsuspecting foes below, but you&#8217;ll likely need to invest in\n\t\tStealth to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knockback<\/span>: Not worth the feat. If you care\n\t\tenough to take this, use a weapon with the Shove trait and put some effort\n\t\tinto Athletics.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Overpowering Charge<\/span>: Barrelling Charge is\n\t\tan tactical option which you occasionally employ to address a single\n\t\tspecific problem. It is not something you should be doing every turn. By\n\t\tthis level you have a Rune of Striking, and you might get another in the\n\t\tnext couple levels. Using your Actions to attack will yield considerably\n\t\tmore damage output. I would only take this if you already find yourself\n\t\tusing Barreling Charge constantly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resounding Blow<\/span>: Situational and not very\n\t\teffective. It can be helpful for some enemies which rely on hearing for\n\t\ttheir senses or against spellcasters, but casting spells while deafened\n\t\tstill only applies a small chance to fail to cast a spell. The only\n\t\tredeeming quality is that there&#8217;s no save, but that&#8217;s not nearly enough to\n\t\tjustify two Actions when Silencing Strike is the same level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silencing Strike<\/span>: Oh wow, how is this not\n\t\ta Flourish or something? This should replace every plain Strike that you\n\t\tever make. Keep in mind that it has the Incapacitation trait so creatures of\n\t\ta higher level than you will be hard to affect, but the chance to Stun other\n\t\tcreatures by doing nothing except hitting them is sinply too good to pass\n\t\tup.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Terrifying Howl<\/span>: Demoralize everything\n\t\twithin 30 feet. Every target is immune to Terrifying Howl for 1 minute, but\n\t\tyou can still use Demoralize etc. afterward. Note that errata changed the\n\t\ttext from &#8220;every creature&#8221; to &#8220;every enemy&#8221; so you no longer need to worry\n\t\tabout scaring your allies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tangle of Battle<\/span>: Decent if you&#8217;re built\n\t\tfor grappling, but even then not essential, and you need to score a Critical\n\t\tHit to trigger it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dragon&#8217;s Rage Wings<\/span>: Free,\n\t\teasily-accessible flight! Absolutely essential at high levels.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Embrace the Pain<\/span>: If you have a free hand (Animal\nInstinct often fights unarmed), grappling\n\t\tyour attacked as a Reaction is fantastic. Barbarians are well-suited to building\n\t\taround Athletics, which makes grappling an easy choice. The disarm option won&#8217;t\nalways be useful because such a small minority of enemies rely on weapons, but disarming an enemy\non their first Strike is a great way to ruin the rest of their turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Furious Grab<\/span>: Grappling is really\n\t\thelpful, but if you enjoy grappling you&#8217;re already deeply invested in\n\t\tAthletics, so this will only rarely have a better result than spending an\n\t\tAction to grapple your target in the normal manner.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Predator&#8217;s Pounce<\/span>: Similar to Sudden\n\t\tCharge, but since it&#8217;s a single Action it&#8217;s more flexible. Unfortunately,\n\t\tyou need to be unarmored or in light armor. The assumption is that Animal\n\t\tInstinct barbarians will rely on Animal Skin, but Animal Skin is terrible.\n\t\tIf you plan to take this, boost your Dexterity to 16 to max out light\n\t\tarmor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: An absolutely respectable\n\t\tranged attack option for a class which is notoriously terrible at fighting\n\t\tat range. Your damage almost certainly won&#8217;t match your weapon damage, but\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t swing a sword at something 120 ft. away.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sunder Spell<\/span>: A great way to handle\n\t\tproblematic magical effects, including buffs, debuffs, area control effects,\n\t\tetc.. You can techically use this on allies, but you should try to do by\n\t\tpunching them rather than hitting them with your +2 Greater Striking pointy\n\t\tstick in order to minimize the damage. Tragically, this is limited to the\n\t\tSuperstition Instinct.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Titan&#8217;s Stature<\/span>: More size and more\n\t\treach! You may have some trouble in closed spaces like dungeons, but if\n\t\tthere&#8217;s room to get big you can easily dominate entire rooms.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unbalancing Sweep<\/span>: Too situational and the\n\t\tAction cost is too high.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Awesome Blow<\/span>: This would be totally\n\t\tworthless if you couldn&#8217;t also Trip the target. If you&#8217;re invested in\n\t\tAthletics (Assurance, increased the skill as early as possible, etc.) you\n\t\tcan reliably Shove and Trip enemies with a single action without incurring a\n\t\tMultiple Attack Penalty beyond the initial successful Strike. Of course, if\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t benefit from the Shove, you would do just as well simply making a\n\t\tTrip action and saving the two feat spent on Knockback and awesome Blow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant&#8217;s Lunge<\/span>: More reach never hurts,\n\t\tbut if you&#8217;re building for reach you&#8217;ve likely gotten very attached to\n\t\tpolearm by now. But if you really want to use a shield, having 10 ft. reach\n\t\twith one-handed weapons may be enough to justify the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Impaling Thrust<\/span>: This seems strictly worse\n\t\tthan grappling, and the persistent damage is pitifully small.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sunder Enchantment<\/span>: Intelligent enemies\n\t\twill frequently use magic items, especially powerful options like weapons\n\t\tand armor. Reducing those items temporarily to mundane items will\n\t\tsignificantly weaken them. However, many enemies aren&#8217;t intelligent and\n\t\twon&#8217;t use magic items, and this feat is limited to the Superstition\n\t\tInstinct.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vengeful Strike<\/span>: Good enough to make Come\n\t\tand Get Me a go-to option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Whirlwind Strike<\/span>: Imagine combining this\n\t\twith Titan&#8217;s Stature. It&#8217;s three Actions so you&#8217;ll need to be in position at\n\t\tthe start of your turn, but if you can hit at least three enemies it&#8217;s\n\t\tconsiderably more effective than making single strikes. Strongly consider a\n\t\tweapon with the Sweep trait in conjunction with this feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Collateral Thrash<\/span>: This doubles the total\n\t\tdamage output from Thrash without changing the action required. This makes\n\t\tThrash an interesting alternative to Swipe, and since it&#8217;s not an attack\n\t\t(and therefore doesn&#8217;t impost a Multiple Attack Penalty) it makes a grat\n\t\tfollow-up to a Strike or two. Or you could just thrash two or three times in\n\t\tone turn if you find that it&#8217;s working well for you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Transformation<\/span>: You get a lot from\n\t\tthis. Flight, scent, darkvision, powerful unarmed attacks, a breath weapon,\n\t\tand possibly other movement types like a burrow speed or a swim speed.\n\t\tHowever, since you&#8217;re making unarmed attacks you&#8217;re giving up the benefits\n\t\tof your well-enhanced magic weapons. Consider putting some gold into a cheap\n\t\tset of Handwraps of Mighty Blows for an easy attack bonus. Your attack bonus\n\t\twith Unarmed Strikes should be +22+Strength, easily exceeding the flat +22\n\t\tprovided by the spell, and any extra bonus on top of that just adds to how\n\t\teffective this is. Normally polymorph spells let you use the higher of your\n\t\town attack bonus or that provided by the spell, but Dragon Transformation\n\t\tforces you to use your own. Of course, that&#8217;s not a problem because you&#8217;re\n\t\tall but guaranteed to have a higher attack bonus anyway.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s unclear how or if Runes of Striking interact with the spell, but for\n\t\t\tsimplicity I would assume that they don&#8217;t. Note that errata corrected the\n\t\t\tfinal paragraph of the feat: You no longer get a fixed DC of 30. Instead,\n\t\t\tyou always use your Class DC for the breath weapon.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Furious Vengeance<\/span>: Critical hits are going\n\t\tto happen. Getting a free Strike in response will lead to a huge amount of\n\t\textra damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-greeb\">Penetrating Projectile<\/span>: Really cool, but\n\t\tyou likely don&#8217;t have a decent weapon to back this up, and it&#8217;s hard to get\n\t\tmore than two enemies in a straight line.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reckless Abandon<\/span>: This is a big gamble\n\t\tto make when you&#8217;re already injured. Attack bonuses are significant, but you\n\t\ttake an equivalent penalty to AC and a penalty to saves, so you&#8217;re likely to\n\t\tincrease the amount of damage you take faster than the amount of damage you\n\t\tdeal. Still, you might combine this with Come and Get Me and Vengeful Strike\n\t\tto really draw attention to yourself, and rely on the temporary hit points\n\t\tfrom Come and Get Me to keep you alive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shattering Blows<\/span>: Too situational. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re really worried about breaking items, buy an Adamantine Weapon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brutal Critical<\/span>: A single extra damage\n\t\tdie on a critical hit is nothing at this level. Your Strength is above 20,\n\t\tand your attacks should deal 3 or 4 dice of damage (Rune of Major Striking\n\t\tis a 19th-level item, so you probably don&#8217;t have one yet but they&#8217;re right\n\t\taround the corner). The real benefit is the two dice of bleed damage. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re swinging a weapon that deals d10 or d12 damage, that will add up\n\t\tquickly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfect Clarity<\/span>: Will Saves are your\n\t\tweakest save, and the ability to reroll them makes you dramatically more\n\t\tresilient. You&#8217;ll end your Rage prematurely, but you got Quick Rage at level\n\t\t17, so you&#8217;ll only go without raging for one turn. Considering this could\n\t\teasily save your life, giving up Rage for one turn seems like a fair\n\t\ttrade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vicious Evisceration<\/span>: This is for monsters\n\t\tand NPCs. Unless you plan to fight the same creature multiple times in the\n\t\tcourse of the same day with ample time for everyone to heal between fights,\n\t\tthis will effectively deal extra damage equal to the target&#8217;s level (double\n\t\tits level if you scroe a critical). This costs two Actions. Instead, you\n\t\tcould make two Strikes, and assuming you&#8217;re using something at least as\n\t\tdamaging as a longsword you should be doing at minimum 3d8+11 (+5 Str, +6\n\t\tGreater Weapon Specialization; Avg. 24.5), and that doesn&#8217;t account for Rage\n\t\tor additional damage from property runes or other effects. Unless the\n\t\ttarget&#8217;s level significantly exceeds your average damage or the target has\n\t\tsome way to heal to full health, I don&#8217;t see a scenario where this is worth\n\t\tsuch a high-level feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Barbarian-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Contageous Rage<\/span>: You&#8217;re unlikely to use\n\t\tthis more than once or twice in a single rage, depending on your party. By\n\t\tthis level you have Quick Rage, and since this action has the Rage trait you\n\t\tcan use the same Action to make yourself and an ally Rage. Your ally gets to\n\t\tchoose whether or not to accept your Anathema, but they would need to be a\n\t\tin a truly bizzarre circumstance to decline. I think your party can manage\n\t\tto behave themselves for a minute at a time, especially with a fight to\n\t\tdistract them. The exact benefits of this decision vary depending on your\n\t\tInstinct. If you selected Animal Instinct, your ally is unlikely to benefit\n\t\tfrom the improve unarmed attack unless they are a Monk. If you chose Giant\n\t\tinstinct, your ally is almost certainly unable to benefit because they are\n\t\tunlikely to use a &#8220;larger weapon&#8221; unless they are also a Giant Instinct\n\t\tBarbarian.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quaking Stomp<\/span>: An 8th-level spell, and you\n\t\tcan use it at half the normal Action cost (1 Action instead of 2 Actions)\n\t\tevery 10 minutes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Unstoppable Juggernaut<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\tshould probably have 20 Constitution, so 8 points of damage resistance to\n\t\tall damage. That&#8217;s a significant increase to your durability. It&#8217;s not going\n\t\tto change your tactics, but it&#8217;ll keep you alive in very difficult\n\t\tencounters. This is probably a better default option than anything in the\n\t\tcore rulebook.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Armor Proficiency<\/span>: You are only Trained\n\t\tin medium armor until 13th level, giving you 12 full levels at which this\n\t\tfeat will let heavy armor match your proficiency with medium armor. You\n\t\tcould take this at low levels, enjoy heavy armor for a long time, then\n\t\tretrain the feat at level 12 or 13 and switch to medium armor if you want to\n\t\tdo so. That also gives you time to increase your Dexterity at levels 5 and\n\t\t10 if you need to do so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Canny Acumen<\/span>: A great way to improve your\n\t\tproficiency in Perception or your weakest save, but you don&#8217;t get to Master\n\t\tuntil 17th level so it&#8217;s easy to delay.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Block<\/span>: A shield can add a lot to\n\t\tyour durability, and considering the Barbarian&#8217;s relatively poor AC that may\n\t\tbe enough to justify the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toughness<\/span>: You already have more hit\n\t\tpoints than anyone, but the Barbarian tends to have worse AC than other\n\t\tfront-line melee characters, so you need hit points to compensate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because your options for weapons are so broad, it&#8217;s difficult to make specific recommendations. Instead, I&#8217;ll offer some general advice on common Martial Weapons, and I&#8217;ll discuss some Uncommon and Advanced Weapons which offer some interesting options to the characters who can access them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your first decision is whether you will use one-handed weapons and a shield, two-handed weapons, or a one-handed weapon and a free hand so that you can use your free hand to grapple and perform other special attacks. Animal Instinct Barbarians will largely disregard this decision in favor of making unarmed attacks, but be sure to pick up a ranged weapon which you can throw.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose a one-handed weapon and a shield, you&#8217;re choosing to improve your durability at the expense of offensive capability. Consider feats like Shield Block to make the best possible use of your shield, and consider multiclassing into Fighter to get extra options for your shield. You can still use weapons with traits like Trip and Shove to perform those special attacks without a free hand, so consider weapons like the Flail if you plan to make use of special attacks on a regular basis. If your party doesn&#8217;t have good options for dealing with crowds of weak enemies, look for weapons with the Sweep trait like the BAttle Axe. If you&#8217;re not sure, the Longsword is a perfectly fine option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to use two-handed weapons, you&#8217;re choosing to focus on damage output over durability. This is generally an expectation for the Barbarian, but if you&#8217;re going this route be sure that your party has adequate healing options available. Consider feats like Toughness, and consider the Medicine skill and related Skill Feats if your party can&#8217;t constantly supply you with magical healing. Your choice of weapons is very similar to one-handed weapons, but you have the option of a weapon with Reach. If you really enjoy special attacks, the War Flail combines several excellent traits. If you just want to hit stuff, go for a Greatsword.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to fight with an open hand, any one-handed will do fine, but you might also consider the Bastard Sword. The Bastard Sword, when used two-handed, deals a much damage as the Greatsword, but you have the option to use it one-handed so that you can use your other hand to grapple or hold items or whatever else. However, if you don&#8217;t intend to Grapple you&#8217;ll be better server by using a weapon with the appropriate Trait so that you can apply your weapon&#8217;s Item Bonus to your checks.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-weapons\">Uncommon Martial Weapons and Advanced Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome Hooked Hammer<\/span>: Great for an\n\t\tempty-hand build becuase you can use it two-handed for extra damage, and it\n\t\talso has the Trip property so you can get the Item Bonus to checks to trip\n\t\tthings.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Horsechopper<\/span>: Basically a Guisarme, but\n\t\tit does less damage in exchange for Versatile. That would be a fine trade if\n\t\tit didn&#8217;t also cost feats to get access to the Horsechopper.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Padded Armor<\/span>: Good starting armor if you\n\t\tplan to rely on Animal Skin exclusively for your AC, but otherwise go for\n\t\tmedium armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hide<\/span>: Your likely starting armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Breastplate<\/span>: Probably your permanent\n\t\tchoice of armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half Plate\/Full Plate<\/span>: If you decide to\n\t\tgo for heavy armor, you&#8217;ll probably still start with Hide because heavy\n\t\tarmor is so expensive. If you have 12 Dexterity and plan to eventually\n\t\treturn to medium armor once your proficiency improves, stick to half plate.\n\t\tOtherwise, consider spending the extra gold on full plate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Berserker&#8217;s Cloak<\/span>: Putting runes on\n\t\tHandwraps of Mighty Blows is more cost-effective for Animal Instinct\n\t\tBarbarians, and using a weapon is more effective for everyone else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Handwraps of Mighty Blows<\/span>: As crucial for\n\t\tAnimal Instinct Barbarians as a weapon is for every other type of\n\t\tbarbarian.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In general, avoid archetypes which provide spellcasting. The inability to use actions with the Concentrate trait during a rage makes spellcasting difficult to rely upon, especially in combat when your feats are most important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Alchemist<\/span>: Conceptually tempting, since\n\t\tmutagens seem like a fun way to supplement Rage, but the benefits are mostly\n\t\tredundant. Animal Instinct Barbarians are likely to consider Bestial\n\t\tMutagen, but the unnarmed attacks will be worse than what you get while\n\t\traging. Juggernaut Mutagen also looks tempting, but you get more Temporary\n\t\tHit Points from Rage. Both mutagens grant items bonuses, but they won&#8217;t\n\t\tstack with essential items like Handwraps of Mighty Blows and fundamental\n\t\trunes on your armor. You might gain some benefit from crafting elixirs, but\n\t\tif you just need cheap healing it&#8217;s<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter<\/span>: The Fighter has a lot of great\n\t\toptions for the Barbarian, and since so few Fighter feats have the\n\t\tConcentrate trait, almost all of the Fighter&#8217;s feats are options for you.\n\t\tFeats which take a single Action to make a Strike and gain some other\n\t\tbenefit like grabbing or shoving the target can help maximize your action\n\t\teconomy, allowing you to use your favorite special attacks without costing\n\t\tpotential Strikes. Fighter Class Feats also make two-weapon fighting builds\n\t\ta possibility, but I&#8217;m not certain that they&#8217;re worth the feat investment.\n\t\tAvoid Power Attack; Rage&#8217;s damage bonus applies to each hit, so you&#8217;ll get\n\t\tbetter damage output from making extra Strikes. Similarly, be wary of Stance\n\t\tfeats, as the Action investment to both Rage and start a Stance at the\n\t\tbeginning of a fight can cut into crucial damage output early in a fight\n\t\twhen it&#8217;s most impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monk<\/span>: Absolutely stellar for Animal\n\t\tInstinct barbarians. Powerful Fist is helpful when you&#8217;re unable to rage,\n\t\tand many Monk Feats offer fantastic ways to complement your unarmed attacks.\n\t\tStance feats can be a hard choice because spending two actions to get set up\n\t\tin the first round of combat can be hard until you have options like Quick\n\t\tRage and Predator&#8217;s Pounce. Take Monk&#8217;s Flurry as soon as possible so that\n\t\tyou can get even more mileage out of your absurdly powerful unarmed attacks.\n\t\tBarbarians with instincts other than Animal will likely be better served by\n\t\tthe Fighter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Barbarian is all about getting angry and hitting stuff. Depending on your choice of Instinct, there are some thematic options which go a bit beyond &#8220;get mad and hit stuff&#8221;, but the majority of the class is absolutely fixated on getting into a fight, getting really angry, and just absolutely wrecking everything in your way. The Barbarian is easily compared to the Fighter, and where the Fighter is a master of martial arms and armor, focusing on using the right techniques at the right time, the Barbarian is often more of a
