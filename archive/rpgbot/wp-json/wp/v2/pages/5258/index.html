How often do you run away in Pathfinder? Do you want to build a character specifically to do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Judgment<\/span> (Su): <\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Escape<\/span> (Su): Occasionally useful, but\n\t\tusing a distraction to hide is rarely a good choice, and if you are using\n\t\tyour judgement you should have an advantage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lore of Escape<\/span> (Ex): You will be very good\n\tat Stealth and Bluff, but Monster Lore gives you an advantage in combat which\n\tLore of Escape can&#8217;t compete with.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hide Tracks<\/span> (Ex): Hugely situational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Monster Lore<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Exorcist, Preacher, Sacred Huntmaster, Sanctified Slayer, Sin Eater<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"iconoclast\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/iiconoclast\">Iconoclast<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you hate magic items? Do you like slowing down the game for hours every turn to force the GM to recalculate enemies&#8217; stats? Well get the hell out. No one wants to play with you. This archetype is a giant middle finger to directed at whatever semblace of pacing your GM has managed to establish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Shake Effects<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Magic<\/span> (Sp): Or you could just learn\n\tthe cantrip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dispelling Attack<\/span> (Sp): Considerably better\n\tthan Discern Lies. Use this on enemies with a pile of items.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Negating Critical<\/span> (Sp): On the astoundingly\n\tinfrequent occasions that this gets triggered, you&#8217;re going to have to stop\n\tthe game and roll like 20 fortitude saves. I hope you brought food for the\n\tgroup, because they&#8217;re going to be super angry every time you need to use this\n\tability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Destroy Artifact<\/span> (Sp): Destroying an artifact\n\tshould be a super cool quest, not something you just spend a week\n\thand-waving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: monster lore, detect alignment, discern lies, exploit weakness, true judgement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Preacher<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"infiltrator\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/infiltrator\">Infiltrator<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Infiltrator is a cool concept. It shuffles some of the Inquisitor&#8217;s Scout and Face abilities and manages to make the Infiltrator better at both roles without giving up anything of any real value except Stern Gaze. It also helps to reduce the Inquisitor&#8217;s MAD, which makes this a fantastic choice over vanilla Inquisitor if you don&#8217;t want any other archetype.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Misdirection<\/span> (Sp): This is great in\n\tsituations where you have people trying to detect your alignment a lot, but\n\tthose situations are rare in most campaigns. This helps a bit when trying to\n\tserve as an Infiltrator Scout, and can allow you to go places where even a\n\tRogue couldn&#8217;t go.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guileful Lore<\/span> (Ex): This makes it much\n\teasier to serve as the party&#8217;s Face without needing to invest in Charisma. If\n\tyou combine this with the Conversion\/Heresy inquisitions, you can add your\n\tWisdom bonus twice and not touch your Charisma at all. However, Guileful Lore\n\tdoesn&#8217;t touch Intimidate, and you give up Stern Gaze for Misdirection, so you\n\tcan&#8217;t rely on Intimidate as much as a normal Inquisitor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Forbidden Lore<\/span> (Ex): This is situational,\n\tbut less so thank Tracking.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Necessary Lies<\/span> (Su): Extremely\n\tsituational, but you can&#8217;t replicate this with a spell like you can with\n\tDiscern Lies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Monster Lore, Stern Gaze, Track, Discern Lies<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Exorcist, Preacher, Sin Eater, Sacred Huntmaster, Sanctified Slayer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"preacher\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/ipreacher\">Preacher<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Preacher allows you trade in the Inquisitor&#8217;s Teamwork Feat mechanics for\n\tsome cool reroll abilities. If you don&#8217;t like Teamwork feats, this is a great\n\toption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Determination<\/span> (Ex): Determination is a\n\treally cool reroll mechanic which you can use offensively or defensively. If\n\tyou don&#8217;t want teamwork feats, you can get some extra uses of Determination\n\tinstead.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Aggression<\/span>: Rerolls are great, and\n\t\tsometimes a single attack roll can make or break an encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defense<\/span>: This is nice once in a while,\n\t\tespecially if you know that the attack is going to do a ton of damage. Note\n\t\tthat insight bonuses add to touch AC, so you can use this to avoid some\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warning<\/span>: Considerably better than the +4\n\t\tbonus. A reroll works out to something like a +5 bonus, and you can use this\n\t\twhen an enemy rolls a critical threat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Solo Tactics, teamwork feats (optional)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Exorcist, Heretic, Iconoclast, Infiltrator, Sacred Huntmaster, Sanctified Slayer, Sin Eater, Witch Hunter<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sacred-huntsmaster\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/isacred-huntsmaster\">Sacred Huntsmaster<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sacred Huntmaster trades in the Inquisitor&#8217;s Judgement ability for an Animal Companion and the Hunter&#8217;s Animal Focus ability. As fantastic as Judgement is, this is a very fair trade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Companion<\/span> (Ex): Animal Companions are\n\tfantastic, and the Hunter&#8217;s version adds the ability to take Skirmisher Ranger\n\tTricks in addition to normal animal tricks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter Tactics<\/span> (Ex): Teamwork Feats are\n\toften problematic because they require that you have someone else to cooperate\n\twith. This resolves that issue by giving you a free team mate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Focus<\/span> (Su): Animal Focus is very\n\tversatile, and can provide a lot of buffs which will serve the same purpose as\n\tJudgement. Because the duration for Animal Focus is measured in minutes, you\n\tmay be able to stretch it over more combats in a day than you could use\n\tJudgement. Because this ability functions as the Hunter ability of the same\n\tname, you can assign Animal Focus enhancements to your Animal Companion even\n\tthough the entry doesn&#8217;t specifically state it. Remember that aspects granted\n\tto your animal companion have no duration, which makes them especially\n\tpotent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Empathic Link<\/span> (Su): Very useful\n\tfor scouting, though somewhat situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Raise Animal Companion<\/span> (Sp): Provided that\n\tyou have a day to rest, this is effectively free.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Second Animal Focus<\/span> (Ex): By this level the\n\tability score enhancements give you a +6 bonus, which makes this ability as\n\teffective as a 45,000 gp item for both you and your animal companion, and\n\tconsiderably more versatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Empathic Link<\/span> (Su): Situational,\n\tbut being able to give orders to your companion telepathically makes it much\n\teasier to command it while you are looking through its eyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Judgement, Second Judgement, Slayer, Third Judgement, True Judgement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Heretic, Infiltrator, Preacher, Sin Eater<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sanctified-slayer\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/isanctified-slayer\">Sanctified Slayer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Studied Target is a Fantastic ability, but the Sanctified Slayer&#8217;s weak Sneak Attack progression and severely limited number of Slayer Talents really hurt the viability of the Sanctified Slayer Archetype. It&#8217;s not completely awful, but it likely won&#8217;t keep pace with a vanilla Inquisitor making good use of Judgement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Studied Target<\/span> (Ex): Studied Target is a\n\tfantastic ability. Remember that the DC bonus applies to Slayer class\n\tabilities, so it does not apply to Inquisitor spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sneak Attack<\/span> (Ex): Sneak Attack at the\n\tsame rate as a Slayer, but you get it one level behind. This won&#8217;t amount to a\n\tlot of damage, especially with the Inquisitor&#8217;s 2\/3 BAB.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Talented Slayer<\/span> (Ex): You only get 4\n\ttalents. As good as the Slayer&#8217;s Talents are, with so few of them you don&#8217;t\n\treally have a lot of options. For help with Slayer Talents, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/slayer\/talents\">Slayer Talents Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Judgement, Second Judgement, Slayer, Third Judgement, True Judgement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Heretic, Infiltrator, Preacher, Sin Eater<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sin-eater\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/isin-eater\">Sin Eater<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eat Sin is a really cool healing mechanic, and Speak with Dead adds a nice utility effect on top of the free healing. Inquisitions\/Domains add a lot of cool options to the Inquisitor, so think carefully when deciding to give them up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Eat Sin<\/span> (Sp): Basically a free use of Cure\n\tX wounds. Fantastic for after combat when your party is resting and healing.\n\tUsing this as a full round action in combat should be a rare occurance. I&#8217;m\n\tnot certain how the undead portion of the ability works because you need to\n\tkill the enemy to eat its sins, and if you killed the enemy it won&#8217;t typically\n\trise as a shadow, spectre, or vampire because those creatures need to be\n\tkilled by their creator to become those creatures.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Speak with Dead<\/span> (Sp): Speak With Dead is\n\tsituational, but if you go around eating everyone&#8217;s sins, you might as well\n\task them questions. Ask them weird stuff like &#8220;where is the trasure?&#8221; or &#8220;what\n\tdid you have for breakfast?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Burden of Sin<\/span> (Sp): Consolidate your parties\n\tstatus afflictions, then have someone remove them all at once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Domain, Teamwork Feat (6th), Exploit Weakness<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Exorcist, Heretic, Infiltrator, Preacher, Sacred Huntmaster, Sanctified Slayer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"spellbreaker\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/ispellbreaker\">Spellbreaker<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Strong-Willed is good enough to make this archetype worth a class dip for any mage hunting character. Like many mage killing archetypes, the Spellbreaker is good at making Concentration checks hard, and provides the Inquisitor with excellent resistances against magic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Strong-Willed<\/span> (Ex): Mind-affecting effects\n\tmake up most Will saves, which means you get to reroll almost every Will save\n\tin the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defense against Magic<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s difficult\n\tto pick which schools you need resistance to. Evocation, Enchantment,\n\tNecromancy, transmutation, and Illusion are all good choices. Remember that\n\tyou get a reroll against Mind-Affecting effects (most Enchantment and Illusion\n\teffects are mind-affecting), and your first choice will affect Impervious when\n\tyou get it at level 20.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Foil Casting<\/span> (Su): Stacking with Disruptive\n\tis great, but the ranged attack mechanic is weird and poorly defined. If you\n\tshoot the same spellcaster three times, does the DC increase stack? Even if it\n\tdoes, you need to prepare an action to shoot the spellcaster to force a\n\tconcentration check.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impervious<\/span> (Ex): This is great for common\n\tspell schools like Evocation. Walk through fireballs. Ignore magic missiles.\n\tKill some wizards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: monster lore, bonus teamwork feats, solo tactics, true judgement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"witch-hunter\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/inquisitor\/archetypes\/inquisitor-archetypes-paizo\/iwitch-hunter\">Witch Hunter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Witch Hunter is about on par with the Spellbreaker, but functions differently. Both archetypes are good, so if you plan to hunt mages pick whichever fits your play style best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Sage<\/span> (Ex): This should save you\n\tseveral ranks on Spellcraft at the very least. Of course, to take advantage of\n\tKnowledgeable Defense you will want to maximize Spellcraft.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledgeable Defense<\/span>: The bonus is pretty\n\tgreat, and it&#8217;s a fun way to motivate you to identify spells. Granting your\n\tallies the bonus is weird and poorly worded. Because you can&#8217;t share the bonus\n\tas an immediate action, you need to use it for ongoing spells which allow\n\tsaves after the spell is cast. Or you might interpret the rule to mean that\n\tyou share the bonus as a swift action, then every time a spell is cast you can\n\tmake a Spellcraft check to share the bonus with all of your allies.\n\tFortunately, the sharing mechanic doesn&#8217;t come into play until level 20.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Scent<\/span>: This is a really cool flavor,\n\tand it&#8217;s considerably more fun than Tracking.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Witch&#8217;s Bane Judgment<\/span> (Ex): <\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Witch&#8217;s Bane<\/span>: Situational, and the bonus\n\t\tisn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s a really cool flavor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Monster Lore, Detect Alignment, Track, Discern Lies, Exploit Weakness, True Judgement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Preacher<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>introduction The Inquisitor is a very versatile class on level with the Bard.
