For most casters you&#8217;ll get more use out of spells from other spell lists, but for the Sorcerer you&#8217;ll do fine with anything useful enough to cast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Racial traits which improve your durability to compensate for your d6 hit dice and lack of armor are both great choices. It&#8217;s harder for the Sorcerer to carry around Absorb Elements and Shield than it is for the Wizard, so damage resistances, AC bonuses or natural armor to replace Mage Armor, and other options like temporary hit points can all be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Since sorcerers generally shouldn&#8217;t be in melee, flight is a huge asset.
