This gives us the flexibility to invest a little less into Dexterity, and more into Constitution. Additionally, we gain cantrips such as Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade to put a little extra punch onto our swings.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be taking Custom Lineage for this build as we want the bonus feat and the single +2 does more for us. If we were not multiclassing, Variant Human would be our choice instead, as we\u2019d need more investment into Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Racial Adjustments<\/th><th>Level 20<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>STR<\/strong><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>DEX<\/strong><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>CON<\/strong><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>INT<\/strong><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>WIS<\/strong><\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>CHA<\/strong><\/td><td>15<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We take point buy, and, in contrast to the more typical ability spread from above, we only put 14 into Dexterity due to the medium armor we\u2019ll be getting from Hexblade. The +2 from Custom Lineage goes into Charisma. Because we have points left over, we bump Wisdom up to remove any penalties to any checks like Insight or Perception.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re using Custom Lineage to get a bonus feat, Fey Touched for +1 Charisma and choosing the Bless spell, and using the +2 to improve Charisma. For our Variable Trait, we\u2019re taking Darkvision because it\u2019s very useful.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Feylost is the perfect background for what is basically Peter Pan. It comes with Deception and Survival, as well as a Musical Instrument of our choice. The Pan Flute seems more than appropriate. As for the bonus language, while I usually leave that up to the reader as these choices are more campaign-dependent, I will suggest Sylvan, language of the fairies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>From Rogue, we get Acrobatics, Insight, Perception, Persuasion, and Thieves\u2019 Tools. From Feylost we get Deception, Survival, and Pan Flute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Expertise, we pick Acrobatics and Persuasion at first level, and Insight and Perception at 6th level.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Because we multiclass carefully, only our first Feat comes late by one level. We then get as many ASIs as a typical rogue, though they are all shifted back a few levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Custom Lineage, we get to pick a bonus feat at first level and we pick Fey Touched, getting +1 to Charisma and choosing the Bless spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fifth level, Rogue fourth, we take Warcaster, primarily so we can make opportunity attacks with Booming Blade, but also so our Rapier and Shield don\u2019t inhibit any somatic components of spells like Shield. Because we started with 18 Charisma, we\u2019re already ahead on fundamental math, allowing us to take this defensive boost early without hurting our offense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, Warlock fourth, we take an ASI for +2 Charisma.

Like, breaking the Fundamental Math good. But why take it on what is allegedly a Rogue? Well, the simple answer is that, by offloading Bless duty onto the Rogue, a Cleric in the party can instead concentrate on something like Spirit Guardians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Sneak Attack<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1- Rogue 1<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>Sneak Attack<br><br>Skills<br>-Acrobatics<br>-Deception<br>-Insight<br>-Perception<br>-Persuasion<br>-Survival<br><br>Expertise<br>-Acrobatics<br>-Persuasion<br><br>Bonus Feat: Fey Touched<br>-Bless (c)<br>-Misty Step<\/td><td>We start out as a Rogue, and 1st-level is a bit rough for everyone, but we\u2019re going out with 14 Dexterity because we\u2019ll be picking up Hexblade Warlock at 2nd-level. We\u2019ll be slightly behind the fundamental math, but it\u2019s only for one level.<br><br>As a Custom Lineage, we get a bonus feat, so we have Bless and Misty Step once per long rest thanks to Fey Touched.

Because we\u2019re not going to increase Dexterity beyond 14, we\u2019ll want to wear Medium armor anyways, and we\u2019ll want to hold a shield. Fights don\u2019t always go our way, sometimes we\u2019ll be caught out of position and we\u2019ll be glad to have actual AC when that happens.<br><br>For Pact Magic, we take the Booming Blade and Eldritch Blast Cantrips. Booming Blade is a straight increase to damage because Rogues don\u2019t get Extra Attack, and Eldritch Blast is a backup for rare situations that we can\u2019t reach someone and want to do more than nothing.<br><br>For 1st-level spells, we learn Protection from Evil and Good and Shield. If we\u2019re in a bad situation with the right kind of foes, Protection from E&amp;G is the same benefit as the target Dodging every turn, and it also ends charm\/fear\/possession from the creatures affected by the spell if your ally is already having trouble. Shield on the other hand is good for those attacks that just barely hit us.<br><br>We\u2019ll only have one Pact Magic spell slot for a few levels though. It might make more sense to use it on Bless, which we know from Fey Touched, to boost the attacks of multiple allies.<br><br>Remember, we\u2019re not primarily a spellcaster, we\u2019re a Rogue who happens to have a few magical tricks that supplement our primary occupation.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3- Rogue 2<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>Cunning Action<\/td><td>With Cunning Action we can Dash or Disengage as a bonus action.<br><br>We could also make a Stealth check to Hide, but this build was a little tight on skills and didn\u2019t choose Stealth as a proficiency.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4- Rogue 3<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>Swashbuckler<br>-Fancy Footwork<br>-Rakish Audacity<\/td><td>Swashbuckler comes with a lot as soon as it\u2019s acquired.<br><br>Fancy Footwork is like a free disengage against any target we make a melee attack against, hit or miss.<br><br>Rakish Audacity does two things.
