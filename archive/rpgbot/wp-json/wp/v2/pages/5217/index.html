For some reason the Bard gets proficiency with the\n\tWhip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: 6+ skill ranks, and a skill list\n\tas long as your arm. The Bard gets all Knowledge skills as class skills,\n\tand\n\tBardic Knowledge adds a heft bonus to Knowledge checks, making the Bard one\n\tof the easiest Librarians in the game with only a few skill ranks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: Despite being only a 2\/3 caster,\n\tthe Bard&#8217;s spells are fantastic. The Bard&#8217;s spell are arcane, but include\n\tCure spells, and have a lot of excellent options which are only available\n\tto\n\tthe Bard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Knowledge<\/span> (Ex): <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Performance<\/span>: Fantastic and\n\tversatile, Bardic Performance is the Bard&#8217;s primary option in combat. There\n\tare numerous feats which can enhance Bardic Performance, and any Bard who\n\tdoesn&#8217;t take Lingering Performance is doing themselves a huge disservice.\n\tAs\n\tyou grow in level you can perform as smaller actions, allowing you to\n\tquickly cycle songs and rely on Lingering Performance to keep their effects\n\trunning without expending performance rounds. The biggest limitation on\n\tBardic performance is that a bard cannot have more than one bardic\n\tperformance in effect at one time.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Countersong<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Distraction<\/span> (Su): More useful than\n\t\tCountersong, but still very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fascinate<\/span> (Su): A surprisingly useful\n\t\tway to distract enemies or defuse combat. This has saved my life a few\n\t\ttimes when my party was in bad shaped and got ambushed by enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspire Courage<\/span> (Su): The Bard&#8217;s bread\n\t\tand butter. Inspire Courage will make up the majority of your Bardic\n\t\tPerformance uses, and will consume the majority of your performance\n\t\trounds\n\t\tper day. It&#8217;s important to note that Inspire Courage&#8217;s bonuses to attack\n\t\tand damage are competence bonuses rather than morale bonuses, which means\n\t\tthat they will stack with many spells like Bless,<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspire Competence<\/span> (Su): Use this for\n\t\tevery skill check (except Stealth obviously). The scaling bonus will\n\t\talways be useful, and can significantly improve your party&#8217;s\n\t\treliability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Suggestion<\/span> (Sp): With an hours per\n\t\tlevel\n\t\tduration, Suggestion can be a great way to circumvent combat. Use\n\t\tFascinate to calm enemies, then use Suggestion to politely Suggest that\n\t\tthey go hang out somewhere out of the way for a few hours.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dirge of Doom<\/span> (Su): Though it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tstack with other fear effects, this is a great way to debuff enemies\n\t\tbefore you allies drop save or suck effects. Note that Dirge of Doom\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t allow a saving throw.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspire Greatness<\/span> (Su): This ability is\n\t\tfantastic. 2d10 temporary hit points are great, especially because the\n\t\ttarget(s) get to add their constitution modifier. There is no extra cost\n\t\tto start a new performance, so you can end then immediately restart this\n\t\tperformance whenever the temporary hit points are consumed. By this level\n\t\tyou can start a performance as move action, and it gets even easier when\n\t\tyou hit level 13 and can start a performance as a Swift action. Note that\n\t\tthe attack bonus is a competence bonus, so it won&#8217;t stack with Inspire\n\t\tCourage&#8217;s bonus to attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Soothing Performance<\/span> (Su): The Mass\n\t\tCure spells generally aren&#8217;t great, but this only costs 4 Bardic\n\t\tPerformance round for the equivalent of a 7th-level spell. At this level\n\t\tyou have plenty of performance rounds to throw around, so you should be\n\t\table to spare a few to patch up the party between fights.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Frightening Tune<\/span> (Sp): For one round of\n\t\tperformance you can make every enemy in a fight run away. Even if this\n\t\tonly affects a few of the enemies in a fight, you can do this as a Swift\n\t\taction and disable huge portions of encounters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspire Heroics<\/span> (Su): +4 to AC and\n\t\tsaves is pretty great, but you will only be able to affect two creatures\n\t\tat most.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mass Suggestion<\/span> (Sp): A bit more\n\t\tpowerful and versatile than Frightening Tune, but you can&#8217;t use it as\n\t\teasily in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadly Performance<\/span> (Su): Save or die as\n\t\ta full round action that costs only one performance round. You way want\n\t\tto\n\t\tstart the round with Fascinate as a swift action to keep the target in\n\t\tplace.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Cantrips are always amazing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Versatile Performance<\/span> (Ex): Versatile\n\tPerformance allows the Bard to pick up additional skills while using their\n\tPerform modifier in place of their potentially lower modifier to the\n\toriginal skill. When selecting your Versatile Performance skills, be sure\n\tto\n\tavoid duplicates. The Bard gets their second Versatile Performance at level\n\t6, but there is very little need for more than two, so no one would fault\n\tyou for only taking two performance skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Act<\/span> (Bluff, Disguise): Disguise is\n\t\tvery situational, and you can completely replace it with Disguise\n\t\tSelf.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Comedy<\/span> (Bluff, Intimidate): Covers two\n\t\tessential social skills. Combines well with Oratory.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dance<\/span> (Acrobatics, Fly): Acrobatics is\n\t\tvery situational unless you plan to do a lot of Tumbling, and it&#8217;s nearly\n\t\timpossible to justify more than one rank in Fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Keyboard Instruments<\/span> (Diplomacy,\n\t\tIntimidate): Covers two essential social skills. Combines well with\n\t\tSing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Oratory<\/span> (Diplomacy, Sense Motive):\n\t\tCovers two essential social skills, and Sense Motive is based on the\n\t\tBard&#8217;s relatively low Wisdom. Combines well with Comedy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Percussion<\/span> (Handle Animal,\n\t\tIntimidate): Animals aren&#8217;t really important to the Bard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sing<\/span> (Bluff, Sense Motive): Covers two\n\t\tessential social skills, and Sense Motive is based on the Bard&#8217;s\n\t\trelatively low Wisdom. Combines well with Keyboard Instruments.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">String<\/span> (Bluff, Diplomacy): Covers two\n\t\tessential social skills, but doesn&#8217;t have a secondary choice which covers\n\t\tthe other social skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wind<\/span> (Diplomacy, Handle Animal):\n\t\tAnimals aren&#8217;t really important to the Bard.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Well-Versed<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lore Master<\/span> (Ex): Makes the Bard\n\tperfectly\n\treliable as a Librarian. With one rank in every Knowledge skill and Bardic\n\tKnowledge you can expect to consistently pass most Knowledge checks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jack-of-All-Trades<\/span> (Ex): Be good at\n\tliterally every skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Charisma is the Bard&#8217;s most important ability for both .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Good for melee or bow damage, but\n\tthe Bard needs Dexterity to fix their poor AC, and they can&#8217;t be good at\n\tevery ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: With light armor Dexterity is\n\tessential. Take Weapon Finesse if you plan to be in melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Fortitude is the Bard&#8217;s only bad\n\tsave and with only d8 hit points the Bard really needs Constitution.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: More skill ranks are great for the\n\tBard&#8217;s huge skill list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Only needed for Will saves, and\n\tthe\n\tBard gets good Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Essential for the Bard&#8217;s\n\tspellcasting, social skills, and Perform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 11<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 16<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 11<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 11<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 11<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Charisma are fantastic, and a favored class bonus which offers additional performance rounds can go a long way to improve the Bard&#8217;s support abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: The Charisma penalty hurts, and the\n\tDwarf doesn&#8217;t really offer anything useful for the Bard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: Despite lacking a bonus to\n\tCharisma,\n\tthe Elf&#8217;s bonuses to Dexterity and Intelligence can be very helpful for the\n\tBard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome<\/span>: The bonuses to Constitution and\n\tCharisma are both great for the Bard, and the Gnome&#8217;s bonus to illusion\n\tspells is nice for the Bard&#8217;s spell list. The Gnome favored class bonus\n\tgrants some much-needed performance rounds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Elf<\/span>: A flexible ability bonus is\n\talways helpful, and Skill Focus is great with Versatile Performance. The\n\tHalf-Elf favored class bonus grants some much-needed performance rounds,\n\tand\n\tyou can take the Human favored class bonus to learn additional spells..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Orc<\/span>: A very different feel from the\n\tHalf-Elf but many of the same benefits. The Half-Orc favored class bonus\n\tgrants some much-needed performance rounds, and you can take the Human\n\tfavored class bonus to learn additional spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: The Halfling&#8217;s Dexterity and\n\tCharisma bonuses are great for the Bard, and the Halfling&#8217;s other abilities\n\thelp the Bard serve as a Scout. Unfortunately the Halfling favored class\n\tbonus is pretty terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: A bonus feat and a flexible\n\tability\n\tbonus are both great for the Bard, and the Human&#8217;s bonus skill ranks help\n\tfill out the Bard&#8217;s skill list. The Human favored class bonus allows you to\n\texpand the Bard&#8217;s very limited number of spells known.

Even at higher levels when your save DC is lagging, you\n\t\tmight still be able to succeed a few times against large bulky creatures\n\t\tlike giants which tend to have poor Will saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cure Light Wounds<\/span>: A great way to spend\n\t\tyour spell slots at the end of the day, and a great way to complement\n\t\twhatever other healing resources are available to your party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ear-piercing Scream<\/span>: Most of the Bard&#8217;s\n\t\tspells target Will saves, so a save-or-suck that targets Fortitude saves\n\t\tcan be a huge asset against enemy spellcasters. The damage isn&#8217;t great,\n\t\tbut you&#8217;re here for the Stun effect, not for the damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grease<\/span>: Stunningly good area control at\n\t\tany level. A DC 10 Acrobatics check doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but very few\n\t\tmonsters have ranks in Acrobatics, so a straight Dexterity check has a\n\t\thigh chance of failure even for high-CR monsters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleep<\/span>: At 1st and 2nd level, Sleep is\n\t\tyour go-to save-or-suck spell. You&#8217;ll be able to keep up with full\n\t\tcasters\n\t\tat this level, too, which is really helpful since you&#8217;ll likely be too\n\t\tweak to be a major threat with a weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Timely Inspiration<\/span>: The bonus isn&#8217;t\n\t\thuge, even at high levels, but it&#8217;s enough that at high levels you can\n\t\tturn a narrow miss into a hit at the cost of a 1st-level spell. I\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t\n\t\trush to grab this at low levels, but at higher levels you might retrain\n\t\tanother 1st-level spell (like Sleep) to get this instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blistering Invective<\/span>: Turn Intimidate\n\t\tinto an AOE debuff, and possibly set enemies on fire.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cure Moderate Wounds<\/span>: Use Cure Light in\n\t\temergencies, and use Path of Glory to recover hit points during down\n\t\ttime.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gallant Inspiration<\/span>: Timely\n\t\tInspiration\n\t\twith a 2d4 bonus instead of the fixed, scaling bonus. Until you hit 15th\n\t\tlevel this will always provide a bonus at least as high, and at an\n\t\taverage\n\t\tof +5 this could make a big difference. However, it feels deeply\n\t\tfrustrating to add 2d4, roll poorly, and still fail after burning a spell\n\t\tslot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glitterdust<\/span>: Great at any level, this\n\t\tis\n\t\tone of the most effective ways to counter invisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroism<\/span>: Somewhat redundant with\n\t\tInspire Courage, but at 10 minutes\/level duration this may still be\n\t\tuseful. If your party doesn&#8217;t have a lot of martial characters, use this\n\t\tto buff whoever wants it and use Bardic Music to do something other than\n\t\tInspire Courage. This provides a Morale bonus, so Courageous weapons can\n\t\timprove the bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility<\/span>: Too useful to forgo.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mirror Image<\/span>: One of the best and most\n\t\treliable ways to use magic in place of a decent AC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Path of Glory<\/span>: A great way to heal the\n\t\tparty, but don&#8217;t both using it in combat. Even if you have more than four\n\t\tparty members, remember that you can all squeeze into the four squares\n\t\tcreated at the beginning of the spell so that everyone gets as much\n\t\thealing as possible. This is dramatically more efficient than Cure\n\t\tModerate Wounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silence<\/span>: Cast it on the fighter\n\t\tstomping\n\t\taround in full plate, and you&#8217;ve suddenly got a sneaky party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sound Burst<\/span>: AOE stun, but it&#8217;s rare\n\t\tthat you&#8217;ll face clustered enemies with poor Fortitude saves so\n\t\tEar-piercing Scream fills the same function.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tongues<\/span>: You&#8217;re almost certainly the\n\t\tFace in your party, and this can almost entirely replace the Linguistics\n\t\tskill.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic<\/span>: Every party needs someone\n\t\twho can cast Dispel Magic, and since it&#8217;s not DC-dependent the Bard is\n\t\tjust as good as everyone else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gaseous Form<\/span>: A great way to safely\n\t\tsneak in or out of somewhere and to look around without drawing\n\t\tattention.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Good Hope<\/span>: +2 morale bonus to\n\t\tbasically\n\t\tevery d20 roll and to damage rolls. Inspire Courage will usually do the\n\t\tjob fine, but you can combine the two (with the some minor overlap) for\n\t\tmore bonuses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haste<\/span>: One of the best buffs in the\n\t\tgame\n\t\tfor martial characters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility Sphere<\/span>: Combined with\n\t\tsilence, you can make your entire party basically undetectable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Jester&#8217;s Jaunt<\/span>: Teleporting an ally a\n\t\tshort distance is a great way to get them out of a grapple or a bad\n\t\tlocation, but this spell isn&#8217;t listed Harmless, so RAW your allies still\n\t\tneed to make a Will save even if you&#8217;re using it to help them. This spell\n\t\tis written to be used offensively rather than to directly affect allies,\n\t\tbut your GM might be generous enough to allow your allies to voluntarily\n\t\tfail the save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mad Monkeys<\/span>: Comical and amusing, but\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phantom Steed<\/span>: A solid option for\n\t\tlong-distance travel if teleportation isn&#8217;t available, and once your\n\t\tmount\n\t\tcan fly it becomes a useful asset in combat, too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Purging Finale<\/span>: Removing many of these\n\t\tconditions typically requires much higher-level spells. Once you can\n\t\tactivate Bardic Music as a swift action, you can start them immediately\n\t\tend a song to help allies recover from problematic status conditions. You\n\t\tcould even use this to help mounts march indefinitely. I&#8217;m not entirely\n\t\tcertain, but removing status conditions like cowering and exchausted\n\t\tshould also remove lesser version of those conditions like shaken and\n\t\tfatigured. Check with your GM.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Curse<\/span>: Situational. Save this\n\t\tfor clerics and NPC spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Reviving Finale<\/span>: 2d6 hit points is not\n\t\tenough for a 3rd-level spell slot. Cast Path of Glory or something\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">See Invisibility<\/span>: Fantastic, but\n\t\tGlitterdust is usually sufficient.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tiny Hut<\/span>: Primarily intended as a safe\n\t\tplace to rest, but the Tiny Hut can also serve as a fox hole for ranged\n\t\tallies like archer rogues and spellcasters who function best at range and\n\t\tdon&#8217;t want to be easy to attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Break Enchantment<\/span>: An essential way to\n\t\tremove debuffs and permanent status conditions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dance of a Hundred Cuts<\/span>: A fantastic\n\t\tbuff for melee bards, but if you skip attacking in a given turn you need\n\t\tto remember to move or the spell ends.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dimension Door<\/span>: No somatic components\n\t\tmeans that you can easily use this to get out of a grapple.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Echolocation<\/span>: Blindsense is great, and\n\t\t10 minutes\/level duration will last a long time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Freedom of Movement<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\tessential if you&#8217;re facing lots of enemies that like to grapple.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroic Finale<\/span>: Give up your own\n\t\tstandard action to give one to someone else. The action economy isn&#8217;t\n\t\tgreat, but sometimes you need an ally to do something you can&#8217;t do on\n\t\tyour\n\t\town.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility, Greater<\/span>: A great way to\n\t\thelp rogues and other squishy allies who don&#8217;t want to be attacked.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Path of Glory, Greater<\/span>: 5 hit points\n\t\tper ally per round is pretty good, and even at rounds\/level duration you\n\t\tcan easily get your whole party to full hit points with one spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Phantom Steed, Communal<\/span>: Just cast\n\t\tPhantom Steed more times.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Primal Scream<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Secure Shelter<\/span>: A more pleasant place to\n\t\trest than a Tiny Hut, but it lacks the ability to serve as a fox hole\n\t\tduring combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Conjuration<\/span>: Fantastic and\n\t\tversatile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shadow Step<\/span>: Dimension Door has a longer\n\t\trange and doesn&#8217;t require somatic components.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Virtuoso Performance<\/span>: This is too\n\t\tcostly to use frequently, but it could work in major fights where\n\t\tplanning\n\t\tto rest afterward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard&#8217;s Escape<\/span>: This is less of an\n\t\tescape, and more of a rapid repositioning. It&#8217;s not a bad spell, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tpoorly described and it&#8217;s very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Dreams<\/span>: Save-or-suck on every\n\t\tenemy within 5 feet of you every round for rounds\/level. If you&#8217;re in\n\t\tmelee against multiple foes this is an absolutely devastating spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic, Greater<\/span>: Just as\n\t\tessential\n\t\tas Dispel Magic, and the maximum bonus is higher.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Frozen Note<\/span>: Hit Dice are a hard\n\t\tmetric\n\t\tto predict because they don&#8217;t map to CR on a one-to-one basis. Creatures\n\t\thave an average number of hit dice 1-2 higher than their CR at any given\n\t\tCR, so unless you&#8217;re facing a large number of considerably weak creatures\n\t\tyou should expect enemies to still get a save. Still, I can&#8217;t think of\n\t\tmany ways that a bard can easily lock down an entire encounter with a\n\t\tsingle spell\/<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Evocation<\/span>: Fantastic and\n\t\tversatile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Walk<\/span>: Neat, but Teleportation\n\t\tis\n\t\tfaster and other spellcasters can cast Teleport by this level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadowbard<\/span>: Much better than Virtuoso\n\t\tPerformance. This lets you stack two songs (or three if you use both\n\t\tspells) without eating any of your Bardic Music rounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stunning Finale<\/span>: Stunning an enemy is\n\t\tgreat, but by this level your save DCs are lagging far enough behind full\n\t\tcasters that you may have trouble getting enemies to fail their saving\n\t\tthrows.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Brilliant Inspiration<\/span>: 5e-style\n\t\tAdvantage on every attack roll, ability check, and skill check (no saving\n\t\tthrows, sadly). You actually want to avoid natural 20&#8217;s, which is weird,\n\t\tbut until that happens this can give your ally a dramatic boost in\n\t\teffectiveness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dance of a Thousand Cuts<\/span>: Combines the\n\t\teffects of two of the best buffs a melee bard could possibly hope for.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Getaway<\/span>: This is what Bard&#8217;s Escape\n\t\tshould do. You need to pre-cast this, but you can easily do it before you\n\t\tgo on an adventure or at the entrance of a dungeon to make sure you have\n\t\tsomewhere safe to go when your party needs to bail.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroes&#8217; Feast<\/span>: A solid all-day buff,\n\t\tand starting the day with some temporary hit points can do a lot to keep\n\t\tyou alive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magnifying Chime<\/span>: A decent AOE damage\n\t\tspell, but it takes time to ramp up. Your best bet is to cast the spell,\n\t\thave an ally throw the affected object into a room, close the door, then\n\t\tstart the scaling damage and hope that whatever is on the other side of\n\t\tthe door dies before the door vibrated apart.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Overwhelming Presence<\/span>: Frozen Note is\n\t\tbetter and the DC will only be 1 lower, though Overwhelming Presence&#8217;s\n\t\trange is much larger.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sonic Form<\/span>: Novel, and the sonic\n\t\tdamage touch attack is passable, but the defensive benefits won&#8217;t matter\n\t\tmuch at this level because so many enemies will have magic attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Allying<\/span> (+1): Even if you&#8217;re built\n\t\tfor\n\t\tweapon combat, you&#8217;re still going to spend a lot of turns in combat\n\t\tcasting spells or using other special abilities.

It&#8217;s a bit more expensive than your typical +2 shield, so it\n\t\tmay not be worth the cost compared to a mithral buckler. However, it\n\t\tallows you to perform somatic components with the hand holding the\n\t\tshield,\n\t\twhich means that you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue,\n\t\tand because it has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone\n\t\tcan use it without issue.

On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\tforego.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circlet of Persuasion<\/span>: +3 bonus to all\n\t\tCharisma-based skills at 4,500gp is amazing.

Bard Class Features Hit Points: d8 hit points is difficult, especially in light armor and without the Rogue&#8217;s absurd Dexterity.
