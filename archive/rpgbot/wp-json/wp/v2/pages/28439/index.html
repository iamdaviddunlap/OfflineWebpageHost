Spell Breaker makes the Abjurer the\n\tuncontested champion of Counterspell and Dispel Magic, allowing you to defend\n\tyour allies both from mundane damage with your ward and from spells with\n\tCounterspell and Dispel Magic. While this is undeniably effective, the purely\n\treactive nature of the subclass can make it boring to play for many players\n\twho prefer a more proactive approach to challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Abjuration Savant<\/span>: Free spells in your\n\t\tspellbook. Always nice, but not massively impactful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Ward<\/span>: A great way to protect\n\t\tyourself and your party. The ward works a lot like Temporary Hit Points,\n\t\tbut, since they aren&#8217;t technically THP, the two effects provide two layers\n\t\tof protection before you take real hp damage. The Ward itself begins at full\n\t\tHP the first time you cast an Abjuration spell each day. Mage Armor is a\n\t\tgreat way to get the ward in place before you go anywhere dangerous.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since the ward can take damage in your place, you may even be able to\n\t\t\tavoid saves to maintain Concentration when you take damage. This\n\t\t\tadditional overshield is a resource, and resources are meant to be spent,\n\t\t\tbut don&#8217;t be reckless and overextend yourself. Be sure to take all the\n\t\t\tnormal defensive precautions and the ward will help mitigate damage when\n\t\t\tthe dice just don&#8217;t go in your favor.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that damage to the ward is applied after damage resistances, so\n\t\t\tanything that reduces the incoming damage will stretch the value of your\n\t\t\tward. Blade Ward and Resistance can both help here, though you may want to\n\t\t\tConcentrate on more impactful spells.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unfortunately, charging the ward requires you to cast Abjuration spells\n\t\t\tusing spell slots, which makes it difficult and expensive to keep the ward\n\t\t\tfully charged throughout the day. Look for Abjuration buffs that you can\n\t\t\tcast on your allies before jumping into combat.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Projected Ward<\/span>: Your party&#8217;s Defender\n\t\tlikely takes a lot more damage than you, so soaking some of it with your\n\t\tward can really cut down on how many resources your party must devote to\n\t\thealing. Just be aware that you&#8217;ll be unable to cast Shield, Absorb\n\t\tElements, and Counterspell in response to future triggering events should\n\t\tyou block some damage to an ally since you only get one Reaction per\n\t\tround.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Breaker<\/span>: Two free prepared spells,\n\t\tand, if you cast either and fail the ability check, your spell slot isn&#8217;t\n\t\texpended. Counter every hostile spell worth a spell slot even if you&#8217;re\n\t\tunlikely to succeed. Outside of combat, you can repeatedly cast Dispel Magic\n\t\tat level 3 until you eventually get lucky on the check.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>In combat, the ability to cast Dispel Magic as a Bonus Action will rarely\n\t\t\tbe impactful, but, against enemy spellcasters, it&#8217;s a powerful way to strip\n\t\t\tthem of buff spells.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Resistance<\/span>: Resistance to spells is\n\t\tgreat for resisting dangerous save or suck spells, and resistance to spell\n\t\tdamage makes you greatly resistant to direct damage spells which typically\n\t\tdon&#8217;t require saves (Eldritch Blast, Fire Bolt, etc.). Both halves of the\n\t\tfeature apply at the same time, so against spells which allow you to save\n\t\tfor reduced damage (Fireball, etc.), this is extremely effective because on\n\t\ta successful save you&#8217;ll often take just a quarter of the game. However,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re expected to counter spells rather than try to resist them, so this is\n\t\tmostly a redundant defense for when you&#8217;re outnumbered or surprised.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"diviner\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diviner<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Forewarned is fore-armed, and Divination is all about forewarning. If you\n\tever walk into a room without knowing who and what is inside it, you aren&#8217;t\n\tcasting enough Divinations. The biggest problem with relying heavily on\n\tDivinations is that they can quickly eat your spell slots, often with little\n\ttangible effect. Fortunately, Expert Divination dramatically reduces the cost\n\tof casting divination spells. Portent provides a wonderful mechanic to\n\tinfluence rolls, allowing you alter the outcome of critical rolls in\n\tsignificant and powerful ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As great as Portent is, if you plan to play a Diviner, you and your DM need\n\tto be prepared to handle divinations and how they work. The DM may be forced\n\tto predict the future for you, to offer cryptic hints, or to improvise the\n\tidle activities of creatures who are generally just sitting in a room waiting\n\tfor your party to come fight them. You need to remember to use your Divination\n\tspells to mitigate risk and to solve problems that can&#8217;t be solved using\n\tFireball and the like. But, if you put in the work, the Diviner Wizard will\n\treward you for your efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Divination Savant<\/span>: Free spells in your\n\t\tspellbook. Always nice, but not massively impactful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Portent<\/span>: Roll high? Save it for important\n\t\tsaving throws or attacks. Roll low? Use it to replace an enemy attack roll\n\t\tor an enemy saving throw. There is no way for this to be bad unless you\n\t\tforget to use it. Portent is School of Divination&#8217;s signature trait, and\n\t\tmastering it will have a massive impact on your game.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Divination<\/span>: This dramatically\n\t\texpands the number of spells you can cast in a day. If you ever think &#8220;is it\n\t\tworth a spell slot to cast a Divination right now?&#8221;, the answer should\n\t\talways be &#8220;yes&#8221;. Throw them around like confetti. You can even use Mind\n\t\tSpike (the only damage-dealing divination spell in the game) to get big\n\t\tpiles of single-target damage at minimal cost whenever you might normally\n\t\tuse a cantrip.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><strong>The Third Eye<\/strong>: The wording is odd. You gain the ability\n\t\tlisted in the bullet until your next rest. For example: the &#8220;See\n\t\tInvisibility&#8221; option gives you the ability to cast See Invisibility without\n\t\tspending a spell slot, but you still need to actually do so.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Darkvision<\/span>: Darkvision isn&#8217;t a\n\t\t\t\tDivination, so this is a good way to get it for free if you don&#8217;t get it\n\t\t\t\tfrom your race, an item, or an ally who can cast Darkvision.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Greater Comprehension<\/span>: Cast Comprehend\n\t\t\t\tLanguages as a Ritual.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span>: See Invisibility is\n\t\t\t\tessentially. It has a 1-hour duration, but you can cast it without\n\t\t\t\tspending a spell slot, so you can freely refresh the duration whenever\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re out of combat.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Portent<\/span>: Not a game changer, but\n\t\tPortent is fantastic, and this makes it 50% more powerful.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evoker\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Evoker<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Evocation is the blunt hammer of magic, and the Evoker Wizard swings it\n\tbetter than anyone. It&#8217;s rarely subtle or elegant, and it&#8217;s often imprecise.\n\tBut, hey, when 90% of problems are nails, the hammer is the king of tools. The\n\tEvoker is a great option for players who are new to spellcasters because many\n\tof the Evoker&#8217;s best spells are mechanically simple, and the subclass makes it\n\textremely reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Evocation Savant<\/span>: Free spells in your\n\t\tspellbook. Always nice, but not massively impactful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Potent Cantrip<\/span>: Fantastically reliable.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This feature is notably not limited to Wizard cantrips, in case you\n\t\t\thappen to have something from another class, a feat, or a Species\n\t\t\ttrait.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sculpt Spells<\/span>: Friendly fire happens\n\t\tinevitably when you have an Evoker in the party. This goes a long way to cut\n\t\tdown on the problem, and you should abuse the fact that your allies are\n\t\tfunctionally immune to your spells wherever possible.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>There&#8217;s some weird nuance here that&#8217;s easy to overlook: While this is\n\t\t\tclearly intended to protect allies from Burning Hands, Fireball, and other\n\t\t\tsuch AOE damage options, the protection doesn&#8217;t end after the initial\n\t\t\teffect of the spell. Creatures are protected from the spell&#8217;s effects for\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s full duration.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This means that your allies can comfortably walk around in the areas of\n\t\t\tspells like Sickening Radiance, potentially dragging enemies about inside\n\t\t\tthe area to force them to take damage. You could even cast Otiluke&#8217;s\n\t\t\tFreezing Sphere, designate your allies as protected by Sculpt Spells, then\n\t\t\tsend them off with pockets full of frozen spheres to smash at their feet\n\t\t\tin a room full of enemies. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think this was intended when\n\t\t\tWotC wrote School of Evocation. Much like Empowered Evocation, I think\n\t\t\tthat they meant for Sculpt Spells only to apply to the initial effects.\n\t\t\tBut it&#8217;s been 5+ years and we haven&#8217;t gotten errata or tweets from Jeremy\n\t\t\tCrawford, so it appears that Sculpt Spells works as I&#8217;ve described it\n\t\t\tuntil someone tells us otherwise.<\/p\n\t\t><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Empowered Evocation<\/span>: This is a\n\t\tconsiderable damage boost. However, it only applies to one damage roll, so\n\t\tany spell that rolls damage multiple times (e.g. Magic Missile) won&#8217;t\n\t\tbenefit from this repeatedly. Instead, focus on multi-target instantaneous\n\t\tdamage spells like Acid Splash and Chain Lightning.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Overchannel<\/span>: This is a great way to get\n\t\tmore mileage out of reliable lower-level spells like Magic Missile and\n\t\tFireball at a level where your higher-level spells and spell slots would\n\t\tgenerally eclipse them. Just be sure to have a Cleric handy when you start\n\t\tintentionally taking damage.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this only applies on the turn that you cast the spell, it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tsignificantly benefit spells that deal ongoing damage like Wall of Fire or\n\t\t\tSickening Radiance.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusionist\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusionist<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Illusion is the most complex, open-ended, and flexible school of magic. It is\n\tlimited only by your and your DM&#8217;s imaginations. A clever player and patient\n\tDM willing to play along can make the Illusionist an unstoppable creative\n\tforce. However, subjective interpretations of NPC behavior can also make the\n\tIllusionist a frustrating, ineffective nightmare. If you plan to play an\n\tIllusionist, have a thorough discussion with your DM about how they want to\n\thandle illusions before you commit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/illusionist\/\">Illusionist Wizard Subclass Guide<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusion Savant<\/span>: Free spells in your\n\t\tspellbook. Always nice, but not massively impactful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Illusions<\/span>: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/practical-guide-to-illusions\/\">Minor Illusion<\/a> can be\n\t\tincredibly powerful in the hands of a smart caster, and adding both effects\n\t\ton one casting makes it considerably more useful. Creating an illusion of a\n\t\tpot lying on the floor accompanied by the sound of a pot falling, or an\n\t\tillusion of a small animal accompanied by appropriate sounds (I&#8217;m fond of\n\t\tchickens for this purpose) can be excellent distractions, and creatures\n\t\tdon&#8217;t get a save or a skill check to disbelieve the illusion until they\n\t\tspend an Action to do so.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While it&#8217;s primarily a non-combat utility, the ability to cast Minor\n\t\t\tIllusion as a Bonus Action makes it an exciting tool in combat, too.\n\t\t\tCreating visual cover to break lines of sight can have a huge impact.\n\t\t\tDepending on how your DM handles illusions, you may be able to hide\n\t\t\tyourself inside an object like a crate or a barrel to make yourself\n\t\t\tuntargetable.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Don&#8217;t overlook the range increase, either. 60 feet of additional range\n\t\t\tmeans that you can do illusory nonsense from a safe distance, such as\n\t\t\tleading enemies far away from you and your party in order to avoid violent\n\t\t\tencounters.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Phantasmal Creatures<\/span>: This is\n\t\tcomplicated.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Changing the spells&#8217; school to Illusion has no mechanical benefit on its\n\t\t\town, but remember that Improved Illusions increases the range of your\n\t\t\tIllusion spells by 60 feet, allowing you to cast these spells from up to\n\t\t\t150 feet away.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Two free summon spells is pretty nice. Summon Beast and Summon Fey both\n\t\t\toffer some appealing options, and upcasting summon spells to boost their\n\t\t\tstats and number of attacks keep them relevant for your whole career.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The two free castings (one for each summon) are a nice convenience,\n\t\t\tgiving you low-cost canon fodder that can absorb a few hits that might\n\t\t\totherwise target you and your allies. The summons won&#8217;t last long in\n\t\t\tcombat with half hit points, but both spells have a 1-hour duration, so\n\t\t\tyou can pre-cast them and wander around outside of combat with a pet ready\n\t\t\tto go. Even as you gain levels and a level 2 or level 3 summon stops being\n\t\t\ta threat, they can still be useful as a scout or as a distraction.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Self<\/span>: Infallibly ignore one\n\t\tattack against you for free, once per Short or Long Rest. Very good for a\n\t\tsquishy Wizard. Combined with other defensive measures like hiding and using\n\t\tcover, you may even be able to forgo Shield, especially since you can use\n\t\tthis again at the cost of a level 2 spell slot.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Illusory Reality<\/span>: This turns your\n\t\tillusions into creation spells, which means that any tool that you can\n\t\timagine is available for the low cost of casting Silent Image. Sadly,\n\t\tMalleable Illusions likely doesn&#8217;t let you change the object which you&#8217;ve\n\t\tchosen to make real because Illusory Reality only applies when you cast the\n\t\tspell.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can&#8217;t directly harm creatures with Illusory Reality, but the rules\n\t\t\tsay nothing about impeding, restraining, blocking, or even dropping them.\n\t\t\tThrow up a Silent Image to create a wall of stone between you and your\n\t\t\tfoes, or to put a cage around them. Create an illusory bridge with a\n\t\t\tconvenient trap door (or just time it so that they&#8217;re on the bridge when\n\t\t\tthe 1-minute duration expires) and drop your enemies into a pit.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Every Wizard subclass in the 2024 Player&#8217;s Handbook is themed around a specific school of magic, seeking to emphasize and improve spells in that school.
