Now you too can decide that you need an extra-dimensional pocket to short rest in. This only isn\u2019t rated higher because Disguise Self and Fear care about your spell save DC which won\u2019t be as good as a dedicated caster.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-Level<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-Level<\/span>: A fantastic way to rest\n\t\t\t\tsafely, and normally exclusive to artificers and wizards. But rangers get very few\n\t\t\t\tspell slots, and spending one to take a Short Rest safely is a high cost\n\t\t\t\tfor the Ranger. Do your best to avoid needing this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">9th-Level<\/span>: It&#8217;s unlikely that you\n\t\t\t\thave sufficient Wisdom to make any spell which allows a saving throw\n\t\t\t\treliable, so you&#8217;ll want to save this for encounters with numerous weak\n\t\t\t\tfoes.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th-Level<\/span>: Amazing on any stealthy\n\t\t\t\tcharacter. Ideally you&#8217;ll never need this because you can rely on Umbral\n\t\t\t\tSight, but if your enemies pull out a torch you can cast Greater\n\t\t\t\tInvisibility and remain unseen.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th-Level<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\t\t\thelpful when your party needs to go somewhere where the locals are\n\t\t\t\tunfriendly.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dread Ambusher<\/span>: The first round of combat\n\t\tis the most important. As a reminder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dmg\/dungeon-masters-workshop#Step11Damage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">combat is only expected to last 3 rounds on average<\/a>. This means that, roughly 1\/3rd of the time, you get extra extra attack and an additional d8 damage on top. That&#8217;s already very good, but you also get a substantial bonus to initiative to try and take that bonus damage and remove something from the fight before it gets to act.\n<p>The bonus speed will help you get into position,\n\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re built for melee, but the real bonus is the extra\n\t\tattack. If you can get Hunter&#8217;s Mark running before initiative is rolled,\n\t\tyou absolutely should so that your first turn can be a big pile of\n\t\tdamage.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Umbral Sight<\/span>: Getting free Darkvision is\n\t\tfantastic on its own, but invisibility to Darkvision is absolutely crazy.\n\t\tMost creatures that will ambush you using Darkvision won&#8217;t have a light\n\t\tsource in their possession, so you functionally have Improved Invisibility.\n\t\tEven if an enemy finds a light source, if you extinguish it you&#8217;re right\n\t\tback to invisibly murdering them.\n<p>Invisibility at this level normally comes at great cost: a highest-level spell slot, Concentration, and a prohibition against doing nearly anything aggressive with it. This has none of those costs, it just only applies when something is only able to see you because of its Darkvision. This means that we should be trying to be in darkness in combat as much as is physically possible. Work to make sure that everyone else in your party can function without light as well so that enemies are relying on Darkvision wherever possible.<\/p>\n<p>While it is incredible, it does have its limitations. The feature specifies that it only works in darkness. That means that it doesn&#8217;t work if there&#8217;s dim light (candles, etc.). It must be actual darkness. It also doesn&#8217;t work on things that can perceive you because of truesight, tremorsense, blindsight, etc. Only Darkvision. With that said, in the right conditions, this is one of the best class features in the game.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iron Mind<\/span>: Additional saving throw\n\t\tproficiencies are always welcome, especially when they&#8217;re for a commonly targeted save.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stalker&#8217;s Flurry<\/span>: Not quite as powerful as\n\t\tan additional attack, but still extremely helpful. The fundamental math of\n\t\t5e assumes that a player following the attack vs. AC progression will hit\n\t\twith attacks roughly 65% of the time against CR-appropriate foes. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tmaking two attacks per turn, you have a roughly 58% chance to miss with at\n\t\tleast one attack, so you&#8217;ll benefit from Stalker&#8217;s Flurry consistently.\n<p>Unfortunately, the wording on Dread Ambusher means that, if the extra attack from the feature misses you do miss out on the d8 damage bump even if the attack Flurry grants you off of it connects, but even so we\u2019re not going to sneeze at free attacks.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadowy Dodge<\/span>: It only works once per\n\t\tround because it consumes your Reaction, but that&#8217;s often plenty. The\n\t\tGloom Stalker thrives on being unseen, so this is powerful insurance if your\n\t\tenemies manage to attack while you&#8217;re not in total darkness and also not\n\t\trunning Improved Invisibility.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gloom-stalker-ability-scores\">Gloom Stalker Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Gloom Stalkers have similar ability score needs to other rangers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re trying to dual wield and\n\tunwilling to use finesse weapons, dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: This is the primary stat for the class\n\tas it powers our attacks and main skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: More hit points are good on\n\teverything, but this build works well at range so don&#8217;t feel the need to pump\n\tit too high.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: This not only powers our spells but a\n\tclass feature or two and other good Scout skills.

It turns out the answer is &#8220;<em>really<\/em> hard.&#8221; If\n\tyou dip into rogue, fighter, and monk, you can end up with a character that\n\tdeals over 400 expected damage in the first turn, accounting for accuracy. If\n\tyou can get someone to Haste you, that number goes up to over 450. This costs\n\tyou just 1 ki point and your Action Surge. I have been informed that this is\n\tenough to kill a monster of a CR appropriate to the character before it gets a\n\tchance to act.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A two-level dip in Fighter gets us Action Surge. The wording on Dread Ambusher means that it will trigger again if you happen to take the Attack action again on your first turn. This means that you should always use Action Surge on the first turn. If you choose to keep going in Fighter, many flavors will add nice benefits. Battle Master&#8217;s Precise Strike can help you land shots which you take the Sharpshooter penalty on, while Ambush can potentially turn a disastrous initiative roll into something that beats out your target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, if your build is centered around doing a bunch of damage in the first round of combat, Gloom Stalker synergizes very well with Assassin Rogue. Taking all of those many dice and turning them into guaranteed crits is pretty great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to do this in melee rather than with a crossbow, adding in Monk\n\t(and specifically Way of Shadow monk) is also a really good synergy. Spending\n\t2 ki for the Darkness spell is an awesome way to make it so things can&#8217;t see\n\tyou.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\u2026 if you&#8217;re paying attention, you&#8217;ll notice that the Darkness I just\n\ttalked about is magical and doesn&#8217;t let your darkvision shine.
