Spellstrike and Spell Combat allow the magus to deliver touch attach spells alongside normal attacks, which can make for some very impressive damage output. The Magus depends on intelligence and gets all knowledge skills, so a Magus can serve as the party&#8217;s librarian.

You get a magical, sentient blade with some weird unknown purpose, and you&#8217;re stuck with it for life. The blade can be very useful, and the free enhancement bonus will save you a lot of money. Other than giving up the possibility of a familiar, the Bladebound archetype is free. It provides a large number of useful abilities which are frequently more useful for the Magus than what a familiar could offer. And, again, it doesn&#8217;t cost anything but the <em>option<\/em> to have a familiar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Black Blade<\/span> (Ex): The Black Blade is very\n\tpowerful. While it cuts your arcane pool from 1\/2 level to 1\/3 level, the\n\tblade gradually develops its own arcane pool which the Magus can use to fuel\n\tthe blade&#8217;s abilities, or the Magus can drain points from the blade&#8217;s pool to\n\tfill his own. In addition, the blade gets an enhancement bonus for free which\n\tprogresses as you level.<\/p>\n<p>There is\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/threads\/rzs2nq5o&amp;page=2?Black-Blade-enhancement-limitation\">some debate<\/a>\n\tabout wether or not you can permanently enhance the Black Blade, but because\n\tthe text does not specify that you can, I would assume that you can&#8217;t. Similar\n\tabilities which provide items (Arcane Bond) explicitly state that you can\n\tenhance the weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alertness<\/span> (Ex): Bonuses to Perception are\n\tgreat, though you probably don&#8217;t have spectacular wisdom, and Perception isn&#8217;t\n\ta class skill.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Black Blade Strike<\/span> (Sp): This could be\n\tnice at high level when the bonus is better than +1 and you get multiple\n\tattacks, but at low levels its going to be pitiful and expensive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Telepathy<\/span> (Su): Until you reach about level\n\t10, you are constantly communicating with a stupid, socially inept piece of\n\tmetal. At high levels you are constantly communicating with a\n\thyper-intelligent piece of metal that probably finds you to be a ridiculous\n\tsack of meat. I imagine that these conversations will be hilarious.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unbreakable<\/span> (Ex): Good for killing rust\n\tmonsters, but very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Energy Attunement<\/span> (Su): Using energy damage\n\tinstead of weapon damage is a fantastic way to bypass DR. I&#8217;m not sure why\n\tacid damage is omitted, but you have plenty of options. Force damage\n\tcompletely removes the need for Ghost Touch when fighting incorporeal\n\tenemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Teleport Blade<\/span> (Sp): Situational, but nice\n\tto have.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Transfer Arcana<\/span> (Su): You have many more\n\tuses for arcane pool points than you Black Blade, so sometimes it&#8217;s nice to\n\tmake the blade share. Keep in mind that the blade will never have an arcane\n\tpool bigger than 5.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell Defense<\/span> (Sp): The spell resistance is\n\tvery small, and spellcasters of your level will have to roll at most a 5 to\n\tbypass your SR. At this level, many spellcasters will have Spell\n\tPenetration.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Life Drinker<\/span> (Su): Finally a way to charge\n\tyour arcane pool on an ongoing basis! If you haven&#8217;t traded in Spell Recall,\n\tyou can use this to cast a theoretically infinite number of spells in a\n\tday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Any<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"eldritch-scion\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\">Eldritch Scion<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eldritch Scion is to the Magus what the Sorcerer is to the Wizard. Instead of depending on Intelligence, the Eldritch Scion depends on Charisma and casts spells spontaneously. Because spontaneous casters increase the spellcasting time when using metamagic, Eldritch Scions are considerably worse at Spell Combat and Spellstrike, and the introduction of the Eldritch Pool hugely handicaps the Eldritch Scion because it adds another limitation on how much the Magus can do in a given day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spells<\/span>: Because you can&#8217;t change your\n\tdaily spell list as easily as a normal Magus, you lose quite a bit of\n\tversatility, but make up for it with additional spells per day. Because the\n\tMagus is less of a utility caster than a Wizard, this may be a good trade\n\tbecause it allows the Magus to output more spell damage per day, and most Magi\n\twill depend primarily on a small subset of the Magus spell list (Shocking\n\tGrasp, Vampiric Touch, Fly, etc.). However, because you are a spontaneous\n\tcaster, casting metamagic spells (like Intensified Shocking Grasp) takes a\n\tfull round action, which means that you can&#8217;t use them with Spell\n\tCombat\/Spellstrike.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline<\/span>: Bloodrager bloodlines provide a\n\tlot of excellent options including spells and bonus feats.

You give up Spell Recall, which isn&#8217;t a huge loss, and you get access to Witch Hexes. This can add some very cool abilities to the Magus which go beyond tehir weapons and spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Magus<\/span> (Su): May witch hexes are\n\tfantastic.

While many of these abilities are great by themselves, the archetype as a whole doesn&#8217;t really add anything to the Magus. If you want to focus on one specific cool weapon, Bladebound is much more interesting and much more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Exotic\n\tweapons are very rarely notably better than Martial weapons, and losing armor\n\treally hurts the Magus. Be sure to pick up a suit of Haramaki to compensate\n\tfor your lack of armor. For weapons, a Katana is likely your bets choice for\n\tthe critical threat range. You still get Spell Combat, so you still want to\n\tkeep a hand free to cast spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Diminished Spellcasting<\/span>: Magus already get a\n\tvery small number of spells. Giving up more really hurts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Canny Defense<\/span> (Ex): Adding your\n\tintelligence to AC is great for an intelligence-based class, but it&#8217;s much\n\tcheaper to enchant a chain shirt than it is to enhance your intelligence. Make\n\tsure to get a suit of Haramaki, or your AC is going to be garbage. You may\n\talso want to commit spells to your AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Focus<\/span> (Ex): This certainly doesn&#8217;t\n\thurt to have.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Perfect Strike<\/span> (Ex): You will get much better\n\tdamage by spending that point to add Flaming to your weapon for a minute.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter Training<\/span> (Ex): This is great for\n\tfeats like Weapon Focus\/Specialization.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Iaijutsu<\/span> (Ex): Initiative bonuses are\n\tfantastic, and making attacks of opportunity while flat-footed is a really\n\tcool trick.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Critical Perfection<\/span> (Ex): The bonus is\n\tnice, but critical hit builds are best when two-weapong fighting, which isn&#8217;t\n\ta thing that the Magus does well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Superior Reflexes<\/span> (Ex): Nice, but the Magus\n\tis hardly a Defender.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iaijutsu Focus<\/span> (Ex): You get one Standard\n\tAction in a surprise round, so trading it down to a swift to draw a weapon is\n\tno better than trading it down to a move action. Adding your intelligence to\n\tdamage is a nice touch, but it won&#8217;t make much difference.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Iaijutsu Master<\/span> (Ex): Ruin every surprise\n\tparty anyone ever throws for you. Also, go first in basically every combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): This ability is\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor and Weapon Proficiency, Spellcasting, Magus Arcana<br>(9th), Spell Recall, Knowledge Pool, Medium Armor, Improved Spell Recall,<br>Heavy Armor, Greater Spell Access, True Magus<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Bladebound, Spellblade<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"myrmidarch\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/magus.html#myrmidarch-(archetype)\">Myrmidarch<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Arcane Archer <em>wishes<\/em> it was as cool as the Myrmidarch. The Myrmidarch gives up a big chunk of the Magus&#8217; spellcasting ability to get some fighter abilities, and since its limited to ranged touch spells with Ranged Spellstrike you won&#8217;t get as much damage output as a melee magus, but the Magus gets a lot of interesting utility and debuff options from various splat books which most magi can&#8217;t use as effectively. In effect, this makes the Myrmidarch a bit like a base class version of the Arcane Archer, with the ability to enhance their weapon and cast spells through it, but also with decent ability to fight without spells. If you want to play an Arcane Archer, I would recommend the Myrmidarch instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Diminished Spellcasting<\/span>: Magus already get a\n\tvery small number of spells. Giving up more really hurts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranged Spellstrike<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s important to\n\tnote that you can only use <em>ranged<\/em> touch attack spells here. Going\n\tfrom the Magus&#8217; original spell list in Ultimate Magic that doesn&#8217;t give you a\n\tton of options for spells which you can cast repeatedly like a normal magus\n\tuses Shocking Grasp. Advanced Race Guide adds mudball, touch of combustion,\n\tand web bolt as 1st-level options, so you&#8217;ll have some great utility options\n\tbut your damage will likely lage behind a melee magus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Training<\/span> (Ex): This is really great\n\tfor the Magus due to their 2\/3 BAB, and the additional damage really helps to\n\tcompensate when you can&#8217;t use Spell Combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighter Training<\/span> (Ex): This is great for\n\tfeats like Weapon Focus\/Specialization, and for things like Point Blank Master\n\tif you choose to focus on archery.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Training<\/span> (Ex): improved and Greater\n\tspell comba are no great loss, and Armor Training is really great for the\n\tMagus. The improved max dex bonus allows you to depend on high dexterity at\n\tlow levels, and continue to benefit from it at high levels as you gain access\n\tto better armor. This also allows you to use heavier armor while still\n\tremaining an effective archer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Mastery<\/span> (Ex): 5\/- is a lot of DR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Spellcasting, Magus Arcana (6th, 12th, 18th), Spell Recall, Knowledge Pool, Improved Spell Combat, Improved Spell Recall, Greater Spell Combat, True Magus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Bladebound, Spellblade, Staff Magus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"skirnir\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/magus.html#skirnir-(archetype)\">Skirnir<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Skirnir is a shield build for the Magus. Typically shield builds on Strikers involve two-weapon fighting, but the Magus needs to keep a hand free to cast spells. You can either use a buckler and a weapon, or you can use a heavy spiked shield and a spiked gauntlet. The difference in AC is important for a lightly armored character like a Magus, and you can&#8217;t bash with a buckler, so the heavy shield is likely your best bet. Because your damage output depends on your spells and the use of Spell Combat (which you get at level 8), the Skirnir will have slightly better AC, but will have problems dealing damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Skirnir is a great concept, but the execution us poor. Carrying a shield improves the Magus&#8217; AC, which is great, but the Skirnir completely handicaps the Magus&#8217; damage output, which essentially makes the Magus a bad wizard with mediocre AC. If you really want a shield on a Magus, a mithral buckler costs 1165 GP and won&#8217;t interfere with any Magus abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Diminished Spellcasting<\/span>: Magus already get a\n\tvery small number of spells. Giving up more really hurts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Bond<\/span> (Su): Arcane Bond is a great\n\tability, and the additional spell slot helps to compensate for your Diminished\n\tSpellcasting. A shield is a weird choice, and it costs half as much to enchant\n\tas a weapon, so the ability to enchant it without a feat isn&#8217;t as helpful as\n\tit normally is..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Pool<\/span>: You can enhance a weapon and\n\ta shield at the same time. This can become expensive if you let it, so be\n\tcareful to manage your Arcane Pool points.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">animated<\/span>: 2 points. Costly, but it frees\n\t\tyour other hand for casting spells or for using a weapon two-handed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">arrow catching<\/span>: 1 points. Awful, even in\n\t\tthe rare situations where it would be useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">arrow deflection<\/span>: 2 points. A DC 20 reflex\n\t\tsave is very steep for a class without a high base reflex save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">bashing<\/span>: 1 points. Useful at low levels\n\t\tbefore you can permanently enhance the shield. It&#8217;s somewhat confusing how\n\t\tthis works with Spiked Shield because you enhance the spikes as a weapon,\n\t\tand Bashing is an Armor property.\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/threads\/rzs2kls2?Shield-of-Bashing-with-Shield-spikes-still#upcv5748gbiig8ev\">This thread<\/a>\n\t\thas some isnight on the designers&#8217; intent, but there isn&#8217;t an official\n\t\truling.

Nice\n\t\tif you ever fight a rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">reflecting<\/span>: 5 points.

Too\n\t\tcostly for how low the spell resistance is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sorcerous Shield<\/span> (Ex): The Magus is a light\n\tarmor melee class, which is always a dangerous concept. Adding the ability to\n\tuse shields really helps to compensate for the Magus&#8217; low AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellstrike<\/span> (Su): Cool, and makes sense for\n\tthe Archetype.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Pool<\/span> (Ex): There are much better\n\tways to improve your Concentration checks, there are much better uses of your\n\tArcane Pool points, and Pool Strike is terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellshield<\/span> (Su): Put your biggest, scariest\n\tdamage spell in your shield a few days ahead of time to help compensate for\n\tyour Diminished Spellcasting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shielded Spell Combat<\/span> (Su): If you used a\n\tbuckler, you can&#8217;t bash. If you use Spell Combat to deal damage, you lose your\n\tshield bonus to AC, so you might as well not have a shield. This ability\n\tdoesn&#8217;t really become useful until level 19.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spellshield<\/span> (Su): Auto-hit with\n\tVampiric Strike to recover the hit points which you just lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Spellcasting, Arcane Pool, Spell Combat, Spellstrike, Spell Recall, Knowledge Pool, Improved Spell Combat, Greater Spell Combat, Counterstrike, Greater Spell Access<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Bladebound, Staff Magus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"soul-forger\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/magus.html#soul-forger-(archetype)\">Soul Forger<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Soul Forger trades in a considerable amount of the Magus&#8217;s spellcasting ability for an Arcane Bond weapon and some abilities to craft and repair items.

Staff Weapon, the archetype&#8217;s 10th level ability, is absolutely fantastic, and really adds a lot of flair to archetype at high levels where magic staves are available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.5 players will want to note that staves in Pathfinder have only 10 charges, but can be recharged, making them a permanent resource instead of an over-priced wand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: All you need\n\tis a long stick and a chain shirt.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quarterstaff Master<\/span> (Ex): Skipping the\n\tprerequisites on this is nice, and using the staff one-handed allows you to\n\tuse Spell Combat with it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quarterstaff Defense<\/span> (Ex): This makes the\n\tenhancement bonus on your staff just as important defensively as offensively.\n\tThe free +3 bonus at level 13 is a really nice boost, and doesn&#8217;t require you\n\tto change armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Staff Weapon<\/span> (Su): You no longer need to\n\tspend money to enhance magic staves as weapons, and you can spend your extra\n\tpoints at the end of the day to recharge your favorite staff much more quickly\n\tthan other characters who are typically limited to recharging one charge per\n\tday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Weapon Proficiency, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor, Fighter Training<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Bladebound, Eldritch Scion, Hexcrafter, Myrmidarch, Skirnir, Soul Forger, Spellblade<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Magus is an arcane Striker, and primarily functions in melee combat. Spellstrike and Spell Combat allow the magus to deliver touch attach spells alongside normal attacks, which can make for some very impressive damage output. The Magus depends on intelligence and gets all knowledge skills, so a Magus can serve as the party&#8217;s librarian. Magus archetypes change the feel and play style of Magi, but don&#8217;t change their role in the party. Archetypes Bladebound The Black Blade is a really cool concept.
