Most of the spells are\n\ttaken from the Druid&#8217;s spell list, though the Ranger gets several unique\n\toptions like Hunter&#8217;s Mark, and in many cases spells shared with the druid are\n\tthe Ranger&#8217;s worst options while spells unique to the Ranger are their best\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Ranger&#8217;s spell selection is also limited heavily by WotC&#8217;s concepts about\n\twhat a ranger is and where they go on adventures.

Note that\n\t\tyou can use this at range, so archery builds can ensnare a target, then\n\t\teither wear them down or shift their attention to other foes. It&#8217;s a\n\t\tStrength save, which means that most spellcasters and many agile enemies\n\t\twill have trouble with it, but big melee brutes will probably resist it.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s also an excellent counter to flying enemies because being restrained\n\t\tcauses creatures which fly nonmagically to fall, which means that if you\n\t\tshoot a griffon or something it&#8217;s going to take a pile of falling damage.\n\t\tAfter the initial save, it takes an Action and and a Strength check (not a\n\t\tsave) to escape, and the target takes damage every round so they&#8217;ll want to\n\t\tescape quickly. The damage scales linearly with spell level, so this remains\n\t\ta powerful and efficient use of a spell slot throughout your career.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Entangle<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): A great area\n\t\tcontrol spell at any level. Strength saving throws tend to be low for any\n\t\tcreature that isn&#8217;t a gigantic Strength-based brute, so it&#8217;s easy to\n\t\trestrain even high-level enemies. However, it requires Concentration so you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t easily combine it with things like Hunter&#8217;s Mark.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fog Cloud<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An excellent way to\n\t\tcover your escape, but you can&#8217;t see through the fog any better than anyone\n\t\telse, so don&#8217;t expect to fight in this without some other advantage most of\n\t\tthe time. Fog Cloud can be a way to negate Advantage if your enemies have\n\t\tthe upper hand, so if you&#8217;re facing enemies who are invisible, hidden, or\n\t\thave some other source of Advantage, Fog Cloud can take that away,\n\t\teffectively leveling the playing field so that no one can see each other.\n\t\tSuch situations are rare, but it&#8217;s nice to know that there&#8217;s a\n\t\tcountermeasure when those situations do arise.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Goodberry<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An excellent resource,\n\t\tboth in terms of healing and utility. A Druid can usually spare a prepared\n\t\tspell so that they can dump spells into Goodberry at the end of the day, but\n\t\tthat may be harder for a Ranger since you get such a small number of spells\n\t\tknown. Still, dumping your spell slots into a pile of goodberries the day\n\t\tbefore you leave on an adventure will give you a helpful pad of hit points\n\t\tthat you can quickly use to heal after combat without resorting to a short\n\t\trest.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hail of Thorns<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This shouldn&#8217;t be a\n\t\tgo-to option, but it&#8217;s a nice way to handle tightly-packed groups of weak\n\t\tfoes. Just don&#8217;t rely on it too heavily, as it will eat your spell slots\n\t\tquickly without a big payoff.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter&#8217;s Mark<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The Ranger&#8217;s bread and\n\t\tbutter. Many rangers will spend the bulk of their time using Concentration\n\t\ton Hunter&#8217;s Mark while they focus fire upon single foes before switching to\n\t\tthe next foe. The 1-hour duration (more if you upcast the spell) means that\n\t\tyou can get a ton of mileage out of one spell slot, but unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tfighting at Range you&#8217;ll need to constantly worry about making saves to\n\t\tmaintain Concentration.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Rules supplements beyond the Player&#8217;s Handbook have introduced a number\n\t\t\tof alternatives to Hunter&#8217;s Mark. The Favored Foe Optional Class Feature\n\t\t\tis basically a weakened version of Hunter&#8217;s Mark with its own usage pool\n\t\t\tthat won&#8217;t eat your spell slots, and spells like Elemental Weapon can\n\t\t\tprovide a similar damage boost. Hunter&#8217;s Mark remains a staple combat\n\t\t\toption for the Ranger, but it&#8217;s no longer the single defining means for\n\t\t\tthe Ranger to be a meaningful threat in combat.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Jump<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too situational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Longstrider<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An extra 10 ft. of\n\t\tmovement is always nice, and the 1-hour duration means that you can enjoy it\n\t\tfor a long time on one spell slot.

Of\n\t\tcourse, Flame Arrows costs an Action to cast (compared to a Bonus Action for\n\t\tHunter&#8217;s Mark), so the 1-hour duration makes it a bit easier to set up\n\t\tbefore you go into combat if you still insist on wasting a spell slot on\n\t\tit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Arrow<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Basically a better\n\t\tversion of Hail of Thorns, but the damage is rarely good enough to justify\n\t\tthe spell slot so save this for when you have a big group of enemies in a\n\t\tsmall area. 5 or more seems like a good number.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Meld into Stone<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Very\n\t\tsituational.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Nondetection<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Good, but not totally\n\t\tessential.

However, most\n\t\tenemies aren&#8217;t spellcasters and won&#8217;t have access to those divination\n\t\toptions, so you can&#8217;t justify casting this every day.

Outside of\n\t\tnormal adventuring activities, the ability to enrich land to double crop\n\t\tyields is very useful. But DnD is a game primarily about adventuring, and\n\t\tthe option to make an area of plants overgrown is the more important option\n\t\tfor most adventurers. In most cases, Entangle will work fine if you just\n\t\tneed to slow your enemies down, but Plant Growth doesn&#8217;t expire, so those\n\t\tplants remain difficult to walk through until someone clears the plants\n\t\t(which may requires hours of chopping and\/or burning). The spell also\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t specify that the plants grow along the ground or sufaces, so RAW it\n\t\tcan create a sphere of plants, creating super-difficult terrain extending\n\t\t100 feet into the air, potentially engulfing flying enemies.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The math on Plant Growth&#8217;s speed reduction is impressive. Since most\n\t\t\tcreatures have a speed of around 30 feet, moving at 1\/4 speed means that\n\t\t\tthey can move one 5-foot square and be left with 10 feet of movement that\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t get them anywhere (unless they dash or something). Jeremy Crawford\n\t\t\thas clarified that Plant Growth\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/811643729966530560\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn&#8217;t create difficult terrain<\/a\n\t\t\t>, so it&#8217;s possible that difficult terrain would stack with Plant Growth,\n\t\t\tbut I personally think that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s intended to work.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Plant Growth specifies that &#8220;a creature moving through the area must\n\t\t\tspend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot&#8221; while the difficult terrain\n\t\t\trule specifies that &#8220;moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of\n\t\t\tspeed&#8221;, and since those two statements conflict I think you&#8217;re intended to\n\t\t\tuse whichever effect is greater rather than stacking them or multiplying\n\t\t\tthem or something.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While it&#8217;s not discussed in the text of the spell, it seems likely that\n\t\t\tPlant Growth would also impede vision. If you turn a nicely-tended hedge\n\t\t\tinto a 100-foot-radius hemisphere of super-difficult terrain, there&#8217;s\n\t\t\tclearly enough stuff in the way that seeing through it is difficult. This\n\t\t\twould necessarily mean that creatures inside the area would likely be\n\t\t\tconcealed to some degree, so don&#8217;t expect to drop Plant Growth on and\n\t\t\tenemy and then spend the next several turns spraying them with cantrips\n\t\t\tuntil they fall down.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Plant Growth&#8217;s problematic limitation is that it requires plants to be in\n\t\t\tthe area. However, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any restriction on how many or\n\t\t\thow large these plants must be (just that they must be &#8220;normal&#8221;, whatever\n\t\t\tthat means), and where there&#8217;s lack of clarity there&#8217;s room for\n\t\t\tshenanigans.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For example: you might carry around a potted plant and throw it into the\n\t\t\tarea to provide the necessary plant life to support the spell. Plants like\n\t\t\tmint or clover can fit into a small pot, and when you make them grow you\n\t\t\tget a pretty and pleasant-smelling field of super-difficult terrain. If\n\t\t\tyour DM scoffs at the idea of 100-foot-tall clover patches, consider\n\t\t\tcarrying a bonsai tree or some other plant which would normally be very\n\t\t\ttall (though a bonsai might not qualify as &#8220;normal&#8221; since we don&#8217;t know\n\t\t\twhat that word means here).<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection from Energy<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An absolutely crucial\n\t\tdefensive option, but hopefully by this level your party has some full\n\t\tspellcasters who can provide it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revivify<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Too good to\n\t\tforgo.

There is some nuance to the math because the extra attack means\n\t\t\tanother chance to score a critical hit, but the difference isn&#8217;t big\n\t\t\tenough to make Swift Quiver worth being a 5th-level spell when you can\n\t\t\tcast Hunter&#8217;s Mark as a 1st-level spell.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Magic weapons, feats, or class features which add additional damage will\n\t\t\tmake the math favor Swift Quiver more heavily, but I&#8217;m not sure how much\n\t\t\tyou would need to justify the difference in spell level between Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\t\tMark and Swift Quiver.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Now consider that same ranger with a longbow and without Crossbow Expert.\n\t\t\tFor that ranger, two extra attacks doubles their number of attacks for the\n\t\t\tturn, taking their damage output from 2d8+2d6+10 with Hunter&#8217;s Mark (avg.\n\t\t\t26) to 4d8+20 (avg. 38), a nearly 50% increase in damage output. We&#8217;re\n\t\t\tagain ignoring the possibility of critical hits, fighting style, magic\n\t\t\titems, etc. but any of those things tip the math further in favor of Swift\n\t\t\tQuiver.
