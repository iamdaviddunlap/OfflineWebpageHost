It has a single decision point which you can change every time you gain a barbarian level, which is great for players who might have trouble deciding, and all three options are reasonably good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Your roles in the party vary little from those typical to the Barbarian: Defender and Striker. Your choice of environment from the Desert, Sea, and Tundra options places some additional emphasis on a specific role. Desert lets you deal area fire damage in an aura around you, arguably giving you a splash of Blaster, but not enough damage to really fill the role. Sea&#8217;s single-target direct damage is good for a Striker. Tundra&#8217;s temporary hit points give you extra durability to serve as a Defender. The 14th-level Raging Storm feature puts all three options&#8217; focus squarely on Striker, but the lower-level subclass features still emphasize different playstyles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to change your Environment means that you can adapt your abilities to suit the needs of your party. However, you can only make this change once per level, and if your choice of Environment is problematic in an encounter you may be unable to make use of your subclass abilities. Storm Herald is also much more heavily dependent on your Bonus Action than most barbarian subclasses, so avoid two-weapon fighting and feats like Polearm Master where the primary benefit relies on your Bonus Action. The 14th-level subclass features also consume your Reaction, so options which rely on your Reaction may also be less appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Path of the Storm Herald Barbarian Build &#8211; Fireball Me in the Face<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

You can only change your environment once\n\t\tevery time you gain a level, so expect to be locked into your choice for\n\t\tseveral game sessions. Generally you&#8217;ll be happy with your choice for a long\n\t\ttime, but you might consider changing if your party composition changes, or\n\t\tif you get a new subclass ability that makes another option more appealing.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Desert<\/span>: Excellent for raw damage and\n\t\t\t\tfor handling crowds of enemies.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sea<\/span>: The worst of the three options,\n\t\t\t\tthough not necessarily bad. You definitely want this in an aquatic\n\t\t\t\tcampaign, but you might get better results from other options if you\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t need to breath underwater.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tundra<\/span>: The best defensive option.\n\t\t\t\tExcellent if your party already does plenty of damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Storm Aura<\/span>: Damage enemies or grant\n\t\ttemporary hit points to yourself and your allies. Only functions while\n\t\traging, but it makes your rage super cool.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Desert<\/span>: If you don&#8217;t have other melee\n\t\t\t\tallies, or if your party has trouble handling crowds of enemies, this is\n\t\t\t\ta good option. However, the damage is small and still consumes your\n\t\t\t\tBonus Action, so if you need to use your Bonus Action for something else\n\t\t\t\ton a turn don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re giving up a whole bunch of damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sea<\/span>: Single-target damage, and the\n\t\t\t\taverage damage isn&#8217;t much better than the damage from Desert, but it still\n\t\t\t\tallows a saving throw for half damage. If you have another melee ally who might get hurt\n\t\t\t\twhen you activate Desert, but you still want more damage output, this is\n\t\t\t\tfine.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tundra<\/span>: This can affect you and any\n\t\t\t\tnumber of allies in the 10-foot aura. Start every encounter within 10\n\t\t\t\tfeet of your allies and you&#8217;ll always go into combat with temporary hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints. The ability to renew them as a Bonus Action means that you can\n\t\t\t\tconsistently pad your own hit points while you&#8217;re up front taking\n\t\t\t\tdamage. On rounds where you&#8217;ve still got temporary hit points, you can\n\t\t\t\tuse your Bonus Action for something else, but don&#8217;t take that as a good\n\t\t\t\treason to consider two-weapon fighting or Polearm Master.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Storm Soul<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Desert<\/span>: Fire damage is one of the most\n\t\t\t\tcommon damage types.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sea<\/span>: Lightning damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tespecially common. This will generally only be useful in aquatic\n\t\t\t\tcampaigns.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tundra<\/span>: Cold damage isn&#8217;t as common\n\t\t\t\tas fire, and the weak version of Shape Water isn&#8217;t especially\n\t\t\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Shielding Storm<\/span>: This requires your\n\t\tallies to stay within your aura, which in some cases might put them in the\n\t\tway of effects they&#8217;re trying to resist, like breath weapons or fireballs.\n\t\tStill, it&#8217;s an occasionally useful option.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Raging Storm<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Desert<\/span>: A little bit of free damage\n\t\t\t\ton your Reaction.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sea<\/span>: Not your Bonus Action, but your\n\t\t\t\tReaction. You won&#8217;t be able to make opportunity attacks for the round,\n\t\t\t\tbut the rest of your attacks will be at Advantage against the prone\n\t\t\t\ttarget, and you can still use your Bonus Action for the active effect of\n\t\t\t\tStorm Aura. Of course, you could already use Reckless Attack to get\n\t\t\t\tAdvantage easily, and if you need a creature to be Prone you can use\n\t\t\t\tShove and get Advantage on the Strength (Athletics) check from Rage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tundra<\/span>: Keep an enemy from running\n\t\t\t\taway.

We&#8217;re going to lean into that by repeatedly standing in the middle of crowds of enemies, then asking our party&#8217;s spellcasters to drop area damage on top of us. This build pairs well with blaster casters like the Evocation Wizard, but we&#8217;re going to build ourselves to minimize area damage so that we can work alongside any Blaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll use the Primal Knowledge Optional Class Feature in this build. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/#optional-class-features\">Barbarian Class Guide<\/a> recommends allowing Instinctive Pounce for any subclass which doesn&#8217;t already have a complicated secondary effect when you Rage, and Storm Herald is one of those subclasses, so we&#8217;ll forgo Instinctive Pounce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll take the ability scores recommended in our Barbarian Guide, then put our +2 increase into Strength.

The spell save DC will be 13 + PB (assuming +5 ability modifier and no items boosting the save DC). Resilient negates the PB, and we have a +3 Dexterity modifier, so we&#8217;re effectively rolling a d20 with Advantage against a target number of 10. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/anydice.com\/program\/39612\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AnyDice<\/a>, this gives us a 79.75% chance to succeed on the save, so we&#8217;re reliably succeeding. That math never changes unless you increase your Dexterity even more.<br><br>From here on, our tactics are fairly stable. Get into the middle of a crowd of enemies, discourage them from moving away with some combination of grappling and Slasher, use Storm Aura to deal automatic damage, and encourage your party to drop every area fire damage effect they can muster on top of you. As long as your hit points hold up, you&#8217;re turning every encounter into an attrition fight where your and your party have a massive efficiency advantage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Brutal Critical (1 Die)<\/td><td>This feature will never not make me sad.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Shielding Storm<\/td><td>Our allies now also enjoy resistance to fire damage while within 10 feet.

The ability to keep enemies within our 10-foot aura is very useful.

It has a single decision point which you can change every time you gain a barbarian level, which is great for players who might have trouble deciding, and all three options are reasonably good.
