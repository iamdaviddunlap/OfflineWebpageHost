Once the spell is in place, the target\n\t\tneeds to pass a wisdom <em>check<\/em> as an Action to remove the effect. Not\n\t\tonly is that a horrifyingly high Action cost, but few creatures will be able\n\t\tto reliably beat the DC even if they&#8217;re built around Wisdom simply because\n\t\tyour save DC will scale better than their Wisdom modifier even with the\n\t\tPaladin&#8217;s relatively poor spell save DC compared to full spellcasters.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Aid<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Not essential, but a\n\t\tgood way to pad your party&#8217;s hit points throughout the day. Just be careful;\n\t\tif the spell ends while you&#8217;re below 5 hit points you&#8217;ll fall to 0 and fall\n\t\tunconscious.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Aid&#8217;s casting time allows it to be used in combat, which is unusual but\n\t\t\toffers an interesting option. With three targets and a 30-foot range, you\n\t\t\tcan cast it to both buff and heal your allies during combat. Targets\n\t\t\tcurrent hit points and hit point maximum both increase, so allies at 0 hit\n\t\t\tpoints are healed in addition to having their hit point maximum raised,\n\t\t\tthereby allowing Aid to serve a similar function to Mass Healing Word.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, since spells don&#8217;t stack with themselves, it&#8217;s hard to repeat\n\t\t\tthis trick.

While this steed\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get anything to make it more durable than a normal horse, it&#8217;s\n\t\tsmarter than a typical animal and has some cool abilities. Among them, you\n\t\tcan share the effect on any spell that you cast which targets only yourself.\n\t\tThat means many buffs like Protection From Evil and Good, but you can also\n\t\tuse spells like Cure Wounds to heal yourself and your mount at the same\n\t\ttime. Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t do this with spells like Branding Smite\n\t\tbecause\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/1021074364832231424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the target of the spell is the creature which you attack<\/a\n\t\t>.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Gentle Repose<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Very\n\t\tsituational, but it solves some interesting problems. Normally you can\n\t\tcremate a body to prevent it from becoming undead, but cremating a body\n\t\ttakes an alarmingly large amount of fuel which you probably don&#8217;t have\n\t\tlaying about. You can mutilate the body, but that&#8217;s gross and in many\n\t\tcampaign settings the gods view that sort of thing as evil. So if you need\n\t\tto maintain a body until you can give it a real burial, this is your best\n\t\tbet.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Gentle Repose also pauses the timer on effects which raise the dead.\n\t\t\tWhile this is specifically called out as working with Raise Dead, it works\n\t\t\twith anything that raises creatures from the dead. That includes Revivify.\n\t\t\tSo if you keep this prepared, you can haul your allies around until you\n\t\t\tcan cast 3rd-level spells and until you can scrape together enough diamond\n\t\t\tdust to raise them.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that while spells don&#8217;t stack, their durations can overlap so if\n\t\t\tyou cast Gentle Repose early to avoid gaps in spell duration you can keep\n\t\t\tbodies preserved indefinitely.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Lesser Restoration<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational, but a\n\t\tsituation that comes up often.

With d10 hit\n\t\tdice and Lay on Hands you have a huge well of hit points, and using this\n\t\tprovides a great deal of protection to comparably fragile allies. This also\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t require Concentration, so you can combine it with options like\n\t\tHeroism to further mitigate damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Zone of Truth<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational and much\n\t\tless reliable than you would hope. Creatures are aware that they&#8217;re under\n\t\tthe effect, and they can choose to &#8220;be evasive&#8221;, which means that they could\n\t\tgive you true but useless answers or simply not answer. Creatures other than\n\t\tthe caster also don&#8217;t know who passed or failed the save, so unless they\n\t\talready trust you other creatures might not believe you when you tell them\n\t\tthat a creature is telling the truth.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If a creature is willing to talk, they can prove that they are saying\n\t\t\twhat they believe to be true, and you can know whether or not they believe\n\t\t\tit to be true. But if the creature is incorrect, if you&#8217;re lying to other\n\t\t\tcreatures (which they might believe that you are), or if any other number\n\t\t\tof other things go wrong, this spell simply fails to meet its intended\n\t\t\tpurpose.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>In short, this helps honest creatures prove to you that they are being\n\t\t\thonest.

Even then, using this in combat isn&#8217;t reliable\n\t\tprotection because it doesn&#8217;t mitigate the effects of spells and abilities\n\t\twhich don&#8217;t require attack rolls like breath weapons or fireballs. The best\n\t\tuse case is generally to invert the effects and use a spell to summon a\n\t\tcreature so that you can bargain with it without risk of the creature\n\t\tescaping. Even then, the 1-hour duration may not be enough to guarantee your\n\t\tsafety. If you want similar effects in combat, Protection From Evil and Good\n\t\twill do the trick.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Shroud<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): With a\n\t\t1-minute duration and Extra Attack, you can get a lot of damage out of this.\n\t\tBut, like any good paladin, you need to consider if this is going to be\n\t\tworth on your precious few smite slots. At 1d8 damage per attack, two\n\t\tattacks per turn, and one minute duration, you can deal at most 20d8 damage\n\t\t(avg. 90). Adjusting for the expected 65% miss chance, that&#8217;s 58.5 damage,\n\t\tprovided that you do nothing else with your Action and that combat last long\n\t\tenough. If you use the same slot on a critical hit (the best time to smite)\n\t\tat any point in that full minute, you&#8217;ll get 8d6 damage (avg. 36). You&#8217;ll\n\t\tscore a critical hit once in those 20 attacks made over the course of a\n\t\tminute of combat, so it&#8217;s a fair comparison.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>So Spirit Shroud will deal more total damage, especially if you have a\n\t\t\tway to make more attacks, such as Haste or Polearm Master. However, that\n\t\t\tdepends on combat being lengthy. A typical combat last 3 to 5 rounds, so\n\t\t\tyou can expect to get half of that 58.5 damage. Things tip more toward\n\t\t\tSpirit Shroud when you upcast it to 5th level, doubling the damage from\n\t\t\tSpirit Shroud but only adding 4d8 additional damage to your Divine Smite\n\t\t\ton a critical hit.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>To summarize: this is good if you have more than two attacks and\/or if\n\t\t\tyou upcast it to 5th level, but it&#8217;s not much better than Divine Smite\n\t\t\twhen cast at 3rd level with just two attacks per turn, and you need to\n\t\t\tdeal with the risks imposed by Concentration.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Curse<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational, but\n\t\tirreplaceable.

The rider effect doesn&#8217;t allow a saving throw, and banishing\n\t\tthe target could dramatically affect the outcome of an encounter. 50 hit\n\t\tpoints is a reasonably large window, especially since you check it after\n\t\tapplying damage from your attack, but ask anyone who has tried to use Power\n\t\tWord Kill how frustrating it is to guess how many hit points a target has.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s frequently easier to just kill them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Circle of Power<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Technically\n\t\tsituational, but spellcasting enemies are common at such high level.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Destructive Smite \/ Destructive Wave<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is a fantastic AOE\n\t\tfor a class that otherwise struggles to handle groups of foes. 10d6 damage\n\t\tis a big pile, and the damage types are very rarely resisted.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dispel Evil and Good<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: In most cases,\n\t\tProtection from Evil and Good will do the trick, but Dispel Evil and Good\n\t\thas two additional effects. You can prematurely end the spell to end a\n\t\tcharm\/frighten\/possession effect, or to attempt to banish creatures from\n\t\tother planes.

However, since the banishment\n\t\t\teffect doesn&#8217;t effect creatures on their home plane, the banishment may\n\t\t\tnot be as appealing as spells like Banishment which can affect creatures\n\t\t\tnative to your current plane.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Geas<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This spell is\n\t\tsituational by design.

Once that&#8217;s done, you\n\t\tneed to give them a suitable command (read the spell description). Generally\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll want it to be something that benefits you, but will also take the\n\t\ttarget most of the duration to keep them from becoming a problem for you.\n\t\tAlso remember that the base effect of the Charmed condition makes it easier\n\t\tfor you to talk the creature into doing things with Charisma checks, so a\n\t\tGeased creature may be a useful ally for the duration of the effect even if\n\t\tthe original order isn&#8217;t directly related to what you want them to do.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Increasing the spell level extends the duration, but weirdly the damage\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t increase. 5d10 is a nice pile of damage, but it doesn&#8217;t scale with\n\t\t\tspell level and at some point the target will get smart enough to wake up,\n\t\t\ttrigger the 5d10 damage, take a short rest, then go about their business.\n\t\t\tIf the damage scaled this would be less of a problem, but damage is so\n\t\t\teasily repaired in 5e outside of combat that without further penalties\n\t\t\tGeas is more a tax on hit dice than the magical shackles it&#8217;s intended to\n\t\t\tbe.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you want a homebrew fix, add a level of fatigue each day that the\n\t\t\ttarget is out of compliance, or make the damage impossible to heal until\n\t\t\tthey go a day without taking it.
