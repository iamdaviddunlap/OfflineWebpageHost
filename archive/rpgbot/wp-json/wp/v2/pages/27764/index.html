More generally, Clerics\n\tare the\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/healbot-olympics\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2693\">best healers in the game<\/a>, and have among the best support, utility, and divination options in the\n\tgame. However, they are by no means limited to healing and support roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, the Cleric can serve effectively as a Healer, a Support caster,\n\tand can provide a little bit of Blaster, Scholar, and Striker, though they\n\twon&#8217;t match a Wizard in those roles. Different subclasses will offer different\n\toptions which can expand your roles within the party, allowing Clerics to fill\n\ta variety of niches. Divine Order (Protector) adds heavy armor proficiency,\n\tbut unfortunately that&#8217;s not enough to consider yourself a Defender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

Fortunately, Clerics have the best healing abilities in the game, so\n\tthey can easily compensate for a small pool of hit points.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Wisdom and Charisma saves cover some\n\tof the most debilitating effects in the game.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor and shields\n\twill give you a decent AC, especially if you&#8217;re not building for melee combat.\n\tSimple weapons will be fine, especially once your spells eclipse your damage\n\toutput with weapons. Clerics don&#8217;t get any tools, and get two skills from a\n\tvery short list of options.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Cleric is a\n\tWisdom-based full caster. With the ability to prepare any Cleric spell at the\n\tbeginning of the day, the Cleric&#8217;s spell list is even more open than the\n\tWizard&#8217;s. Your choice of Divine Domain also grants up to 10 free prepared\n\tspells as you gain levels, allowing you to play to your domain&#8217;s theme without\n\tcutting into your normal prepared spells. Clerics have some of the best\n\tdivination options in the game, all of the best healing options, many of the\n\tbest buffs and debuffs, as well as iconic offensive options like Spirit\n\tGuardians.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1. <strong>Divine Order<\/strong>: Divine Order splits clerics between\n\tfront-line clerics and back-line clerics, at least in concept. The reality is\n\tthat Protector gets +1 AC, but Thaumaturge gets a cantrip and they&#8217;re actually\n\tgood at Religion. A difference of 1 AC shouldn&#8217;t stop you from wading into\n\tmelee.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Protector<\/span>: Heavy armor is very nice, but\n\t\tMartial weapons aren&#8217;t significantly better than Simple weapons since\n\t\tClerics don&#8217;t get Weapon Mastery.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thaumaturge<\/span>: Fantastic on any Cleric.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity<\/span>: A flexible pool of\n\tresources used for various abilities. Divine Spark and Turn Undead are the\n\tdefault, but your subclass might offer more options, such as Life Domain&#8217;s\n\tPreserve Life. You get up to 4 uses per rest, and Channel Divinity recharges\n\ton a Short Rest, making it a deep resource pool to draw from.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Channel Divinity isn&#8217;t a spell, using it doesn&#8217;t run into the &#8220;1\n\tleveled spell per turn&#8221; rule, which means that you can still use your Bonus\n\tAction for spells like Healing Word and Spiritual Weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Spark<\/span>: Divine Spark is the default\n\t\tuse for your Channel Divinity. It&#8217;s not as much healing as Cure Wounds when\n\t\tyou first get this, but as you gain more Channel Divinity uses and as Divine\n\t\tSpark&#8217;s healing improves, the total amount that you can heal in a day grows\n\t\texponentially.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Turn Undead<\/span>: Only situationally useful\n\t\tsince it only affects one creature type, but it also mostly negates a common\n\t\tcreature type as a threat. This upgrades at level 5 when you get Sear Undead\n\t\tto also deal damage, allowing you to easily clear out groups of low-CR\n\t\tundead.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Turn Undead notably affects &#8220;undead of your choice&#8221; within range, which\n\t\t\tis a convenient way for you to include undead in your party without\n\t\t\taccidentally turning them.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Cleric subclasses are briefly summarized below.

Even if\n\t\tyou have a greataxe and 20 Strength, 1d12+1d8+5 damage (avg. 16), it barely\n\t\tbeats Toll the Dead at this level (2d12, avg. 13), and cantrips improve\n\t\tearlier and faster than Divine Strike does. And that&#8217;s to say nothing of\n\t\tPotent Cantrips, which makes cantrips so much more effective that Divine\n\t\tStrike can&#8217;t hope to compete.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>War Domain may be the only viable use for Divine Strike. Since War Priest\n\t\t\tlets you attack as a Bonus Action, it gives you an opportunity to use this\n\t\t\talongside other spells. If possible, get Shillelagh so that you can use\n\t\t\tWisdom for attack and damage.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Cantrips<\/span>: Consistently useful.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>10. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Intervention<\/span>: Absolutely amazing.\n\tRaise Dead as an Action with no gold cost. Hallow mid-combat. Prayer of Healing as an Action to\n\ttake a Short Rest mid-combat. You don&#8217;t need to have the spells prepared,\n\teither, so most of the Cleric&#8217;s spell list is available.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>14. <strong>Improved Blessed Strikes<\/strong>: Remember that your choice at\n\tlevel 7 locks you into your choice here, too.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Strike<\/span>: More damage, but not\n\t\tnearly enough to make weapons viable for the Cleric.

Divine Order. New. Lets you choose between a martial cleric or a caster cleric at level 1 independent of your domain. Protector gets heavy armor and martial weapons. Thaumaturge gets an extra cantrip and +Wisdom modifier to their Arcana and Religion checks so that they can finally compete with wizards on religious knowledge.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Spellcasting. Now allows you to change a cantrip when you gain a Cleric level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Channel Divinity. Uses per rest now scale up to 4 instead of 3. New \u201cDivine Spark\u201d option added alongside Turn Undead, allowing you to heal or damage a creature for 1d8+Wis which adds more dice as you gain levels. It\u2019s effectively Cure Wounds at range as an Action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Sear Undead. New. Now inflict Wisdom modifier d8 damage to undead that fail their save against Turn Undead. Much simpler and more useful than Destroy Undead, which this replaces.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>7. Blessed Stikes. Moved to level 7 from level 8. Now lets you choose rather than being split by subclass. Divine Strike now adds +1d8 radiant or necrotic damage; no more scaling (in this feature; see Improved Blessed Strikes at level 14), and no more variation in damage types between subclasses. Potent Spellcasting is the same as it was.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Divine Intervention. Cast nearly any Cleric spell of 5th level or lower as an Action with no material components, such as Raise Dead or Hallow. Works once per long rest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Improved Blessed Strikes. New (technically). Divine Strike damage adds a second d8, or you can grant temporary hp when you deal damage with a cantrip.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Greater Divine Intervention. You can now cast Wish instead of a 5th-level or lower Cleric spell, but it adds a 2d4 day cooldown if you do so.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Cleric Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An increase to Wisdom is too crucial to forgo, so any Background which\n\tdoesn&#8217;t include Wisdom is immediately out.
