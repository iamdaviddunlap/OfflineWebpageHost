Not always useful, but wonderful for a Druid to\n\t\thave, and helpful if you&#8217;re summoning beasts because you can talk to them to\n\t\tgain information about things that they may have seen, allowing you to use\n\t\tbeasts as effective disposable scouts. As an example, you might summon a\n\t\tbunch of low-CR breasts with Conjure Animals (hope for things like rats,\n\t\tcrows, or other small, common animals) and send them to scout an area and\n\t\treport back to you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Totem<\/span>: Powerful and versatile, and\n\t\tas a bonus action it&#8217;s usable without cutting into your spellcasting.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bear Spirit<\/span>: If your party is on the\n\t\t\t\tdefensive, this is a good way to get some temporary hit points onto your\n\t\t\t\tallies. If you have a grappler in the party or if you&#8217;re facing an enemy\n\t\t\t\tthat grapples your party, Advantage on Strength checks is fantastic.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, the temporary hit points only apply when you first create the\n\t\t\t\tspirit, so its effectiveness diminishes quickly in most cases.\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is also very helpful if you summon numerous low-CR creatures.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe temporary hit points apply to all allies in the area, so if you\n\t\t\t\t\thave 8 summoned hyenas or something, they&#8217;re suddenly much more\n\t\t\t\t\tdurable and can soak considerably more damage which might otherwise be\n\t\t\t\t\tdirected at party members. Your summons get the benefits of Advantage\n\t\t\t\t\ton Strength checks, too, but most creatures that grapple have an\n\t\t\t\t\tattack that grapples automatically.<\/p>\n<p>Still, you may be able to command\n\t\t\t\t\tthem to grapple by normal means, which may be more effective since\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have Advantage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hawk Spirit<\/span>: Your go-to option in most\n\t\t\t\tcases, especially if you don&#8217;t plan to flood combat with summoned\n\t\t\t\tcreatures. As a back-line spellcaster, you can use your largely ignored\n\t\t\t\tReaction to grant Advantage on an attack roll. If you have a rogue in the\n\t\t\t\tparty, this is an easy way to get Sneak Attack. For other party\n\t\t\t\tmembers it&#8217;s just a nice buff that you can grant once per round,\nbut as Extra Attack comes online it will feel less impactful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Unicorn Spirit<\/span>: If you&#8217;re taking a\n\t\t\t\tshort rest and haven&#8217;t already expended Spirit Totem, use this before\n\t\t\t\tyour rest to get some extra healing. The spell you cast doesn&#8217;t need to\n\t\t\t\tbe anything fancy: It just needs to be a leveled spell that restores hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints. Healing Word works, for example, and it&#8217;s a great way to trigger\n\t\t\t\tthis repeatedly.\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear if spells like Goodberry or Healing Spirit\n\t\t\t\tare intended to work since they don&#8217;t immediately heal a targeted creature when you\n\t\t\t\tcast the spell, but they do restore hit points, so RAW I think it works.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is an exciting option when you have numerous summoned creatures\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the additional healing doesn&#8217;t have a cap on the number of\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets. If you have a small army of summoned creatures, you can heal\n\t\t\t\t\tthem for free, stretching the benefits of your spell slot.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mighty Summoner<\/span>: One of the biggest\n\t\tproblems with summoned creatures is that most can&#8217;t overcome damage\n\t\tresistance or immunity to non-magical attacks. This solves that issue, and\n\t\talso makes your summoned creatures slightly more durable so that you get\n\t\tsome more mileage from your spell slots.\n\t\t<p>However, the new summon spells introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of\n\t\t\tEverything don&#8217;t appear to have hit dice, so they don&#8217;t appear to benefit\n\t\t\tfrom the additional hp. All creatures should have hit dice, and you might\n\t\t\targue that they have a number of hit dice equal to the spell level used to\n\t\t\tsummon them, but we haven&#8217;t gotten an official answer on the subject so\n\t\t\tdiscuss it with your DM before making any assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>Summon Draconic Spirit, which follows the same mechanics as other Tasha&#8217;s-era Summon X spells, specifies that the spirit has one hit die per spell level, which seems like a very reasonable way to handle that.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guardian Spirit<\/span>: With this and Mighty\n\t\tSummoner, you can make Conjure X spells last for an exceptionally long time\n\t\teven while in combat, even if you don&#8217;t plan to use Unicorn Spirit to get\n\t\tfree healing for your summons.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Faithful Summons<\/span>: At this level CR 2\n\t\tcreatures aren&#8217;t likely to win a fight for you (even with the benefits of\n\t\tMighty Summoner), but they might keep enemies at bay long enough for your\n\t\tparty to come to your rescue.\n\t\t<p>The language is fairly clear that you can&#8217;t trigger this willingly, so\n\t\t\tunfortunately you can&#8217;t tell your allies to beat you unconscious to get\n\t\t\tfree summons (though they could technically decide to do so on their own\n\t\t\tso long as you weren&#8217;t willingly going along with their plan).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This also uniquely allows you to select the beasts which you summon,\n\t\t\twhich is weird since Conjure Animals doesn&#8217;t normally allow that. I\n\t\t\trecommend the Giant Constrictor Snake because its attacks can grapple your\n\t\t\tfoes and buy you more time for your allies to rescue you. But the Giant\n\t\t\tBoar is hard to kill thanks to Relentless, and the Polar Bear&#8217;s attacks\n\t\t\tare really good without needing to run around and leave your unconscious\n\t\t\tbody defenseless.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-shepherd-druid-ability-scores\">Circle of the Shepherd Druid Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Shepherd druids are very similar to most druids, but adding an emphasis on\n\tsummoning means that you have a second pool of hit points to divert attention\n\taway from yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: AC, initiative, important saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Con<\/span>: You really don&#8217;t need much.

Stick to staple spells like Healing Word and Faerie Fire.<br><br>If you have extra gold and your GM lets you get away with it, invest in a small herd of goats. They&#8217;re 1 gp each and only CR 0, but sheep cost 2 gp and don&#8217;t have an attack. Cows cost 10 gp, so they&#8217;re a bit out of our price range. You might justifiably ask &#8220;why would you do this?&#8221;, and that&#8217;s a very responsible question to ask.<br><br>A goat has just 3 hp, but with its ram attack and Charge trait, it&#8217;s a bit of potential damage if we can point it an enemy. Compare that to the 50gp cost for a flask of alchemist&#8217;s fire. If it gets killed, that&#8217;s one attack directed at a goat instead of an ally that we care about, plus you\u2019ve fed the party for the next few days.<br><br>The difficulty is convincing a bunch of goats to attack your enemies.

Speech of the Woods is basically a permanent Speak with Animals, which will be great when we can summon our own animals.<br><br>If you can take Wild Companion, it&#8217;s a great complement to Circle of the Shepherd&#8217;s capabilities. It&#8217;s not totally clear if it&#8217;s considered a &#8220;summoned&#8221; creature, but Find Familiar uses thematically similar language to spells like Summon Fey Spirit, so I think it qualifies. If it does, Mighty Summoner (which we get at level 6) gives our familiar 2 more hit points, raising its total to a whopping 3. That&#8217;s exactly enough that CR 0 creatures might not one-shot your disposable owl. It&#8217;s fine, though: we can summon two of them per short rest, so if they get converted into pillow filling we don&#8217;t need to feel bad about it.<br><br>Sadly, you can&#8217;t use Find Familiar to get a dog, or we&#8217;d get ourselves a nice herding dog. Maybe if you convince your DM that it&#8217;s no more annoying than disposable owls, and that you&#8217;ll summon and feed it every day, they&#8217;ll finally let you get a puppy.<br><br>At this level we should have around 100gp according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/starting-above-1st-level\/#wealth-by-level-table\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/starting-above-1st-level\/#wealth-by-level-table\">wealth by level<\/a> table. Still not enough to justify buying a bunch of cows, but that&#8217;s a whole lot of goats that we could haul around. Combined with Speech of the Woods, we can now talk to our herd of goats and ideally convince them to fight on our behalf. A sensible rule system would make this require an Animal Handling check, but amazingly 5e doesn&#8217;t because <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/animal-handling-rpgbot-podcast-s2e90\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"15916\">Animal Handling outright doesn&#8217;t do that<\/a>.<br><br>So you have a herd of goats. The problem with goats is their 3 hit points. You know what else you have? Spirit Totem. Spirit Totem (Bear) piles another 7 temporary hit points onto each one of your <s>party members<\/s> goats. Bear also gives allies advantage on Strength checks, including checks to do things like Shove. Should your herd of goats be allowed to swarm your enemies and shove into hazards? No, probably not. But your party sure can.<br><br>Are you all out of goats? Did your DM veto your sheep-herding shepherd ambitions? Fine.

It also gets us to 18 Wisdom, keeping us right on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2691\">Fundamental Math<\/a>.<br><br>At this level, you should have roughly 400 gp according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/starting-above-1st-level\/#wealth-by-level-table\">Wealth By Level<\/a> progression, and the PHB is full of wonderful livestock that we could turn into a small army. Goats are 1 gp, which is still our most efficient gold-to-combatants ratio, but it may no longer be our best option. Instead, consider the elephant. At 200gp, it&#8217;s a CR 4 beast with a mountain of hit points and attacks good enough to make your party&#8217;s fighter reconsider their life choices. Why are these things 200gp and common enough to be in the PHB? I sincerely have no idea. If they weren&#8217;t Huge, they&#8217;d be such a problem that character builds almost wouldn&#8217;t matter unless they got you more gold and\/or elephants.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Nothing here but 3rd-level spells, which includes Conjure Animals and Summon Fey. This is the first time we get to directly compare PHB-era Conjure X spells to Tasha&#8217;s-era Summon X spells, and the comparison is crucial to optimizing Circle of the Shepherd.<br><br>Conjure Animals has the magical ability to let the DM pick the animals that you summon, allowing them to absolutely ruin your spell if they feel salty or if they feel like summoning a bunch of cows in the middle of a frozen tundra doesn&#8217;t fit the intent of the spell, which is totally sensible until you&#8217;re on the plane of fire and need some cows and your DM needs to figure out what mundane beasts are native to the plane of fire only to find that the answer is &#8220;none&#8221; and now you&#8217;re in a staring contest with your DM waiting for them to get everyone out of the mess that they created.<br><br>If your DM just lets you pick animals, you&#8217;re golden. Summon a bunch of cows. Maybe pick those wooly highland cows so that they fit in with your goats and sheep. They&#8217;re terrifying by CR 0 standards, and you can get 8 of them for an hour. With 15 hp, they can take a hit or two, and if you throw up Spirit Totem (Unicorn) and cast Goodberry (yes, it counts), you can heal all of them (and your party, I guess) at once for almost nothing and be left with a pocket full of snacks for later.<br><br>Now let\u2019s compare that to both Summon Beast and Summon Fey. Your beast or fey will be much more effective offensively than an individual cow, will have double the hit points, and will be much more portable than 8 cows. The fey\u2019s DPR will be something like 8.15, the beast\u2019s something like 9.65 for Land, and the herd of cows\u2019 DPR will be a measly 37.4. A pittance, really.<br><br>So it comes down to circumstances. Big, open field and your DM lets you pick the animals? Conjure Animals. Tight dungeon interior? Summon Beast or Summon Fey.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Land&#8217;s Stride<br>Mighty Summoner<\/td><td>By now enemies with resistance to non-magical B\/P\/S are common, so the ability to overcome that resistance is extremely useful.<br><br>Mighty Summoner&#8217;s hp boost is one of those features that looks totally reasonable, but gets really weird when you dig into it. In this case, it&#8217;s because of how hit points, hit dice, size, and CR work. To be brief: CR cares about hit points, but not the number of hit dice. Hit dice size is determined entirely by a creature&#8217;s size. Therefore, a smaller creature of the same CR will have a larger number of hit dice, provided that everything else is equivalent (hp, damage, etc.).<br><br>Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t actually work out in practice because creatures&#8217; offensive CR and defensive CR balance each other out. There CR 1\/4 creatures ranging from 1 hit die to 4 hit dice. Those 4 hit die beasts look really tempting. Giant Frogs have 19 hp base and shoot up to 27 hp with Mighty Summoner! Even better: at CR 1\/4, we can still get 8 of them from Conjure Animal. They&#8217;re not as shepherdy as cows, but their grapple effect is hard to say &#8220;no&#8221; to, and cows only have 2 hit dice.<br><br>So how does Mighty Summoner work with Summon Beast\/Summon Fey? It doesn&#8217;t. Your summoned creature doesn&#8217;t have hit dice, and therefore Mighty Summoner simply doesn&#8217;t function. That&#8217;s super disappointing, so as a compromise, ask your DM if they can have 2 hp per spell level. That seems fair compared to the 64 hp worth of extra frog I proposed above.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>4th-level spells means that Summon Beast\/Summon Fey get a second attack, roughly doubling their DPR. We also get Conjure Minor Elementals, Conjure Woodland Beings, and Summon Elemental, so our summon options fully triple. That&#8217;s a lot of analysis paralysis.<br><br>&#8211; Conjure Animals: Lots of low-CR creatures. Swarming single enemies with things like giant frogs can quickly eliminate them, and both Bear and Unicorn totems can make them very durable unless enemies can deal area damage.<br>&#8211; Conjure Woodland Beings: Summon 8 sprites and have them shoot things to sleep. Damage basically doesn&#8217;t matter. Too annoying? Fine, summon 4 satyrs so you can be the GOAT among goats. They&#8217;re basically pet level 1 fighters, and if you support them Spirit Totem (Unicorn) they&#8217;re perfectly capable of tanking for your whole party.<br>&#8211; Conjure Minor Elementals: A bunch of mephit breath weapons sounds vaguely useful, but the damage is pitiful and they&#8217;re made of paper. Basically the only useful thing here is summon a gargoyle, which is a very decent damage sink for a few levels, and can fly. It&#8217;s basically a compromise between Summon Elemental&#8217;s Air and Earth options.<br>&#8211; Summon Beast: Unless you&#8217;re using a lower-level spell slot (which you&#8217;ll need to do sometimes), Summon Elemental will almost always be more effective.<br>&#8211; Summon Fey: With multiple attacks, Fuming is less useful than the other options, but unless you&#8217;re able to reliably benefit from the rider effects on Fey Step, Summon Elemental will be more useful.<br>&#8211; Summon Elemental: Earth is your go-to tank (assuming you can&#8217;t summon 8 giant frogs), while Air is your go-to flying option.<br><br>Conjure Animals, Conjure Woodland Beings, and Summon Fey are your go-to options, with Summon Beast around for use with 2nd-level spell slots when you&#8217;re short on better spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase: Wis 18 -> 20<\/td><td>Finally a level that isn&#8217;t interesting and a wall of math and conjecture about herd animals.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>5th-level spells. Conjure Animals upcast to 5th level summons double the number of creatures summoned with a 3rd-level slot, allowing you to summon 16 giant frogs. Encircle two medium creatures with powered-up frogs, throw up Spirit Totem (Unicorn) to area heal them all every turn, and find the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dmg\/running-the-game#HandlingMobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mob attack rules<\/a> in the DMG so you&#8217;re not rolling 16 attack rolls.<br><br>By now, our frogs are becoming less and less reliable. Scaling ACs, scaling damage numbers, and the growing prevalence of area damage are making it hard to keep low-CR creatures alive, even with Mighty Summoner&#8217;s hp boost. A young blue dragon (CR 9) does an average of 55 damage with its breath weapon, which is more than double our frogs&#8217; max hit points. Even Spirit Totem (Bear) isn&#8217;t enough to keep them alive through one decent AOE.<br><br>For the most part, it&#8217;s time to put Conjure Animals out to pasture. Against some enemies (anything without area damage or which can&#8217;t counter grapples), it can still be very effective, but it can&#8217;t be our go-to option anymore. Fortunately, level 9 is right when we roll into the high-level &#8220;Conjure X&#8221; spells.<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#conjure-elemental\">Conjure Elemental<\/a> is decent, but heavily limited by the lack of elementals that fall into the spell&#8217;s CR range. At level 5, the elementals aren&#8217;t significantly better than an elemental summoned with a level Conjure Elemental, but they do have hit dice, and adding 24 hp to an earth elemental makes it a very sturdy Defender.<br><br>The only new &#8220;Summon X&#8221; spell at this level is Summon Draconic Spirit, which notably doesn&#8217;t summon a beast or a fey, so it doesn&#8217;t benefit from Mighty Summoner or Guardian Spirit. Skip it. You can&#8217;t herd dragons.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Guardian Spirit<\/td><td>Remember how we&#8217;ve been using Spirit Totem (Unicorn) to repeatedly heal our flock of frogs or elementals or whatever? Well, you no longer need to do that. Now your summoned critters will passively heal just by being in the area of your totem, allowing you to switch to Hawk to boost your ally&#8217;s attacks or to Bear so that your party can shove enemies prone to give your summoned army Advantage. Unfortunately, by this level you can summon creatures with well over 100 hit points, so this may not be enough to heal them all the way to full hp.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>6th-level spells mean that we can upcast Summon X and get three attacks, Conjure Elemental gets us CR 6 elementals like the absolutely unfair Invisible Stalker, and we can cast Conjure Fey.<br><br>Conjure Fey is weird.

It&#8217;s mostly &#8220;summon giant animal&#8221; and you can&#8217;t herd any of these things excekpt maybe the triceratops. At this spell level, your options aren&#8217;t intuitively great. Personally, I would go for the Giant Crocodile because it can grapple and restrain targets of its bite, which helps your entire party. The Annis Hag will do considerably more damage, but it doesn&#8217;t restrain things.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/metamagic\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2675\">Metamagic Adept<\/a> (Extended Spell, Any Other)<\/td><td>Are you doing a good job keeping your high-level summoned creature alive?

The Bheur Hag will run out spells quickly and then resort to Ray of Frost unless you&#8217;re facing humanoids almost exclusively. The Korred&#8217;s attacks are fine, but any of the Summon X spells will massively outperform it on damage. Of course, the Korred can cast Stone Shape at will for the spell&#8217;s 1-hour duration, and that alone is enough to accomplish quite a bit &nbsp;(like <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/defending-a-permanent-base\/\">building your <s>castle<\/s> barn<\/a>).<br><br>So, altogether, not a fantastic level for summoning purposes.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Faithful Summon<\/td><td>Honestly the fact that I can&#8217;t choose to summon 32 cows to announce my impending demise is a travesty.

Let&#8217;s look at Summon Elemental&#8217;s Earth option for comparison. The T-Rex has 162 hit points with the Mighty Summoner boost compared to the elemental&#8217;s 90 (106 if your DM allows the 2-per-spell-level approach which I suggested above). The T-Rex&#8217;s DPR is 36.75, while the elemental&#8217;s is 46.6. So you&#8217;re giving up almost a quarter of the elemental&#8217;s damage output for a bigger pool of hp and the T-Rex&#8217;s ability to grapple\/restrain one target, and the hp is hard to measure because of the elemental&#8217;s damage resistances. The elemental also isn&#8217;t Huge, so you can fit it through doors and such.<br><br>It&#8217;s hard to say which is outright better, but I lean toward the T-Rex if you can fit it wherever you&#8217;re going because it won&#8217;t strain your action economy like the Summon X spells do. Unfortunately, it can&#8217;t fly, so against flying enemies you&#8217;ll want Summon Beast (Air) or Summon Elemental (Air).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Inspiring Leader<\/td><td>Time to pile some temporary hit points onto your T-Rex and whoever else has stuck around long enough to make it to this level despite being repeatedly surrounded by cows and giant frogs.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>9th-level spells! You&#8217;re probably going to cast Foresight on someone (possibly your T-Rex), but consider that Conjure Fey can get you a Frost Salamander. It hits an even 200 hit points with Mighty Summoner. It has 5 attacks, but its DPR comes in at just 33.05, so your T-Rex is a better option there. Where it shines is its 60-foot cone breath weapon, with is easily enough to hit 3 targets in most multi-enemy encounters, and even on successful saves that&#8217;s 66 damage. It&#8217;s the equivalent of an 8th-level Cone of Cold cast every turn.<br><br>You might rightly say &#8220;but that recharges on a d6 roll of 6, so I&#8217;ll only be able to use that once per encounter&#8221; and you&#8217;re mostly correct. But the Frost Salamander&#8217;s Burning Fury trait allows it to recharge its breath weapon instantly if it takes fire damage. So: you set it on fire with Alchemist&#8217;s Fire, dealing 1d4 fire damage (doubled due to vulnerability) per turn, which is immediately healed by Guardian Spirit, which heals 8 hp per turn at this level, matching the max your salamander could take from being on fire.<br><br>At this point, we have everything from the Druid that we actually care about, so if you&#8217;re planning to multiclass, now is a good time. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Timeless Body<br>Beast Spells<\/td><td>Beast spells is cool because we can turn into a bird and still summon stuff.
