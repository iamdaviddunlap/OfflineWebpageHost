The\n\t\tBigger They Are gives you a nonviolent way to handle low-Intelligence\n\t\tMonstrosities, but that won&#8217;t be helpful consistently. The Tarrasque only\n\t\thas 3 Intelligence, so the effect works across the full CR scale, but most\n\t\tof the spellcasting is centered around Beasts and already on the Druid&#8217;s\n\t\tspell list, so while Mark of Handling complements the Druid&#8217;s existing\n\t\tcapabilities nicely, it doesn&#8217;t expand them much or fix any problems that\n\t\tthe Druid faces.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Making<\/span>: The skill bonuses and\n\t\tproficiencies may not be especially useful, but the spellcasting is\n\t\texcellent for a druid looking to take a supporting role in the party. Nearly\n\t\tevery one of the spells is new to the Druid&#8217;s spell list. However, the\n\t\tbetter options require Concentration, which is already a big problem for the\n\t\tDruid so you may not be able to enjoy your dragonmark spells and your best\n\t\tdruid spells at the same time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: Druids have few few\n\t\tteleportation options, and Mark of Passage introduces several than can be\n\t\tvery useful for druids looking to get in and out of melee in a hurry.
