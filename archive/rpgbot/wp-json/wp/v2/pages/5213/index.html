You give up Fast Movement and your other tradeable abilities (Uncanny Dodge, Trap Sense), but you get proficiency with heavy armor, and you gradually get the ability to move your normal speed in it. You won&#8217;t be able to move 40 feet like a normal barbarian, but 30 foot move speed in full plate is still fairly impressive. Combined with Barbarian hit points, people will have a lot of problems taking you out of a fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: One of\n\tBarbarians&#8217; biggest problems is their low AC. Throw heavy armor on them, and\n\tyou have an unstoppable ball of hitpoints wrapped in nice thick armor. This\n\tcould easily be gained from a feat or a dip into Fighter, but Fast Movement\n\tonly works in light an medium armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indomitable Stance<\/span> (Ex): One of your\n\tbiggest problems in heavy armor is going to be your speed, so giving up Fast\n\tMovement is disappointing. The bonuses against charges and overrun\/trample are\n\thighly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armored Swiftness<\/span> (Ex): Don&#8217;t give up on the\n\tidea of fast movement just yet. This brings your speed in heavy armor up to 25\n\tfeet. You won&#8217;t be winning many races, but at least you&#8217;re faster than\n\thalflings.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resilience of Steel<\/span> (Ex): Situational.\n\tWith heavy armor, your AC should be high enough that critical hits aren&#8217;t a\n\tfrequent problem. You also have plenty of hit points to fall back on.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Armored Swiftness<\/span> (Ex): This allows\n\ta human barbarian to move at 30 feet, and run 3 times his\/her speed in heavy\n\tarmor. At level 5 you can reasonably expect to have full plate, so you\n\tprobably haven&#8217;t spent too many levels moving slowly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Weapon and Armor Proficiency, fast movement, uncanny dodge, Trap Sense, improved uncanny dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"breaker\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/breaker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Breaker<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The aptly named Breaker is a Sunder archetype. You get bonus damage to break things, and you get bonus damage when using broken weapons. Eventually you get so good with broken weapons that they actually deal more damage than non-broken weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Destructive<\/span> (Ex): With Greater Sunder, this\n\tis potentially damage applied to whoever is wielding the target of your\n\tsunder.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Scavenger<\/span> (Ex): At 6th level, the\n\tdamage bonus equals the penalty for using a broken weapon. At 9th level you do\n\t<em>more<\/em> damage with a broken weapon. The bonus isn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s\n\tcertainly better than Trap Sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fast Movement, Trap Sense<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Wild Rager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"brutal-pugilist\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/brutal-pugilist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brutal Pugilist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Barbarians make excellent grapplers. Despite not getting the Monk&#8217;s bonus unarmed damage, Barbarians&#8217; huge strength and rage powers give them a lot of options in a grapple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To really understand how to use this archetype, you need to have a good understating of how grappling works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Savage Grapple<\/span> (Ex): Even for a grappler,\n\tyou want to be the one who starts a grapple. The ability to defend yourself\n\tagainst other grapplers goes a long way to make sure you start a grapple with\n\tthe upper hand. Reducing the penalties from the Grappled condition also makes\n\tyou less of an easy target while grappling.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Pit Fighter<\/span> (Ex): The bonus is small, and you\n\tget a total of 6 choices over 20 levels. I would choose CMB for grapple, then\n\tCMD for grapple, then pick whatever else you think is fun. Removing your armor\n\tfor another +1 may be tempting, but +1 to your CMB\/CMD hardly outweighs the\n\tbenefits of armor, especially at high levels where a +1 to CMB\/CMD is such a\n\tsmall portion of your bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Savage Grapple<\/span> (Ex): Now you can\n\tgrapple with effectively no penalties. This is hugely important because\n\twhoever you are grappling with will still be taking penalties to dexterity,\n\tand therefore to their CMD. Combined with the +5 for being in control of a\n\tgrapple, this is a huge advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Uncanny Dodge, Trap Sense, Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Brute, Hurler, Urban Barbarian.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"drunken-brute\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/drunken-brute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drunken Brute<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drunken Brute is a very simple archetype. You give up Fast Movement for a really fantastic drinking ability, which then turns a lot of otherwise terrible drinking-related rage powers into really fun mechanics. As you grow in level, you will need to spend more time drinking to charge your rage powers, so sometimes it may be a good idea to pre-funk encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Raging Drunk<\/span> (Ex): Drinking a potion as a\n\tmove action is a really fantastic ability, and doing it without provoking\n\tattacks of opportunity is a huge benefit. That alone makes this archetype an\n\texcellent class dip, but the benefits don&#8217;t stop there. Drinking makes your\n\tcurrent round not consume a rage round for the day, which means you can keep\n\traging as long as you have enough booze on hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fast Movement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Brutal Pugilist, Elemental Kin, Hateful Rager (Half-Orc), Invulnerable Rager, Savage Barbarian, Superstitious, Wild Rager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"elemental-kin\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/elemental-kin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elemental Kin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A very simple archetype, Elemental Kin replaces Trap Sense with an amusing recharge mechanic that fuels your rage rounds when you take energy damage. The bonus rounds aren&#8217;t huge, but if you haven&#8217;t given up Trap Sense for another archetype, this is almost guaranteed to be a good option. If you have a convenient source of elemental damage (such as a camp fire), and a bunch of free\/cheap healing, you can sit and damage yourself to generate rage rounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Fury<\/span> (Ex): This isn&#8217;t particularly\n\tgood, but it&#8217;s better than Trap Sense, and it gets you free rage rounds once\n\tin a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Trap Sense<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Brute, Hurler, Mounted Fury, Sea Reaver, Totem Barbarian, Urban Barbarian, Wild Rager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"hurler\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/hurler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hurler<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to build a ranged barbarian, this is a must. Otherwise, don&#8217;t bother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skilled Thrower<\/span> (Ex): The biggest problem\n\tthat thrown weapons have is their lack of range. In most cases, you can charge\n\tas far as you can effectively throw a spear. Adding 10 feet range increments\n\tof thrown weapons and objects is nice, but unless you are planning to build a\n\tpurely ranged barbarian, it&#8217;s not going to make a noticeable difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fast Movement<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Brutal Pugilist, Elemental Kin, Hateful Rager (Half-Orc), Invulnerable Rager, Savage Barbarian, Superstitious, Wild Rager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"invulnerable-rager\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/invulnerable-rager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Invulnerable Rager<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like Barbarian damage reduction? Then this is the archetype for you. The DR scales considerably faster, and you give up the worst of the Barbarian&#8217;s abilities. You also get some modest resistance to either cold or fire, but that&#8217;s not really the key component to this archetype.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invulnerability<\/span> (Ex): DR\/- at level 2, and\n\tthe scaling is very nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extreme Endurance<\/span> (Ex): The resistance to\n\tfire or cold is nice, but you will probably forget that you have this because\n\tthe bonus is so small. Still, it&#8217;s better than Trap Sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Uncanny Dodge, Trap Sense, Improved Uncanny Dodge, Damage Reduction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Brute, Hurler, Urban Barbarian.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mounted-fury\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/mounted-fury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mounted Fury<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mounted charging is a great mechanic for Barbarians. With their absurd strength and Power Attack, Barbarians can do a ton of damage on a single attack. Throw that behind Spirited Charge with a lance, and you&#8217;re tripling your already impressive damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fast Rider<\/span> (Ex): If you&#8217;re going to be be\n\tcharging over\/through enemies, you need as much move speed as you can get.\n\tThis helps, but remember to get horseshoes of speed as soon as it&#8217;s practical\n\tto do so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestial Mount<\/span> (Ex): Animal companions are\n\tconsiderably better than some horse you bought from the local farm. It will\n\thave more hitpoints, better AC, and you can add feats to it as you level. Make\n\tsure to give it Improved Overrun so that you can overrun and trample enemies\n\twhile charging more important targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fast Movement, Uncanny Dodge, Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Elemental Kin, Savage Barbarian, Superstitious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"savage-barbarian\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/savage-barbarian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Savage Barbarian<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Barbarians have a lot of problems with their AC. This archetype attempts to address that by removing your armor and replacing it with small bonuses to AC. These bonuses won&#8217;t match up to a chain shirt until level 9, and will never catch up to a chain shirt with only modest enhancements. Oh, and since you apparently like losing all of your hit points to every kobold with a pointy stick, you also give up your DR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Naked Courage<\/span> (Ex): There is no way this\n\tdodge bonus can make up for your lack of armor, and the bonus to saves against\n\tfear is negligible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Natural Toughness<\/span> (Ex): You need all of the\n\tAC you can get, but giving up DR is cruel. With so little armor, DR seems like\n\ta foregone conclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Trap Sense, Damage Reduction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Brute, Hurler, Mounted Fury, Sea Reaver, Totem Barbarian, Urban Barbarian, Wild Rager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-reaver\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/sea-reaver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sea Reaver<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in an aquatic campaign, the best ability that this archetype has to \n\toffer is a bonus to a short list of skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Fixable with a\n\tfeat, but still annoying. The armor check penalties form medium armor also\n\tmake swimming hard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Marine Terror<\/span> (Ex): Fight in wading pools!\n\tSituational at best, even in heavily aquatic campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eyes of the Storm<\/span> (Ex): Highly\n\tsituational, even in an aquatic campaign.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Savage Sailor<\/span> (Ex): Those are all of the\n\tskills which you would need in an aquatic campaign, and with the Barbarian&#8217;s\n\tfairly small pool of skill ranks it&#8217;s nice to see some bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sure-Footed<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor Proficiency, Fast Movement, Uncanny Dodge, Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Elemental Kin, Savage Barbarian, Superstitious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"scarred-rager\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/scarred-rager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scarred Rager<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This archetype has a really cool flavor, but the implementation is disappointing. All of the benefits are very situational, and even in situations where they apply they aren&#8217;t very good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Terrifying Visage<\/span> (Ex): The benefits are\n\thighly situational, and you have to give up Fast Movement, which is great on a\n\tBarbarian.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tolerance<\/span> (Ex): All of the listed effects\n\tare minor and rare, which makes this very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Scarification<\/span> (Ex): Bleed damage is very\n\trare, and not particularly scary. Ignoring 1 point per round isn&#8217;t going to\n\twin you any fights.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Tolerance<\/span> (Ex): The added effects\n\tare more common and considerably more troublesome than the first bunch of\n\teffects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fast Movement, Uncanny Dodge, Trap Sense, Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"superstititous\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/superstitious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Superstitious<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spellcasters are one of the scariest enemies in Pathfinder. Despite the name and flavor of this archetype, the abilities it provides are well suited to fighting nearly any foe, whether or not it can cast spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Sixth Sense<\/span> (Ex): Insight bonuses to AC go\n\ton all types of AC, similar to deflection bonuses, and because they&#8217;re so rare\n\tthey are very easy to stack with your other bonuses. The bonus to initiative\n\tis also nice so that you can get charging early in the fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Keen Senses<\/span> (Ex): Giving up DR hurts, but\n\tthe crazy number of additional\/improved senses that you gain are certainyl\n\tworth the cost. These senses make you more able to fight in areas of Darkness,\n\tand eventually let you find and fight invisible creatures without issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Trap Sense, Damage Reduction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Brute, Hurler, Mounted Fury, Sea Reaver, Urban Barbarian, Wild Rager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"titan-mauler\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/titan-mauler\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Titan Mauler<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it was originally published, Massive Weapons completely omitted the text which allows the Titan Mauler to use oversized two-handed weapons. Without that correction, the archetype&#8217;s sole function is to allow you to use a greatsword one-handed. Fortunately the issue was corrected in Errata.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest feature of this archetype is the ability to use weapons one size too large with little or no penalty. Larger weapons are exciting, but the damage payoff really isn&#8217;t all that impressive normally. The damage difference between a large bastard sword (the biggest weapon a medium creature can wield) and a large greatsword is only 2.5 on average, and you take a relative -4 attack penalty to do it (although the penalty will gradually go away). Barbarians normally get much better rates elsewhere (such as power attack), so unless you&#8217;re looking to use Vital Strike, there is very little practical reason to consider Titan Mauler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Big Game Hunter<\/span> (Ex): Situational,\n\tespecially if you plan to use Enlarge Person. And you should really plan to\n\tuse Enlarge Person. At high levels when enemies are more consistently large,\n\tthis becomes easier to use, but a +1 bonus really isn&#8217;t going to matter much\n\tat the levels where you face the biggest foes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Jotungrip<\/span> (Ex): Jotungrip allows you to wield\n\tan <em>appropriately sized<\/em> two-handed weapon in one hand, which means you\n\tcan wield a Greatsword or a two-handed polearm in one hand at a -2 penalty.\n\tThis does not allow you to wield oversized weapons (such as a Large Bastard\n\tSword) any better. You could always dual-wield greatswords, which would look\n\tsuper cool at the expense of actually hitting things. It&#8217;s useful for a\n\tbarbarian class dip if you want to do something like using a reach weapon and\n\ta shield at the same time, but that&#8217;s a very niche case.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Massive Weapons<\/span> (Ex): The wording on this\n\tability is awful, so I&#8217;ll clarify: You can use a two-handed weapon for a\n\tcreature one size larger than you (such as a human wielding a large\n\tgreatsword), but at an additional -4 penalty on top of the -2 for using a\n\tweapon one size category off. That&#8217;s a total -6 penalty to attacks. However,\n\tthe penalty is reduced by 1 at 3rd level and at every 3rd level until the\n\tpenalty reaches 0 at 18th level. That&#8217;s a lot of penalty and you don&#8217;t get a\n\tlot of extra damage, so don&#8217;t try to use this unless you&#8217;re high level or\n\tusing Vital Strike. If you use a weapon that&#8217;s oversized but not a two-handed\n\tweapon for a creature one size larger then you (such as a human wielding a\n\tlarge bastard sword), you start from the normal -2 penalty and reduce it to -1\n\tat 3rd level, then to 0 at 6th level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Evade Reach<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s a very good day when\n\tyou have reach, but the giant\/dragon\/dinosaur you&#8217;re fighting doesn&#8217;t. Of\n\tcourse, you&#8217;re going to charge into melee where this will only matter for the\n\tfirst round or two. Unless you&#8217;re built to make a lot of attacks of\n\topportunity (which this archetype doesn&#8217;t help with), this won&#8217;t be very\n\timportant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Titanic Rage<\/span> (Su): Burning through your\n\trage rounds at double speed sucks. At this level you should have enough gold\n\tthat you can afford to chug potions of Enlarge Person whenever you get\n\tthirsty. If you have a wizard handy, they can use a wand on you, or you can\n\tuse Permanency and be permanently large for a measly 2,500 gp, which any\n\tdecent Barbarian should be doing anyway unless they spend a lot of time in\n\tcramped dungeons.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/titan_mauler\">Titan Mauler Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Fast Movement, Uncanny Dodge, Trap Sense, Improved Uncanny Dodge, Indomitable Will<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"true-primitive\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/true-primitive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">True Primitive<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The only appealing part of this archetype is Trophy Fetish, which still isn&#8217;t fantastic. You give up almost all of your decent weapon choices, normal armor, the potential to learn to read, and Trap Sense to get a bunch of things which are considerably worse. The only thing you want from this archetype is the Trophy Fetish morale bonus to saves, which is a common bonus type that you can get from a Bard or about a dozen spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: It&#8217;s a very sad\n\tday when a barbarian has to step down to using a shield or two-handing a\n\tbattleaxe.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Illiteracy<\/span>: Hilarious. I wish all barbarians\n\thad this solely for comic relief.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Favored Terrain<\/span> (Ex): One of the Ranger&#8217;s\n\tworst abilities, and you get a worse version of it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Trophy Fetish<\/span> (Ex): The morale bonus to\n\tdamage is pathetic, but the permanent morale bonus to saving throws is\n\tfantastic. That&#8217;s ALL of your saving throws. All throws, all the time. No Bard\n\trequired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Armor and Weapon Proficiency, Fast Movement, Trap Sense<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Wild Rager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"urban-barbarian\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/urban-barbarian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Urban Barbarian<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very weird archetype. You give up some of your wilderness-related skills and get Diplomacy, a couple of knowledge skills, and linguistics. You also trade in the barbarian&#8217;s signature Rage ability from &#8220;Controlled Rage&#8221; which sacrifices some of the total bonus for the ability to choose which physical ability to increase, and you don&#8217;t take penalties while raging. This has a lot of potential for creative use, but this isn&#8217;t a go-to option for people looking to get angry and crush things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Your armor\n\tclass is already enough of a problem, so why not make it worse?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: What the hell did I just read?

And <em>two<\/em> knowledge\n\tskills?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crowd Control<\/span> (Ex): The bonus to\n\tattacks\/ac is lousy, and if you&#8217;re adjacent to two enemies you aren&#8217;t\n\tmurdering hard enough. Intimidating crowds is hilarious, but not very\n\timportant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Controlled Rage<\/span> (Ex): This is not entirely\n\tawful. It allows for a wide range of builds dependent on either strength or\n\tdexterity, and even provides some interesting options as a class dip. However,\n\tstrength will always be the easiest damage option, and this likely won&#8217;t make\n\tyou as scary in combat as normal rage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Class Skills, Armor Proficiency, Fast Movement, Rage<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Brutal Pugilist, Elemental Kin, Hateful Rager (Half-Orc), Invulnerable Rager, Savage Barbarian, Superstitious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wild-rager\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/paizo-barbarian-archetypes\/wild-rager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wild Rager<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wild Rager is all about giving yourself the Confused status condition. If you like being confused and useless, this is the archetype for you. If you like being able to act on your turns, don&#8217;t give this archetype another look. I have seen some truly awful archetypes, but this is just insulting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Uncontrolled Rage<\/span> (Ex): The Barbarian&#8217;s\n\tprimary job is to reduce things to 0 hit points. This spits in the face of\n\teverything Barbarians stand for. Confusion means that there is a very real\n\tchance that you will stop and stand still for a full turn. Just stand there,\n\tconfused at the fact that you beat someone to a bloody pulp and they fell down\n\tas result. That is literally you primary job. Why would that possibly confuse\n\tyou? Even worse, the DC gets harder considerably faster than your will saves\n\tincrease. Oh, and having higher constitution makes it even worse. The better a\n\tbarbarian you are, worse this problem gets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wild Fighting<\/span> (Ex): The extra attack at -2\n\tis right in line with rapid shot, and an extra attack on a barbarian is a\n\tscary prospect. The -4 penalty to AC is crippling, and drops this from blue to\n\tgreen.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Rage Conversion<\/span> (Ex): Confusion is a 4th\n\tlevel spell, and is a solid save-or-suck effect because it reduces the target\n\tto a babbling maniac. You have equal chances to act normally, do literally\n\tnothing, <em>hurt yourself<\/em>, or attack the nearest creature, which could\n\tvery well be a tree or an ally. Why would you want to substitute what may be a\n\tslightly annoying status effect for one which takes you out of the fight 3\/4\n\tof the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Rage, Uncanny Dodge, Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Breaker, Drunken Brute, Elemental Kin, Hurler, Savage Barbarian, Superstitious, True Primitive.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"racial-archetypes\">Racial Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/archetypes\/feral-gnasher\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26007\">Feral Gnasher Barbarian Handbook<\/a> (Goblin)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Barbarian is typically a melee striker with a pile of hit points and DR to compensate for their relative lack of AC.
