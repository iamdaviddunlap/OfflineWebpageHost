The only problem is that, as an artificer, you can&#8217;t\n\t\tactually cast all that many spells and the default attacks with either\n\t\tversion of the armor are so good that there&#8217;s rarely a point to using the\n\t\tdamage spells.<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">1st-level Spells<\/span> Magic Missile\n\t\t\t\tironically misses the mark here. Spending one of your limited spells on\n\t\t\t\t3d4+3 damage when an attack with your armor is either going to do\n\t\t\t\t2d6+int or d8+int and taunt feels incredibly wasted. This only becomes\n\t\t\t\tmore evident when you reach level 5 and get extra attack. Thunderwave,\n\t\t\t\ton the other hand, is great. While it does target con saves and is\n\t\t\t\ttherefore more likely to be resisted by monsters, it&#8217;s good damage and\n\t\t\t\tif they fail can help you get a moment to breathe.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span> Mirror image is one\n\t\t\t\tof the best defensive spells out there, and having access to it as\n\t\t\t\tsomeone in heavy armor is exciting. Shatter is underwhelming AOE damage,\n\t\t\t\tbut the Armorer has few other options to handle crowds.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd-level Spells<\/span> Just wow. You get one\n\t\t\t\tof the best AOE control spells and then also the required competitor to\n\t\t\t\tFireball. Admittedly using Lightning Bolt is harder because it&#8217;s a line,\n\t\t\t\tbut that also makes it much easier to aim around your friends.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">4th-level Spells<\/span> Another amazing\n\t\t\t\tlevel. Greater invisibility is a staple spell and the uses for it are\n\t\t\t\tonly limited by your imagination. Fire Shield is great for giving\n\t\t\t\tyourself another resistance if you aren&#8217;t already resistant to both fire\n\t\t\t\tand cold, although the rider effect is a bit wasted as not much should\n\t\t\t\tbe hitting you all that often at this level due to either your high AC\n\t\t\t\tor being removed from melee.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-level Spells<\/span> Passwall at this\n\t\t\t\tlevel is generally only useful if no one else has any spell slots left\n\t\t\t\tfor teleport. Wall of Force, on the other hand, is another incredible\n\t\t\t\tSwiss Army knife of a spell. Section off a fight. Trap someone in a\n\t\t\t\tsphere and walk away. Options abound.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tools of the Trade<\/span> Picking up free armor\n\t\tproficiencies is always a good thing. Heavy armor in particular is required\n\t\tto make one version of the class function and is a lovely side of gravy for\n\t\tthe other. The free smith&#8217;s tools proficiency is a nice piece of flavor but\n\t\tis really just there to make the next part possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Armor<\/span> Robert Downey Jr has nothing\n\t\ton you. You now wear your focus, use full plate with strength 8 and no\n\t\tdrawbacks, and can take it off as an action to sleep. Everything about this\n\t\tis mouthwatering.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Model<\/span> Oh no wait it gets better.\n\t\tWhat would you like your <em>sub<\/em>subclass to be? Guardian gets the only\n\t\tunlimited \u201ctanking\u201d mechanic in the game and the capacity to self-generate\n\t\ttemp hp to help offset the d8 hit die, whie Infiltrator means that you can\n\t\ttake that full plate and walk around in it, quiet as a church mouse. A very\n\t\tfast church mouse. That shoots lightning. It is worth noting that you can\n\t\tchange which model you have as part of a short or long rest, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\toptimizing, you&#8217;re still going to have a primary role that you expect to be\n\t\tin.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra attack<\/span> Very boring, but still very\n\t\tgood<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Modifications<\/span> One of the hardest\n\t\tparts of playing artificer is figuring out where to spend your infusions.\n\t\tBecause they can be given to friends, there can be a legitimate expectation\n\t\tthat you don&#8217;t keep all of them yourself, particularly if you&#8217;re in a\n\t\tlow-magic setting where magic items are harder to come by. This gives you\n\t\ttwo free ones that can only apply to you, thus helping to alleviate part of\n\t\tthe strain. Also, creating extra slots on you means you can have some of the\n\t\tbest options while continuing to wear your suit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Perfected<\/span>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor<\/span> The guardian version of this is good\n\t\tbut competes for your reaction with the other amazing Artificer ability\n\t\tFlash of Genius and, considering that your job is protecting people, only\n\t\tusing your reaction to pull something and punch it when you could be giving\n\t\tthem a massive bonus on, for instance, a save vs finger of death is\n\t\tinevitably going to lead to some moment where you tear your hair out because\n\t\tyou already used your reaction. The Infiltrator version is phenomenal. If\n\t\tyour first attack hits the benefits apply to the second attack so you&#8217;re\n\t\talways going to want to save your extra d6 for the second roll as the\n\t\tadvantage makes it more likely to crit and multiply the bonus die.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Armorer Artificer Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Like any other caster class, your primary stat for Armorer Artificers will be\n\tthat which controls your spells.
