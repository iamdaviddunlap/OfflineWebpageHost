The idea of a fighter who forgoes traditional training in favor of dirty tricks seems like a fun concept. The Cad is excellent at locking down high priority targets like casters or major enemies, but isn&#8217;t spectacular at damage output. if combined with allies who can benefit from crowd control effects (rogues, etc.), the Cad can be a major asset to the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetype-features\">Archetype Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Example Build &#8211; Fist and Flail<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#traits\">Traits<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options.

Everything a fighter would want to take is a combat feat, and there\n\tare enough options that you never have to play the same fighter twice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Mastery<\/span>: DR\/- is great, and you should\n\talways be wearing armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetype-features\">Archetype Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Cad gives up proficiency\n\tin medium armor, heavy armor, and tower shields. It may be worth spending a\n\tfeat on medium armor proficiency so that you can use mithral breastplate, but\n\twithout Armor Training, you won&#8217;t be able to move at full normal speed in\n\tmedium and heavy armor. You need to get into combat quickly, so your movement\n\tspeed is important.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: The Cad add Acrobatics, Bluff,\n\tEscape Artist, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth to their skill list. These fit the\n\tflavor of the Cad well, but the fighter&#8217;s limited skill points don&#8217;t give him\n\ta lot of room to enjoy these bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dirty Maneuvers<\/span>: This is the Cad&#8217;s\n\treplacement for bravery, and fits the flavor of the archetype perfectly.\n\tDisarm and Dirty Trick are crucial for the Cad, and this provides an extremely\n\trare bonus to the Dirty Trick maneuver. Steal can be situationally useful, but\n\tI find that there are generally more important things to do in combat than\n\tpick people&#8217;s pockets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catch Off-Guard<\/span>:\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/feats.html#catch-off-guard\">Catch Off-Guard<\/a>\n\tis a weird feat, but can be very powerful in a Cad&#8217;s hands. Proficiency with\n\timprovised weapons is fairly dull, but treating unarmed opponents as\n\tflat-footed opens up some options for the Cad, especially once he gets Deadly\n\tSurprise at level 7. This is particularly useful against NPC wizards\/sorcerers\n\twho don&#8217;t typically need weapons. Keep in mind that natural weapons count, so\n\tthis isn&#8217;t particularly useful against most monsters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Payback<\/span>: While certainly in keeping with\n\tthe flavor of the archetype, this is strictly worse than Weapon Training. The\n\tCad is good at locking down enemies and preventing them from attacking you (or\n\tdoing anything else interesting). If payback comes into play frequently, the\n\tfight likely isn&#8217;t going well for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadly Surprise<\/span>: Level 7 is basically\n\tchristmas. At this point you should have all of the Dirty Trick feats, which\n\tis great because Deadly Surprise is probably the best thing that has ever\n\thappened to the Dirty Trick maneuver. Dirty trick is, by default, a Standard\n\tAction. With\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/ultimateCombatFeats.html#quick-dirty-trick\">Quick Dirty Trick<\/a>, you can make a single dirty trick attempt per turn in place of your attack\n\twith highest base attack bonus, a limitation which isn&#8217;t placed on other\n\tcombat maneuvers like Trip and Disarm. However, your foe needs to be denied\n\ttheir dexterity bonus to use this ability. Use Quick Dirty Trick to blind your\n\tfoe, then use Deadly Surprise to pile on other status effects.<\/p>\n<p>If you are planning to multiclass into other classes, now is the time to do\n\tit. Deadly Surprise is easily the defining feature of the Cad archetype, and\n\tthe higher level features do little to improve your maneuvers further.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Razor-Sharp Chair Leg<\/span>: Changing the damage\n\ttype for your improvised weapons is cute, but rarely necessary. The 19-20\n\tthreat range with improvised weapons is nice, but isn&#8217;t a game changer. It&#8217;s\n\tmarginally more important when you get Treacherous Blow later, but still not a\n\thuge bonus.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Craven Combatant<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to have\n\tCombat Expertise for your combat maneuver feats, and you will likely be using\n\tit to compensate for your lack of medium and heavy armor. If you are using\n\tcombat expertise, this effectively becomes Improved Uncanny Dodge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sweeping Prank<\/span>: At this point, you should\n\tbe getting to use dirty trick frequently due to Deadly Surprise, which makes\n\tSweeping Prank only useful on surprise rounds in which you start adjacent to\n\ttwo foes or in rounds in which you need to move. Even then, you could simulate\n\tthis effect by using Cleave and have the added benefit of dealing damage. At\n\t17th level you can use this ability against 2+dex modifier targets. This is\n\tmarginally better, but still only situationally useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Treacherous Blow<\/span>: Because you&#8217;re limited\n\tto a single immediate action per round, this won&#8217;t let you use Dirty Trick\n\tmore often, it simply provides a way to use it when your target isn&#8217;t denied\n\ttheir attack bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ultimate Payback<\/span>: This is a great\n\timprovement on Payback, but isn&#8217;t going to be particularly helpful unless your\n\tbuild focuses on critical hits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Any melee character&#8217;s\n\tbread-and-butter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Potentially more important than\n\tConstitution on a Cad, dexterity adds to your relatively low AC, improves your\n\tCMD, and improves your reflex saves. You need at least 13 for Combat\n\tExpertise. Of course, if you need AC you can always use Combat Reflexes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Con<\/span>: You have d10 hit points and strong\n\tfortitude saves, but more constitution can only help.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: You need 13 for Combat Expertise, but\n\twon&#8217;t benefit much from anything past that. 14 might be nice for skill points,\n\tbut isn&#8217;t worth the points if you&#8217;re using point buy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: The only real benefit you get here is\n\twill saves. While will saves are certainly important, your other abilities\n\tneed more focus. Plus, you can always take Iron Will if you need it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump to 7. Completely useless on a Cad.\n\tYour archetype is about fighting dirty, not about making friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:18<\/li>\n<li>Dex:14<\/li>\n<li>Con:12<\/li>\n<li>Int:13<\/li>\n<li>Wis:12<\/li>\n<li>Cha:7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:17<\/li>\n<li>Dex:14<\/li>\n<li>Con:12<\/li>\n<li>Int:13<\/li>\n<li>Wis:10<\/li>\n<li>Cha:7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:15<\/li>\n<li>Dex:14<\/li>\n<li>Con:12<\/li>\n<li>Int:13<\/li>\n<li>Wis:12<\/li>\n<li>Cha:7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:15<\/li>\n<li>Dex:14<\/li>\n<li>Con:12<\/li>\n<li>Int:13<\/li>\n<li>Wis:10<\/li>\n<li>Cha:8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t any races that give you bonuses to Dirty Trick.\n\tInstead, look for races with bonus strength and\/or bonus feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Dwarves are excellent fighters\n\tnormally. Bonus Constitution and Wisdom make them very durable, a +2 on saves\n\tagainst spells is fantastic, and Darkvision is always helpful. However, they\n\tdon&#8217;t bring anything specifically useful to the Cad archetype.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The bonuses to Dexterity and\n\tIntelligence are nice, but the penalty to constitution is problematic. If you\n\tplan a weird class dip into a spellcasting class, Elf could be a good choice.\n\tOtherwise, Elf doesn&#8217;t really help the Cad at all.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Gnomes are small, which gives them a\n\t-2 penalty to the ever-important CMB. The strength penalty brings another -1,\n\trendering them wholly useless for a Cad.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Elf<\/span>: That variable ability bonus goes\n\tstraight into strength. If you are planning a class dip, Half-Elf is a good\n\tchoice due to Multitalented. Their other racial bonuses are situationally\n\tuseful, and there are lots of good choices for alternate racial traits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Variable ability bonus to\n\tstrength. Beyond the ability bonus, Darkvision is really the only thing\n\tHalf-Orcs bring to the table. About on-par with Dwarves, but certainly nothing\n\tto get excited about.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Halfling<\/span>: Halflings suffer the same issues\n\tthat Gnomes do. Their racial skill bonuses and dexterity bonus are mildly\n\tuseful, but not nearly enough to justify a net -3 to CMB.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: I can&#8217;t hear you over that +2 bonus\n\tto strength. The real trade-off here is whether you want a bonus feat or the\n\tHalf-Elf Multitalented trait. The human skill bonus matters very little for a\n\tfighter, even with the Cad archetype, but a bonus feat opens up a lot of\n\toptions. If you aren&#8217;t planning a class dip, you would be hard-pressed to find\n\ta better option than Human.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Civilized<\/span> (Social): Knowledge (Local) can\n\t\tbe a fairly useful skill depending on your group&#8217;s play style, and throwing\n\t\ta rank into it for the +3 class skill bonus can give you an extra way to\n\t\tcontribute to the party out of combat. The +1 bonus to Knowledge (Nobility)\n\t\tprobably won&#8217;t do anything for you, unfortunately.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Friend in Every Town<\/span> (Social): Knowledge\n\t\t(Local) and Diplomacy are both fantastic skills, but your charisma is\n\t\tprobably garbage, so Civilized is probably the better option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Savage<\/span> (Social): Knowledge (Nature) is a\n\t\tgood option for dropping a single rank to diversify your party&#8217;s knowledge\n\t\tset, especially if your party doesn&#8217;t have any druids or rangers. The +1 to\n\t\tsurvival is also nice since Survival is a class skill for fighters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): A +2 bonus to\n\t\tinitiative is never a bad choice, but remember that you can only have one\n\t\ttrait of each type, and you really want Surprise Weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Surprise Weapon<\/span> (Combat): If you plan to\n\t\tuse improvised weapons (and you should), this is an absolute must. A +2\n\t\tbonus from a trait is better than you will from any feat at roughly half the\n\t\tcost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warrior of Old<\/span> (Elf Racial): +2 to\n\t\tinitiative is fantastic, and this won&#8217;t take up your much more useful Combat\n\t\ttrait.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elven Reflexes<\/span> (Half-Elf Racial): +2 to\n\t\tinitiative is fantastic, and this won&#8217;t take up your much more useful Combat\n\t\ttrait.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With only 2+ skill points, your options are somewhat limited. Cad gives you some extra skill options, but you have limited ability to cover all of your available skills. You will need 13 intelligence for Combat Expertise, so you&#8217;re probably looking at 3 skill points, maybe 4 if you&#8217;re human.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span>: Mobility is important for any\n\t\tmelee fighter, and Acrobatics can help you get into position to do work. You\n\t\tmay not have the feats to devote to Dodge and Mobility, so Acrobatics can\n\t\thelp you move through combat easily.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bluff<\/span>: You&#8217;re likely going to dump\n\t\tcharisma, so this won&#8217;t do you much good unless you&#8217;re planning a class dip\n\t\tinto something more socail.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Escape Artist<\/span>: You have full BAB and a high\n\t\tstrength, which will get you out of any grapples or nets which would require\n\t\tEscape Artists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span>: Even though it&#8217;s cross-class,\n\t\tPerception will see more use than any other skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sleight of Hand<\/span>: This is only situationally\n\t\tuseful on your skill monkey, and won&#8217;t see much use on a fighter. If you\n\t\tneed to rob someone, use the Steal combat maneuver.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span>: Depending on how your group\n\t\tapproaches a fight, Stealth can get a lot of mileage. Follow along behind\n\t\tthe rogue and use Stealth to get into a good position before the weapons\n\t\tcome out.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Survival<\/span>: Perhaps the best skill choice\n\t\tfor single-class fighters, Survival lets you do some useful stuff outside of\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Like any fighter, the Cad depends heavily on feats. Fortunately, you get plenty of them. With normal feats at every odd-numbered level and bonus feats at every eaven-numbered level, you get a feat at every level (and two\/three at first).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Expertise<\/span>: The starting feat in all\n\t\tof the combat maneuver feat trees. Combat Expertise will also help to\n\t\tcompensate for your low AC. Take this at level 1.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improvised Weapon Mastery<\/span>: Redundant with\n\t\tRazor-Sharp Chair Leg, and the damage bonus is negligible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Disarm<\/span>: Disarming an opponent\n\t\tlets you bring improvised weapons into play, and further wastes your\n\t\topponents actions by forcing them to retreive\/replace their lost weapon.\n\t\tDirty Maneuvers also adds a small bonus to your disarm checks, which makes\n\t\tDisarm easy to optimize.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Disarm<\/span>: The +2 bonus to disarm\n\t\tis nice, but moving the weapon 15 away in a random direction is only\n\t\toccasionally useful. Your enemies will probably be too busy un-blinding\n\t\tthemselves to go hunting for their weapons, and I like the idea of them\n\t\tspending every one of their turns un-blinding themselves and picking up\n\t\ttheir weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Dirty Trick<\/span>: One of the precious\n\t\tfew bonuses you can get to your CMB with Dirty Trick, and required for other\n\t\tDirty Trick feats. Since Dirty Trick won&#8217;t be your go-to option until mid\n\t\tlevels, you can wait to take this until level 5.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Dirty Trick<\/span>: This is the key to\n\t\tmaking Dirty Trick effective. Not only does it extend the duration of Dirty\n\t\tTrick effects from 1 round to 1d4 rounds, but they require a standard action\n\t\tto remove early. That means blinding someone with Dirty Trick is now a huge\n\t\thindrance since they have to waste their standard action to make themselves\n\t\tuseful again. The +2 bonus is also nice since CMB bonuses for Dirty Trick\n\t\tare rare. Don&#8217;t forget that every 5 by which you pass the targets CMD adds\n\t\tan additional round to the effect as normal. Take at level 6 or 7 depending\n\t\ton if you want Quick Dirty Trick first or second.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Trip<\/span>: While you don&#8217;t get a\n\t\tclass bonus to Trip, tripping is right in your wheelhouse.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Trip<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to spend\n\t\tresources on tripping, go all-in. Greater trip lets you trip targets, then\n\t\tuse your attack of opportunity to hit them, which then lets you use Deadly\n\t\tSurprise. Imagine in one attack tripping, hitting, then blinding your\n\t\ttarget. If you&#8217;re full attacking, your target is now prone (+2 to melee\n\t\tattacks) and blind (flat-footed, and another +2 to attacks).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Steal<\/span>: Despite your class bonus\n\t\tto this maneuver, Steal is still not a fantastic option. If you&#8217;re worried\n\t\tabout an attack of opportunity, use Dirty Trick to blind the target. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re worried about failing the combat maneuver check, use Dirty Trick to\n\t\tentangled the target. A -4 penalty to strength and dexterity nets a sizeable\n\t\t-4 penalty to CMD.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Greater Steal<\/span>: I can&#8217;t think of any reason\n\t\twhy you would want this. If you are stealing this much, you should have been\n\t\ta rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Dirty Trick<\/span>: This is the key to your\n\t\tpotential as a Cad. Take at level 6 or 7. With Quick Dirty Trick, you can\n\t\tstart doing full attacks to pile status effects on enemies and effectively\n\t\tremove them from combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: you already need\n\t\tresonable dexterity for combat maneuvers, so Combat Reflexes becomes an\n\t\texcellent option. You can use Deadly Surprise with attacks of opportunity,\n\t\tso you can in theory hit enemies and use Dirty Trick to entangle them and\n\t\tprevnet them from moving away.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fleet<\/span>: A +5 bonus to speed is nice, but\n\t\tI don&#8217;t know if I would spend a feat on it when there are so many other good\n\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Fortitude<\/span>: You are on the front\n\t\tlines, and are going to get hit with a lot of stuff. Buffing your saves will\n\t\tkeep you alive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavy Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Without Armor\n\t\tTraining, heavy armor will hurt your mobility too much to make it\n\t\tviable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Critical<\/span>: If you reach high\n\t\tenough levels to get the Cad&#8217;s critical-centric abilities, this is\n\t\tdefinitely worth taking for imrpovised weapons. I wouldn&#8217;t take this before\n\t\tlevel 15 unless you are already spending feats on critical hit effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Will<\/span>: You are on the front lines,\n\t\tand are going to get hit with a lot of stuff. Buffing your saves will keep\n\t\tyou alive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lunge<\/span>: Reach is any fighter&#8217;s friend,\n\t\tand a Cad makes for a great battlefield control fighter. The penalty to AC\n\t\tis hard for a light-armor fighter, but when combined with Combat Expertise,\n\t\tLunge effectively lets you trade some attack bonus for extra reach. When\n\t\tcombined with Enlarge Person, your reach goes up to 15 feet. While this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t affect attacks of opportunity (the effect ends at the end of your\n\t\tturn), it lets you hit several spread out targets, which can be\n\t\thelpful..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: You are on the front\n\t\tlines, and are going to get hit with a lot of stuff. Buffing your saves will\n\t\tkeep you alive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Medium Armor Proficiency<\/span>: When you are\n\t\thigh enough level to afford mithral breastplate, this may be a good choice.\n\t\tYou need a lot of help with your AC, and mithral breastplate won&#8217;t sacrifice\n\t\tmobility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Attack<\/span>: Power Attack gives you a\n\t\tlot of options for dealing damage. However, you&#8217;re going to be frequently\n\t\tusing combat expertise, which can make power attack less useful. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tdoing well locking down targets with Dirty Trick, you can switch to power\n\t\tattack to take advantage of your targets&#8217; reduce AC.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Precise Strike<\/span>: If you are flanking\n\t\tfrequently, this is a decent choice to improve your damage output. It&#8217;s not\n\t\tgoing to bridge the gap between you and a DPS-centric character, but it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t hurt. If you&#8217;re Two-Weapon Fighting, this gets even better since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re making extra attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Quick Draw<\/span>: At some point during a fight,\n\t\tyou may want to switch to an improvised weapon. This feat is the difference\n\t\tbetween a single attack and a full attack at least once during a fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Toughness<\/span>: Since we aren&#8217;t spending a lot\n\t\tof resources on constitution, toughness can be crucial. Your AC is going to\n\t\tbe fairly low, so this will give you some much-needed durability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Two-Weapon Fighting\n\t\tis a tempting proposition, especially when the Cad&#8217;s high level abilities\n\t\tmake critical hits more important. More attacks means potentially more\n\t\topportunities to use Deadly Surprise. If you&#8217;re going this route, definitely\n\t\tuse a shield as your off-hand weapon to compensate for your relatively low\n\t\tAC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Focus \/ Weapon Specialization<\/span>:\n\t\tSince Cad is a weird build, weapon focus and weapon specialization can be\n\t\thard to use. If you find that improvised weapons are working for you, take\n\t\tfocus and specialization with improvised weapons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Any fighter is defined at least partially by their choice of weapon. The Cad is no exception. Since you are built for combat maneuvers, we want weapons that will give us bonuses to our favorite combat maneuvers. At levels 15 and higher, a high critical threat range can be helpful to take advantage of Treacherous Blow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dire Flail<\/span>: All of the fantastic\n\t\tbenefits of a flail, plus you can use Two-weapon fighting. Flails don&#8217;t have\n\t\ta light weapon equivalent, so this one of the very few times I would ever\n\t\tsuggest using a double weapon. Of course, it is only useful if you devote\n\t\tyourself heavily to a two-weapon fighting build, and doing so can be very\n\t\tdifficult without a lot of payoff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Kukri<\/span>: If you want to go for critical\n\t\thits, Two-weapon fighting with Kukris is probably the way to do it. You can\n\t\ttake weapon focus\/specialization with kukri and apply the bonus to both\n\t\thands.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flail<\/span>: While the damage and crit range\n\t\taren&#8217;t fantastic, +2 bonuses to disarm and the ability to make trip attacks\n\t\tmake this the Cad&#8217;s weapon of choice at least until they&#8217;re high enough\n\t\tlevel to care about critical hit effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heavy Flail<\/span>: all the same benefits as a\n\t\tflail with better damage and crit range. The marginally improved damage\n\t\toutput may not be worth using a two-handed weapon depending on your play\n\t\tstyle. Adding Power Attack makes this a more worthwhile choice, but if you\n\t\tneed the AC bonus there&#8217;s absolutely nothing wrong with sticking to a normal\n\t\tflail and a shield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improvised Weapons<\/span>: Carry a few empty\n\t\tbottles and broken chair legs to whip out when the time is right. Carry\n\t\tspares so that you can discard them when you&#8217;re done or when you need to\n\t\tswitch tactics. However, you will have problems with damage reduction unless\n\t\tyou have someone to cast magic weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scimitar<\/span>: If you&#8217;re dual-weilding, you may\n\t\tbe able to get away with a scimitar in one hand and an improvised weapon or\n\t\tkukri in the other. But at that point, why even bother with a scimitar when\n\t\ta second kukri or improvised weapon would save you feats and resources?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brawling<\/span> (+1): Add your enhancement\n\t\tbonus to all of your combat maneuvers.

The Breaker archetype caters well to improvised weapons, though\n\t\tthe damage bonus builds slowly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue<\/span>: The cad is fantastic at allowing\n\t\tsneak attack damage. Using Dirty Trick to blind the target makes for easy\n\t\tsneak attacks, or you can disarm the target and hit them with an improvised\n\t\tweapon. Sneak attack gives you some useful skills, and brings a lot of extra\n\t\tdamage to a fairly low-damage build. Unchained Rogue is strictly better than\n\t\tclassic Rogue, so use the unchained version if possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Fist and Flail<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>Why would anyone ever fight fair?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a buckler, a flail, and a spiked gauntlet. Most of the time you will be fighting with the flail two-handed (and taking the -1 penalty to attacks from your buckler unless you think to take it off first) at low levels, but options will evolve over time as you acquire feats. The Cad really hits its stride at level 7 when he receives Deadly Surprise, so we will need to find ways to make yourself important and useful at low levels.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We will assume the 25-point buy abilities suggested above, but the other suggested abilities can also use this build without any problems.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For this example build, we will use a Half-Elf with the suggested ability scores described above.

We will maximize Acrobatics, and spread the rest of the points between Climb, Knowledge (Dungeoneering), Stealth, Survival, and Swim over our first few levels in order to get the +3 class skill bonus. Once we have a rank in all of our skills, we can put those extra 2 ranks into Perception every level until we&#8217;re caught up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we hit level 8 and multiclass into Rogue, Perception will become a class skill and get that wonderful +3 bonus. Use the rogue skill ranks to diversify your skill set further, or to address gaps in your party&#8217;s skill set. You&#8217;re not going to supplant a dedicated skill monkey, but you&#8217;re a great candidate to Assist Other on skill checks.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Surprise Weapon (Combat) and Elven Reflexes (Racial).<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s)<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><th>1 &#8211; Fighter<\/th><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Combat Expertise<\/li>\n<li>Power Attack<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td> <p>At first level, you&#8217;re a fairly generic sword-and-board fighter. Switch between Combat Expertise and Power Attack as the situation warrants. Remember that you can forego your buckler&#8217;s bonus to AC in order to ignore the -1 penalty that it applies to your attacks. Power Attack becomes a high risk, high reward option for you. If you are flanking or your opponent is otherwise vulnerable, use your flail two-handed and power attack.

A +4 bonus to attack a prone foe can make or break important attacks at nearly any level.<\/p>\n\n<p>Combat Expertise\/Power Attack penalties apply to Combat Maneuver checks, as they are technically attacks. For poorly armored targets, use power attack on the turn that you trip. When they try to stand up, you can apply your power attack bonus to the opportunity attack, and +4 bonus to attack prone foes will offset the penalty. Also remember that opportunity attack take place <em>before<\/em> the action which provokes them, so you can&#8217;t trip the target to prevent them from standing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Favored class bonus: 1 Extra Hit Point<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>3 &#8211; Fighter<\/th><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved Disarm<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>3rd level brings the &#8220;Catch Off-Guard&#8221; bonus feat, which allows you to treat unarmed opponents as flat-footed when you use an improvised weapon. Disarm opponents using your flail, then hold your flail in you off-hand and use your buckler and an improvised weapon. Treating your enemy as flat footed can cost them a good deal of AC, especially on lightly armored foes. Don&#8217;t forget that enemies with natural weapons are always considered armed, so fall back on your Combat Expertise\/Power Attack tactics when you see something with claws.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can also use Improved Disarm (Standard action to make one attack), then spend your move action to retreive your enemy&#8217;s weapon with your empty hand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Favored class bonus: 1 Extra Hit Point<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>4 &#8211; Fighter<\/th><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved Dirty Trick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Improved Dirty trick gets us moving toward our intended Cad mechanic. However, Dirty Trick is still a standard action, and the effect can be removed with a move action even if you succeed. At this point, you may be more successful applying low-impact status effects liked Shaken or Sickened, since your enemy will be less tempted to spend time removing them. This will hopefully mean that the target will remain debuffed for a round or two, allowing your team to take advantage of the target&#8217;s reduced AC and saves. If you have a rogue who gets their turn between you and the target, take a risk and go for Blind. Blinding the target will make your rogue considerably more effective.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because Dirty Trick is a standard action, you will probably not be using it constantly. Save it for high-priority targets like solo monsters or enemy leaders so that you can maximize its effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the first time that iterative attacks really come into play. Remember that Trip and Disarm can replace melee attacks, so you can use your primary hand to trip with a flail, and use your off hand to attack enemies after tripping or disarming them and have a nice advantage.<\/p>\n\n<p>Favored class bonus: 1 Extra Hit Point<\/p>\n<p>Ability Score increase: Strength<\/p>\n<p>Favored class bonus: 1 Extra Hit Point<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>5 &#8211; Fighter<\/th><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Combat Reflexes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>5th level brings the Payback ability.

Our first iterative attack, and Quick Dirty Trick. Quick Dirty trick lets you give up your first attack (the one with the +6 bonus) to make a Dirty Trick Attempt. Use it to entangle your target, dropping their strength and dexterity by 4 each, and thereby lowering their CMD by 4. Use your second attack to trip or disarm them while their CMD is garbage. On their turn, they can either spend their whole turn undoing what you did, or they can continue to be entangled\/disarmed\/tripped while they limp around trying to do something interesting. Either way, you&#8217;ve succeeded in hindering your target.<\/p>\n\n<p>You also get the second bonus point from Dirty Maneuvers, which gives you a much-needed +2 to both Dirty Trick and Disarm.

Since you&#8217;re more likely to hit due to your charge bonus, you&#8217;re more likely to get a free Dirty Trick attempt. Use the attempt to blind your target. If they waste their standard action to remove the blind effect, they can&#8217;t attack you. If they attack you, you have a 50% chance that they automatically miss, which easily covers the -2 to AC for charging.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you make a full attack, you can either attack or trade in your primary attack for a guranteed Dirty Trick, depending on how much trouble your enemy is giving you. Either way, blind the target. Now that they&#8217;re flat-footed and you get a further +2 bonus to attack them, use your secondary attack to hit them and use the free Dirty Trick to entangle them. Now they can&#8217;t see, they can&#8217;t move, and they have to waste a standard action to fix one of the conditions. They can&#8217;t fix both in one turn.<\/p>\n\n<p>If your target is unfortunate enough suffer multiple Dirty Trick effects, apply them in this order: Blind (easier to hit), Entangle (lowered CMD), Sickened (lower attack, damage, and saves), Shaken (lower attack and saves), Deafened. If the target is a spellcaster, consider deafening them first so that they suffer the 20% chance to fail spells with verbal components.
