You don&#8217;t get any Rage powers, so it&#8217;s not quite as cool, but it&#8217;s a fun tactical option when you want to turn on your rage and ruin someone&#8217;s day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hateful Retort<\/span> (Ex): This is a cool way to\n\tget a free attack, but it&#8217;s only once per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Anger<\/span> (Ex): Rage is pretty great,\n\tand combined with your Judgement ability you can do some serious damage. You\n\tget rounds at half the rate that Barbarians do, so be sure to save these\n\trounds for important encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"black-powder-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/inquisitor.html#black-powder-inquisition\">Black Powder Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You get the ability to use and repair guns and a really lousy ability to debuff arcane spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Granted Powers<\/span>: Firearms are decent weapons,\n\tbut they&#8217;re not very exciting without Grit. The debuff on arcane spellcasters\n\tis insultingly bad; it allows a save to resist, and doesn&#8217;t even force a\n\tconcentration check unless you prepared an action. If you really want to use\n\tfirearms as an Inquisitor, be sure to take Amateur Gunslinger or a level of\n\tGunslinger. Of course, one level of Gunslinger makes this inquisition totally\n\tuseless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"conversion-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#conversion-inquisition\">Conversion Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Conversion Inquisition is fantastic for an Inquisitor hoping to play the party&#8217;s Face. Charm of Wisdom makes Wisdom an extremely powerful ability score and removes your need to purchase multi-ability enhancement items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Charm of Wisdom<\/span> (Ex): This makes Charisma a\n\tdump stat without cutting into your ability to serve as a face.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Swaying Word<\/span> (Sp): The save DC will keep\n\tpace with the highest level spells available to your party, and Dominate\n\tPerson is one of the most effective spells in the game. However, you only get\n\tone use per day, so be sure to use it on someone likely to fail their Will\n\tsave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fate-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#fate-inquisition\">Fate Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fate Inquisition can be easily replaced by two spells cast by a 3rd level Cleric. Augury is a 2nd level spell, and all of the effects of Agent of Fate can be reproduced or replaced by 1st level Cleric spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Augury<\/span> (Sp): Augury is a great divination,\n\tbut it&#8217;s only a second level spell.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Agent of Fate<\/span> (Su): This is a really cool\n\tability, but it&#8217;s only usable once per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fervor-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#fervor-inquisition\">Fervor Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fire of Belief is garbage, but Fervent Action is pretty cool. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to know when best to use effects like Fervent Action, so it may be one of those abilities that you keep saving until you eventually realize that you have never used it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire of Belief<\/span> (Sp): The Inquisitor is no\n\tslouch in combat, and they have plenty of ranged combat options. The only\n\treally redeeming qualities of this ability are the alignment affects and that\n\tthe ray is a ranged touch attack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fervent Action<\/span> (Ex): Any one of these\n\tactions could turn the tide of battle in your favor, but it&#8217;s only once per\n\tday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"heresy-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#heresy-inquisition\">Heresy Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Heresy Inquisition is a slightly grumpier version of the Conversion domain. Either one works for an Inquisitor acting as the party&#8217;s Face. The Heresy Inquisition also has a third ability, which is unusual for inquisitions. Even without Word of Anathema, the Heresy Inquisition is fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Righteous Infiltration<\/span> (Ex): Note quite as\n\tgood as the Conversion domain&#8217;s Charm of Wisdom power, but this still greatly\n\treduces your need for Charisma when you want to play a Face.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blessed Infiltration<\/span> (Ex): A reroll on a d20\n\tworks out to something like a +5 bonus, which may very well be the difference\n\tbetween your Charisma and Wisdom scores. Rerolls on any roll are fantastic,\n\tand not only do you get to reroll, you get to take the higher roll, and you\n\tcan use this multiple times per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Word of Anathema<\/span> (Sp): Throw this on\n\tsomething big and scary, and watch it proceed to stumble its way into an early\n\tgrave. Be sure to use this on something with a low Will save because you only\n\tget one use per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"imprisonment-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#imprisonment-inquisition\">Imprisonment Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Imprisonment Inquisition is a cool concept, but the abilities are basically impossible to rely on. You can almost never expect Caging Strike to work, and you can only use Divine Prison once per day. You&#8217;re better off just throwing a net.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Caging Strike<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s nice being able to\n\tuse this multiple times per day, but it&#8217;s awfully difficult to count on\n\tcritical hits when you don&#8217;t get proficiency with anything with a threat range\n\tbetter than 20.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Prison<\/span>: This is a fantastic save or\n\tsuck effect, but you only get to use it once per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"illumination-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#illumination-inquisition\">Illumination Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Illuminating Touch is a decent buff, though not very exciting, and Aura of Enlightenment is really hard to justify when you can use Aid Another and cast Daylight to achieve the same effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Illuminating Touch<\/span> (Sp): A one hour\n\tduration is pretty great, and you can use this multiple times in a day. Before\n\tyou go into a fight with something that likes to force Will saves, throw this\n\ton everyone in your party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Enlightenment<\/span> (Su): This is a\n\tweird ability. You can neutralize the Darkness spell, and your allies gain a\n\tbonus to skill checks for some reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"justice-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#justice-inquisition\">Justice Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both abilities are awful and they have nothing to do with each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Judicious Force<\/span> (Su): This is only important\n\tif someone in your party is built for critical hits, and if they&#8217;re built for\n\tcritical hits they already have critical focus. Otherwise it&#8217;s just a very\n\tinfrequent chance to high-five someone who is already doing something awesome\n\twithout your help.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Chains of Justice<\/span> (Su): This makes dissuades\n\tyour allies from attacking the target of your chains, but allows the target to\n\tattack your allies with impunity. Why would you buff your enemies?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oblivion-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#oblivion-inquisition\">Oblivion Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Life Anchor should not come up often enough to justify its existence, and while Stare of Oblivion is cool and reasonably effective, save-or-suck effects should be left for those who can produce a better DC and a better duration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Life Anchor<\/span> (Su): You should do your best\n\tto never need this ability. If you ever need this ability, you have done\n\tsomething wrong.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Stare of Oblivion<\/span> (Sp): The base DC will\n\tkeep pace with the highest level spells available to your party, and\n\tFeeblemind is a great save-or-suck for arcane spellcasters, Paladins, and a\n\tlong list of other creatures and roles. The effect only lasts 1d4 rounds, but\n\tthat should be plenty of time to tackle and subdue enemy spellcasters. You can\n\tuse it multiple time per day, which is nice if your targets pass the first\n\tsave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#order-inquisition\">Order Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Order Inquisition is right on the line between <span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> and <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span>. Mantle of Chaos is good, but situational, and Commanding Order is good, but not great. If you expect to face a lot of chaotic enemies, this is more on the side of <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mantle against Chaos<\/span> (Sp): Protection from\n\tAlignment is a great set of spells. Protection from Chaos is one of the less\n\treliable ones since most campaigns tend be a good vs. evil dynamic. If your\n\tcampaign involves hunting lots of hippies, anarchists, and abberations than\n\tthis can be very useful. Of course, Protection from Chaos is a first level\n\tspell, so this isn&#8217;t terribly powerful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Commanding Order<\/span> (Sp): Clerics get Greater\n\tCommand as a 5th level spell one level later, their DC will be better, and\n\tthey can affect multiple targets. Still, you can replicate a 5th level spell\n\t3+ times per day for free. Command your enemies to Halt, and they are\n\teffectively Dazed for 1 round per Inquisitor level, effectively removing them\n\tfrom the fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"persistence-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#persistence-inquisition\">Persistence Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A bonus feat, a swift-action speed boost, and a once per day use of Lay on Hands give you some fantastic options to get you into melee and keep you there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Powers<\/span>: Step Up is a great feat\n\twhen fighting enemies using spells or ranged attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Relentless Footing<\/span> (Ex): This does not\n\tlist a duration, so I would assume that it lasts for one round, but check with\n\tyour GM. Because this is such a short duration, it should be saved for rounds\n\twhen you need extra mobility; escaping, charging, dodging past enemies,\n\tetc.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inner Strength<\/span> (Su): This is basically Lay\n\ton Hands once per day with a couple of Mercies to removed some fairly common\n\tconditions. Many of the conditions are very debilitating (particularly\n\tblinded, confused, nauseated, and Staggered), and removing them gets you back\n\tinto the fight without cutting into your normal action economy for the\n\tround.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"spellkiller-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/inquisitor.html#spellkiller-inquisition\">Spellkiller Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities are among the toughest enemies in the game, and they become more common at higher levels. The Spellkiller Inquisition gives you some good options for handling spellcasters, and a nice AC buff for defeating any random enemy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Powers<\/span>: Disruptive is a great feat\n\tfor killing spellcasters, but you need to stay within reach so make sure that\n\tyou take Step Up to keep enemies from stepping out of reach to cast spells.\n\tSacred\/Profane bonuses are extremely rare, so the AC boost is nice.\n\tUnfortunately, staggering a spellcaster doesn&#8217;t hurt them much because they\n\tstill get their standard action to cast spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tactics-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#tactics-inquisition\">Tactics Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant the Initiative is so fantastic that it&#8217;s almsost good enough to offset\n\thow lame Inquisitor&#8217;s Direction is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Inquisitor&#8217;s Direction<\/span> (Su): If the best you\n\tcan do is grant an ally some minor buffs and a free attack for one round, you\n\tare not a useful character. You need to be within 30 feet to use it, so you\n\tshould be getting into melee to make some of your own attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grant the Initiative<\/span> (Ex): This would be\n\tblue if it only applied to you. Initiative bonuses are amazing. If this means\n\tmoving the enemies even one space lower in the iniative order, it could mean\n\tthe difference between a flawless victory and a crippling defeat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"torture-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#torture-inquisition\">Torture Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This Inquisition can be replaced by one feat, a cantrip, and two skill ranks. A pile of stuff you could easily get at level 1 is not worth your single Inquisition choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Torturer&#8217;s Presence<\/span> (Ex): Need some more\n\tIntimidate? Here you go.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Torturer&#8217;s Touch<\/span> (Sp): Touch of Fatigue is a\n\tcantrip, and a poor one at that.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Critical Precision<\/span> (Ex): If you want to build\n\tfor critical hits, just take Critical Focus. Also, don&#8217;t be a class with 2\/3\n\tBAB.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"truth-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#truth-inquisition\">Truth Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Truth Inquisition can be replaced by the Guidance spell and the Zone of Truth spell, both of which are on the Inquisitor spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Justice&#8217;s True Path<\/span> (Sp): Like Guidance on\n\tcrack. Good for stuff like opening locks, disarming traps, or other things\n\twhich are quick to do but generally don&#8217;t happen in combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Grasp of Honesty<\/span> (Su): By the time you get\n\tthis ability, you have had Zone of Truth available for four levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"valor-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#valor-inquisition\">Valor Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like the spell Remove Fear? Well then this Inquisition is great! Because that is all that this Inquisiton does: remove fear. If Fear is such an issue for you, play a Paladin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Touch of Resolve<\/span> (Sp): Remove Fear is a first\n\tlevel spell for a huge number of classes, including Inquisitors.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fearless<\/span> (Su): Fear effects are generally\n\tvery gentle, and can be easily overcome with a number of sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"vengeance-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#vengeance-inquisition\">Vengeance Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should never want or need either of these abilities. Get a bow and don&#8217;t die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Retribution<\/span> (Sp): An amusing\n\tlow-level damage option. This would be great for Clerics, but Inquisitors have\n\taccess to better weapons and should be able to do more damage at range.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Final Vengeance<\/span> (Su): You should be working\n\tvery hard to never need this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"zeal-inquisition\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/inquisitor.html#zeal-inquisition\">Zeal Inquisition<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your campaign involves actively persecuting one group of people for their religious beliefs, you should feel bad, but this Inquisition might be useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Zealous Surge<\/span> (Sp): You never want to need\n\tthis, but it&#8217;s a cool way to keep you in the fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Scourge of the Enemy<\/span> (Ex): Hugely\n\tsituational. This would only make sense in a campaign where you are actively\n\thunting members of one religion, and most campaigns involve a cosniderably\n\tmore diverse set of opponents.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Inquisitions are primarily for Inquisitors, but Clerics and Druids can take them if they decide that they want to give up free spell slots for some reason.
