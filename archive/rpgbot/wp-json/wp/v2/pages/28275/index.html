While you lack the full range of healing capabilities\n\tavailable to spellcasters, the rate at which you can convert Focus Points into\n\thit points is impressive, and Way of Mercy eventually gains the ability to\n\tremove status conditions and even raise the dead at very high levels. This\n\tallows the Monk to add Healer to their staple roles as a Scout and Striker,\n\tthough you can&#8217;t compete with classes like the Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hand of Harm<\/span>: One Focus Point point to\n\t\tautomatically deal roughly as much damage as an Unarmed Strike is more\n\t\tefficient than spending a Focus Point to perform a Flurry of Blows which has\n\t\ta chance to miss. This is also necrotic damage, which is much less-commonly\n\t\tresisted than bludgeoning damage (or whatever type your weapon deals).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since the damage is &#8220;extra damage&#8221; added to the attack, the extra damage\n\t\t\tdie is multiplied on critical hits, much like Divine Smite or Sneak\n\t\t\tAttack, so the most effective time to use Hand of Harm is when you score a\n\t\t\tcritical hit.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, this only works after you hit with an Unarmed Strike. If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tusing a weapon, there&#8217;s an incentive to fight unarmed even if your Martial\n\t\t\tArts die would deal less damage than a weapon. Of course, Flurry of Blows\n\t\t\tand Martial Arts&#8217; Bonus Action attack only allow Unarmed Strikes, so\n\t\t\tthere&#8217;s always going to be some portion of your attacks where you can\n\t\t\tapply this.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Physician&#8217;s Touch later improves Hand of Harm to add the Poisoned\n\t\t\tcondition, making it an amazing way to briefly debuff enemies without a\n\t\t\tsave.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hand of Healing<\/span>: Your Martial Arts die\n\t\tplus your Wisdom modifier is roughly equivalent to a 1st-level Healing Word.\n\t\tThat&#8217;s not a ton of healing all at once, but you get a ton of Focus Points\n\t\tper Short Rest as you gain levels, and the action economy around this is\n\t\tfantastic. This is also a great way to expend your remaining Focus Points\n\t\twhenever you reach a Short Rest.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>While you <em>can<\/em> use Hand of Healing as an Action, there&#8217;s almost\n\t\t\tno reason to do so in combat. Spending your Action to heal in small\n\t\t\tamounts turns combat into an attrition fight, and players\n\t\t\t<em>always<\/em> lose attrition fights.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Generally you&#8217;ll use Hand of Healing during combat as part of a Flurry of\n\t\t\tBlows. When you do this, you spend the Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows,\n\t\t\tthen you can decide to replace one of the Unarmed Strikes with Hand of\n\t\t\tHealing. As far as I can tell, you can make this decision at any point, so\n\t\t\tyou could make one attack and see the results before deciding if you want\n\t\t\tto make another attack or heal something.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Since you can move between attacks, I believe that you can also move\n\t\t\tbetween attacking and using Hand of Healing, so you could use Flurry of\n\t\t\tBlows to heal an ally and then run over to an enemy and attack them some\n\t\t\tmore.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>In many ways, this is like Healing Word, and until your Focus Point pool\n\t\t\tis fairly large, that&#8217;s how you should consider Hand of Healing: a tiny\n\t\t\tamount of healing, but enough to bring a dying ally back into a fight. As\n\t\t\tyou gain more levels you can afford to use this more often, and\n\t\t\tPhysician&#8217;s Touch allows you to quickly remove some problematic status\n\t\t\tconditions.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Implements of Mercy<\/span>: Insight and Medicine\n\t\tare both Wisdom-based, which makes them good skills for the Monk.\n\t\tUnfortunately, Medicine is borderline useless (although check out some of\n\t\tour\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-s2-e6\/\">suggestions<\/a>\n\t\tto fix that), as its sole written function is made obsolete by the Healer&#8217;s\n\t\tKit. Herbalism Kit does allow you to craft Antitoxins and Potions of\n\t\tHealing, though, which is nice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><strong>Physician&#8217;s Touch<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hand of Harm<\/span>: Hand of Harm adds the\n\t\t\t\tability to make the target Poisoned with no save. Poisoned is an\n\t\t\t\tabsolutely fantastic debuff against most enemies (though spellcasters\n\t\t\t\twho don&#8217;t rely on attack rolls can largely ignore it, and it\u2019s the single most common status immunity in the game).<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hand of Healing<\/span>: Hand of Healing adds\n\t\t\t\tthe effect of Lesser Restoration and can also remove the Stunned\n\t\t\t\tcondition. If this was an either\/or it would be fantastic, but you get\n\t\t\t\tto both remove conditions <em>and<\/em> heal the target.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Healing and Harm<\/span>: This provides\n\t\ta way to conserve some Focus Points a few times per day, as well as to\n\t\trapidly provide a lot of healing all at once. You do still need to spend one\n\t\tFP to activate Flurry of Blows, but you got Heightened Focus at level 10,\n\t\tso Flurry of Blows is giving you three attacks instead of two.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For Hand of Harm, this saves you 1 FP at the cost of one of your Flurry\n\t\t\tof Healing and Harm uses per day. You can only use Hand of Harm once per\n\t\t\tturn, so you get no additional value. It&#8217;s absolutely not worth the\n\t\t\tcost.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unlike Hand of Harm, you can use Hand of Healing as often as you like.\n\t\t\tUsing Hand of Healing three times during a Flurry of Blows triples your\n\t\t\tability to output healing. Weirdly, this also means that, rather than\n\t\t\tspending an Action to use Hand of Healing outside of combat, it&#8217;s more\n\t\t\tefficient to use Flurry of Blows and punch yourself and your party until\n\t\t\teveryone feels better. You get three times as much healing per Focus Point\n\t\t\tby doing this.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Hand of Ultimate Mercy<\/span>: Have a dead party\n\t\tmember? Take a Short Rest to get your Focus Points back if you need to, then\n\t\tpunch them back to life. You only need 5 Focus Points to use this and you\n\t\tget 17 per Short or Long Rest at this level. If someone goes down you likely\n\t\tstill have a bunch to spend.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The fact that this only takes an Action is great. It&#8217;s similar to\n\t\t\tRevivify, but lacks an expensive cost. You could absolutely use this in\n\t\t\tcombat, and, in many cases, that&#8217;s a good idea. This doesn&#8217;t have the\n\t\t\tspecific text around how mortal wounds or missing limbs are handled, but I\n\t\t\tassume it works like Raise Dead in most respects. The target notably\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t need to be willing to return to life, either, which raises some\n\t\t\tinteresting ethical questions.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The one serious limitation on this is that you can only use it once per\n\t\t\tLong Rest. But, with a 24-hour window in which it will function after the\n\t\t\ttarget&#8217;s death, if you need to raise 2 people, you can raise one, take a\n\t\t\tLong Rest, raise the other, and then still have a ton of time to mess\n\t\t\taround before you get anywhere near the 24-hour timer. Of course, if you\n\t\t\thave 3 dead allies, you&#8217;ll want to go find a cleric.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shadow\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warrior of Shadow<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Warrior of Shadow Monk is a powerful Striker, using magical darkness to\n\tgive themselves a huge mathematical advantage in combat.

Consistent Advantage on all of\n\t\t\t\tyour attacks and Disadvantage on your enemies&#8217; attacks against you is a\n\t\t\t\tmassive mathematical advantage.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Keeping your enemies inside the area of Darkness will have a huge\n\t\t\t\t\timpact. They&#8217;ll struggle to attack your party, and many effects can\n\t\t\t\t\tonly target creatures which the creature can see, making many spells\n\t\t\t\t\tand special abilities unusable. Either Grapple enemies or take Sentinel\n\t\t\t\t\tto prevent them from moving away from you.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Shadow Arts allows you to move the effect at the beginning of your\n\t\t\t\t\tturn without spending an action of any kind, but you&#8217;ll rarely need to\n\t\t\t\t\tdo that. You can cast Darkness on an object, then hold it in your hand\n\t\t\t\t\tand carry it with you. Covering the object blocks Darkness, so you can\n\t\t\t\t\tstow the object if you need to reveal yourself.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Darkvision<\/span>: Always useful, especially\n\t\t\t\tif your Species doesn&#8217;t have Darkvision already.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Figments<\/span>: Minor Illusion is an\n\t\t\t\tabsolutely fantastic spell.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Step<\/span>: Teleportation is great, and\n\t\tAdvantage is great, but Monks get by on a large number of low-damage\n\t\tattacks, so Advantage on one attack isn&#8217;t particularly useful. Giving up\n\t\tyour Bonus Action also means less attacks that round. Advantage on one\n\t\tattack helps make up for losing your Bonus Action attacks, but you probably\n\t\thave Advantage from fighting in Darkness, so you want to avoid using this in\n\t\tany situation where regular movement would suffice.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You need to teleport from darkness to darkness, so Shadow Step may be a\n\t\t\tgood reason to use Shadow Arts (Darkness) to move the location of your\n\t\t\tDarkness effect in order to give yourself a destination for\n\t\t\tteleportation.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Shadow Step<\/span>: This makes Shadow\n\t\tStep much easier to use at the cost of a Focus Point.

Both take an Action to turn on a\n\t\tpowerful combat mode, and, since their benefits overlap, you&#8217;re only going to\n\t\tuse one at a time.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Being invisible means Advantage on all of your attacks and Disadvantage\n\t\t\ton attacks against you, but notably isn&#8217;t bypassed by the ability to see\n\t\t\tin magical darkness. Cloak of Shadows also lets you use Flurry of Blows\n\t\t\tfor free, allowing you to go all-in on offense. In a typical 3-round\n\t\t\tcombat, you&#8217;ll spend 3 FP for Cloak of Shadows and pay for the cost by\n\t\t\tmaking 3 flurries.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Despite its obvious benefits, Cloak of Shadows doesn&#8217;t totally supplant\n\t\t\tDarkness. Darkness can still be used to blind enemies, reducing their\n\t\t\tability to attack your allies. If you go into combat with Darkness\n\t\t\trunning, you might use Shadow Arts&#8217; ability to move the effect to\n\t\t\trepeatedly drop it onto your enemies while you rely on Cloak of Shadows to\n\t\t\tattack.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"elements\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Warrior of the Elements<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Warrior of the Elements gives the Monk a Focus Point-powered combat buff\n\twhich adds a pile of exciting features as you gain levels.

Pushing an enemy out of reach\n\t\t\t\t\tand knocking them prone with falling damage means that you won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\ttrigger an Opportunity Attack and that your target is prone, combining\n\t\t\t\t\tthe benefits of Addle and Topple.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n<p>Note that this feature <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/sae\/sage-advice-compendium#SAC-Monk2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">intentionally ignore creature size<\/a>, unlike most push effects.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Topple<\/span>: A great way to knock\n\t\t\t\thigh-Strength foes prone. Those same foes can reliably pass the saves to\n\t\t\t\tresist Push or to resist you using an Unarmed Strike to knock them\n\t\t\t\tprone.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wholeness of Body<\/span>: Basically a pool of\n\t\tadditional Hit Point Dice. You should absolutely not use this in combat. The\n\t\thealing is too minor. If you&#8217;re feeling endangered, Dodge and prevent incoming\n\t\tdamage rather than trying to repair it while still actively taking\n\t\tdamage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fleet Step<\/span>: Effectively a free Dash every\n\t\tturn, massively improving your mobility. Take advantage of this to forcibly\n\t\treposition enemies with a combination of Open Hand Technique and grappling.\n\t\tPut all of your enemies into a nice, neat little ball, then high-five your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Blaster.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quivering Palm<\/span>: 10d12 damage averages to\n\t\t65. This costs 4 FP to create the vibrations, then another attack during an\n\t\tAttack action to trigger the damage. The target makes a Constitution save,\n\t\tand since Constitution saves are consistently high, we need to expect\n\t\tenemies to pass the save. So is this worth the Focus Points to use?\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For 4 FP, you can trigger Flurry of Blows twice and Stunning Blow twice.\n\t\t\tThe 4 additional attacks compared to Martial Arts will deal 1d12+5 damage\n\t\t\teach. Assuming all four hit, that&#8217;s an average of 46 damage without\n\t\t\tconsidering the possibility of crits, falling damage from Open Hand\n\t\t\tTechnique, etc. The two Stunning Fist uses might rob the target of two\n\t\t\tturns.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>It&#8217;s difficult to make a direct comparison between Quivering Palm and our\n\t\t\tother options. Quivering Palm can be a big damage nuke delivered very\n\t\t\tquickly, but I don&#8217;t trust Constitution saves enough to make that gamble\n\t\t\tfrequently. Personally, I would rather use Stunning Fist and spend a turn\n\t\t\tpunching the target while they&#8217;re unable to retaliate.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Your choice of Monk subclass will offer a combination of powerful abilities which complement the core Monk features, adding new and exciting capabilities which make it easy to distinguish yourself from other Monks.
