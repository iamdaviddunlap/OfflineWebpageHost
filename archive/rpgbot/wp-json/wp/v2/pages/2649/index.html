The number of curses known is now listed in the class features table for your convenience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crimson Rite now lists when you gain additional options (Primal Rite, Esoteric Rite) in the class features table<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blood Maledict&#8217;s 3rd use per rest is moved two levels higher, though all other increases to your use pool remained where they were.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Feature: Brand of Castigation \/ Brand of Tethering<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grim Psychometry got a significant rewrite. It&#8217;s much more flexible now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dark Velocity renamed to Dark Augmentation; effects altered slightly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sanguine Mastery was totally rewritten<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Subclasses: The subclasses have seen a lot of changes. Shuffling around the levels at which the Blood Hunter gets subclass benefits necessitates some design changes, but the degree to which the subclasses have changes is considerable. Where the class&#8217;s core features recieved some polish and some fine-tuning, the subclasses are almost completely different in mechanical terms.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ghostslayer: Almost everything has changed. Aside from the name and damage type of Rite of Dawn, none of the Ghostlayer&#8217;s mechanics were retained from the original version of the subclass.&nbsp; <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lycan: Originally published as a supplement for the Blood Hunter, Order of the Lycan made it into the revised version of the class alongside the other subclasses. Predatory strikes has a lower damage cap, Bloodlust no longer requires you to keep a running tally of damage you&#8217;ve taken in a turn, and Cursed Weakness is gone. Improved Predatory Strikes now adds a scaling attack bonus that used to come from Beastly Precision several levels later. Advanced Transformation got a rewrite, but Lycan Regeneration is unchanged. The higher-level features got reworked. Brand of the Voracious is new and it is very powerful.&nbsp; <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mutant: The Mutation Score mechanic is gone, significantly simplifying the subclass. In general, Order of the Mutant is easier to read and play. The list of formulae has expanded significantly, and the only option which was removed was Wariness. &nbsp; <\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Profane Soul: The spellcasting is unchanged, and while the patron benefits haven&#8217;t changed conceptually they&#8217;ve been rebalanced slightly. Diabolic Channel is replaced by Brand of the Sapping Scar so Order of Profane Soul is a bit less of an Eldritch Knight clone. Soul Syphon is replaced by Blood Curs eof the Souleater. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blood Curses: Every Blood Curse changed. Four were removed, 7 new options were added, and 4 existing options were altered to some degree. There are now Blood Curses which have prerequisites, including level requirements an subclass requirements. &nbsp; <ul><li>New: Blood Curse of the Anxious<\/li><li>Blood Curse of Binding: Now also disallows Reactions. The Amplified version now has a 1-minute cap on duration so you can&#8217;t permanently bind creatures with poor Strength.&nbsp; <\/li><\/ul><ul><li>New: Blood Curse of Bloated Agony<\/li><li>New: Blood Curse of Corrosion<\/li><li>New: Blood Curse of The Exorcist<\/li><li>Blood Curse of The Eyeless: Range reduced, and now subtracts your hemocraft die from the attack rather than imposing Disadvantage &nbsp; <\/li><li>Blood Curse of The Fallen Puppet: amplifying the effect no longer adds a damage bonus, but the creature can move up to half its speed. &nbsp; <\/li><\/ul><ul><li>New: Blood Curse of The Howl<\/li><li>Removed: Blood Curse of the Fending Rite<\/li><li>Blood Curse of The Marked: Totally rewritten. No longer tied to Crimson Rite. &nbsp; <\/li><\/ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New: Blood Curse of The Muddled Mind<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removed: Blood Curse of Mutual Suffering<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removed: Blood Curse of Purgation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>New: Blood Curse of The Soul Eater<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removed: Blood Curse of Spell Sunder <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-new-in-the-2022-version\">What&#8217;s new in the 2022 version?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/forums\/d-d-beyond-general\/news-announcements\/132962-wont-you-be-our-valentine-blood-hunter-update\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/forums\/d-d-beyond-general\/news-announcements\/132962-wont-you-be-our-valentine-blood-hunter-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forum post on DnDBeyond<\/a> has the  (mostly) full details, but I&#8217;ll cover the highlights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we got three new patrons to reflect new patrons added in sourcebooks released since the 2020 version of the Blood Hunter: The Fathomless, The Genie, and The Undead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, and perhaps most important, we now get to choose between Intelligence and Wisdom as your Blood Maledict stat. Unless you&#8217;re planning to multiclass into artificer or wizard, choose Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest is just rewording of the existing text for clarity. One notable change is that wording around effects which trigger from Crimson Rite damage have been updated to read &#8220;whenever you hit a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite&#8221;. In practice little has changed, but the text is more explicit which hopefully removes some arguments around potential abuse cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some minor rules tweaks, so be sure to check the specific text of things like Blood Curses for wording changes. As an example: Blood Curse of Binding now affects Large or smaller creatures, where previously you cold Enlarge yourself to potentially target larger enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Blood Hunter Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 is standard for front-line\n\tmartial classes, and since the Blood Hunter sacrifices their own hit points\n\tit&#8217;s important to have as many hit points as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Dexterity saves are important for\n\tmitigating damage from area damage effects, but Intelligence saves are rare.\n\tYou&#8217;ll also gain the ability to add your Intelligence modifier to your physical\n\tsaving throws, which will go a long way to keep you alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Martial weapons, medium\n\tarmor, and shields. The Blood Hunter matches the Ranger&#8217;s proficiencies, but\n\tcan&#8217;t match the AC of the Fighter or the Paladin unless you find a way to get\n\tproficiency with heavy armor. The Blood Hunter also gets proficiency with\n\tAlchemist&#8217;s Supplies, allowing you to craft things like Alchemist&#8217;s Fire, as\n\twell as three skills from a list of class options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunter&#8217;s Bane<\/span>: The Blood Hunter is a class\n\tthat looks for any excuse to track a monster, so Advantage on Wisdom\n\t(Survival) checks to track some monsters is helpful.<\/p>\n<p>When you gain Hunter&#8217;s Bane at level 1, you choose your Hemocraft ability score,\nchoosing between Intelligence and Wisdom. Choose Wisdom. This ability score sets your\n&#8220;Hemocraft Modifier&#8221;, which is crucial for many of your class features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Maledict<\/span>: Blood Maledict feels a\n\tlittle bit like spellcasting. It&#8217;s not spellcasting, but it certainly feels\n\tthat way. You get a maximum of four uses per short rest, so when you resort to\n\ta Blood Curse it needs to be a situation that really justifies it rather than\n\tthrowing it at the first enemy you see. Blood Curses notably only affect\n\tcreatures with blood unless you spend hit points to amplify your Blood Curse,\n\tso if you run into elementals, constructs, or some types of undead get ready\n\tto spend some hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Style<\/span>: Fighting Style is a welcome\n\taddition for any martial character. The Blood Hunter gets all of the offensive\n\toptions, but unlike the Ranger they get no defensive options. With only medium\n\tarmor, the option to take Defensive would be nice, but the Blood Hunter is\n\tapparently too aggressive for things like AC. There&#8217;s also nothing appealing\n\tfor the Order of the Lycan to use while transformed, so if you&#8217;re considering\n\tOrder of the Lycan look for something that you can use while you&#8217;re not\n\ttransformed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The obvious choice for ranged builds. +2 to hit is a big deal in a game\n\t\twhere a 20th-level character can expect a maximum of +11 to hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Note that this works while using a shield. 2 damage closes the damage gap\n\t\tbetween a longsword and a two-handed weapon (4.5-&gt;6.5 vs. 6.5\/7).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Weapon Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This adds\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/rpg.stackexchange.com\/questions\/47172\/how-much-damage-does-great-weapon-fighting-add-on-average#answer-47173\">an average of just over 1 damage per attack on average<\/a>, and even then the only with a greatsword. Tragically, the Blood Hunter\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get a better option if you plan to use two-handed melee weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The Blood Hunter&#8217;s attacks more closely resemble the Ranger&#8217;s than the\n\t\tFighter&#8217;s. You only get two attacks, and you can apply Crimson Rite to both\n\t\tweapons to get the on-hit damage boost. However, beware the stacking costs\n\t\tof Crimson Rite, and remember that many of the Blood Hunters abilities use\n\t\tyour Bonus Action so you&#8217;ll often need to give up your additional attack to\n\t\tdo something else.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Crimson Rite<\/span>: Crimson Rite adds a scaling\n\tdamage bonus which does similar damage to Hunter&#8217;s Mark or Hex, but costs you\n\thit points rather than spell slots. It&#8217;s a crucial part of the Blood Hunter,\n\tand many of your other class features will depend on you having Crimson Rite\n\trunning. If you&#8217;re going somewhere that you expect to encounter enemies, draw\n\tyour weapon, activate Crimson Rite ahead of time, and don&#8217;t put your weapon\n\tdown until you&#8217;re ready to rest. The effect expires when you take a short or\n\tlong rest, but otherwise if you don&#8217;t lose hold of your weapon you can get a\n\tlot of bonus damage for a fairly minor quantity of damage. <\/p><p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the bonus damage is magic, but it doesn&#8217;t\n\tmake attacks with the weapon magic, so creatures which you attack might resist\n\tyour weapon damage but not the bonus damage from Crimson Rite. The damage\n\tbonus scales with level, and it feels really good on top of Extra Attack. The\n\tability is also worded to disadvantage two-weapon fighting and thrown weapons,\n\tbut it works really well for Crossbow Expert users. You need to spend\n\tadditional hit points <em>and<\/em> an extra Bonus Action to affect additional\n\tweapons, so be very cautious about two-weapon fighting builds.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Primal Rites<\/strong>: You get just two of the three Primal Rites\n\t\toptions, so be sure to pick options which will be effective against as many\n\t\topponents as possible. Blood Hunters typically face evil creatures like\n\t\tfiends, so you want to take options which aren&#8217;t commonly resisted by those\n\t\tcreatures.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rite of the Flame<\/span>: Nearly all fiends\n\t\t\t\thave resistance to fire damage, and it&#8217;s commonly resisted by other\n\t\t\t\tcreatures too.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rite of the Frozen<\/span>: Many fiends have\n\t\t\t\tresistance to cold, but not so many as have resistance to fire.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rite of the Storm<\/span>: Fiends usually\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t have resistance to lightning damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Esoteric Rites<\/strong>: You only get one, and Rite of the Roar is\n\t\tconsiderably better than the other options.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rite of the Dead<\/span>: Most things don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tresist necrotic damage, but the things that do resist it are evil\n\t\t\t\tcreatures which blood hunters can expect to face.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rite of the Oracle<\/span>: Psychic damage\n\t\t\t\tis resisted by very few creatures, but many undead and constructs are\n\t\t\t\toutright immune to it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rite of the Roar<\/span>: Almost nothing\n\t\t\t\tresists thunder damage. The only better option is Force damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blood Hunter Order<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Blood Hunter Orders&#8221;,\n\tbelow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: A crucial feature of almost\n\tany martial class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Brand of Castigation<\/span>: A small but helpful\n\tdamage boost against large singular foes, especially if you can keep your\n\ttarget&#8217;s focus on yourself. Your Intelligence\/Wisdom likely isn&#8217;t higher than 16, so\n\tthe damage bonus won&#8217;t win fights on its own, but against foes with numerous\n\tsmall attacks it can add up quickly. Unfortunately you&#8217;ll need to be hit by\n\tattacks to trigger Brand of Castigation, so manage your hit points\n\tcarefully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Grim Psychometry<\/span>: Make an Intelligence\n\t(History) check to ask the DM about the plot or when to find nearby monsters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dark Augmentation<\/span>: The bonus speed is nice\n\tbut not particularly significant. The bonus to saves is the real appeal here.\n\tEven if your Intelligence\/Wisdom is just 14, +2 to three types of saving throws is\n\tsignificant, and if your Hemocraft Modifier improves later this gets even\n\tbetter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brand of Tethering<\/span>: Situational, but a\n\thelpful counter against enemies which can easily move between planes like\n\tspellcasters and some fiends. Brand of Castigation has no duration, so you can\n\tleave this in effect and make it much easier to chase across the planes. It&#8217;s\n\tunclear how this works against creatures using the Blink spell, but I can&#8217;t\n\timagine that it goes well for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hardened Soul<\/span>: Fear and Charm effects become\n\tcommon at high levels, and many effects that don&#8217;t make you frightened and\n\tdon&#8217;t charm you are also considered &#8220;fear&#8221; and &#8220;charm&#8221; effects, so resistances\n\tlike this are much more effective than they appear at first glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanguine Mastery<\/span>: Rerolling a Hemocraft die\n\tonce per turn will be helpful nearly every turn. The most likely usage is to\n\treroll the bonus damage from Crimson Rite, and rerolling a d10 damage die is\n\tstill satisfying even it&#8217;s not a huge mathematical advantage. You can also\n\tuse it to reduce the damage which you take to activate Crimson Rite or to\n\tamplify a Blood Curse, and to improve the effects of many of your other Blood\n\tHunter abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Blood Hunter Orders<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-of-the-ghostslayer\" class=\"rating-green\">Order of The Ghostslayer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the baseline for the Blood Hunter. It&#8217;s a solid archetype that broadens the Blood Hunter&#8217;s possible targets by allowing Blood Maledict to affect creatures without blood, and while it&#8217;s especially good at killing undead the Ghostslayer is still good at fighting everything else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rite of the Dawn<\/span>: Radiant damage is very\n\t\trarely resisted, making this your best Crimson Rite option until a least\n\t\t14th level when you would normally choose your only Esoteric Rite. The\n\t\tglowing weapon is helpful, but it also discourages you from activating\n\t\tCrimson Rite ahead of time if you&#8217;re trying to avoid notice. The damage\n\t\tresistance and bonus damage against undead are situationally useful, but\n\t\tobviously they&#8217;re fantastic against undead enemies which are common in many\n\t\tcampaigns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Curse Specialist<\/span>: An extra use of Blood\n\t\tMaledict is fantastic on its own, and the ability to affect creatures\n\t\twithout blood without spending hit points to amplify is really nice.\n\t\tConstructs, most elementals, plants, and many types of undead don&#8217;t have\n\t\tblood, so normally they&#8217;re immune to Blood Curses.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ethereal Step<\/span>: The ability to enter the\n\t\tEthereal plane and move about typically isn&#8217;t available until much higher\n\t\tlevel. For example: the Etherealness spell is a 7th-level spell. Use this to\n\t\twalk through walls and to avoid all sorts of other obstacles.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brand of Sundering<\/span>: At this level your\n\t\tHemocraft Die increases to 1d8, so the extra damage is nice. However, since\n\t\tBrand of Castigation is only usable once per rest you may be tempted to\n\t\twithold Brand of Castigation in case you encounter enemies which can move\n\t\tthrough creatures or walls like ghosts. It&#8217;s never fun to sit on such a good\n\t\tresource in case you need it, but I don&#8217;t see a way around it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Curse of the Exorcist<\/span>: Charm and\n\t\tFear effects are very common as you reach high levels, so this will see a\n\t\tlot of use. The damage from Amplifying is automatic and exceeds the amount\n\t\tof damage that you take, so it&#8217;s nearly always worth the hit points to\n\t\tAmplify this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rite of Revival<\/span>: You should always have\n\t\tCrimson Rite running in combat, which means that this is always an option.\n\t\tWell, unless you&#8217;re already at such low hit points that you can&#8217;t activate\n\t\tCrimson Rite. At that point it&#8217;s time to make a hasty retreat and live to\n\t\tfight another day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-of-the-lycan\" class=\"rating-blue\">Order of The Lycan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Order of the Lycan is only slightly more complicated than the order of the Ghostlayer, but in a lot of ways it&#8217;s stronger. It has several numeric advantages which other characters can&#8217;t replicate without magic items, and Order of the Lycan is extremely difficult to kill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with its many strengths, Order of the Lycan still has limitations. The subclass is entirely melee-focused, and does not benefit directly from any of the Combat Style options available to the Blood Hunter. Bloodlust can also force you into a dangerous state where you might attack your allies unless you give up your lycanthrope form, which you can only use a few times before resting until very high level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you can easily overcome these challenges: The Archery style offers an easy way to fight at range when your Order of the Lycan features aren&#8217;t useful, nicely addressing both melee-only nature of the subclass and giving you a meaningful way to use Combat Style. Bloodlust will remain a problem until you acquire Lycan Regeneration at 11th level unless your party has ample healing available. If someone in your party can cast Healing Spirit you should be just fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heightened Senses<\/span>: Hearing isn&#8217;t\n\t\ttypically as useful as sight, and smell is rarely used for Perception\n\t\tchecks. But Advantage on nearly any Perception check is still good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hybrid Transformation<\/span>: For one hour, turn\n\t\tinto a combat monster. Well, more of a combat monster than you already were.\n\t\tYour hybrid form emphasizes fighting unarmed, but you can still use a shield\n\t\tand you should absolutely do so because you&#8217;ll need the extra AC to avoid\n\t\tbeing subject to Bloodlust for as long as possible. The hour-long duration\n\t\tcan carry you through several fights with sufficient healing options\n\t\tavailable, but if Bloodlust comes into effect and you don&#8217;t have enemies\n\t\tnearby for you to attack you&#8217;ll need to end your transformation early to\n\t\tavoid murdering your friends.\n\t\t<p>Much like the Barbarian&#8217;s Rage feature, this is your go-to option in\n\t\t\tcombat, but since the usage is limited you technically can&#8217;t use it\n\t\t\twhenever you want. The hour-long duration is good, but you still need to\n\t\t\tbe careful to manage the effects unless you want to get into a fight\n\t\t\twithout the ability to transform.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Feral Might<\/span>: A modest, but still\n\t\t\t\tuseful bonus to melee damage. Curiously, it&#8217;s not limited to weapon\n\t\t\t\tattacks so you can use it with spells if you want to do that for some\n\t\t\t\treason. Advantage on Strength checks is great for things like grappling\n\t\t\t\tand shoving. Strength is normally a dump stat, but if you want to Shove\n\t\t\t\tor Grapple things a little bit of Strength won&#8217;t cost you too much.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resilient Hide<\/span>: +1 AC will close the\n\t\t\t\tgap between medium and heavy armor, and since the bonus only applies\n\t\t\t\twhen not wearing heavy armor it removes any incentive to get heavy armor\n\t\t\t\tproficiency. You also gain resistance to common weapon damage types,\n\t\t\t\tthough unlike the Barbarian this resistance is bypassed by silvered\n\t\t\t\tweapons or magic.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Predatory Strikes<\/span>: The ability to use\n\t\t\t\tDexterity for attack and damage with unarmed strikes removes nearly all\n\t\t\t\tneed for Strength, so go all-in on Dexterity. You might even consider\n\t\t\t\tthe Archery fighting style, then use Hybrid Transformation when you need\n\t\t\t\tto jump into melee. Predatory Strikes also gives you an extra attack as\n\t\t\t\ta Bonus Action so long as you make an Unarmed Strike as part of the\n\t\t\t\tAttack action on your turn. Even once you get Extra Attack so that you\n\t\t\t\tcan use a weapon for one of your attacks, using an Unarmed Strike will\n\t\t\t\ttypically be better between Predatory Strikes, Feral Might, Improved\n\t\t\t\tPredatory Strikes, and Crimson Rite applied to your Unarmed Strikes.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodlust<\/span>: This is a handicap to\n\t\t\t\tdiscourage you from living in your Hybrid Transformation form. It\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t end when all of your enemies are dead, so either someone heals\n\t\t\t\tyou above half of your hit points or you spend a Bonus Action on your\n\t\t\t\tturn to return to your normal form. Lycan Regeneration will make this\n\t\t\t\tless problematic, but you don&#8217;t get that until 11th level.\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re suffering from Bloodlust but don&#8217;t want to drop out of your\n\t\t\t\t\tlycanthrope form, you can keep your allies safe by several methods.\n\t\t\t\t\tPositioning an enemy between you and your allies is an obvious\n\t\t\t\t\tsolution, but Bloodlust doesn&#8217;t end when combat does. If there are no\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies around, drop prone. Standing eats half of your movement,\n\t\t\t\t\tcreating a much smaller radius where you might move and attack an\n\t\t\t\t\tally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Bloodlust requires that you move toward an ally and make an Attack\n\t\t\t\t\tagainst a creature, but it doesn&#8217;t require that you draw a weapon or\n\t\t\t\t\tanything so as long as you don&#8217;t have a ranged weapon in hand you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\tfine. You&#8217;re still forced to take the Attack action (likely clawing at\n\t\t\t\t\tthe air and being angry) so you can&#8217;t Dash to move back towhere you\n\t\t\t\t\twere, but falling prone doesn&#8217;t require an action of any kind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>On turns where you pass the save, move back to a safe &#8220;center point&#8221;\n\t\t\t\t\twhere hopefully an ally can place a Healing Spirit for you. If your\n\t\t\t\t\tallies are clever, then can run around you on their own turns to force\n\t\t\t\t\tyou to chase them back into the Healing Spirit&#8217;s space to continue\n\t\t\t\t\thealing.\n\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stalker&#8217;s Prowess<\/span>: More speed never\n\t\thurts, and this stacks with the speed improvement from Dark Augmentation, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll eventually a get a total speed bonus of +15 ft.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Predatory Strikes<\/span>: Attack\n\t\t\t\tbonuses are extremely powerful in a game where a typical character will\n\t\t\t\thave a maximum attack bonus of +11 at 20th level without spells or magic\n\t\t\t\titems. I think that the progression is intended to keep pace with +X\n\t\t\t\titems, but I can&#8217;t say for sure. Regardless, this is spectacular.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Transformation<\/span>: Transforming\n\t\ttwice per rest makes Bloodlust much less of a problem because you can drop\n\t\tout of your transformation long enough to heal with spells, potions, or\n\t\twhatever else but you don&#8217;t need to resort to taking a Short Rest. Lycan\n\t\tRegeneration goes even further to stretch out the usage of your\n\t\ttransformations by allowing you to regenerate enough hit points that\n\t\tBloodlust stops affecting you.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lycan Regeneration<\/span>: Free ongoing\n\t\t\t\thealing, though it only applies while Bloodlust is a problem so you may\n\t\t\t\tnot want to stand around healing unless there are enemies who you can\n\t\t\t\tattack. The healing caps at half of your maximum hit points which is\n\t\t\t\tenough to stop Bloodlust, but you&#8217;ll still want to spend some Hit Dice\n\t\t\t\tor something to get back to full hp.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Brand of the Voracious<\/span>: Advantage on the\n\t\tsave to resist Bloodlust makes it much easier to hang around while\n\t\ttransformed so that Lycan Regeneration can get you back to half of your max\n\t\thp. Brand of Castigation granting Advantage on your attack rolls against the\n\t\ttarget is a nice bonus worth of its own ability. Honestly I&#8217;m not sure why\n\t\tthese two effects weren&#8217;t broken up because they&#8217;re totally unrelated.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hybrid Transformation Mastery<\/span>: The ability\n\t\tto drop in and out of hybrid form without limit makes Bloodlust even less of\n\t\ta problem, and it makes going civilized places a bit easier since you&#8217;re not\n\t\twalking around as a weregoat or something equally gruesome. Blood Curse of\n\t\tthe Howl is a great way to start any combat, and if everyone you care to\n\t\tscare is within the 30 ft. range you don&#8217;t need to amplify it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Curse of the Howl<\/span>: This is snuck in\n\t\tat the end of the description of Hybrid Transformation Mastery, but don&#8217;t\n\t\tmiss it. Starting an encounter against multiple foes with Blood Curse of the\n\t\tHowl can put your party at a massive advantage early in a fight when it\n\t\tmatters most.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-of-the-mutant\" class=\"rating-orange\">Order of The Mutant<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Order of the Mutant saw a lot of improvement from the original version, but it&#8217;s still held back by the severely limited number of mutagens that you can have readied at any one time. Because you can never have more than 3, there&#8217;s little incentive to prepare anything except your absolute favorite options unless you can find out what you&#8217;re facing well ahead of time. In most cases you can&#8217;t do that without scouting around or using divination magic, and even then it can be hard to guarantee anything more than a few minutes in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exalted Mutation solves Order of the Mutants biggest problem, but it doesn&#8217;t come online until 18th level, at which point you&#8217;ve suffered so long that it hardly matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a possible fix: Instead of preparing your mutagens during a rest, you prepare reagents for mutagens. Creating a mutagen requires one minute of uninterrupted work with these reagents and a set of alchemist&#8217;s tools. This allows the Blood Hunter a bit more flexibility with their mutagens, but not so much that they can change them during combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Formulas<\/span>: You start with four formulas\n\t\tand learn four more over time. You&#8217;ll never be able to have more than three\n\t\tmutagens readied at any time, so it&#8217;s okay to have a couple go-to options\n\t\tand a bunch of situational options which you can rotate in and out when the\n\t\tsituation justifies it. See &#8220;Mutagens&#8221;, below, for help selecting\n\t\tformulas.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mutagencraft<\/span>: Mutagens allow you to gain\n\t\ta long-duration buff which you can apply in a hurry, but which can carry a\n\t\tproblematic side-effect. If possible, you want to apply a mutagen well ahead\n\t\tof time so that you can keep your Bonus Action free for other things like\n\t\tBlood Maledict. While the formulas available are interesting, diverse, and\n\t\tindividually powerful you&#8217;re severely limited by the number of mutagens\n\t\twhich you can have prepared at any one time. It starts at just 1, and caps\n\t\tat just 3 at 15th level, which means that when you prepare your mutagens you\n\t\tneed to either do a bunch of pre-planning and investigation or you need to\n\t\tguess. In most cases that&#8217;s going to mean sticking to a few staple options\n\t\twhich complement your build and your role in the party and only rarely using\n\t\tother options from your list of known formulas.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Strange Metabolism<\/span>: Poison is very common,\n\t\tso immunity is really nice. Suppressing the side-effects of a mutagen\n\t\ttemporarily can make many mutagens much more viable in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brand of Axiom<\/span>: Situational, but one of\n\t\tvery few Blood Hunter options for handling invisible creatures. You can also\n\t\tuse this to handle shapeshifters or spellcasters who like polymorph spells.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s probably not the intent of the ability, but you can use this on\n\t\tcreatures which were polymorphed against their will to end unpleasant\n\t\tpolymorph effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Curse of Corrosion<\/span>: Poisoned is a\n\t\tgreat debuff, though many creatures have resistance or immunity. The\n\t\tamplified version deals 4d6 automatic damage, which is more than you pay to\n\t\tamplify the effects, so it&#8217;s nearly always a good option. Against enemies\n\t\twithout good Constitution saving throws like many spellcasters, this is a\n\t\tdeath sentence.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exalted mutation<\/span>: This solves the biggest\n\t\tproblem with Mutagens: the inability to choose your mutagens from your full\n\t\tlist of options to suit your current needs. Tragically, it doesn&#8217;t come\n\t\tonline until 18th level so in many ways it&#8217;s too little, too late.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mutagens\">Mutagens<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aether<\/span>: Flight in any form and at any\n\t\tspeed is excellent, but try to avoid being grappled or shoved.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Aluring<\/span>: Charisma is usually dump stat\n\t\tfor the Blood Hunter, but with a tiny bit of Charisma, Advantage on Charisma\n\t\tchecks, and a few proficiencies you could easily be your party&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celerity<\/span>: Generally your go-to combat\n\t\toption. Disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Conversant<\/span>: Situationally useful.\n\t\tHelpful if you need to make a bunch of Investigate checks or something, but\n\t\tDisadvantage on Wisdom checks include Wisdom (Perception), so I wouldn&#8217;t use\n\t\tthis anywhere that enemies might suddenly appear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cruelty<\/span>: This is a huge gamble, so I\n\t\twould never use this until you know what you&#8217;re fighting. Big martial\n\t\tenemies like ogres or dinosaurs? Cruelty time. Anything with any ability\n\t\tthat even remotely resembles spellcasting? Don&#8217;t even think about it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deftness<\/span>: Situational. The time that I\n\t\twould most encourage this is when you&#8217;re trying to be sneaky, but when\n\t\tyou&#8217;re sneaking around trying to avoid notice it&#8217;s just as important to be\n\t\taware of potential threats like traps or other creatures sneaking around, so\n\t\tDisadvantage on Wisdom checks (which include Perception) is a dangerous risk\n\t\tto take.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Embers<\/span>: Good against enemies that deal\n\t\tfire damage like red dragons or elementals, but bad against\n\t\tspellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gelid<\/span>: Good against enemies that deal\n\t\tcold damage like white dragons, but bad against spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Impermeable<\/span>: Piercing damage is common,\n\t\tbut not as common as slashing damage, and many creatures which deal piercing\n\t\tdamage can do slashing damage with another attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mobile<\/span>: Drinking one of these is easier\n\t\tand less costly than taking proficiency in Acrobatics specifically to handle\n\t\tbeing grappled. It&#8217;s not very exciting, but it&#8217;s a great fallback.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nighteye<\/span>: Darkvision is crucial, and if\n\t\tyou suddenly find yourself in sunlight again you can spend an Action to\n\t\tflush the effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Percipient<\/span>: Wisdom (Perception) is one of\n\t\tthe most eseential and frequently-rolled checks in the game, and Advantage\n\t\ton those checks can help you avoid all sorts of trouble. Disadvantage on\n\t\tCharisma checks is a negligible cost, especially when you&#8217;re planning to\n\t\tfight stuff rather than make conversation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Potency<\/span>: Useful for Strength-based\n\t\tbuilds, but there is very little reason for those to exist so I don&#8217;t expect\n\t\tthis to be used often.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precision<\/span>: More criticals hits are always\n\t\tgreat, and Strength saving throws are uncommon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapidity<\/span>: More movement speed is always\n\t\tnice, and with the maximum +15 ft. bonus and Dark Augmentation you&#8217;re as\n\t\tfast as a horse. Disadvantage on Intelligence checks is only rare important\n\t\tunless you like to make Intelligence checks to identify monsters, so you can\n\t\toften leave this running while you travel around.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reconstruction<\/span>: Once you have Dark\n\t\tAugmentation the speed penalty makes a human as fast as a dwarf, which is\n\t\tusually still enough. If you can find a magic item to boost your speed or if\n\t\tyou can spend another mutagen on Rapidity you can easily offset the speed\n\t\tpenalty and have hit point regeneration for a full hour at a time. In the\n\t\tabsolute worst case scenario, you could save this for before a short rest,\n\t\tthen drink it to get back to full hit points without spending hit dice\n\t\tbefore getting a fresh set of mutagens.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sagacity<\/span>: The bonus can improve a lot of\n\t\tyour Blood Hunter class features, including things like Brand of Castigation\n\t\tand the saving throw bonus from Dark Augmentation. Still, it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\tjustify using it when more proactive combat options exist and when\n\t\tConversant is more effective for ability checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shielded<\/span>: Slashing damage is the most\n\t\tcommon type of weapon damage and bludgeoning is the least.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unbreakable<\/span>: Bludgeoning damage is the\n\t\tleast common type of weapon damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vermillion<\/span>: An extra use of Blood\n\t\tMaledict is great. It&#8217;s not clear what happens if you drink more than one of\n\t\tthese or what happens when you spend an Action to &#8220;flush&#8221; the effects, but\n\t\there is how I think it&#8217;s intended: Each use of Vermillion gives you a single\n\t\t&#8220;temporary&#8221; charge for Blood Maledict which is used before your normal pool\n\t\tof uses. If you lose the effect of the Mutagen, the temporary charge is also\n\t\tlost. The side effect lingers after you&#8217;ve used the temporary charge, so be\n\t\tsure to flush the effects whenever it&#8217;s convenient.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"order-of-the-profane-soul\" class=\"rating-green\">Order of The Profane Soul<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Otherworldly Patron<\/strong>: Tragically, few of the patron options\n\t\tare good, but their benefits are also minor compared to access to Pact Magic\n\t\tso you can still do fine even if you pick a pact which isn&#8217;t very good.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Archfey<\/span>: Starts with a\n\t\t\t\tsituational option and never really recovers.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Fathomless<\/span>: The entire benefit can be replace\nby the Ray of Frost cantrip.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Fiend<\/span>: Primarily focuses on doing\n\t\t\t\tfire damage, but doesn&#8217;t do it especially well.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Genie<\/span>: An interesting mix of\noptions allowing you to solve the a few different problems, but nothing amazing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Great Old One<\/span>: Decent, with a\n\t\t\t\tweird combination of crowd control, utility, and buffs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Undying<\/span>: Starts strong then\n\t\t\t\ttapers off almost immediately.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">The Celestial<\/span>: For a class with no\n\t\t\t\tother healing options, this is surprisingly good.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Hexblade<\/span>: Nothing good until 15th\n\t\t\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Undead<\/span>: The abilities are\nsituational, difficult to use reliably, and don&#8217;t do much when they do work.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pact Magic<\/span>: Order of the Profane Soul\n\t\tgives you the Warlock&#8217;s Pact Magic in the same way that Eldritch Knight\n\t\tgives the Fighter the Wizard&#8217;s spellcasting. See the Spells section, below,\n\t\tfor help selecting spells. You start with two cantrips and max out at three,\n\t\tso choose wisely. Eldritch Blast is tempting, but remember that your\n\t\tIntelligence\/Wisdom likely can&#8217;t match your Dexterity so you&#8217;ll do better with\n\t\tother options until your Hemocraft Modifier catches up a bit, and Hex will add a\n\t\tnice pile of extra damage (assuming you can hit anything). Booming Blade and\n\t\tGreen-Flame Blade are great possibilities (especially once you get Mystic\n\t\tFrenzy), but don&#8217;t shy away from utility options.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Rite Focus<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Archfey<\/span>: Situational, but a\n\t\t\t\tgreat option if your party can&#8217;t easily handle invisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Fathomless<\/span>: A 10-foot\nreduction in speed makes it difficult for enemies to approach you if you attack at range\nand difficult to escape you in melee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">The Fiend<\/span>: Rite of the Flame is the\n\t\t\t\tworst choice for Crimson Rite, and while this has improved from the\n\t\t\t\toriginal version of the class rerolling on 1s and 2s still boosts your\n\t\t\t\taverage damage by less than 1 damage on average.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">The Genie<\/span>: Flight is really good, but a round or two won&#8217;t get you through combat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Great Old One<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using\n\t\t\t\ttwo-weapon fighting or Crossbow Expert, you might score critical hits\n\t\t\t\tfairly often. The original version required a saving throw in addition\n\t\t\t\tto a critical hit which made this functionally useless.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Undying<\/span>: Regaining hit points when\n\t\t\t\tyou drop a creature is great, and you no longer need to outright kill it\n\t\t\t\tat the same time to trigger the effect. The DM gets to decide if the\n\t\t\t\tcreature is an appropriate threat, so you likely can&#8217;t farm a bag of\n\t\t\t\trats or repeatedly beat one creature unconscious.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">The Celestial<\/span>: Roughly on par with\n\t\t\t\tHealing Word.

If you plan to play a race that I didn&#8217;t cover, the advice below should still offer some insights into the sorts of racial traits which will be beneficial. With Wisdom as your Hemocraft ability, the Blood Hunter&#8217;s race options look similar to the Ranger&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing to get from your race is a Dexterity increase. A Wisdom increase is nice, too, but not essential, and a Constitution increase is arguably more important because the Blood Hunter has less AC than a fighter and needs to spend their own hit points to fuel abilities like Crimson Rite. Beyond that, consider races with useful things like extra skill proficiencies and Darkvision which can broaden your skill set and help you succeed without relying on spellcasters in the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aarakocra<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: Dexterity and flight.

In that case, consider Intelligence-based skills like Arcana which can help you identify enemies and their weaknesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble deciding, here are some suggestions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloistered Scholar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: The Blood Hunter can make good use of the knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Urban Bounty Hunter<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a><\/sup>: Basically two skill choices from the Rogue class skills, plus some tool\n\t\tproficiencies, including the ever-important Thieve&#8217;s Tools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This\u00a0section\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0address\u00a0every\u00a0published\u00a0feat,\u00a0as\u00a0doing\u00a0so\u00a0would\u00a0result\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0ever-growing\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0options\u00a0which\u00a0don&#8217;t\u00a0cater\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0class.\u00a0Instead,\u00a0this\u00a0section\u00a0will\u00a0cover\u00a0feats\u00a0which\u00a0we\u00a0think\u00a0work\u00a0especially\u00a0well\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0class\u00a0or\u00a0which\u00a0might\u00a0be\u00a0tempting\u00a0but\u00a0poor\u00a0choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crossbow Expert<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: An extra attack means an extra chance to apply your Hemocraft die to\n\t\tdamage. However, there&#8217;s a lot of competition for your Bonus Action, so you\n\t\tmay not be able to make the extra attack every round. Order of the Profane\n\t\tSoul should avoid this in favor of Mystic Frenzy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Duelist<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: The Blood Hunter is mostly a melee class, but can&#8217;t match the Fighter&#8217;s\n\t\tAC, the Barbarian&#8217;s hit points, or the Rogue&#8217;s ability to mitigate damage\n\t\twith Uncanny Dodge. Defensive Duelist offers a reliable way to boost your AC\n\t\tevery round, though it only works against one attack.

They&#8217;re all used as a Bonus Action, and you always have the opportunity to enhance their effects by spending a Hemocraft Die worth of hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Curse of The Anxious<\/span>: This is a great\n\toption if you have an offensive spellcasting in the party who likes to rely on\n\tsave-or-suck spells like Hold Monster, but only if you spend the hit points to\n\tenhance it. You never get more than 4 uses of Blood Maledict per rest, so\n\tdon&#8217;t go wasting this on cantrips or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Curse of Binding<\/span>: Many highly-mobile\n\tenemies and many spellcasters have terrible Strength saves, and holding them\n\tin place makes them much easier to kill. This is also a great counter against\n\tenemies which are flying non-magically, as reducing their speed to 0 forces\n\tthem to fall. Enhancing this isn&#8217;t a certainty, but in most cases you&#8217;ll want\n\tto do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Curse of Bloated Agony<\/span>: This becomes\n\ta better option at higher levels when enemies with multiple attacks are\n\tcommon, but the damage also becomes less significant as you gain levels, so\n\tthere&#8217;s a weird narrow &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; where this is good. You might take this as\n\tyour second Blood Curse, then replace it when you get your third and can\n\tretrain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Curse of Corrosion<\/span>: Restricted to\n\tOrder of the Mutant.

Unfortunately, since your Hemocraft die is a\n\tsingle die it&#8217;s a flat probability distribution, so any time you use this it&#8217;s\n\ta gamble unless you just need to reduce the attack by 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet<\/span>: A good\n\tway to deal some extra damage outside your own turn, but you may be able to\n\thave a more significant effect on an encounter with other options.

Remember that since the Blood Hunter is primarily a martial class, you will generally want to avoid spells solely devoted to dealing damage. Your spell attacks and spell save DC&#8217;s will both be relatively poor, and because you get spell levels so slowly the damage output will be unimpressive in the best of cases. Instead, focus on buffs and utility options.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cantrips\">Cantrips<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Booming Blade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: If you can use Mystic Frenzy with either Booming Blade or Green-Flame\n\t\tBlade and trigger the bonus damage, you will consistently deal more damage\n\t\tthan attacking normally. Booming Blade has the added benefit of providing\n\t\textra reasons for enemies to not move away from you, which is sorely needed\n\t\tin 5e because opportunity attacks are usually not a serious deterrent.

The ability to damage two\n\t\tenemies with one attack is really enticing, but if you need that\n\t\tfunctionality you can either attack twice or use Mystic Frenzy and hit the\n\t\tsecond target as a Bonus Action.\n\t\t<p>Note that Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything published an updated version of\n\t\t\tGreen-Flame Blade.

Rage is neat and Unarmored\n\t\tDefense is exciting, but you won&#8217;t get enough rages per day to matter and\n\t\tyou won&#8217;t have enough Ability Score Increases to get 20 in Dexterity,\n\t\tConstitution, and Intelligence. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to do so, but\n\t\tremember that there&#8217;s always an opportunity cost for investing in one thing\n\t\tinstead of another.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bard<\/span>: Nothing the Blood Hunter needs that\n\t\tthey can&#8217;t get from either the Rogue or the Wizard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cleric<\/span>: Most of the\n\t\tspellcasting will be obsolete very quickly, but options like Bless and Shield of Faith\nwill remain useful. If you just want heavy armor, look at the Fighter instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Druid<\/span>: A 1-level dip for Shillelagh could\nsupport an all-Wisdom build, which would be really neat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: A single level (assuming it&#8217;s\n\t\tyour first level) gets you heavy armor and Fighting Style. The Fighter gets\n\t\tmany more options than the Blood Hunter, and getting two lets you try some\n\t\tfun combinations. If you can make it to three levels, Champion&#8217;s Improved\n\t\tCritical feature is very nice since critical hits will double your Crimson\n\t\tRite damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monk<\/span>: Martial Arts is tempting because\n\t\tit offers an additional attack to deliver Crimson Rite. However, you&#8217;ll most\n\t\tlikely be limited to monk weapons like the spear unless you take enough\n\t\tlevels to take Way of the Kensei. That&#8217;s a big investment just to get an\n\t\textra attack as a bonus action, especially since the lost levels will mean a\n\t\tsmaller Hemocraft die. Unarmored defense is tempting if you&#8217;re using Wisdom\nfor hemocraft, but it&#8217;s only a minor improvement over light armor, and if magic items are\non the table it might not even be an improvement.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Paladin<\/span>: The Fighter provides similar\n\t\tbenefits without a Charisma dependency.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger<\/span>: Tempting, but you need too many\n\t\tlevels before you get anything interesting that you couldn&#8217;t get from the\n\t\tFighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span>: Cunning Action and Expertise are\n\t\tboth great, but if you&#8217;re going this route you should try to make Rogue your\n\t\tfirst level for the extra skill proficiencies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Wizard is a better fit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Warlock<\/span>: While the Pact Magic from Order of\n\t\tthe Profane Soul works with the Pact Magic from the Warlock, your spells\n\t\tlearned from Warlock levels are Charisma-based so anything offensive will be\n\t\tunreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wizard<\/span>: Intelligence-based spellcasting,\n\t\tbut since Spellcasting and Pact Magic are separate things you may as well be\n\t\tstrapping a 1st-level wizard to your back.

Ghostlayers have very few decision points in their build, and there are no spells or mutagens or anything of the sort to manage. However, the Blood Hunter still requires some degree of resource management at the table to keep yourself effective. The Ghostlayer is simple to build and simple to play compared to other subclasses, and throughout this build I&#8217;ll try to explain the evolving tactics of the class so you know how to conduct yourself during play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blood Hunter stands somewhere between the Fighter and the Rogue in terms of role in a party, sharing the Fighter&#8217;s martial capabilities and the Rogue&#8217;s high damage output. This build falls into that split role, so depending on the makeup of your party you&#8217;ll want to adjust some of your choices (I&#8217;ll explain more below). You can also choose between a melee build and a ranged build simply by changing your Fighting Style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll make some adjustments from the suggested ability scores above to maximize what we get from our racial ability score increases. We&#8217;ll end up with 16 in both Dexterity and Constitution, and 14 in Intelligence. That gives us plenty of hit points to spend on Crimson Rite and on enhancing Blood Curses, and 14 Intelligence is a perfectly respectable score to support the Blood Hunter&#8217;s Intelligence-based features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Increased<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Stout Halfling.

Arcana, History, and Investigation are all great choices. If you have someone in the party like a wizard who is already very good at Arcana, replace it with Religion instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use your background to get more proficiencies that suit your role in the party.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re fitting into your party as more of a fighter, look for proficiencies in Perception, and possibly in either Acrobatics or Athletics so that you have a good way respond to being grappled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re fitting into your party as more a rogue, look for proficiencies in Stealth and Thieves&#8217; Tools.

You&#8217;re just as effective with a rapier and a shortbow, so use whatever fits the situation. Figure out what&#8217;s working for you before 2nd level and you need to select your Fighting Style.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our first Blood Curse is Curse of the Fallen Puppet. Creatures (including your allies) fall to 0 hit points frequently at low levels so you&#8217;ll have lots of opportunity, and even a single attack can have a huge effect on the outcome of an encounter. Be careful enhancing the effects, though. 1d4 hit points sounds small, but when you have 13 hit points it can really hurt.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Fighting Style: Archery or Dueling<\/li>\n<li>Crimson Rite<\/li>\n<li>Primal Rite: Rite of the Storm<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At this point you&#8217;ll need to commit to a Fighting Style. If you&#8217;re fighting primarily in melee, grab a shield and take Dueling. If you&#8217;re fighting primarily at range, grab a shortbow and take Archery.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2nd level brings Crimson Rite, which is one the Blood Hunter&#8217;s most iconic and flashy abilities. Generally you&#8217;ll want to activate Crimson Rite as soon as you supect that you&#8217;ll be facing enemies so that it&#8217;s ready to go whenever you need it. It does cost you 1d4 hit points, but if you deliver a few hits it&#8217;s easily worth the cost. We selected lightning damage at this level because resistance to it is relatively rare, but we&#8217;ll switch damage types at 3rd level.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood Hunter Order: Ghostslayer<\/li>\n<li>Rite of the Dawn<\/li>\n<li>Curse Specialist<\/li>\n<li>Blood Maledict (2\/rest)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Rite of the Dawn lets us deal radiant damage with Crimson Rite, which is a great option because it&#8217;s so rarely resisted. Curse Specialist lets us use Blood Maledict an extra time per day, but we still only have Curse of the Fallen Puppet so be sure to use it at every opportunity. It&#8217;s no longer limited to creatures with blood, so you can use it on things like skeletons and golems.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Improvement (Dexterity 16 -&gt; 18)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>More Dexterity boosts your AC, you attacks, and your damage.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemocraft Die: 1d6<\/li>\n<li>Extra Attack<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>This is a great level for damage output. A second attack means that you can deliver Crimson Rite damage more frequently, and the larger Hemocraft Die means that it does even more damage. Of course, the bigger die also means that Crimson Rite costs more to upgrade, but it&#8217;s absolutely worth the cost.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood Maledict (3\/rest)<\/li>\n<li>Blood Curse: Binding<\/li>\n<li>Brand of Castigation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Blood Curse of Binding is a powerful way to keep single targets stuck in place. If you fight at range and they don&#8217;t, you can stop them in place and shoot them while they stuggle. If they fight at range and you don&#8217;t want to, you can stop them in place while you get into melee. Perhaps more important, you can use this to make flying enemies fall if they&#8217;re flying nonmagically.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Brand of Castigation isn&#8217;t usable often enough for it to have a large effect on your tactics, but it&#8217;s a nice option when you&#8217;re focusing on a single foe with a lot of hit points. It also discourages the target from attacking your allies, which can be great if you need to draw attention away from other allies who might be short on hit points.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereal Step<\/li>\n<li>Primal Rite: Rite of the Frozen<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>You can use Etheral Step either to move through solid barriers like walls and doors, or you can use it in combat to move past problematic enemies to get to their squishy friends like spellcasters and archers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rite of the Frozen is a nice option, but don&#8217;t expect to use it much since radiant damage is so much more reliable.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Improvement (Dexterity 18 -&gt; 20)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>More attack, damage, and AC.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Grim Psychometry<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Grim Psychometry is a weird ability that can be hard to use unless your DM is willing to put in the work to support it. Hopefully if you&#8217;ve made it to level 9 your DM is ready for this.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood Curse: The Eyeless<\/li>\n<li>Dark Augmentation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Blood Curse of the Eyeless is a helpful defensive option that can negate an enemy&#8217;s successful attack roll. It&#8217;s a bit of a gamble, unfortunately, but when an enemy hits by 1 or 2 it&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dark Augmentation doesn&#8217;t change your tactics significantly, but it offers a helpful bonus to your physical saving throws. Now that you&#8217;re at 20 Dexterity, you can increase your Intelligence to improve this bonus.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemocraft Die: 1d8<\/li>\n<li>Brand of Sundering<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Brand of Sundering is a spectacular counter to foes like ghosts which can pass through solid walls, but even against more mundane enemies adding an extra Hemocraft Die on top of your Intelligence Bonus is a significant damage increase.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Improvement (Intelligence 14 -&gt; 16)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Better saving throws, and the save DC for your Blood Curses improves.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood Maledict (4\/rest)<\/li>\n<li>Brand of Tethering<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Brand of Tethering keeps enemies from fleeing in ways that Blood Curse of Binding can&#8217;t. Brand of Tethering prevents teleportation and interplanar travel, making it a great option for enemies like spellcasters and powerful fiends which can often plane shift.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood Curse: Any<\/li>\n<li>Hardened Soul<\/li>\n<li>Esoteric Rite: Roar<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>At this point we have most of the good Blood Curse options, so take whatever looks interesting to you. Since we already have several great options there is room for you to experiment with options which are only situationally useful.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hardened Soul provides a helpful defense against common status conditions, but it doesn&#8217;t change our tactics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been doing just fine with radiant damage for a long time, but Esoteric Rite offers other interesting options. Rite of the Roar is great because thunder damage is so rarely resisted, and between thunder damage and radiant damage you should be able to affect anything. However, don&#8217;t forget that Rite of the Dawn offers other useful benefits like resistance to necrotic damage.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood Curse of the Exorcist<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>If you or an ally fail a save, this can totally change the outcome of the encounter.
