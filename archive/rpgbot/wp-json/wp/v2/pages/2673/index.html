The ability to customize spells on the fly makes it easy to adapt\n\tyour spellcasting to the needs of the moment and to maximize the effect of\n\tyour favorite spells. The Sorcerer&#8217;s spell list allows them to serve as a\n\tBlaster, Controller, Striker, and Utility Caster, and sorcerers make one of\n\tthe easiest Faces in the game due to their skill list and their dependence on\n\tCharisma. The Divine Soul subclass also adds Healer to the class&#8217;s possible\n\troles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Sorcerers can be challenging to play, but at the same time they can be less\n\tcomplex than most spellcasting classes. The Sorcerer falls into a middle\n\tground between the Wizard and the Warlock. The Sorcerer lacks the versatility\n\tof a Wizard due to their limited number of spells known, but share many of the\n\tsame capabilities and almost all of the same spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Wizard is powerful because they own a tool for every problem, the\n\tSorcerer is powerful because they own a few good tools and can use them to fix\n\tany problem. The Sorcerer gets more spell slots than the Warlock, allowing\n\tthem to focus more on leveled spells than the Warlock, who must use them\n\tsparingly and rely heavily on cantrips and invocations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Sorcerer&#8217;s versatility comes from their ability to boost their spells\n\tusing Metamagic, shaping them to suit the needs of the moment. If you&#8217;re\n\taccustomed to playing a wizard, expect to cast a lot of low-level spells using\n\thigher-level spell slots to get as much utility as you can out of your limited\n\tnumber of spells known.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, consider our other supporting material for the Sorcerer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\">Sorcerer Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/spells\">Sorcerer Spells Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/metamagic\">Sorcerer Metamagic Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/sorcerers-levels-1-4-good-to-evil-a-guide-to-building-a-magical-being-rpgbot-podcast-s4e20\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Sorcerer Optimization Part 1<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/sorcerer-levels-5-20-mastering-magic-essential-spells-for-characters-rpgbot-podcast-s4e24\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26236\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Sorcerer Optimization Part 2<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

That means\n\tthat Concentration spells are easier to maintain without investing in options\n\tlike the War Caster feat.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: No armor or shields, and\n\tonly the most basic weapons, but the Sorcerer skill list contains\n\t<em>all<\/em> of the Face skills, including Insight.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Sorcerer casts spells the\n\tsame way a Bard does: You get a set number of spells known, and can cast any\n\tspell from that list so long as you have the slots to do so. This means that\n\tSorcerers always have fewer options available to them than a Wizard who can\n\tchange their spell list daily, but Sorcerers make up for this lack of\n\tversatility by being able to augment their spells with Metamagic. The Sorcerer\n\tspell list is a subset of the Wizard&#8217;s spell list (with a handful of additions\n\tlike Dominate Beast and Earthquake), but you still have plenty of options to\n\tchoose from.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the Sorcerer gets more cantrips than any\n\tother spellcaster, but they get fewer spells known than the Bard. Expect to\n\tcast low-levels spells at higher-level spell slots frequently, and to use\n\tmetamagic to customize your spells. Most importantly, expect to retrain\n\tlower-level spells whenever you get a better option, constantly adjusting your\n\tspells known to perfect your spellcasting capabilities.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>For help selecting spells, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/spells\"\n\t\t>Sorcerer Spell List Breakdown<\/a\n\t>.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sorcerous Origin<\/strong>: Sorcerer subclasses are briefly summarized\n\tbelow.

You have a limited pool per day, but you have the option of\n\t\tconsuming spell slots to get additional Sorcery Points. This pool is fairly\n\t\tlimited, so budgeting your sorcery points is crucial. If you need more, look\n\t\tat the Metamagic Adept feat and items like the Bloodwell Vial.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Flexible Casting<\/span>: Using Sorcery Points to\n\t\tget additional spell slots is very expensive, so only do it when you\n\t\tabsolutely need to do so. Converting spell slots to Sorcery Points is a bit\n\t\tless daunting once you have a large pool of spell slots, but be sure not to\n\t\tdo it too much or you will quickly run out of daily resources. There are\n\t\tsome cases where it can be very effective to turn a bunch of Sorcery Points\n\t\tinto cheap low-level spell slots, but those cases are rare.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic<\/span>: Metamagic allows you to stretch\n\tthe effects of your limited number of spells known, allowing you to easily\n\tcapitalize on existing spells instead of constantly needing to find and learn\n\tnew ones. With a pool of spells known as small as the Sorcerer&#8217;s, this is an\n\timportant capability.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>For help with Metamagic options, including the Metamagic Adept feat, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/metamagic\"\n\t\t>Sorcerer Metamagic Breakdown<\/a\n\t>.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sorcerous Restoration<\/span>: Four free Sorcery\n\tPoints gives you a lot of options, but it&#8217;s only 4 points every Short Rest. In\n\ta full adventuring day you can expect 2 Short Rests at most, so it&#8217;s 8 Sorcery\n\tPoints across a full day compared to the 20 that you already get and however\n\tmany you get from converting spell slots. Plus, a Bloodwell Vial will get you\n\t5 on a Short Rest if you spend at least one hit die, so this feels\n\tdisappointingly small.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optional-class-features\">Optional Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything, Optional Class Features offer ways to add additional features or replace existing ones. These rules are optional, and you should not assume that your DM will allow these features without consulting them first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments and suggestions for specific Optional Class Features are presented here, but for more information on handling Optional Class Features in general, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\">Practical Guide to Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Additional Sorcerer Spells<\/span> (Addition): A\n\tsurprisingly large number of additions, the Sorcerer gets numerous spells taken\n\tprimarily from the Wizard&#8217;s spell list, bringing the two classes a little\n\tcloser together in terms of spell options. The Sorcerer also gets Flame Blade,\n\tbut Flame Blade is garbage so it&#8217;s mostly there to say &#8220;neat, you get a druid\n\tspell&#8221;.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing the new spells on all sorcerers. They&#8217;re no better than\n\twhat sorcerers already get, but they introduce some excellent new ideas to the\n\tSorcerer&#8217;s spell options.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Metamagic Options<\/span> (Addition): Two\n\tinteresting new metamagic options.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing the new options on all sorcerers. The new options are\n\tgood but not as good as existing options like Heightened Spell and Quickened\n\tSpell, so they&#8217;re not going to cause balance issues.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sorcerous Versatility<\/span> (Addition): Like other\n\tspellcasters, the Sorcerer gains the ability to retrain a cantrip. Second, you\n\tcan retrain one Metamagic choice. Sorcerers get more cantrips than anyone else\n\tso retraining them isn&#8217;t as impactful, but retraining metamagic is a huge\n\tbenefit considering how few you get.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Sorcerous Versatility on all sorcerers. Like other\n\tretraining mechanics, it&#8217;s helpful but doesn&#8217;t actually make characters more\n\tpowerful because they&#8217;re not getting anything which they couldn&#8217;t already have\n\tat the same level.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Guidance<\/span> (Addition): This makes the\n\tspell Enhance Ability considerably less useful. A single sorcery point is a\n\tlow cost for insurance against bad rolls on ability checks.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Magical Guidance on all single-class sorcerers using\n\tsubclasses which I&#8217;ve rated <span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> or\n\t<span class=\"rating-red\">red<\/span>. Other sorcerers are already plenty\n\teffective, and if they need help with ability checks they can cast Enhance\n\tAbility.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Sorcerers are all about Charisma, and you can forego everything else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Take a bit for AC.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Take some to compensate for your d6\n\thit points and to support Concentration.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: A bit for knowledge skills might be\n\tnice.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Wisdom saves are common, and Insight\n\tis helpful for a Face.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Commands almost everything you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Sorcerer Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Charisma bonuses are absolutely essential.

For example, could you cast Fireball and cause a creature to\n\t\tsuffer Disadvantage on the Dexterity save for that same Fireball? Since this\n\t\titem is already so powerful, I&#8217;m inclined to believe that the curse effect\n\t\tbegins <em>after<\/em> the immediate effects of the spell, so Fireball\n\t\twouldn&#8217;t benefit, and while the target wouldn&#8217;t suffer Disadvantage on their\n\t\tinitial save against Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter, they would suffer\n\t\tDisadvantage on the save made at the end of their next turn.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Even with that conservative, cautious ruling, this is still a very\n\t\t\tpowerful item, allowing you to dramatically exceed the benefits of\n\t\t\tHeightened Spell at the cost of as little as one Sorcery Point. For\n\t\t\texample: you could target a creature with a cantrip that you&#8217;ve enhanced\n\t\t\twith metamagic (it doesn&#8217;t matter which, literally any of them will\n\t\t\tsuffice), and even if your cantrip is unsuccessful, you can then curse\n\t\t\tthe target with your Shadowfell Shard. Pick your party&#8217;s favorite type of\n\t\t\tsaving throw, then until the of your next turn you can hammer on the\n\t\t\ttarget with spells and special features which target that saving throw.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Your Sorcery Points are the only limitation on usage, so you&#8217;re free to\n\t\t\trepeat this every round at very little cost. This can turn low-level\n\t\t\tspells like Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp or Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter into a\n\t\t\tnearly guaranteed death sentence for even high-level foes. Spamming a\n\t\t\tmetamagic-enhanced Mind Sliver in order to repeat the curse effect and\n\t\t\tpile on a 1d4 save penalty is nearly unbeatable for most creatures, and if\n\t\t\tyou have two or three suitable spells which target differing saves you can\n\t\t\tmake this combo work against nearly any creature you meet.

The Charisma increase is the biggest draw, and I haven&#8217;t\n\tused the Dragonborn in a staple build yet, so I really want to double down on\n\tthe draconic theme of the character. You&#8217;ll need to choose a draconic ancestor\n\tto determine your breath weapon and your damage resistance. Personally I\n\talways prefer cones over lines, but that&#8217;s mostly personal preference. Also\n\tkeep in mind that you&#8217;ll be able to add damage resistance using your bloodline\n\tfeatures starting at level 6, so choose different ancestors for your race and\n\tfor your class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since staple builds are limited to the SRD and the Basic Rules, we don&#8217;t have\n\ta ton of spells to choose from, which means that the dragon ancestor you\n\tchoose for Draconic Bloodline should be a fire dragon. I recommend either cold\n\tor poison for your racial dragon ancestor. Cold will be more useful\n\toffensively, but there are a lot of enemies that deal poison damage which\n\tmakes poison resistance very useful defensively.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With high Charisma and access to all four Face skills, there is little reason\n\tfor you to not be the party&#8217;s Face. Between your background and your class\n\tskills, try to end up with Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion. Get\n\tInsight if it&#8217;s convenient, but your Wisdom isn&#8217;t high enough to be especially\n\tgood at it so hopefully someone in your party can fill in the gap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Acolyte, Criminal, Noble, and Soldier all get you one of the Face skills we\n\twant, but there&#8217;s no option to get two.

Otherwise I recommend Noble so that\n\tyou can get the three Charisma-based Face skills.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Sorcerers only really need Charisma, so feats can be a great option. Draconic\n\tBloodline&#8217;s Elemental Affinity feature emphasizes one element, which makes\n\tElemental Adept a particularly appealing option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Draconic Bloodline<br>Dragon Ancestor<br>Draconic Resilience<br>Spellcasting<br>Cantrips\n\t\t\t\t\tKnown:<br>&#8211; Chill Touch<br>&#8211; Mage Hand<br>&#8211; Prestidigitation<br>&#8211;\n\t\t\t\t\tRay of Frost<br>Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Shield<br>&#8211; Sleep<\/td><td>For your starting gear, take a light crossbow, a component pouch or arcane focus, either pack, and two daggers.<br><br>We get a lot at first level, and there are a lot of decision points. Things are a little less daunting at higher levels, but we have a lot of choices to make at first level.<br><br>First we get stuff from Draconic Bloodline. We need to choose a Dragon Ancestor, and since fire spells are more common than other damage spells in the SRD, I strongly recommend a fire dragon ancestor. Once we get elemental affinity at 6th level, that will present a significant damage boost across most spell levels, including cantrips.<br><br>Draconic Resilience matches Mage Armor, which saves us a spell known, and on top of that we get an extra hit point per level. That makes us very durable compared to other sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards.<br><br>Four cantrips is more cantrips than any other spellcaster. We have lots of great options. However, keep in mind that your light crossbow is a perfectly viable combat option. Even with just 14 Dexterity, +4 to hit and 1d8+2 damage will likely net more average damage than you can score with a cantrip.<br><br>Eventually Fire Bolt will be your go-to combat option, but for now we can focus on more interesting options. Chill Touch gives us one of the Sorcerer&#8217;s few options for dealing necrotic damage, and it&#8217;s a great fallback when you face enemies with problematic damage resistances. Ray of Frost provides a nice crowd control option. That&#8217;s plenty of offensive options at this level, so we have room to use the rest of our cantrips on utility.<br><br>For our leveled spells we&#8217;ll pick up general staples. Shield is a powerful defensive option at every level, and Sleep is powerful enough at low levels to end an encounter outright, but you may want to retrain it later when.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Font of Magic<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Burning Hands<\/td><td>Font of Magic is the Sorcerer&#8217;s most iconic class feature. Sorcery\n\t\t\t\t\tPoints allow you to create additional spell slots, but the primary\n\t\t\t\t\tappeal is Metamagic. We don&#8217;t get Metamagic until 3rd level, so for\n\t\t\t\t\tnow it&#8217;s basically just a free 1st-level spell slot.<br><br>At\n\t\t\t\t\tthis level we&#8217;ll learn Burning Hands. It&#8217;s probably redundant with\n\t\t\t\t\tyour breath weapon, so use your breath weapon first. We mostly want it\n\t\t\t\t\tfor when we pick up Elemental Affinity at 6th level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Metamagic<br>&#8211; Empowered Spell<br>&#8211; Quickened Spell<br>New\n\t\t\t\t\tSpell Known:<br>&#8211; Scorching Ray<\/td><td>3rd level introduces Metamagic. You get two choices now and two more later, giving you a total of 4 choices. There are 8 options, so obviously we&#8217;ll need to skip some.<br><br>We&#8217;ll take Empowered Spell and Quickened Spell. Empowered Spell insulates us against poor damage rolls, and you&#8217;ll get more use out of Empowered Spell at low levels than you will from Quickened Spell because you have so few Sorcery Points to spend, and rerolling three damage dice can provide a relatively large boost at this level.<br><br>Scorching Ray is a reliable damage option, but it&#8217;s not very exciting. Keep in mind that Elemental Affinity will only apply to one damage roll per spell, but that also means that you only need to hit with one of the three rays to get the bonus damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Charisma 16 -&gt; 18)<br>New Cantrips\n\t\t\t\t\tKnown:<br>&#8211; Fire Bolt<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211;\n\t\t\t\t\tBlindness\/Deafness<\/td><td>At this level our Charisma increases. More spell attack bonus means that cantrips will be considerably more reliable than a crossbow, so between the improved attack bonus and adding Fire Bolt, it&#8217;s likely time to retire your crossbow.<br><br>Blindness\/Deafness is an excellent debuff. Being blind makes it hard to target enemies with spells, and Disadvantage on attacks is a huge debuff. However, it works on Constitution saves so it&#8217;s not reliably against big burly enemies which typically rely on weapon attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Fireball<\/td><td>If you haven&#8217;t already retired your crossbow, now is the time. Even\n\t\t\t\t\tthe cantrips we&#8217;ve selected with the least damage now deal 2d8 (avg.\n\t\t\t\t\t9), easily outpacing your crossbow at 1d8+2 (avg. 6.5).<br><br>5th\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel also introduces 3rd-level spells. Take Fireball. That gives us a\n\t\t\t\t\tbig AOE damage option, so consider retraining Sleep for utility\n\t\t\t\t\toptions like Detect Magic if you&#8217;re not using it frequently.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Elemental Affinity<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Haste<\/td><td>Elemental Affinity gives us a serious boost to all of our fire\n\t\t\t\t\tspells. Fire Bolt jumps to 2d10+4. Adding the boost on top of AOE\n\t\t\t\t\tspells like Burning Hands and Fireball makes them especially potent\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the damage boost applies to every target.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Wall of Fire<\/td><td>Wall of Fire is the first area control option we&#8217;ve taken. The first damage roll will benefit from Elemental Affinity, but the additional damage after that won&#8217;t.<br><br>Use Wall of Fire to alter the layout of a fight; split up groups of enemies so that enemies are forced to to suffer extra damage to reach you and your allies. Once enemies are separated they&#8217;ll either take the damage to get to you, or they&#8217;ll be stuck waiting while you kill their allies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Charisma 18 -&gt; 20)<br>New Spell\n\t\t\t\t\tKnown:<br>&#8211; Polymorph<\/td><td>Another Charisma increase means better spell attacks, higher DC&#8217;s, more damage from Elemental Affinity, and more dice from Empowered Spell.<br><br>Polymorph adds a powerful buff option for yourself or for your allies, but you can also use it to turn enemies into something harmless.<br><br>By this level you have enough Sorcery Points that you should be experimenting with Quickened Spell. Keep in mind that you still can&#8217;t cast two leveled spells in a turn (unless you got a second Action from something like Action Surge), so Quickened Spell typically means that you&#8217;re doing something else with your Action like casting a Cantrip.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Cone of Cold<\/td><td>5th level spells are important because they&#8217;re the highest-level\n\t\t\t\t\tspell slots which you can create with Sorcery Points. Unfortunately,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe SRD and the Basic Rules contain no fire damage spells at this\n\t\t\t\t\tlevel. Instead, rely on lower-level spells cast using 5th-level spell\n\t\t\t\t\tslots. Fireball cast as a 5th-level spell deals 10d6 damage (avg. 35)\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared to Cone of Cold&#8217;s 8d8 (avg. 36), so the gap in damage is\n\t\t\t\t\talready negligible, and Elemental Affinity will make Fireball more\n\t\t\t\t\teffective.<br><br>Empowered Spell is more effective for spells\n\t\t\t\t\twith fewer but larger dice, which should be enough that Cone of Cold\n\t\t\t\t\tcan do more damage than Fireball if you want to spend a Sorcery Point\n\t\t\t\t\tto buff it. And if you&#8217;re going to cast your high-level spell slot,\n\t\t\t\t\tspending a Sorcery Point to get some more power is worth the cost.<br><br>That\n\t\t\t\t\tcomparison really calls attention to how Sorcerers can adjust their\n\t\t\t\t\tlimited number of spells on the fly to get more versatility from their\n\t\t\t\t\trelatively limited number of spells known.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Metamagic<br>&#8211; Twinned Spell<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Any<br>New\n\t\t\t\t\tSpell Known:<br>&#8211; Hold Monster<\/td><td>We get some great stuff at this level. An additional metamagic option\n\t\t\t\t\tgives us even more ways to customize our spells. Using Twinned Spell\n\t\t\t\t\ton single-target spells like Blindness\/Deafness and Hold Monster means\n\t\t\t\t\tthat we can target additional enemies as though we were casting those\n\t\t\t\t\tspells using higher-level spell slots, by using Twinned Spell. You can\n\t\t\t\t\talso twin powerful spells like Polymorph which are limited to single\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Sunbeam<\/td><td>6th-level spells introduce our first spell slots that we can&#8217;t create\n\t\t\t\t\tusing Sorcery Points. They&#8217;re our &#8220;big guns&#8221;, even well into high\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels, and since spellcasters get so few high-level spell slots you\n\t\t\t\t\treally need to get a lot out of each of them.<br><br>Sunbeam,\n\t\t\t\t\twhile its initial damage is lower than lower-level options like Cone\n\t\t\t\t\tof Cold, you can use it every round for a full minute, dealing out a\n\t\t\t\t\thuge amount of damage with a single spell slot. It&#8217;s also one of the\n\t\t\t\t\tonly ways for the Sorcerer to deal radiant damage, and blinding foes\n\t\t\t\t\tis really effective. If you use Quickened Spell to cast it, you cast\n\t\t\t\t\tthe initial beam as a Bonus Action and you can still use your Action\n\t\t\t\t\ton the same turn to fire another beam.<br><br>This is also the\n\t\t\t\t\tlast level at which the Sorcerer learns a new spell at every level.\n\t\t\t\t\tInstead, you&#8217;ll learn one new spell each time that you get access to a\n\t\t\t\t\tnew spell level. Expect to rely on your lower-level spells cast with\n\t\t\t\t\thigher-level spell slots, and retrain any low-level spells which\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not using.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Constitution 14 -&gt; 16)<\/td><td>This is our fist ability score increase that we don&#8217;t really need, so\n\t\t\t\t\tif you&#8217;ve decided to experiment with feats now is the time.

Fire Storm&#8217;s big appeal (beyond the\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage type) is that you can position the cubes very flexibly to avoid\n\t\t\t\t\tyour allies. You can also use Empowered Spell to reroll low dice, and\n\t\t\t\t\tsince Fire Storm uses d10&#8217;s you&#8217;ll get a lot of mileage out of\n\t\t\t\t\tEmpowered Spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Dragon Wings<\/td><td>Dragon Wings means free, persistent flight without maintaining concentration or spending a spell slot.
