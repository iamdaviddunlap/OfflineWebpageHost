With good martial capabilities\n\tand a dependence on Charisma, the Thaumaturge fits easily as a Face, and\n\tStriker. Depending on your build choices, you could also function as a Scout\n\tand you can pick up a few Defender, Healer, and Utility Caster capabilities,\n\tthough you won&#8217;t match a fighter as a Defender or a full spellcaster on other\n\troles. In some ways, the Thaumaturge is close to the Rogue in terms of party\n\trole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Much like the Fighter, which becomes unique by your choices of equipment and\n\tclass feats, the Thaumaturge distinguishes themselves by their preferred\n\tImplements, allowing you to pick up exciting capabilities based on whatever\n\tassortment of trinkets and knick-knacks you&#8217;ve collected. Several feats lean\n\tinto this theme, allowing you to create and use free temporary magic items\n\tlike scrolls and talismans which are usually expensive single-use tools for\n\tmost characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Thaumaturge does face some specific challenges. It&#8217;s a martial\n\tclass with Charisma as its Key Ability Score, so you will simply never be as\n\teffective with a weapon as other martial classes like the Champion or the\n\tFighter. You need to constantly juggle which items you&#8217;re holding, and your\n\tmost important class features often place a tax on your action economy, so\n\tthere isn&#8217;t as much room to play with action options as there is with many\n\tother classes. This is a complicated class to build and play, but it can\n\tabsolutely be worth the effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite their deep customizability and a whole lot of great ideas in the\n\tclass, several of the Thaumaturge&#8217;s options are frustrating due to apparent\n\teditorial errors which have yet to be corrected in Errata. Among the most\n\tconsistent: many things allow you to use your Class DC in place of a spell or\n\titem&#8217;s existing DC, but those same options make no mention of spell attacks,\n\twhich means that a huge number of enticing options simply don&#8217;t work for the\n\tThaumaturge, and the text doesn&#8217;t make it clear if this is intentional or\n\tmerely an error.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Thaumaturge Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Thaumaturge Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#strengthbased\">Strength-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dexteritybased\">Dexterity-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#charismabased\">Charisma-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Thaumaturge Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Thaumaturge Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Thaumaturge Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-skill-feats\">General Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Thaumaturge Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#class-feats\">Class Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#class-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Thaumaturge Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Thaumaturge Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

If you&#8217;re looking at innate spells, consider defensive options,\n\tbuffs, and utility options, but be mindful of your action economy because\n\tExploit Vulnerability and Intensify Vulnerability place a lot of strain on\n\tyour limited number of actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a martial character, the Thaumaturge doesn&#8217;t get access to\n\tCritical Specialization Effects by default.

Since the Implements\n\t\trequire a free hand, you can&#8217;t use two-handed ranged weapons like bows or\n\t\tmost crossbows, limiting you to pistols and hand crossbows.

Very\n\t\tefficient, and you&#8217;ll benefit from this constantly both in and out of\n\t\tcombat.

The\n\t\trange is 60 feet rather than within your melee reach, allowing you to use\n\t\tthis at range. You get the option to use either Deception or Intimidation,\n\t\twhich means that you could ignore the Deception skill in favor of\n\t\tIntimidation if you didn&#8217;t have the resources to invest in both. You can get\n\t\ta bonus to your check against certain creatures, but in most campaigns that\n\t\twill rarely come into play. Finally, the Success effect is improved so that\n\t\tthe target is Flat-Footed against all of your Attacks for the rest of your\n\t\tcurrent turn rather than just your next Attack that turn.\n\t\t<p>With those things in mind, is this worth the feat and the Action to use\n\t\t\tit? Beyond the AC penalty, the Thaumaturge gains no benefit from making\n\t\t\tthe target Flat-Footed, and considering that your action economy is\n\t\t\talready strained by Exploit Vulnerability and eventually Intensify\n\t\t\tVulnerability, it&#8217;s hard to see where this fits into your tactics. I would\n\t\t\tlove this on a rogue, but a Thaumaturge may struggle to use this\n\t\t\tconsistently.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Familiars are excellent, but without the ability to cast spells and\n\t\tdeliver them via a familiar or to get other resources like Reagents, your\n\t\tfamiliar is reduced to its most basic functions.

Persistent damage is definitely a problem,\n\t\tbut reducing the DC to end it from 15 to 10 still leaves a very high chance\n\t\tthat your friend is going to continue burning\/melting\/bleeding, so spending\n\t\ta feat and two Actions to <em>maybe<\/em> help is hard to justify. This feat\n\t\twill rarely be more useful than Administer First Aid, and even in that\n\t\tnarrow case where this is better, it still has a high likelihood of\n\t\tfailure.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scroll Thaumaturgy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Stunningly good. Access to every spell via scrolls means easy access to\n\t\tmagical solutions to any problem, provided that you can afford the scrolls.\n\t\tCrucial options like Heal, utilities like See Invisibility, and whatever\n\t\telse you might need. I would rarely consider scrolls as an offensive option\n\t\tdue to the persistent cost of doing so, but a well-timed Fireball is hard to\n\t\tbeat. At low levels this will be too expensive to use frequently, so\n\t\tconsider picking this up a few levels later or retrain your 1st-level class\n\t\tfeat when it starts to decline.\n\t\t<p>Keep in mind that you use your class DC for the scroll&#8217;s save DC, but the\n\t\t\ttext makes no mention of how you handle spell attacks. I believe this was\n\t\t\tan accidental omission rather than an intentional limitation, but\n\t\t\thopefully we&#8217;ll get some errata to clear it up.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Call Implement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: For the vast majority of implements, this is too situational to justify.\n\t\tThe wording on what happens if you fail to recall your item is attrocious.\n\t\tRAW, if you fail to recall your implement even once, you&#8217;re unable to recall\n\t\tyour implement <em>permanently<\/em>. I really hope that this is\n\t\tunintentional. It would be reasonable to regain the ability to recall your\n\t\timplement once you retrieve it manually, but that&#8217;s not what&#8217;s in the text.\n\t\t<p>If you choose the Weapon implement with a thrown weapon, you can use Call\n\t\t\tImplement to allow you to repeatedly retrieve and throw your weapon. If\n\t\t\tyou go this route, plan to retrain this as soon as you can get a Returning\n\t\t\trune to eliminate the constant Action cost to get your weapon back for\n\t\t\tanother throw.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enhanced Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Familiars are really cool, but the Thaumaturge doesn&#8217;t have any unique\n\t\tways to interact with their familiar.

However, it&#8217;s very\n\t\tshort-lived and it&#8217;s annoying to track, so it will often feel like a lot of\n\t\teffort for a 1 in 10 chance to actually matter. Against groups of identical\n\t\tlow-level enemies, it&#8217;s more likely to be impactful both because you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing to draw more attacks and because you&#8217;re more likely to score a\n\t\tCritical Success to get the larger bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Talisman Esoterica<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Talismans are excellent but expensive, so for most characters you might\n\t\tgrab a few for specific problems and hope that you never need them.

Misfortune affects aren&#8217;t especially rare, but\n\t\tthey won&#8217;t appear in most game sessions, so you might go a long time without\n\t\tneeding this, need it every turn for one encounter, then go back to not\n\t\tneeding it again for months of real-world time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Breached Defenses<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Resistance to physical damage is common and will become more common as\n\t\tyou gain levels. Against some enemies, the resistance will be high enough\n\t\tthat it may outweight the Vulnerability imposed by Exploit Vulnerability. In\n\t\tthose cases, Breached Defenses will net more total damage. However, I&#8217;m not\n\t\tcertain how often that will be the case. Personal Antithesis adds a Weakness\n\t\tequal to 2 + half your level, which may be enough that Breach Defenses will\n\t\talmost never be more impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Instructive Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Diverse Lore is significantly more effective for solving the same\n\t\tproblem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Paired Link<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially very useful, but it depends heavily on your build and on that\n\t\tof whoever recieves the other half of your item.

Getting a few for free guaranteed is helpful, and the easy\n\t\t+2 bonus on the skill check means that your rituals are considerably more\n\t\treliable. Keep in mind that the text of this feat is identical to that of\n\t\tthe Ritualist Dedication feat (Advanced Player&#8217;s Guide), and there are no\n\t\tother Thaumaturge feats which require Thaumaturgic Ritualist, so if you want\n\t\tto explore rituals, the Ritualist archetype may be a more appealing\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-6\">6th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">One More Activation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: You only get to use this once per day <em>total<\/em>, not once per day\n\t\tper item.

A free scroll\n\t\tevery day is nice, but 1st-level spells are inexpensive. You get a 2nd-level\n\t\tscroll in two levels, so this stays somewhat useful, but these low-level\n\t\tscrolls are still inexpensive enough that you can afford to buy them when\n\t\tyou need them.

The ability to apply the Personal Anthisesis to multiple\n\t\tcreatures of the same type means that you can easily carve through numerous\n\t\tsmall creatures of the same type. You won&#8217;t always need this, but it will\n\t\thelp often enough that it&#8217;s worth a feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cursed Effigy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Against powerful foes which justify the Action cost, this could make a\n\t\tbig difference. The difficulty is finding options to capitalize on the\n\t\tpenalty. Implement options like the Bell&#8217;s Ring Bell and the Wand&#8217;s Fling\n\t\tMagic both work, and if you have Scroll Thaumaturgy you could use\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elaborate Talisman Esoterica<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: A deeper pool of expendable resources.

You can take this a second time at\n\t\tlevel 14 to get a total of 6 free talismans per day, but at that point you\n\t\tmight have trouble using them all since you can only have on talisman on a\n\t\tweapon at a time and you need time to attach a new one between fights.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incredible Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Familiars are really cool, but the Thaumaturge doesn&#8217;t have any unique\n\t\tways to interact with their familiar.

This keeps those\n\t\texcellent items perpetually relevant, allowing you to stick to low-level\n\t\tversions of items rather than upgrading to a more expensive version purely\n\t\tfor the better save DC.

If you have at least one Implement\n\t\twith a Reaction (and you absolutely should), this is fantastic. Just\n\t\tremember that you can still only take one Reaction in response to a\n\t\ttriggering event, so there will be rounds in which you don&#8217;t get to use both\n\t\tReactions.\n\t\t<p>You might also use this to capitalize on multiple Implements with\n\t\t\tReaction options, but doing so is often both harder and less effective.\n\t\t\tThe Amulet, the Bell, and the Weapon all have Reaction options, but since\n\t\t\tyou only get one Reaction you generally can&#8217;t use them both on the same\n\t\t\tturn.

You don&#8217;t\n\t\tnecessarily need this, but if you have 4 or 6 free Talismans each day, you\n\t\tmight have days where you don&#8217;t get to use them all without this feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Trespass Teleportation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational, and when it does apply it&#8217;s both complicated and risky.\n\t\tYou maintain your position relative to the target, so they&#8217;re free to put\n\t\tyou somewhere extreemly unpleasant. If they teleport into the air becuase\n\t\tthey can fly, congratulations: you&#8217;re airborn. If they teleport into a\n\t\tdungeon or something, you might find yourself in a wall and the feat doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tspecify how that&#8217;s handled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Implement&#8217;s Flight<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Effectively permanent flight without an Action cost to activate. Keep in\n\t\tmind that you do still need to follow the rules for flight, so you need to\n\t\tspend an Action flying to remain aloft.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Seven-Part Link<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Hopefully by this level your party has learned to work with the existing\n\t\tranges of their spells. If not, lower-level options like familiar or the\n\t\tReach Spell feat can solve this problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sever Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Not always applicable, but at this level magic is abundant and many\n\t\tpowerful enemies will have spells to buff themselves. This allows you to\n\t\trepeatedly attempt to counteract those spells without spending limited\n\t\tresources like spell slots, so you&#8217;re free to attempt this repeatedly until\n\t\tit works.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grand Scroll Esoterica<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: These spells are very powerful and the scrolls are justifiably expensive,\n\t\tso getting three for free lets you do a lot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Implement&#8217;s Assault<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re in an encounter with two or more foes, this is likely to yield\n\t\tmore damage output than attacking a signle target twice. If you have\n\t\tSympathetic Vulnerabilities and you already have Exploit Vulnerability\n\t\trunning, you can carve through hordes of enemies of the same type in a\n\t\thurry. Note that the Sweep weapon property appears to apply here, so\n\t\tstrongly consider weapons like axes and make your first Strike against the\n\t\tleast-important target in range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intense Implement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially very powerful, but it depends on your choice of Implements.\n\t\tYou might intentionally choose an implement with a poor Adept Benefit but a\n\t\tstrong Initiate Benefit, in which case this won&#8217;t help you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ubiquitous Weakness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Share Weakness, but it affects allies within 30 feet and doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\tyou to spend an Action to trigger the benefits. It won&#8217;t help against\n\t\tenemies which don&#8217;t have a specific Weakness, but it&#8217;s very powerful when it\n\t\tdoes. If you have several allies in your party who rely on Strikes, this may\n\t\tbe worthwhile. But if you only have one other martial ally and everyone else\n\t\tis using spells, you won&#8217;t get enough benefit from this to justify the\n\t\tfeat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unlimited Demesne<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: This solves several of the issues with Thaumaturge&#8217;s Demesne, but doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tmake it much more useful. You still don&#8217;t get any specific, tangible benefit\n\t\tfrom using it. Instead, take Grand Scroll Esoterica and use one of your\n\t\tscrolls to cast Magnificent Mansion. You get all the same comfort and\n\t\tprotection, plus you also get a 6th-level spell scroll. Even better, use a\n\t\tlower-level magical option to get a safe place to sleep which doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire you to have uncontested ownership of a 100 ft. square of land and\n\t\tsave your high-level scrolls for something more interesting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wonder Worker<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">DA<\/a><\/sup>: Powerful, but also massively expensive to make it work since you need to\n\t\tinvest so heavily in the specified skills on a class which has no other need\n\t\tto use those skills. You might limit yourself to one tradition to minimize\n\t\tthe cost, but at that point why not just play a spellcaster?\n\t\t<p>Amazingly, this is the only Thaumaturge option that specifies that it\n\t\t\tworks with spell attacks.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Incredible Investiture<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The Thaumaturge has several options to encourage collecting and using\n\t\tnumerous magic items. Incredible Investiture lets you stretch that a little\n\t\tbit further. If you do go this route, consider Thaumaturge&#8217;s Investiture\n\t\tinstead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Toughness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 8+ hit points is low for a front-line martial character, and Toughness\n\t\tcan close some of the gap between you and more durable characters like the\n\t\tFighter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Thaumaturge Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Since you need a free hand to hold implements and since the Weapon implement\n\tcan only be one-handed, you&#8217;re limited to one-handed weapons. With the damage\n\tbonuses provided by Exploit Vulnerability, you want to hit with as many\n\tStrikes as possible, so Agile weapons are a good idea. You can also afford to\n\tuse weapons with a small damage die since you get a lot of damage from other\n\tsourcers, so weapons like the Starknife feel like less of a sacrifice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to use ranged weapons, your options are limited. Thrown weapons,\n\thand crossbows, and one-handed firearms are your best bet. Even then, you need\n\tto take the Ammunition Thaumaturgy feat to be able to reload\n\tcrossbows\/firearms, which presents a persistent tax. It may be best to stick\n\tto melee until you can pick up a Returning rune for a thrown weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hatchet<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good go-to option for Strength-based builds, the Hatchet has Agile and\n\t\tThrown. Sweep may be useful in encounters where Exploit Vulnerability can\n\t\taffect multiple foes of the same type.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortsword<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good go-to for melee-only builds, but if you&#8217;re not going to benefit\n\t\tfrom Finesse, the Hatchet is a better choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Starknife<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Agile, Deadly d6, Finesse, and you can throw it, allowing you to easily\n\t\tfight both in melee and at range. The Hatchet has a larger damage die, but\n\t\tthe Starknife has twice as much range and Deadly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Thaumaturge Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explorer&#8217;s Clothing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>: Where every\n\t\tDexterity-based build wants to end up.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Leather<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>: Your likely\n\t\tstarting armor for Dexterity-based builds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Leather<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>: Unless you\n\t\tcompletely dumped Strength, this is a good starting armor for\n\t\tDexterity-based builds.

That leaves lots of room for feats which offer more\n\t\tinteresting ways to make an attack. Low-level options like Exacting Strike\n\t\tand Lunge may be helpful.
