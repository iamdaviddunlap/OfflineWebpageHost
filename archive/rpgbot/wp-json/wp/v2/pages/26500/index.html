Where in 1e your save DC included the level of the spell, in Pathfinder 2e your Spell Save DC is the same for any spell that you cast (though it gets complicated if you can cast spells from multiple traditions). If you cast a 1st-level spell one turn, then a 9th-level spell the next, they will have the same save DC. Because of this change, low-level spells can remain fantastically useful at high levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Cantrips are always heightened to half your level rounded up, so they&#8217;ll match the level of the highest-level spells that you can cast. This scaling keeps Cantrips a reliable source of damage output at any level, though most spellcasters still want to rely on ranked spells when they suit the situation rather than counting on Cantrips as your only source of damage output. Because your number of Cantrips is limited, many spellcaster should try to split their options between damage and utility. A spellcaster whose only capability is damage is basically an archer with extra steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<!--\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-\"><\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a>)<\/sup>: <\/li>\n\t-->\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Approximate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a>)<\/sup>: Absolutely\n\t\tuseless.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Bullhorn<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a>)<\/sup>: Absolutely\n\t\tuseless even for a Bard.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Caustic Blast<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: A 5-foot\n\t\tburst can hit as many as 4 creatures, but more likely you&#8217;ll hit two\n\t\tadjacent creatures. The damage is decent, but the scaling is slow, so you&#8217;ll\n\t\thave Rank gaps where the damage falls behind.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This isn&#8217;t a bad spell, but it fills a similar function to Electric Arc,\n\t\t\twhich is better in the vast majority of situations. Electric Arc&#8217;s damage\n\t\t\tis more consistent and scales more smoothly, plus it allows much more\n\t\t\tspace between your two targets. Caustic Blast can only beat Electric Arc\n\t\t\tif you can hit three or more targets or if one or more of the targets\n\t\t\tcritically fails their save and starts taking Persistent Damage.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Caustic Blast also competes with Scatter Scree. While Scatter Scree can\n\t\t\tonly affect 2 squares and and doesn&#8217;t apply Persistent Damage, Scatter\n\t\t\tScree&#8217;s damage scales more consistently, and the gauranteed Difficult\n\t\t\tTerrain may be more useful than very occasionally getting a tiny bit of\n\t\t\tPersistent Damage.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Widen Spell would make this very exciting, but tragically Widen Spell\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t apply to bursts this small.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Prior to the remaster, Caustic Blast was called Acid Splash and relied on\n\t\t\ta primary target and splash damage.

You&#8217;re gambling for critical failures to stun the\n\t\ttarget. Against single enemies that&#8217;s a bad gamble, and doing more damage to\n\t\tquickly eliminate the target is a better choice. Against larger numbers of\n\t\tlow-level enemies, use area damage.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Prior to the remaster, Daze dealt damage equal to your spellcasting\n\t\t\tAbility Modifier.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Deep Breath<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too\n\t\tsituational and too limited.

Someone in every party needs to know this. You can get it\n\t\tvia the Arcane Sense Skill Feat, but it won&#8217;t Heighten normall, so you will\n\t\tlose some of the more powerful features. Even so, it&#8217;s better to have this\n\t\tat Rank 1 than not at all.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The remastered version of Detect Magic has different functions when\n\t\t\tHeightened from the original version. Because schools of magic went away\n\t\t\tin the remaster, the ability to identify schools of magic didn&#8217;t make\n\t\t\tsense anymore.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Metal<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too\n\t\tsituational. This would be great for NPC merchants worried about adventurers\n\t\ttrying to commit fraud, but for players this will probably never matter.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Draw Moisture<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Extremely\n\t\tsituational. If survival elements were more impactful in PF2 this might be\n\t\texciting, but this is not that game.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eat Fire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Resistance to\n\t\tone of the most common damage types in the game as a Reaction. Sure, the\n\t\tresistance scales very slowly, but for such a small cost it&#8217;s fantastic.\n\t\tEven Ancestries\/Heritages which provide permanent fire resistance will\n\t\tprovide less resistance than Eat Fire does.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>On top of that, you can can create a small burst of Smoke which can\n\t\t\tconceal creatures within it, potentially including you, which lasts for a\n\t\t\tfull minute. This adds yet another powerful defensive option.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this doesn&#8217;t care about your spellcasting stats, it&#8217;s a fantastic\n\t\t\tInnate Spell. It&#8217;s also on every spell list except Divine, making it an\n\t\t\teasy go-to option for a huge number of characters.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Electric Arc<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: The gold\n\t\tstandard of ranged attack cantrips. If you can target two enemies, this will\n\t\teasy outdo the initial damage of any other cantrip. In a long fight you\n\t\tmight get more out of Persistent Damage from cantrips like Gouging Claw, but\n\t\tElectric Arc is consistent, reliable, and predictable. If you&#8217;re not\n\t\tfortunate enough to have it on your spell list (it&#8217;s only Arcane\/Primal),\n\t\tgetting it as an Innate Spell or via Adapted Cantrip is a great choice.\n\t\t<p>Prior to the remaster, Electric Arc dealt 1d4+Modifier damage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Counter<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Uncommon):\n\t\tThis is very similar to how Counterspell works, provided that you have a\n\t\tqualifying spell. This notably doesn&#8217;t require your own spell to be of any\n\t\tparticular Rank, so you may be able to use 1st-Rank Arcane Spells to\n\t\tcounteract much more powerful spells.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The &#8220;elemental cycle&#8221; omits numerous damage types including air, acid,\n\t\t\tcold, and electricity, meaning that against a huge number of spells, this\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t function. Fire spells will be the most common by far, so maybe\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll benefit from having a water spell on hand to counter fire\n\t\t\tspells.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Figment<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very useful,\n\t\tbut since this depends on a Deception check to Create a Diversion, everyone\n\t\texcept for Charisma-based spellcasters may struggle to make this effective.\n\t\tOf course, your GM may let you accomplish quite a bit before you actually\n\t\troll to Create a Diversion.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This replaces the Legacy spell Ghost Sound, but the effects of Figment\n\t\t\tare much more versatile.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Gale Blast<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC2<\/a>)<\/sup>: Decent damage\n\t\tand good scaling. This is a great option for melee casters or for ranged\n\t\tcasters that want a way to push enemies out of melee.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Glass Shield<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Functionally\n\t\tsimilar to Shield, but you trade much of Shield&#8217;s Hardness for retaliatory\n\t\tdamage. If you&#8217;re a melee caster, this is absolutely worth considering, but\n\t\tranged casters should stick to Shield. You can absolutely take both, which\n\t\tmay be a good idea since they both have a cooldown once you use the Reaction\n\t\tto block damage.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The retaliatory damage starts to add your Spellcasting Attribute Modifier\n\t\t\twhen you reach level 5 and start casting 3rd-Rank Arcane Spells. If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\ttaking Glass Shield as an Innate Spell and have poor stats, Shield may be\n\t\t\ta safer choice.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gouging Claw<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Good base\n\t\tdamage plus Persistent Damage on hit. This is the gold standard for melee\n\t\tattack cantrips.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Prior to the remaster, Gouging Claw dealt 1d6+Modifier damage and only\n\t\t\tapplied Persistent Damage on a critical hit. While the Persistent Damage\n\t\t\tscaled better in the Legacy version, applying bleed on every hit means\n\t\t\tyour expected damage output is much more consistent.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ignition<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Good\n\t\tsingle-target damage and persistent damage on a crit. You can also use it as\n\t\ta melee attack, which is appealing for casters who occasionally step into\n\t\tmelee because you can use one Cantrip both in melee and at range. For\n\t\tcasters who are in melee more consistently, look at Gouging Claw instead.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Prior to the remaster, this spell was called &#8220;Produce Flame&#8221;. The\n\t\t\tremaster also updated the spell so that using Ignition in melee increases\n\t\t\tthe damage dice (including the Persistent Damage) from d4&#8217;s to d6&#8217;s.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Illuminate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very\n\t\tdramatic, but not useful enough to justify a spell even with a 1-Action\n\t\tcasting time. Using it on unwilling targets could be amusing, but likely\n\t\twon&#8217;t do any harm beyond giving away their location.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Infectious Enthusiasm<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a>)<\/sup>: The Action\n\t\tcost is way too high for such as small benefit. Compare this to the Bard&#8217;s\n\t\tCourageous Anthem, which affects your whole party, provides better benefits,\n\t\tand costs half as many Actions to cast. Yes, it&#8217;s a class-exclusive Focus\n\t\tSpell, but this seems to be trying to mimic the Bard&#8217;s capabilities, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s absolutely not doing the job.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Invoke True Name<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a>)<\/sup>: This would be\n\t\treally good against a creature whose True Name you know, but learning a\n\t\tcreature&#8217;s True Name is a major plot point. You might get to use this\n\t\tagainst one or two creatures in an entire campaign if you&#8217;re lucky.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: An\n\t\tadventuring staple. Most of the time you&#8217;ll attach light to your party&#8217;s\n\t\tDefender so that they can both see and draw attention in otherwise dark\n\t\tplaces, but sometimes you&#8217;ll also want to place lights at a distance to\n\t\texpose enemies, to investigate areas from afar, or to draw attention.\n\t\tRemember that you can have up to 4 lights running at once, so you&#8217;re free to\n\t\tspread them out to cover a large area.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Prior to the remaster, the functions of Light were split between the\n\t\t\tDancing Lights and Light cantrips. Consolidating the two and removing the\n\t\t\tneed to Sustain Dancing Lights makes everything much more usable. However,\n\t\t\tsince you can no longer target an object, you can no longer cast light on\n\t\t\tsomething before throwing it into a deep pit, so you&#8217;ll still need to haul\n\t\t\ttorches around from time to time.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Live Wire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC2<\/a>)<\/sup>: The damage is\n\t\tgood, but ignition works very simialarly, scales better, and works in melee.\n\t\tThe only appeal of Live Wire over Ignition is that fire resistance is\n\t\tcommon. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll get enough value from this to justify it as a\n\t\tbackup Cantrip.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Message<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Only\n\t\tsituationally useful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Needle Darts<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">RoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Excellent\n\t\tdirect damage. The ability to add special metal types to the damage means\n\t\tthat you can easily trigger weaknesses, adding a great deal of additional\n\t\tdamage at potentially no cost. The damage is comparable to Telekinetic\n\t\tProjectile, though Needle Darts scales very slightly slower in exchange for\n\t\tPersistent Damage on a Critical Hit.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Pathfinder Society requires the caster to hold at least one chunk of\n\t\t\tmetal or an item made of the metal which you&#8217;re using to cast the spell. A\n\t\t\tcold iron dagger, a silver coin, and adamantine shield, etc. This is minor\n\t\t\tinconvenience because you&#8217;ll need to Manipulate to retrieve whatever\n\t\t\tvariety of metal you need, but I think it&#8217;s a fair balancing requirement\n\t\t\tbecause it adds a cost to benefit from a creature&#8217;s weaknesses.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Phase Bolt<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC2<\/a>)<\/sup>: Your allies\n\t\tfighting in melee will frequently grant your enemies Cover against your\n\t\tattacks. This nearly avoids that issue. Of course, you could also use a\n\t\tcantrip that calls for a saving throw instead, such as Electric Arc.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Prestidigitation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Neat, but not\n\t\tespecially impactful.

The damage reduced is\n\t\tconsiderably greater than the damage that you take, making it a very\n\t\tefficient trade. If you&#8217;re relying on your Minion as a tank, this can\n\t\tconsiderable improve how much damage your party can absorb in combat before\n\t\tit becomes a problem.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Puff of Poison<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC2<\/a>)<\/sup>: The damage\n\t\tisn&#8217;t great, but the appeal here is Persistent Damage without a Critical\n\t\tSuccess on an attack or a Critical Failure on a save. Reliably applying\n\t\tPersistant Damage is really impactful, and will easily make up for the\n\t\trelative difference in damage even as Cantrip damage scales with Rank. The\n\t\tbiggest issues is the 10-foot range, which largely limits this to melee\n\t\tcasters or casters with\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=4577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reach Spell<\/a>.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Read Aura<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Useful for\n\t\tlocating and identifying magic items, ongoing spell effects, etc. Detect\n\t\tMagic is frequently sufficient, but sometimes you need more precision than\n\t\tDetect Magic offers.

The illusion&#8217;s stats are decent, and with two Actions per\n\t\tround it can hopefully make a few strikes before something gets through the\n\t\tillusion&#8217;s AC.

Normally spells which\n\t\tdeal multiple types of damage suffer from multiple resistances, but this\n\t\talso ignores 10 points of each resistance, which helps quite a bit. It&#8217;s\n\t\tquite a bit more damage than Meteor Swarm upcast at 10th level (avg. 94.5),\n\t\tbut in some cases Meteor Swarm&#8217;s 4 independent AOEs may still be preferable\n\t\tbecause it can hit more targets.
