Mapping the ebbs and flows of the story, plotting the course for antagonists, and laying plot hooks can all take a great deal of planning and forethought. But with some effort (and a little bit of math), we can find a skeletal structure for campaign planning which greatly simplifies the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article will help you with none of those problems. Instead, this article breaks down the underlying math and mechanics of a campaign run from 1st level through 20th, including all of the encounters, experience, and treasure. By making some base assumptions we can build the mechanical skeleton of a campaign and determine exactly where things need to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>But why do this? Why is this important? Because I have never once met a DM who thought of an entire campaign starting at the beginning and proceeding in order to the end. That&#8217;s now how people think. If you&#8217;ve ever had a great idea for a dungeon or a piece of treasure and didn&#8217;t know where to fit it into your campaign, this article will help you do it. If you&#8217;ve ever worried that you don&#8217;t have enough content to get players to level 20 (which isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing), this article will help you find out where you have gaps. If you&#8217;ve ever worried that you&#8217;re not giving your players enough treasure, this article will help you determine exactly where and when you should place it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article clearly answers several questions about 5th edition and its underlying math:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How many encounters should players face at each level?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How much gold should I give my players at each level?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How many magic items should I give my players at each level?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How many in-game days does it take to reach level 20?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"assumptions\">Assumptions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The remainder of this article relies on a handful of assumptions. Tweaking these assumptions will result in changes to the &#8220;skeleton&#8221; which we will be building in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"experience-points\">Experience Points<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The campaign skeleton will assume that you are awarding experience points rather than using &#8220;Milestone Leveling&#8221; or some other system. This means that players will need a certain number of encounters of CR equal to their level worth of experience to gain a level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the easier assumptions to change. You can use the campaign skeleton to get an idea of the number of encounters to include, then abandon experience points altogether, thereby achieving more flexibility in encounter design without altering the pace of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"default-random-treasure\">Default Random Treasure<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide includes rules for random treasure. These rules don&#8217;t account for games with varying levels of magic, and they assume that you are using magic items in your game. We will make the same assumption because the majority of Dungeons and Dragons campaigns include magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use magic items in your game, remove them. 5th edition is balanced to be played without magic items, so this shouldn&#8217;t have any further effect on the campaign skeleton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4player-party\">4-Player Party<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The math for CR assumes that a single creature is an average-difficulty encounter for four player characters. Therefore, the rules for treasure assume that the treasure is divided among four characters. I&#8217;ll attempt to break this down into individual treasure to allow the campaign skeleton to scale up and down for parties of different sizes, but some amount of rounding will be required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-adventuring-day-and-short-rests\">The Adventuring Day and Short Rests<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Page 84 of the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide describes &#8220;The Adventuring Day&#8221;. This establishes a rough guideline for how many encounters players can handle in any given day, and suggests roughly two short rests per day. These assumptions give us a guideline for how much adventuring you can squeeze into a single day, which in turn tells us how quickly you could expect to run players from level 1 to level 20 if you were to do nothing but adventure as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gaining-a-level-requires-a-long-rest\">Gaining a Level Requires a Long Rest<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While there is no rules guidance on the subject, I&#8217;m going to assume that you require players to complete a long rest before gaining a level. Gaining a level without taking a long rest introduces a lot of very complicated math that I don&#8217;t find interesting or meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"math\">A Big Pile of Math<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you want to just trust me and ignore all of this interesting and useful math, skip to <a href=\"#the-skeleton\">The Skeleton<\/a>, I won&#8217;t think any less of you, But if you want to understand the math and logic behind how I built the skeleton, settle in for some math, statistics, and tables full of numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"encounters-per-level\">How Many Encounters Per Level?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The table below includes the math to determine how many encounters of average CR will bring a player to the next level. Based on our assumptions discussed above, this assumes a party of four characters facing encounters made solely on single monsters of CR equal to the players&#8217; level. This math largely disregards experience from other sources, but it tells us enough that we can build the skeleton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The table reveals some really interesting information:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The number of encounters per level is almost never round. It&#8217;s hard to know why this is the case, but if I had to guess it&#8217;s because Wizards chose nicely rounded numbers for the experience to reach the next level without directly considering how much experience an encounter would grant.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The number of encounters per level ramp up significantly at 3rd level once characters are established and have all selected subclasses, then drop to 8-9 encounters per level at 11th level, likely because encounters become more complex at the beginning of Tier 3.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The daily experience budget allows roughly 5-6 encounters per day at every level except 5th, which allows more than 9.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will take a total of roughly 200 encounters worth of experience to bring a character to 20th level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will take just over 33 days for players to reach 20th level if you allow leveling in the middle of a day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level \/ CR<\/th><th>CR Exp.<\/th><th>Exp. per Player<\/th><th>Exp. for next Level<\/th><th>Exp. to next Level<\/th><th>Encounters to next Level (Raw)<\/th><th>Daily Exp.

We&#8217;ll use the &#8220;ramp&#8221; method for distributing treasure hoards, but feel free to replace this with other methods if you&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the option of randomly generated treasure hoards, I&#8217;ve included column for manually specified treasure. The logic for this column is taken from <a href=\"\/\/www.enworld.org\/forum\/showthread.php?395770-Analysis-of-quot-Typical-quot-Magic-Item-Distribution\">this ENWorld forum post<\/a> which goes into the statistical distribution of magic items over a character&#8217;s career from levels 1 to 20. The treasure hoard rules don&#8217;t scale well for parties of more\/less than 4 players, but the analysis in the forum post makes it very easy to scale the number of magic items in your campaign to accommodate parties of differing size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The treasure tables and associated text also don&#8217;t specify how to include permanent Common items. I recommend replacing one or two common consumables with one common permanent item if the players want them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the <a href=\"\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/awarding-magic-items#MagicItemsAwardedbyRarity\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/awarding-magic-items#MagicItemsAwardedbyRarity\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Awarding Magic Items By Rarity<\/a> table on page 135 of <a href=\"\/\/smile.amazon.com\/Xanathars-Guide-Everything-Wizards-Team\/dp\/0786966114?keywords=xanathars+guide+to+everything+5e&amp;qid=1641841556&amp;sprefix=xanath%2Caps%2C189&amp;sr=8-2&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rpgbot-20&amp;linkId=06cf27aaf1b417a57551f9f3091e3dc2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\">Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything<\/a> <span style=\"font-size: revert; color: initial;\">(<\/span><a style=\"font-size: revert;\" href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/about\/faq#what-are-affiliate-links-and-why-do-you-use-them\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">affiliate link<\/a><span style=\"font-size: revert; color: initial;\">)<\/span> in place of the items recommended below.

Now we know exactly how much content we need to put in front of the players to get them to 20th level. But we still have one lingering question: What do we do about the non-round numbers? A DM can&#8217;t actually make 0.65 encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that not every encounter needs to be a single monster of CR equal to the party&#8217;s level. Use encounters of varying difficulty; their experience point values will vary accordingly, and by adjusting the difficulties of a few encounters up and down you can easily hit nearly any number. I recommend making roughly 25% of encounters easier than normal, 25% harder than normal, and 50% average difficulty. By adjusting the total experience value of encounters and adding in experience for traps, puzzles, and story rewards You can easily compensate for non-round numbers of encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-planning-a-level\">Example &#8211; Planning a Level<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Planning out any single level is roughly the same. To illustrate the process, we&#8217;ll plan out content for taking a party of four characters from 4th level to 5th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Skeleton specifies that it will take 13.87 encounters (10 regular and 3 hoard encounters) to take players from 4th level to 5th level, and the daily experience budget for 4th level gives us room for 6.18 encounters per day. That means that players will need to face 2.24 days worth of experience to reach 5th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can address that in two ways: we could spread the encounters over three adventuring days, stretching our experience budget a little bit thin and making each individual day a bit more manageable for the players; or we could do two days worth of adventuring and award some story experience rewards for things other than fighting monsters like traps, puzzles, and story rewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example we&#8217;ll go for the second method. We&#8217;ll assume that each adventuring day includes a handful of traps, a puzzle, and a small story reward at the end of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to make roughly 25% of encounters below average difficulty, and roughly 25% of encounters above average difficulty. 6 doesn&#8217;t divide into neat quarters, but we&#8217;ll have 1-2 easy encounters per adventuring day and 1-2 hard encounters per adventuring day. Easy encounters should generally be grouped with hard encounters in order to stay within the daily experience budget so that players&#8217; daily resources aren&#8217;t overtaxed to the point that they don&#8217;t have a reasonable chance of success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have three hoard treasures to award, and I&#8217;ve always liked awarding more treasure for harder encounters, so I think we&#8217;ll award treasure hoards for our hard encounters where it&#8217;s possible to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Encounters<\/th><th>XP Threshold<\/th><th>Day 1<\/th><th>Day 2<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><th>Easy<\/th><td>500<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Medium<\/th><td>1000<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Hard<\/th><td>1500<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Deadly<\/th><td>2000<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Free XP<\/th><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>800+<\/td><td>300+<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Individual Treasure<\/th><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Treasure Hoards<\/th><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>5*<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><tfoot><tr><td colspan=\"4\">* &#8211; Because we&#8217;ve deviated from the assumption of 1 monster of CR To \t\t\t\tkeep to the expected treasure, we&#8217;ll add an additional individual \t\t\t\ttreasure.

How we join the two days doesn&#8217;t matter all that much. They could be part of a multi-day adventure like a long dungeon crawl, or they could be two totally separate adventures with any amount of time in between. It doesn&#8217;t really matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From here, all you need to do is create the encounters, roll or pick the treasure, and drop them into your game.
