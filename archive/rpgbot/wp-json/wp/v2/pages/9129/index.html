If you typically fight with a &#8220;sword and board&#8221;\n\tarrangement (meaning a weapon and a shield), grappling is difficult. However,\n\tif you fight unarmed to even using a two-handed weapon, you have a free hand\n\tmost of the time with which you can attempt a grapple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strangely, after you start the grapple, there&#8217;s no requirement to keep that\n\thand free. You&#8217;re free to use that hand to go back to attacking with a\n\ttwo-handed weapon or to grapple a different creature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also means that creatures without hands can&#8217;t initiate a grapple unless\n\tthey have some other way to do so. For example: a giant toad has no hands, but\n\tif they hit a creature with their bite, the target is grappled. This notably\n\tdoesn&#8217;t require a check and doesn&#8217;t care about size; it simply happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8230;you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an\n\t\tattack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check&#8230;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of an attack roll, you make an ability check to initiate a grapple.\n\tThis tells us that, at the very least, if you want to grapple you need decent\n\tStrength and proficiency in Athletics.

Not\n\tevery creature is immensely strong, but many are nimble, wiggly, or otherwise\n\tdifficult to restrain, and either set of capabilities can help you get out of\n\ta grapple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offensively, this means that grapplers will want to pick targets who are bad\n\tat both Acrobatics and Athletics. Grappling ogres or quicklings may be hard,\n\tbut grappling wizards is typically easy. Defensively, this means that melee\n\tbuilds may want a way to escape grapples, typically by being proficient in\n\teither Acrobatics or Athletics depending on which of their Strength or\n\tDexterity is higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition.

This means that you could\n\tinitiate a grapple (grapple is a melee attack), but if the grappled creature\n\tis then outside of your reach after the attack, the grapple immediately\n\tends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"moving-a-grappled-creature\">Moving a Grappled Creature<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>While a grappled creature has its speed reduced to 0, the creature who\n\tinitiated the grapple has no such problem. Sometimes, as a grappler, you may\n\twant to move the grappled creature somewhere else, such as by dragging them\n\tinto a wall of fire or tossing them into a pit. This is frequently a more\n\tefficient way to reposition a creature than by using Shove, so understanding\n\thow it works is very helpful for front-line martial characters even if you\n\tdon&#8217;t grapple frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but\n\t\tyour speed is halved&#8230;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful, but vague.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no clear explanation about what &#8220;drag&#8221; means here, so we&#8217;re left to\n\tfill in the meaning using plain English. &#8220;Drag&#8221; means to pull, so you can&#8217;t\n\tpush the target away by grappling them (though maybe you could by carrying\n\tthem?). There&#8217;s also no rules about where the creature is positioned, so\n\tyou&#8217;ll need to work it out with your DM on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying a grappled creature is even less clear. If you&#8217;re a human grappling\n\tan ogre, how are you supposed to carry them? Can you pick them up, carry them\n\tto a window, then drop them out of it? I honestly have no idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a DM, I try to interpret these rules as simply as possible. When you move\n\twhile grappling a creature, any creatures remain in the same position relative\n\tto your space, so they basically &#8220;float&#8221; in space as you move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rules also don&#8217;t seem to care how many creatures you have grappled, so\n\tif you grapple numerous foes (or any creature really, since you can\n\ttechnically grapple allies) you&#8217;re free to drag them all around at the same\n\ttime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules also don&#8217;t care about what sort of movement you use, and Jeremy\n\tCrawford has tweeted that\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/756195224855072768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it works with movement of any sort<\/a>. This means that you could grapple creatures then fly into the air, drag\n\tthem up walls with a climb speed or spider climb, or if you&#8217;re a monk\n\tpotentially even run up a wall while grappling a creature. This both\n\tdiscourages creatures from breaking the grapple and gives you an easy source\n\tof additional damage output when you inevitably decide to drop them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I get this question frequently: These rules\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/907788091267543040\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">don&#8217;t care about a creature&#8217;s actual weight<\/a>, so the carrying capacity rules do not matter here. The Monster Manual\n\tdoesn&#8217;t specify creatures&#8217; weights, and your options in a grapple shouldn&#8217;t\n\thinge on whether or not the target has had a heavy lunch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A medium creature could grapple a tiny creature such as a pixie or a house\n\tcat and drag them around without any impact on your speed.

Shoving a Creature allows\n\tyou to shove a creature prone. When combined with the Grappled condition, this\n\tprevents creatures from standing (you can&#8217;t expend movement when your speed is\n\t0, and standing requires expending half of your movement).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is frequently referred to as the grapple+shove combo, and it&#8217;s a\n\tpowerful tactic for martial characters. Forcing enemies to remain prone is an\n\teasy way to get Advantage on attacks, and a character optimized for grappling\n\talready has everything that they need to Shove, too. This is typically the\n\tmost useful way to consistently benefit from grappling in combat, so I&#8217;ll\n\trefer to the grapple+shove combo repeatedly throughout this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that your allies will also be affected by you shoving creatures prone.\n\tOther melee attackers will benefit, while allies relying on ranged attack\n\trolls (archers, warlocks, etc.) will suffer Disadvantage to hit the target. If\n\tyour ranged allies complain about you knocking foes prone, encourage them to\n\tlearn spells like Create Bonfire or to switch targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"twoweapon-fighting\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While this is an edge case, you <em>can<\/em> grapple or shove in the same\n\tturn that you use Two-Weapon Fighting, provided that you have Extra Attack.

An optimized grappler will\n\t\ttypically start with a +3 Strength modifier.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Proficiency.<\/strong> Proficiency and Expertise in Athletics are\n\t\tthe most mathematically impactful thing that you can do to improve your\n\t\tgrappling. If you can get Expertise, such as from levels in rogue or from\n\t\tthe Skill Expert feat, that will have a huge impact, especially as your\n\t\tProficiency Bonus scales with level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extra Attack.<\/strong> The ability to make multiple attacks in the\n\t\tsame turn means that you can grapple and shove in the same turn, which gets\n\t\tthe grapple+shove combo working in one turn rather than two, doubling your\n\t\teffectiveness.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Size.<\/strong> You can only grapple creatures up to one size larger\n\t\tthan you, so if you want to grapple everything you meet, you&#8217;ll want to be\n\t\tas large as possible. The Climbing a Creature optional rule can make this\n\t\tpoint less crucial, but only if you&#8217;re okay with whatever you&#8217;re grappling\n\t\twalking around while you climb all over it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantage.<\/strong> Advantage works out to slightly more than +3,\n\t\tbut your Strength modifier can almost match that right at level 1, and your\n\t\tProficiency Bonus will scale with level, especially if you have Expertise\n\t\tand are doubling your Proficiency Bonus, which is why those points are more\n\t\tcrucial.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Imposing Disadvantage.<\/strong> Typically harder than finding a way\n\t\tto get Advantage, imposing Disadvantage on your target is just as impactful.\n\t\tSpells like Hex can provide consistent, easy ways to accomplish this.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Other Stuff.<\/strong> Other sources of bonuses for yourself and\n\t\tpenalties for your targets are less common and often less permanent, but\n\t\tthey can still have a useful benefit to improve your grappling.

Other\n\tpeople may disagree with me regarding what should be considered &#8220;essential&#8221;,\n\tand that&#8217;s fine.

The Eldritch Knight can cast buffs like Enlarge\/Reduce to\n\t\tget Advantage on Strength checks and raise your size to large, and the Rune\n\t\tKnight&#8217;s Giant&#8217;s Might grants Advantage on Athletics Checks and can get you\n\t\tup to Huge size at high levels, allowing you to grapple anything in the\n\t\tgame.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Paladin<\/span>: The Paladin gets Extra Attack,\n\t\tso if you can get Expertise in Athletics elsewhere you have the essentials.\n\t\tOath of Glory&#8217;s Channel Divinity (Peerless Athlete) can get you Advantage\n\t\twithout consuming Concentration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranger<\/span>: The Optional Class Feature Canny\n\t\tgives the ranger Expertise in one skill at first level and the Ranger gets\n\t\tExtra Attack, making them the only class other than the Bard which can get\n\t\tboth of those essentials without multiclassing.

The second bullet is only useful if you&#8217;re facing a single enemy,\n\t\tbut even then you&#8217;re also negating Advantage\/Disadvantage for both yourself\n\t\tand your target, so you&#8217;re doing this purely to help your allies in a way\n\t\tthat you could accomplish just as well with Shove.

To counter these creatures, proficiency in Athletics or\n\tAcrobatics is helpful, but you can also make yourself larger or make yourself\n\timmune to the Grappled condition somehow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"breaking-a-grapple\">Breaking a Grapple<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There are three ways to break a grapple:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Escape the grapple<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Become immune to the Grappled condition<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Move the grappler and their target apart<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Escaping a grapple is straightforward. You make a Strength (Athletics) or\n\tDexterity (Acrobatics) check opposed by the grappler&#8217;s Strength (Athletics)\n\tcheck or a check against a fixed DC if you were grappled by an attack. Either\n\tway, the grappler typically won&#8217;t be as optimized as a player character built\n\tfor grappling, so success should be within reach even if all you have is an\n\tappropriate skill proficiency. The problem is that escaping this way takes an\n\tAction to <em>try<\/em> to escape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming immune to the Grappled condition is hard, but if you can do it,\n\tyou&#8217;re no longer affected by the condition. The most likely option is a spell\n\tlike Polymorph.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest and most likely way to break a grapple is by moving the grappler\n\tand their target apart. This is fairly simple since you usually only need to\n\tmove one creature or the other 5 or 10 feet depending on the grappler&#8217;s reach.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For martial characters, Shove works great, especially if you have Extra\n\tAttack. If you shove the creature away, an attempt will cost one of your\n\tattacks, so you can either retry or attack with any remaining attacks. The\n\tCrusher feat and Way of the Open Hand&#8217;s Open Hand Technique both allow you to\n\tmove enemies just by hitting them, making it easy to break a grapple for\n\tyourself or an ally without cutting into your action economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For non-martial characters, options like the Telekinetic feat, teleportation\n\tspells like Misty Step, or any other form of forced movement can break a\n\tgrapple, often without a check of any kind.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an ally stuck in a grapple, you can come to the rescue using\n\tsimilar tactics. If you shove either the grappler or the grappled creature\n\taway from the other, you can break a grapple. This is great for shoving your\n\tparty&#8217;s wizard out of a grapple with big strong foes who you might not be\n\tstrong enough to shove (unless you&#8217;re optimized for grappling, in which case\n\tyou might go shove the tarrasque just to show off). If you&#8217;re not a grappler,\n\tthe spells Dimension Door and Vortex Warp can both pull an ally out of a\n\tgrapple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The grapple rules are, by default, tipped in the favor of monsters. But with\n\tsome very modest optimization, you can turn grappling into a powerful tool to\n\tget an upper hand in combat. And with a little more work you can become a\n\tborderline-unstoppable grapple monster who can pin down even the strongest of\n\tenemies, tipping combat dramatically in your party&#8217;s favor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Grappling has been a staple tactic of clever players since 5th edition&#8217;s release, and has existed for decades in prior editions of Dungeons and Dragons.
