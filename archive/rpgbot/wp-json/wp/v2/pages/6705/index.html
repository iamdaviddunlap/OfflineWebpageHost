Keep in mind that the state of the meta periodically changes as new source materials are released, and the article will be updated accordingly as time allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-a-lineage\">What is a Lineage?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lineage replaces your race&#8217;s traits and sometimes adds some new flavor to your character. You can choose any race (or a combination of races or something more outlandish) and apply a lineage to it, allowing you to combine the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of your race(s) and the flavor and mechanics of your lineage. Mechanically, characters of a lineage uses the same &#8220;racial traits&#8221; regardless of how you describe your characters lineage, and you usually replace all traits provided by your race (though some lineages get the Ancestral Legacy feature) if you choose to select one in addition to your lineage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All lineages provide the choice of a single +2 ability score increase and a single +1 increase or three separate +1 increases (the Custom Lineage is an exception, and cannot choose the three +1 increases as far as I can tell). Players are free to allocate these increases as they see fit, allowing lineages to function in a wide variety of classes, and allowing the lineage&#8217;s other traits to come to the forefront where normally your ability score increases would heavily influence your viable class options. This flexibility in Ability Score Increases is available to every race if you&#8217;re using the Customizing Your Origin Optional Rule, but it&#8217;s the default for lineages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I understand things, lineages cannot take feats which require a specific race, even if you describe yourself as originally a member of that race. Jeremy Crawford clarified that the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/1367309850707849216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Custom Lineage<\/a> is taken instead of a race, so you&#8217;re not a specific race to qualify for race-specific feats. It&#8217;s not totally clear yet, but I believe the intent is that other lineages follow the same rule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestral-legacy\">Ancestral Legacy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft, Ancestral Legacy is a trait shared between several lineages, allowing you to introduce some physical traits of your race (namely unusualy movement speeds) or omit those traits and get two skills instead. This allows you to use base races like the Aarakocra to get a flying speed or the Triton to get a swim speed and not feel weird about being a dhampir aarakocra who can&#8217;t fly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As written, this decision point is only available if you adopt the lineage after character creation (such as if your character becomes a hexblood during play). This means that RAW you can&#8217;t create a 1st-level aarakocra dhampir with the ability to fly, but if you created a regular aarakocra and then immediately became a dhampir you could choose to keep your flight speed. It&#8217;s not clear if this is intentional, but I think it&#8217;s a really pointless restriction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t include things like the ability to breath underwater, so some lineages struggle to function underwater regardless of your original race.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vampiric-bite\">Vampiric Bite<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Dhampir&#8217;s bite uses Constitution for attack and damage (you explicitly\n\tuse Constitution by default unless you have some other feature which allows\n\tyou to do otherwise, such as Martial Arts or Hex Warrior, so using Strength is\n\tactually impossible), and is treated as a simple weapon so it gets some\n\tbenefits which most natural weapons (like the tabaxi&#8217;s claws) don&#8217;t. Using\n\tConsitution instead of Strength or Dexterity means that martial classes can\n\tbuild around Constitution almost entirely, allowing you to be exceptionally\n\tdurable without sacrificing much offensively (though the bite&#8217;s d4 damage die\n\twill lag behind most weapons, so there is a small cost).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"attack-with-con\">There is currently some confusion around whether or not you can change the\n\tability score used to attack with Vampiric Bite. By default, you use\n\tConstitution to attack with it, and attacking with Strength is not an option.\n\tThings get confusing when you introduce class features like the Battle Smith\n\tArtificer&#8217;s Battle Ready, the Monk&#8217;s Martial Arts, and the Hexblade Warlock&#8217;s\n\tHex Warrior. The\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/forums\/d-d-beyond-general\/bugs-support\/108683-van-richtens-guide-to-ravenloft-issues-and-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DnDBeyond Support Thread for Van Richten&#8217;s Guide<\/a>\n\tspecifies that Martial Arts does not allow you to use Vampiric Bite with\n\tDexterity, and that assertion seems to be based on the bit of text in Martial\n\tArts that specifies that you use Dexterity &#8220;instead of Strength&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we apply that same logic elsewhere, Battle Ready and Hex Warrior would not\n\tqualify because they both use the phrase &#8220;instead of Strength or Dexterity&#8221;.\n\tI&#8217;m not certain how authoritative DnDBeyond is on rules questions like this,\n\tand I&#8217;m\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RPGBOTDOTNET\/status\/1396610353161666560\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still waiting for an answer from Jeremy Crawford<\/a>. If this ruling sticks it&#8217;s going to address some specific abuse cases, but\n\tI strongly doubt that WotC wrote the &#8220;instead of Strength or Dexterity&#8221; as\n\tanything except a way to clarify how those features work. As always, discuss\n\trules questions with your DM to see how they want to handle things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Vampiric Bite &#8220;counts as a simple melee weapon,&#8221; I believe that you\n\tcan enhance your bite with spells which target weapons like Magic Weapon and\n\tyou can use effects like Divine Smite which require an attack with a weapon.\n\tI&#8217;m not entirely certain of this ruling and we haven&#8217;t gotten errata or rules\n\tanswers from Jeremy Crawford, but this is the only race with a natural weapon\n\tthat specifies that it &#8220;counts as a simple melee weapon&#8221;, and I have to assume\n\tthat the wording is intentional to allow things like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vampiric Bite interacts strangely with Eldritch Claw Tattoo: since it counts as a simple weapon rather than an unarmed strike, the Magical Strikes benefit of the tattoo doesn&#8217;t apply. The Eldritch Maul portion does, but that&#8217;s not why Eldritch Claw Tattoo is good. If you plan to bite things in combat, you really want a way to make your attacks magical so that you can overcome common damage resistances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly frustrating: since your bite doesn&#8217;t have a monetary value and\n\tcan&#8217;t be held in your hand (putting your hands in\/on\/around your mouth doesn&#8217;t\n\tcount), it doesn&#8217;t qualify for spells like Booming Blade<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vampiric Bite also provides easy access to Advantage when you&#8217;re short on hit\n\tpoints, so a clever player will look for ways to raise their hit point maximum\n\t(hint: take the Tough feat and max out Constitution), then hang out at just\n\tbelow half hit points. This is a risk-reward calculation similar to the\n\tBarbarian&#8217;s Reckless Attack, so be sure that your AC is good and try to get\n\ttemporary hit points and\/or damage resistance if you can. Feats like Inspiring\n\tLeader are a great option if you already have Tough, but your allies may also\n\tbe able to provide temporary hit points from spells like Heroism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final portion of Vampiric Bite allows you to empower yourself when you\n\tbite most creatures. Conveniently this doesn&#8217;t need to be done in combat, and\n\tunless you&#8217;re desperate that&#8217;s usually a terrible time to do it. Both the\n\thealing and the bonus to attacks\/checks equal the amount of piecing damage\n\tthat you deal with the bite, so you want to get as much damage as possible.\n\tEffects which add additional damage of the same type like Hunter&#8217;s Mark (Sneak\n\tAttack would be good but Vampiric Bite doesn&#8217;t qualify since it doesn&#8217;t have\n\tthe Light or Finesse traits) are great, and if you can you should absolutely\n\ttry to use Vampiric Bite with a critical hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your best bet is to use Vampiric Bite on unconscious or paralyzed creatures\n\tbecause attacking them will guarantee a critical hit. If you need easy access\n\tto targets, carry around a bag of rats. Knock one unconscious, then eat it for\n\thp or a bonus to your next attack\/check. If you know that you&#8217;re about to go\n\tinto combat, this is a great way to get a massive bonus to initiative (2d4+5\n\twith 20 Con, a critical hit, and no other damage boosts). Eat a rat, then have\n\tsomeone ask you about world history or something. It&#8217;s so good that it feels\n\tlike cheating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For additional damage boosts to Vampiric Bite, look for effects which add extra damage of the same type. Rage, Hunter&#8217;s Mark, the Piercer feat, the spell Magic Weapon, and many other effects effects work, and each bit of extra damage means more value from the &#8220;empower&#8221; option. Extra dice are multiplied on critical hits, too, which is especially exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note to DMs: I don&#8217;t think WotC intended for players to do this. High-level barbarians getting bonuses in excess of +20 on checks definitely doesn&#8217;t seem intentional. A bonus of 1d4+5 to attacks\/checks up to 6 times per day is already really good, and that&#8217;s probably as far was WotC saw this going (maybe 2d4 on a critical hit). As a quick fix, I recommend limiting the use of the bonus to attacks\/checks to within 1 round of using Vampiric Bite. That prevents some of the simpler abuse cases (initiative, social situations, knowledge checks, etc.), but still allows it to be used in combat and rewards players for looking for damage boosts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still worried about the big numbers, limit the bonus to 1d4+Con, which is still a considerable bonus well in excess of Guidance, Bless, and similar buffs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes\">Dhampir Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section assumes that you&#8217;re <em>not<\/em> using the option &#8220;Customizing Your Origin&#8221; rules presented in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything or the updated version of the race published in Mordenkainen&#8217;s Monsters of the Multiverse.

You can use\n\tInfusions to deal with breathing, to see in the dark, to walk on walls (or\n\tfly, preferably), and to use something other than Strength or Dexterity for\n\tattack and damage. The Dhampir may enable you to skip over some options for\n\tInfusions and spells, but the Artificer can often handle those challenges\n\tbetter so your racial traits will feel redundant and will gradually become\n\tobsolete as you gain levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Artificer does have a unique ability to make the Dhampir&#8217;s Vampiric Bite magical, allowing you to overcome resistance to non-magic weapon damage types without relying on options like the spell Magic Weapon or higher-level class features like the Monk&#8217;s Ki-Empowered Strikes. Ideally, a Dhampir relying on Vampiric Bite wants an artificer in the party, but actually playing an artificer isn&#8217;t necessarily the only way to make that happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Battle Smith&#8217;s Battle Ready feature may offer the ability to bite using\n\tyour Intelligence instead of Constitution, but we&#8217;re still waiting on\n\tclarification on the subject. I&#8217;ve discussed this issue further\n\t<a href=\"#attack-with-con\">above<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"barbarian\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\">Barbarian<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the biggest hit die available, Rage, and Unarmored Defense, the\n\tBarbarian is a great way to explore Vampiric Bite. However, Rage&#8217;s damage\n\tbonus doesn&#8217;t apply to Vampiric Bite because you must use Strength to attack\n\tin order to get the damage bonus, and Vampiric Bite specifies that you use\n\tConstitution for attack and damage. It&#8217;s not a &#8220;may&#8221; like the Finesse trait or\n\tsimilar effects, so you&#8217;re stuck attacking with Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re fine with giving up the bonus damage from Rage, you can dump Strength, ignore Reckless Attack, and go for 20 Dexterity, 20 Constitution, and a shield to get 22 AC while otherwise totally unequipped, then run around and less than half hp comfortably hiding behind the damage resistance from Rage and that massive pile of AC and hit points while chewing on people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Piercer feat works well since it can provide either a Strength increase or a Dexterity increase, allowing it to fit into your build without cutting into your ability scores. Just keep in mind that your relatively poor damage output compared to other barbarians raises the &#8220;tank falacy&#8221;, so you should pick a subclass which focuses healily on offense so that you&#8217;re a meaningful offensive threat rather a mildly annoying bag of hit points with small teeth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At high levels, Brutal Critical multiplies the damage dice from Vampiric\n\tBite, so a raging 20th-level Barbarian with 24 Constitution can deal 5d4+5\n\tbite damage on a critical hit, averaging to 17.5. That&#8217;s a decent chunk of\n\thealing, but adding that much to an attack or ability check trivializes most\n\tchecks regardless of your other ability scores or proficiencies. Throw on the\n\tPiercer feat, and you get another d4 and can reroll one of the dice, nudging\n\tthat average roll even higher to an average of slightly more than 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bard\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\">Bard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For caster bards, the ability to walk on walls and ceilings is a great way to\n\tstay out of reach of enemies without spending expensive spell slots on flight.\n\tFor martial bards, Vampiric Bite is a great option because you don&#8217;t need to\n\tsplit focus between Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma at the same time.\n\tCollege of Valor is a better fit than College of Swords thanks to medium armor\n\tand shields. Since bards are highly skilled, Vampiric Bite is a great way to\n\tfurther buff your skills on top of Expertise, Enhance Ability, and whatever\n\tother shenanigans you can manage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cleric\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\">Cleric<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For caster clerics, the ability to walk on walls and ceilings is a great way\n\tto stay out of reach of enemies without spending expensive spell slots on\n\tflight.

Your best bet is to save it for\n\tempowering you ability checks or spell .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The War Domain&#8217;s version of Divine Strike adds additional d8&#8217;s of damage of\n\tthe same type as the weapon with which you attack.

There&#8217;s some room for argument that Vampiric Bite would function while using a form with a bite attack, but it&#8217;s not totally clear and Jeremy Crawford&#8217;s answers on the subject are&#8230; complicated. Stuff like the Dragonborn&#8217;s breath weapon and resistance are allowed because <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/909078764184682496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they don&#8217;t specify anatomy<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/801158248002822145\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the breath weapon only requires exhalation<\/a>, but the Tortle&#8217;s AC doesn&#8217;t apply because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2017\/09\/20\/does-the-tortle-ac17-apply-to-wild-shape-forms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the shell specifies anatomy<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vampiric Bite specifies that you have a &#8220;fanged bite&#8221;, which sounds a whole lot like specific anatomy to me, so Vampiric Bite wouldn&#8217;t apply. You might generously interpret that any &#8220;fanged bite&#8221; would do, so poisonous snakes and potentially vampire bats would qualify, but I think that&#8217;s a stretch. If you want to turn into a vampiric wolf or something, discuss it with your DM and maybe you can work something out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"fighter\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\">Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grab full plate and a shield, max out Constitution, and take the Tough and\n\tPiercer feats.

A critical hit for a high-level dhampir monk could roll 2d10+5 damage, either healing you or boosting your next attack\/check by that much. That&#8217;s an average roll of 16, and adding that bonus to an ability check trivializes it regardless of your proficiency or ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can fit the Piercer feat into your build (easier since it provides a +1 Dex increase), rerolling the relatively large damage die once per turn is decent, and the additional die on critical hits can be extremely effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fighting while below half hit points to get Advantage with your bites is\n\tabsolutely possible for dhampir monks, but with d8 hit dice it&#8217;s a scary\n\tprospect. If you can, try to find temporary hit points somewhere once you&#8217;re\n\tbelow half hp, or look for other ways to mitigate or avoid damage if you can\n\tfind them. You might even multiclass into barbarian so that you can use the\n\tBarbarian&#8217;s version of Unarmored Defense instead of the Monk&#8217;s and dump Wisdom\n\tto focus on being crazy and biting people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"paladin\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\">Paladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Divine Smite requires an attack with a weapon, and since Vampiric Bite is\n\ttreated as a simple weapon it qualifies. However, the bonus radiant damage\n\tfrom Divine Smite won&#8217;t add to the value of the &#8220;empower&#8221; option because it&#8217;s\n\tnot piercing damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vampiric Bite allows you to build around Constitution and Charisma,\n\tsignificantly addressing the Paladin&#8217;s MAD issues. Max out Constitution and\n\tconsider the Tough feat. Lay on Hands offers a great way to shoot back up to\n\tjust below half hit points, so hanging out at low hp to get Advantage is safer\n\tthan it is for most characters. You do still face the same Fighting Style\n\tchallenges as the Fighter, unfortunately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ranger\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\">Ranger<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you build for melee, you&#8217;ll reduce the ranger&#8217;s MAD issues somewhat,\n\tthough you&#8217;ll still want the Dexterity to fill out medium armor and you won&#8217;t\n\tbe as durable as a barbarian, fighter, or paladin. Hunter&#8217;s Mark provides\n\textra damage with your bite, making you more effective offensively and\n\toffering more value from the &#8220;empower&#8221; option, allowing you to heal yourself\n\tand boost your attacks\/checks more than most other characters. I recommend\n\tgoing for medium armor with a shield, focus on Constitution and Wisdom, and\n\tcast Pass Without Trace or use Vampiric Bite to empower yourself when you need\n\tto be stealthy so that you can offset Disadvantage to Dexterity (Stealth)\n\tchecks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to fight at range, the ability to walk on walls\/ceilings without\n\tthe aid of spells or magic items is a great asset, and you can relegate\n\tVampiric Bite to empowering attacks and ability checks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"rogue\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\">Rogue<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vampiric Bite doesn&#8217;t qualify for Sneak Attack, which is disappointing\n\tbecause I&#8217;m sure there are legions of players hoping to play an edgy dhampir\n\trogue. Darkvision and the ability to climb walls and ceilings solves a lot of\n\tproblems which often require magic, and Vampiric Bite can still be used to\n\tempower attacks and ability checks, so there is still some value here, though\n\tyou almost certainly won&#8217;t use Vampiric Bite in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sorcerer\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to walk on walls\/ceilings makes flight less crucial, but at that\n\tpoint a race with flight is significantly more effective or you can cast\n\tSpider Climb.

The ability to walk on\n\twalls and ceilings reduces your reliance on limited spell slots to fly or\n\tlevitate, and Vampiric Bite offers an improvement to you overall durability\n\t(though a low hit point maximum and poor AC are still problems).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: The advice below hinges upon the idea that you can\n\tchoose to use Charisma with Vampiric Bite thanks to Hex Warrior. While I\n\tbelieve that RAI would allow you to do so, it&#8217;s not perfectly clear if that&#8217;s\n\tactually the design intent. I&#8217;ve discussed this issue further\n\t<a href=\"#attack-with-con\">above<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hexblades, as always, are a uniquely appealing option. Hex Warrior works with\n\tthe Dhampir&#8217;s Vampiric Bite (though Pact of the Blade clearly does not), so\n\tyou can use Charisma to bite people. Otherwise there&#8217;s not much that&#8217;s unique\n\there. More martial classes will be able to make better use of Vampiric Bite,\n\tand since Vampiric Bite doesn&#8217;t work with Booming Blade you&#8217;re denied a go-to\n\toffensive option. Options like Thirsting Blade all still work, but that trades\n\taway the savings on invocations gained from the Dhampir.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wizard\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\">Wizard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to walk on walls\/ceilings makes flight less crucial, but at that\n\tpoint a race with flight is significantly more effective or you can cast\n\tSpider Climb. Vampiric Bite doesn&#8217;t help much, either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bladesingers might consider using Vampiric Bite in place of a weapon, but be\n\tvery cautious about doing so because building around Con\/Int will mean\n\tneglecting Dexterity which will then reduce your AC. Wizards don&#8217;t get enough\n\thit points (even with high Constitution) to make that a safe choice. It might\n\twork, but be very cautious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"feats\">Dhampir Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dhampirs have no race-exclusive feats, but the feats below may be appealing\n\tfor dhampir characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"feats-piercer\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/piercer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Piercer<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Abusing the critical hit portion of Vampiric Bite is a great way to make the\n\tDhampir&#8217;s Vampiric Bite effective. Piercer adds an additional damage die on\n\tcritical hits, providing a significant bonus there.
