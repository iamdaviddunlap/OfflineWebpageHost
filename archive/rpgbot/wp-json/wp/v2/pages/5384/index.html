Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

You won&#8217;t keep up with a\n\t\tfull spellcaster, which hurts but you&#8217;re trading that for martial\n\t\tcapabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhance Arrows<\/span> (Su): If you don&#8217;t have a +1 weapon by three levels into this class, you&#8217;re probably already dead. The elemental damage abilities are nice, and you can combine them with a different element permanently applied to your bow. Distance won&#8217;t matter much. Holy\/etc. is fantastic, but you won&#8217;t get it until at least 15th character level, at which point you could have bought it long ago. With the exception of the enhancement bonus all of these effects will work alongside other effects, so you&#8217;re effectively using a weapon of considerably higher power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Imbue Arrow<\/span> (Su): This is the Arcane Archer&#8217;s signature ability. Keep in mind that the spell must be an area spell, so you can&#8217;t put Shocking Grasp on an arrow like the Magus can. Fireball and similar effects are obvious choices, but don&#8217;t overlook things like Haste or other spells which aren&#8217;t directly offensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Seeker Arrow<\/span> (Su): Situational, and you can usually solve the same problem by putting a fireball on Imbue Arrow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Phase Arrow<\/span> (Su): A single arrow won&#8217;t do enough damage to be meaningful most of the time. Archery is all about voluminous numbers of arrows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hail of Arrows<\/span> (Su): Fantastic in large encounters. The ability doesn&#8217;t specify that you need to be able to see targets, but I assume you still need to know to target them, and you probably also need ammunition. Still, you can kill whole armies with this. With the Distance enchantment from Enhance Arrows your bow range is absurdly long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arrow of Death<\/span> (Su): Even though the save is Charisma-based and you might not be a Charisma-based spellcaster, a base DC of 20 is still excellent. The ammunition limitation is frustrating, so save this for high-priority foes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"base-classes\">Base Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Arcane Archers are conventionally built using two classes: a martial class for the Base Attack Bonus requirements, and an arcane class for the spellcasting. In addition, you can use classes like Bard and Magus to cover both sets of requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"martial-class\">Martial Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your martial class will consume the majority of your levels before diving into Arcane Archer. Because your spellcasting class will generally have 1\/2 BAB, you&#8217;ll probably take either four or five levels in your martial class, and will likely return to your martial class after you run out of Arcane Archer levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 span=\"rating-red\">Barbarian<\/h4>\n<p>Barbarian rage doesn&#8217;t work with spellcasting, and barbarians aren&#8217;t built to\n\tuse bows.<\/p>\n<h4 span=\"rating-blue\">Fighter<\/h4>\n<p>The combination of fighter-exclusive feats, armor\/weapon training, and the\n\tfighter&#8217;s feat slots make the fighter a great go-to option. 6th level gives\n\tyou a bonus feat which, you may not need, which means you can put another\n\tlevel into your spellcasting class before going into Arcane Archer.<\/p>\n<h4 span=\"rating-orange\">Paladin<\/h4>\n<p>Technically doable, but doing archery well requires a mountain of feats and\n\tpaladins don&#8217;t get the bonus feats for it to work. If you insist on a paladin\n\tbuild, I recommend the the Divine Hunter archetype, which helps with the feat\n\ttax and allows you to apply Divine Bond to your weapon. By doing a\n\tPaladin\/Sorcerer split, you can double-dip on Charisma, which is fun.<\/p>\n<h4 span=\"rating-green\">Ranger<\/h4>\n<p>6 levels of ranger will get you two feats from your combat style, and the\n\tability to ignore their prerequisites means that you can get Point Blank\n\tMaster at 6th level without fighter levels. I recommend hunting around for\n\tarchetypes that trade Favored Enemy and\/or Favored Terrain for something more\n\tinteresting. You also won&#8217;t get much from the ranger&#8217;s spellcasting, so don&#8217;t\n\tinvest heavily in Wisdom.<\/p>\n<h4 span=\"rating-green\">Slayer<\/h4>\n<p>Along the same lines as the Ranger, and you give up many of the Ranger&#8217;s\n\tabilities which will quickly become obsolete without level-based scaling and\n\treplace them with things like Sneak Attack and Slayer Talents. I still\n\trecommend taking the Ranger Combat Style talents to get archery feats, but\n\tyour 4th-level talent is open.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spellcasting-class\">Spellcasting Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While any arcane spellcasting class qualifies, this section only discusses full spellcasters because those are the sorts of classes which make the most sense for this branch of your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 span=\"rating-orange\">Arcanist<\/h4>\n<p>Arcane Archers lost a lot of spellcasting due to their split focus, so the\n\tArcanist invalidates its own versatility by dramatically reducing the quantity\n\tof spells which you have available.<\/p>\n<h4 span=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/h4>\n<p>The Sorcerer&#8217;s biggest appeal is their large pool of spell slots. If you plan\n\tto use the same spells repeatedly but don&#8217;t need to worry much about utility\n\tor skills, sorcerer is a good option. The emphasis on Charisma is also helpful\n\twhen you get Arrow of Death.<\/p>\n<h4 span=\"rating-green\">Witch<\/h4>\n<p>Functionally similar to wizard, but you trade Arcane Bond for a Hex. The two\n\tspell lists are different, so consider carefully which one you think will work\n\tbest for you.<\/p>\n<h4 span=\"rating-blue\">Wizard<\/h4>\n<p>The go-to for two-class Arcane Archers, the wizard&#8217;s Intelligence will pad\n\tyour skill ranks, and you&#8217;ll get new spell levels as fast as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"single-class\">Single Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Technically you could meet all of the Arcane Archer&#8217;s requirements using a single spellcasting class, but this guide assumes that you want to get into the class as soon as possible. These classes can meet all of the Arcane Archer&#8217;s requirements in a reasonably timely manner, but still have good enough spellcasting to be a worthwhile option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/h4>\n<p>Bards are a weird choice. As support casters, they lack most of the offensive\n\toptions associated with the Arcane Archer. You won&#8217;t be throwing fireballs,\n\tbut you might find that your support spells and enchantments can be equally\n\teffective with some clever thinking.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-green\">Bloodrager<\/h4>\n<p>The only class with full BAB progression and arcane spellcasting, the\n\tBloodrager can qualify for Arcane Archer at level 6. The Bloodrager&#8217;s already\n\tlimited spellcasting will be handicapped even further, so you&#8217;ll need to\n\tmostly ignore the Arcane Archer&#8217;s signature Imbue ability. However, you&#8217;ll\n\tstill be an excellent archer and you will benefit greatly from the Arcane\n\tArcher&#8217;s other class features. Be sure to add the Adaptive property to your\n\tcomposite bow so that your damage can benefit from your fluctuating Strength\n\tbonus when you rage or change size.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Magus<\/h4>\n<p>Magus without the Mymidarch archetype is technically possible, but there is\n\tbasically no reason to do it. Myrmidarch simply adds too much which feeds into\n\tthe Arcane Archer. You&#8217;ll need 8 levels to qualify for Arcane Archer, but\n\tduring those 8 levels you&#8217;re casting spells and shooting your bow. Ranged\n\tSpellstrike lets you attach single-target spells like Shocking Grasp or\n\tDisintegrate to your arrows, so once you add Imbue Arrow from Arcane Archer\n\tyou can put all of your spells on arrows. 8 levels gets you one step of both\n\tWeapon Training and Armor Training, providing small but helpful improvements\n\tto your attack, damage, and AC. You also get enough Fighter Training to\n\tqualify for Weapon Specialization, which opens up several other important\n\tfeats for archers. You even get to cast spells in medium armor and ignore\n\tarcane spell failure, so you can wear a breastplate or mithral fullplate.<\/p>\n<p>The Myrmidarch does have one drawback which might dissuade you at first\n\tglance: you give up 1 spell per spell level. But before you throw up your\n\thands and abandon the Myrmidarch, compare it to your typical two-class Arcane\n\tArcher. At ninth level you get your first level of Arcane Archer. A\n\tfighter\/wizard will be on their third level of Arcane Archer, but will only\n\thave the spellcasting of 3rd- or 4th-level wizard. You&#8217;ll be casting\n\tthird-level spells, while the fighter\/wizard is just getting 2nd-level\n\tspells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The exact makeup of your ability scores varies depending on your choice of\n\tspellcasting class. Prioritize Dexterity. Get a bit of Strength for bonus bow\n\tdamage, some Constitution for hit points. You never need your spellcasting\n\tability to exceed 16, but more never hurts.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity bonuses and bonuses to a spellcasting ability are fantastic. Small size can also be helpful for the bonuses to attack and AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: Nothing specifically useful for the\n\tArcan Archer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Bonuses to Dexterity and Intelligence\n\tare perfect for anything built around Magus, Witch, or Wizard. The bonus to\n\tovercome spell resistance will be helpful to compensate for your low caster\n\tlevel.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: Halfling is strictly better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tbasically the only thing that helps you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\tbasically the only thing that helps you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Small size and a bonus to\n\tcharisma mean that you&#8217;ll want to build something Charisma-based.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Flexible ability bonus, and the feat\n\twill help with the archery feat tax..<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Knack<\/span> (Magic): Absolutely required.\n\t\tTwo caster levels gets you a ton of additional damage and duration from\n\t\tyour spells. You give up several levels of spellcasting throughout the\n\t\t10 levels of arcane archer, so this is useful even if you build around\n\t\tbard or magus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Most of your skills will be defined by your base classes. Expect to continue investing in those skills, but consider putting ranks into skills added by Arcane Archer if you don&#8217;t have them already.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The most rolled skill in\n\t\tthe game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Riding imposes penalties. Find\n\t\ta way to fly instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): You have high enough\n\t\tDexterity that Stealth should be doable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your selection of feats follows the conventional Point-Blank Shot tree for\n\tthe most part. You might pick up feats to complement your spellcasting, but\n\twith greatly diminished spellcasting it&#8217;s probably not wise.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Composite Longbow<\/span>: Using a bow is the\n\t\tpurpose of the class.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Armor is presented in the order in which you should acquire it, rather than alphabetical order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Buckler<\/span>: You&#8217;ll suffer a -1\n\t\tpenalty to your bow attacks because using a bow requires two hands, but the\n\t\tinexpensive AC bonus provided by a slightly enhanced mithral buckler is\n\t\teasily worth the attack penalty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Shirt<\/span>: The best armor you can\n\t\treasonably get unless you make it to +10 Dexterity modifier, at which point\n\t\tHaramaki becomes your best armor option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mithral Breastplate<\/span>: Arcane Archers get\n\t\tproficiency with medium armor, but unless your spellcasting comes from\n\t\tbloodrager, bard, or magus you&#8217;ll suffer arcane spell failure while wearing\n\t\ta mithral breastplate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Adaptive<\/span> (+1000gp): Strength can be\n\t\tan easy and inexpensive way to add some extra damage to your bow,\n\t\tespecially at low levels. You&#8217;ll probably never improve your natural\n\t\tStrength score, but at high levels you might consider upgrading your\n\t\tbelt to include a Strength bonus. If you do, or if you occasionally use\n\t\ttemporary Strength bonuses like Bull&#8217;s Strength, consider the Adaptive\n\t\tweapon property rather than using a composite bow with a potentially\n\t\tmismatched Strength bonus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; It Turns Out That Magus Was the Answer the Whole Time<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because of their split focus on spellcasting, an Arcane Archer will never be quite as good with a bow as a single-class fighter. Because they get so little spellcasting, dual-class builds with a full spellcasting class will still have terrible spellcasting. For the entirety of a 20-level run, the Magus\/Arcane Archer will have better spellcasting than a Wizard\/Fighter\/Arcane Archer, having more spell slots of each level, reaching each spell level earlier or at the same level, and having a caster level advantage of at least 5 caster levels. Dual-class builds literally can&#8217;t compete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to summarize: 8 levels of Magus (probably with the Myrmidarch archetype). If you still really want to play an Arcane Archer, take two levels of it to get Imbue Arrow, then consider going back to Magus. If you&#8217;re absolutely set on playing the prestige class, stick it out for the full 10 levels, then go back to Magus.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Arcane Archer is a very popular concept, combining the excitement of firing a bow with the magical power of an arcane spellcaster.
