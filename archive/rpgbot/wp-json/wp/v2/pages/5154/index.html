Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Cleric Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+ is great for cloistered\n\tclerics, giving them more hp than the sorcerer or the wizard, but for\n\twarpriests 8+ hit points is difficult since you&#8217;re likely going to be on the\n\tfront lines of combat alongside champions, fighters, and other characters with\n\tboth better armor and more hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Cleric&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are poor, which is typical for a full spellcaster. The Warpriest\n\ttrades away some spellcasting progression in exchange for better proficiencies\n\tin armor, Fortitude saves, and weapons, but they&#8217;re still not great. The\n\tCleric is a spellcaster first, and their proficiencies reflect that.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perception<\/span>: Trained at level 1 and you\n\t\tnever advance beyond Expert. Fortunately, you have good Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Will saves are the\n\t\tCleric&#8217;s only good save. Warpriests get better Fortitude progression, but\n\t\tnot by a lot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: A total for 4+ Trained skills,\n\t\tbut you&#8217;ll likely dump Intelligence so expect something like 3 Trained\n\t\tskills at first level from your class.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attacks<\/span>: The Cloistered Cleric&#8217;s weapon\n\t\tproficiencies are basically worthless. You&#8217;re barely more capable than a\n\t\twizard. The Warpriest&#8217;s proficiencies are better, but not quite as good as a\n\t\tmartial class like the Champion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: By default the Cleric gets no\n\t\tarmor proficiencies. The Warpriest gets medium armor, but clerics only\n\t\tadvance to Expert in armor proficiencies, and even then only at 13th level.\n\t\tStrongly consider putting feats into Armor Proficiency.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spells<\/strong>: The Cloistered Cleric gets the standard\n\t\tprogression for every full spellcaster, but the Warpriest Cleric&#8217;s\n\t\tspellcasting proficiency doesn&#8217;t advance as much or as quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deity<\/strong>: Your choice of deity is just as impactful as your Doctrine, determining your character&#8217;s anathemas, what domains you can choose from, whether your Divine Font feature grants Harm or Heal, a Trained skill, and a set of spells added to your spell list. For help choosing a deity, see my <a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/deities\">Cleric Deities Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Divine Spellcasting<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Spells<\/span>: Heightening spells is\n\t\tan important mechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many spells scale with spell level,\n\t\tallowing them to stay relevant long after you learned them. Since clerics\n\t\tdon&#8217;t use a Spell Repertoire, you can prepare a spell at any level that you\n\t\tcan cast.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Fantastic every time, on any\n\t\tcharacter, in any amount. Clerics can prepare 5 cantrips each day (if you\n\t\thave the first printing the Core Rulebook, this was corrected in\n\t\terrata).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Font<\/span>: Effectively free spell slots\n\tat your highest spell level. For clerics who get Heal, this reduces the need\n\tto commit spell slots to Heal just because you&#8217;re the person in your party who\n\tcan cast Heal. For clerics who get Harm, you get a low-cost damage option and\n\tyou can even heal your allies if everyone builds characters with inverted\n\thealing. However, this also adds a reliance on Charisma which is otherwise not\n\tan important ability for the Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Doctrine<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Doctrines&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cleric Feats<\/strong>: See Cleric feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alertness<\/span>: Your only improvement to\n\tPerception, and you get it at level 5.

You give up the standard\n\tspellcasting proficiency progression which most full spellcasters recieve, but\n\tin exchange you get medium armor and Shield Block, both of which considerably\n\timprove your durability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Warpriest&#8217;s biggest problem is that their proficiencies don&#8217;t keep up with other characters. You never go past Expert in armor, and while your weapon proficiencies advance reasonably well, you never go past Weapon Specialization, so your attack bonus and damage will always lag behind martial characters. To make up the gap, you&#8217;ll need to take feats like Align Weapon and cast spells like Magic Weapon. Fortunately, you get plenty of those options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">First Doctrine<\/span>: Medium armor and Shield\n\t\tBlock are a massive improvement to your durability.

First, using the feat is a huge gamble: if you miss, you lose the\n\t\tspell. You can mitigate this with options like True Strike, but that adds\n\t\teven more cost for what is essentially a neat trick. Second, the feat uses\n\t\tthe base damage (1d8 per spell level), so you&#8217;re getting much less damage\n\t\tout of the spell slot than you could for the same two Actions if you just\n\t\tcast the spell normally. The advantage is that you don&#8217;t need to rely on a\n\t\trelatively poor spell DC, which may be advantageous for the Warpriest. But\n\t\teven then, you can get much more for the same spell slot by casting\n\t\tsomething like Magic Weapon.\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re not a warpriest, if you have Divine Font (Heal), or if you\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t have enough Charisma to get several uses out of Divine Font, don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tbother with this feat.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Command Undead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The effect is too situational, the Action cost is too high, and the\n\t\tduration is too short.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Directed Channel<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Cloistered clerics have more room to invest in Charisma to support Divine\n\t\tFont, which means that they&#8217;re more likely to use those spells frequently.\n\t\tThey&#8217;re also more likely to be fighting from behind their more durable\n\t\tallies, so a 60-foot cone may be a much safer area of effect than a 30-foot\n\t\temanation which would encourage you to move dangerously close to melee. All\n\t\tof that makes Directed Channel a good option for cloistered clerics who plan\n\t\tto rely on Divine Font heavily. However, remember that you don&#8217;t get the\n\t\toption to include yourself in a cone, so you can&#8217;t heal yourself when you\n\t\tuse the 3-Action version of Heal or Harm.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Communal Healing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Communal Healing still isn&#8217;t enough hit points to justify the feat.

I&#8217;m not sure how the range works if you cast\n\t\tHeal targeting only yourself. I assume that it uses the same range as the\n\t\tspell (so either touch or 30 feet depending on how many Actions you spend),\n\t\tbut the text doesn&#8217;t specify.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Necrotic Infusion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The duration of the bonus is very short.

Harm and Heal both allow a Basic Fortitude Save, so the target will\n\t\ttake no damage if they roll a Critical Success, which means that you don&#8217;t\n\t\tknock them prone. This notably doesn&#8217;t care about spell level, so Cast Down\n\t\tworks fine with a 1st-level Harm, allowing you to turn an inexpensive spell\n\t\tslot into an easy way to knock foes prone and knock low-flying enemies to\n\t\tthe ground. However, you&#8217;ll need to use the 1-Action or 2-Action versions of\n\t\tthe spell, so you likely won&#8217;t do anything else in the same turn.

You can avoid the need for\n\t\tthis by building a party with inverted healing (dhampirs, etc.), but you may\n\t\tnot be able to guarantee the composition of your party. The number of\n\t\tcreatures who you can omit is limited to your Charisma bonus, but the\n\t\tclerics who should take this will need high Charisma anyway so that\n\t\tshouldn&#8217;t be a problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Steady Spellcasting<\/span>: The Flat Check is\n\t\ttoo difficult to make this feat an easy choice.

This removes that tax. You can solve\n\t\tthe same problem by buying some scrolls for emergencies, but heightening the\n\t\tspells for free may be worth the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Create Undead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: I would much rather have this than Turn Undead, but it&#8217;s still only\n\t\tsituationally useful in most campaigns. The persistent damage doesn&#8217;t care\n\t\tabout the target&#8217;s level, and they take the damage unless they score a\n\t\tCritical Success on their save (remember that it&#8217;s a Basice Save). This also\n\t\tisn&#8217;t limited to single targets, so you can use the 3-Action version of Heal\n\t\tto affect every undead in an encounter and rack up a ton of damage in a\n\t\thurry.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Emblazon Energy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Tempting for warpriests, but maybe not as effective as you would like.\n\t\tThe Shield option is excellent if you have the right damage type selected,\n\t\tbut it takes 10 minutes to emblazon something and you may not have time to\n\t\temblazon the right element. The damage bonus is fine, but weapon property\n\t\trunes like Flaming will deal more damage and should become available around\n\t\tthe same level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Martyr<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Risky, expensive, and it only works a few times per day so the feat cost\n\t\tis high for what you get. This looks tempting for a cloistered cleric who is\n\t\tdoing a good job avoiding damage, but it&#8217;s definitely not a go-to\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Surging Focus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Focus Points are great, but one extra Focus Point per day isn&#8217;t much for\n\t\tthe feat cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Castigating Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Even in a campaign where you&#8217;re facing fiends frequently, this is a tiny\n\t\tamount of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heroic Recovery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This will rarely be more impactful than spending the same Action to do\n\t\talmost anything else, such as Aid the target or make a Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Command Undead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This finally provides a way to make undead that you encounter into\n\t\tminions long-term. However, the 24-hour duration only works if they\n\t\tcritically fail the save, so you may need to repeatedly hit the target with\n\t\tHarm until they roll poorly enough to fail the save. This is great if you\n\t\tcan find suitable undead to command, but it presents a constant tax on your\n\t\tspell slots which may prove frustrating.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Replenishment of War<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent for warpriests. Easily-replenished temporary hit points provide\n\t\ta significant improvement to your durability, easily making up the gap\n\t\tbetween the Cleric and martial classes like the Fighter. This also allows\n\t\tthe &#8220;bag of rats&#8221; abuse case, but since the temporary hit points until lay\n\t\tuntil the start of your next turn there&#8217;s rarely a benefit to stabbing your\n\t\tbag of rats for extremely short-lived temporary hp.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shared Avoidance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Traps, falling rocks, and other such hazards frequently affect your whole\n\t\tparty, and sharing a +2 bonus can do a lot to mitigate the effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield of Faith<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Not a huge bonus, but still useful for warpriests who use Focus\n\t\tSpells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Through Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and you can typically just switch to spells\n\t\twhich call for a saving throw instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defensive Recovery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: +2 AC is a decent bonus. For a cloistered cleric relying on their martial\n\t\tallies staying alive, this could be helpful. But you want to avoid healing\n\t\tallies in combat as much as you possibly can, so you&#8217;ll likely only use this\n\t\twhen you&#8217;re healing allies who are dying or who are about to hit 0 hit\n\t\tpoints.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Focus<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Crucial if you&#8217;re built around using Focus Spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Emblazon Antimagic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Technically only situationally useful, but enemies which rely upon magic\n\t\tare common. The shield benefit will be more consistently useful since not\n\t\tall magic enemies rely on casting spells on themselves, but the weapon\n\t\tversion may be more impactful when it does come into play.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shared Replenishment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re a front-line melee warpriest, you almost certainly want these\n\t\ttemporary hit points for yourself. If you&#8217;re hitting with more than one\n\t\tStrike per round, you might be able to make this worthwhile, but you should\n\t\tprobably spend Actions on your turn to Raise a Shield, Sustain a Spell, Cast\n\t\ta Spell, and do other things beside making a Strike, which may make it\n\t\tdifficult to even have a chance to trigger Replenishment of War more than\n\t\tonce per turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deity&#8217;s Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good for warpriests who are built to use domain spells. Resistance to all\n\t\tdamage is excellent, and there&#8217;s no Action cost beyond casting your domain\n\t\tspell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ebb and Flow<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Weirdly powerful, but difficult to use. The 2-Action versions of Harm and\n\t\tHeal are very efficient, dealing or healing roughly 3 times as much as the\n\t\t1-Action version or the per-target effect for the 3-Action version, so\n\t\tnumerically this is roughly as effective as hitting 6 creatures with the\n\t\t3-Action version of Harm or Heal. The difficulty is that one target needs to\n\t\tbe harmed by the spell and the other needs to be harmed by the same spell.\n\t\tThe easiest way to do this is with Harm and with allies in the party with\n\t\tinverted healing (undead minions, dhampirs, etc.).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Extend Armament Alignment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Align Armament&#8217;s biggest problem is the 1-round duration. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tconsistently facing enemies which you can harm with Align Armament (for\n\t\texample: you&#8217;re a good cleric and your enemies are consistently evil), this\n\t\tmight be worthwhile on a warpriest. If you go into dangerous areas and\n\t\trepeatedly spend n Action to align your weapon, you can go into encounters\n\t\twith the effect already running and the 1-minute duration will get you\n\t\tthrough most fights. If your DM complains about this tactic, discuss doing\n\t\tthis as an Exploration Mode Activity or something.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fast Channel<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re built around Divine Font, this is excellent. The additional\n\t\tAction could be used to Stride into position to get the greatest effect, to\n\t\tRaise a Shield, to Sustain a Spell, or any manner of other excellent and\n\t\timpactful things.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Premonition of Clarity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Most mental effects target your Will save, and clerics have excellent\n\t\tWill saves. Still, sometimes you&#8217;ll fail a save, and mental effects can take\n\t\tyou out of a fight entirely. The reroll alone is excellent, and the +2 bonus\n\t\tmakes it even better. This is technically only situationally useful since it\n\t\tonly affects one of the three types of saving throws (and even then,\n\t\ttechnically not all of them), but it&#8217;s still very good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swift Banishment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The action economy is great, and extraplanar enemies are common in many\n\t\tcampagins, but it&#8217;s risky. A cloisterd cleric should just cast Banishment\n\t\tdirectly, so the most likely user here is the Warpriest. Your spell DC is\n\t\tgoing to be lower than most full spellcasters, and it&#8217;s unclear if you can\n\t\tspend the additional Action to present a material component, so you don&#8217;t\n\t\tget to impose the extra -2 penalty to the save. Those factors make it more\n\t\tlikely that the target will pass their save, and if they Critically Succeed\n\t\tyou&#8217;re Stunned 1. Unless you can find a way to mitigate those risks, this is\n\t\tlikley to dangerous to use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eternal Bane<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Bane is only a 1st-level spell, over time it will repeatedly affect the\n\t\toutcome of rolls, but since the penalty never gets worse than -1 it&#8217;s not\n\t\tgoing to constantly important. Creatures also get a Will save to resist the\n\t\teffects, which may make this unreliable. The best candidate for this feat is\n\t\ta warpriest planning to fight in melee where the 15-foot radius will\n\t\tconsistently affect creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Eternal Blessing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Bless&#8217;s +1 bonus to attacks is a great buff for your whole party, and\n\t\teven with a 15-foot radius you can stil position yourself so that most or\n\t\tall of your allies can consistently benefit without actually walking into\n\t\tmelee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remediate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. If you need to counteract an effect, cast\n\t\tDispel Magic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resurrection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The fast healing can do a lot to keep your allies conscious, rather than\n\t\trepeatedly falling to 0 hit points and compelling you to hit them with Heal\n\t\tagain. Fast healing is slow, but 50 hit points over the course of a minute\n\t\tis still a bunch of healing if your target can avoid falling unconscious\n\t\tagain during that time. You can trigger this with any sort of hit points\n\t\trestoration, so casting Heal at 1st level, using a potion, using Medicine,\n\t\tor any other healing option will suffice. In some cases you might even knock\n\t\tan ally to 0 hit points just to get the extra hit points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Wellspring<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Crucial if you&#8217;re built to use Focus Spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Echoing Channel<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: You&#8217;re already spending three Actions to do this, and at that point a\n\t\t3-Action version of the spell will typically be more effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Swift Banishment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A significant improvement to Swift Banishment, but not worth the feat\n\t\tunless you&#8217;re facing a huge number of extraplanar enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Miraculous Possibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Clerics &#8220;know&#8221; every Common spell on the Divine Spell list, which means\n\t\tthat you can use this to cast a dizzyingly large array of spells without the\n\t\tneed to prepare weird, situational spells and haul them around all day in\n\t\thopes that you&#8217;ll need them. You may be able to solve the same problem with\n\t\tscrolls, but this doesn&#8217;t cost gold to use and doesn&#8217;t require you to build\n\t\ta growing library of scrolls which might never see use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shared Clarity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Your allies almost certianly don&#8217;t have Will saves as good as yours, so\n\t\tallowing them to reroll their saves with a bonus will provide a powerful\n\t\tdefense against many problematic effects.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Avatar&#8217;s Audience<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very cool, but not especially impactful.
