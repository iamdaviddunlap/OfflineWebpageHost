Wisdom is\n\talways good, but a charisma bonus encourages specific class choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Native Outsider<\/span>: As outsiders with the\n\tnative subtype, Aasimars are immune to a number of punishing effects that only\n\ttarget humanoids, but also can not be the recipient of a number of buffs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Medium<\/span>: Medium size is the size that most\n\tthings are and offers no real benefits or penalties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Normal Speed<\/span>: A movement of 30 feet. Not\n\tspecial, but not bad either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Senses<\/span>: 60 feet of darkvision is fantastic\n\ton any character, but it&#8217;s best if you pick a class where you expect to scout\n\tin darkness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skilled<\/span>: A +2 in perception is great\n\tregardless of your stats, but it&#8217;s even better combined with the wisdom bonus\n\tfrom your racial ability modifiers. You also get a +2 to diplomacy, which is\n\tfun if you plan on being the party face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell-Like Ability<\/span>: Daylight is a\n\tsituational spell that is most useful for countering magical darkness and\n\timposing penalties on enemies with light sensitivity. However, it lasts a long\n\ttime and you can slap it on your weapon long before you get into a fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Celestial Resistance<\/span>: A broad range of\n\tresistances against commonly-encountered damage types. This is great, but it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t scale well so there are better options in the Alternate Traits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Languages<\/span>: Common and Celestial. Celestial\n\tcomes up often enough that it&#8217;s nice to have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-racial-traits\">Alternate Racial Traits<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Celestial Crusader<\/span>: Replaces Celestial\n\tResistance and Skilled. A +1 insight bonus to attack rolls against a\n\tcommonly-encountered enemy type is useful, but you&#8217;re giving up some\n\tincredible defensive options for a situationally useful bonus that&#8217;s not all\n\tthat great even when it matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deathless Spirit<\/span>: Replaces Celestial\n\tResistance. This trait is exceptionally useful in an undead-themed campaign.\n\tNegative levels are one of the most punishing effects in the game. With this\n\ttrait you don&#8217;t lose hit points when you are subject to negative levels, which\n\tapplies even when you are resurrected. A +2 to saves against an entire school\n\tof magic stays useful forever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exalted Resistance<\/span>: Replaces Celestial\n\tResistance. While the spell resistance only applies to spell effects with the\n\tevil descriptor and to spells cast by evil outsiders, this is a benefit as it\n\twon&#8217;t apply to your friends&#8217; spells along with your enemies. Pick this if you\n\texpect to fight evil outsiders in your campaign, especially if you expect to\n\tfight them at low levels when spell resistance is exceptionally hard to come\n\tby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halo<\/span>: Replaces Darkvision. If you&#8217;re not\n\tplanning on scouting in the dark, and you&#8217;re going to be the party face, the\n\tlight cantrip and an intimidate bonus is a good trade for darkvision. Plus,\n\tyou can always get Darkvision from a spell or an item if you do need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Immortal Spark<\/span>: Replaces Skilled and\n\tSpell-like Ability. Lesser Age Resistance lasts all day, so if you play a\n\tmiddle-aged aasimar you can get a +1 ability score increase to all your mental\n\tscores without suffering any of the physical score penalties, which is a huge\n\tbenefit if you&#8217;re playing a spellcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Incorruptible<\/span>: Replaces Spell-like Ability.\n\tCorruption Resistance is a bad spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavenborn<\/span>: Replaces Skilled and Spell-like\n\tAbility. There are very few spells which would benefit from this in a\n\tnoticeable way so it mostly affects spell duration for spells like Daylight,\n\twhich ironically you longer get to cast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Scion of Humanity<\/span>: Replaces Languages and\n\talters Native Outsider. If there are buffs that you&#8217;d like to be able to be\n\table to benefit from, this is worth taking. Additionally, if you take the\n\tRacial heritage feat, you can count as an aasimar, human and one other race,\n\twhich is neat if you have a build in mind that requires race specific\n\tarchetypes or feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Truespeaker<\/span>: Replaces Skilled. Learning\n\ttwice the amount of languages per rank invested in linguistics can result in a\n\thuge number of languages known, but you could also buy a Wand of Tongues and\n\tkeep the ranks and +2 bonus to Perception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"aasimar-feats\">Aasimar Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Angel Wings<\/span>: You should have regular\n\taccess to fly by now, but it&#8217;s nice to gain a class skill and a flight speed\n\twithout bothering the party caster, using an action, or spending money on\n\titems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Angelic Blood<\/span>: This is a feat tax towards\n\tgaining Angel\/Metallic Wings, but the ability to deal bleed to yourself to\n\tcause evil creatures to take damage is so funny that it&#8217;s almost worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Angelic Flesh<\/span>: You choose one option that\n\tchanges your skin and grants you some kind of defense. Gaining fire resistance\n\t5 from Brazen, or +1 natural armor from Steel are both nice, but not so good\n\tthat it&#8217;s worth the investment unless you&#8217;re attempting to pick up Metallic\n\tWings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Celestial Servant<\/span>: Spell resistance on a\n\tfamiliar or animal companion is wonderful, and smite evil on it increases\n\ttheir damage output a great deal. However, you&#8217;ll want to look for an animal\n\tcompanion with more than 11 charisma to really make use of it, and few regular\n\tanimals meet that criteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Force<\/span>: This is a great addition to\n\ta build centered around\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/channel_energy\/\">Channel Energy<\/a>. Gain the benefits of a bull rush or drag without having to go through an\n\tenemy&#8217;s CMD. Area control is always worth your time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Channel Force<\/span>: Forced movement in\n\t\tan AoE cone or line is incredible.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Channel Force<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to\n\t\tbe hard-pressed to find a situation where Improved Channel Force won&#8217;t be\n\t\tsufficient, but if you find that situation, it&#8217;s nice to have.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Consecrate Spell (Metamagic)<\/span>: If you&#8217;re\n\tregularly fighting evil creatures, which you likely will be, this is great. If\n\tyou are in an evil campaign or have an evil party member, this is ironically\n\talso good for healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Heavenly Radiance<\/span>: Flare burst and Wake of\n\tLight are situational at best, but Searing Light, Wandering Star Motes and\n\tSunbeam are all reliable spell-like abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Metallic Wings<\/span>: This takes a huge feat\n\tinvestment just to increase your damage output by a fraction. If you have\n\tsmite, sneak attack, or some other way to add a lot of damage to every attack\n\tin a round, this feat is <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"aasimar-classes\">Aasimar Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you do decide to swap out the Skilled trait and the daylight spell-like ability for Immortal Spark and play as a middle-aged character, you have the combined ability score bonuses of a +1 to intelligence, +3 to wisdom and a +3 to charisma with no real penalties unless you&#8217;re hit by a dispelling effect. This method of play lends itself to full casters, but every class can make use of it with a little risk involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alchemist\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/alchemist\">Alchemist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With a +2 to wisdom and charisma and no favored class bonuses, the best case\n\tI can make for an aasimar alchemist is that they can lessen the impact of the\n\talchemical penalty to your will saves for consuming a mutagen.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"antipaladin\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/antipaladin\">Antipaladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As an alternate version of the paladin, this is very similar to its companion\n\tclass.

Unlike with the paladin, there is no favored\n\tclass bonus. Additionally, you do not get the option of an animal companion,\n\tso you cannot apply the celestial template to it with the Celestial Servant\n\tfeat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcanist\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/arcanist\">Arcanist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A +2 to wisdom helps your will saves, a +2 to charisma helps raise the DC of\n\tyour arcanist exploits, as well as increases the number of times per day you\n\tcan consume spells.

The favored class bonus is incredible, allowing you access to higher\n\tlevel revelation abilities sooner. This was heavily nerfed by errata (adding\n\t1\/2 to the oracle&#8217;s level for the purposes of determining the effects of one\n\trevelation became 1\/6 to the oracle&#8217;s level instead), but gaining revelation\n\tfeatures early is still so good that this is entirely worth it. You can, for\n\texample, apply this bonus to the Ancestor mystery revelation Spirit of the\n\tWarrior and get a BAB that is higher than your level for a few rounds a\n\tday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, there&#8217;s an Aasimar-specific archetype for the oracle called the\n\tPurifier, which grants you alignment channel as if you were a cleric.

The favored class bonus grants the aasimar stronger morale\n\teffects from their aura. If the paladin selects an animal companion as their\n\tdivine bond they can get the celestial template six levels early with\n\tCelestial Servant, which they can retrain into another feat at 11th level.<br><br>Additionally,\n\tbuilding towards metallic wings with a paladin is a solid option, as it grants\n\tyou two additional attacks to deliver smite damage without cutting into a\n\tpaladin&#8217;s normal full attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"psychic\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/psychic\">Psychic<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Aside from slightly better will saves, the aasimar doesn&#8217;t do anything for\n\tthe psychic.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/ranger\">Ranger<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As a primarily ranged martial and wisdom caster, the ranger lends itself well\n\tto the aasimar, and, a ranger with an animal companion as their hunter&#8217;s bond\n\tcan pick Celestial Servant to make their companion a good deal stronger.

The +2 to perception and diplomacy from\n\tthe skilled trait synergizes nicely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also get a pretty dramatic damage increase at 11th level with the\n\textra natural attacks gained via the metallic wings feat tree, however, you\n\twill have to invest four feats to get it, taking a -2 penalty to stealth with\n\tthe Angelic Flesh feat.
