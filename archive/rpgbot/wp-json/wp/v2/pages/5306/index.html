Strength\n\t\tdamage really only handicaps enemies that will have high Fortitude saves, so\n\t\tit will be difficult to use this effectively.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">alter self<\/span>: The weakest polymorph spell,\n\t\tbut it still offers some nice utility option. See my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph#alter-self\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a>\n\t\tfor further guidance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">excruciating deformation<\/span>: Too slow, and it\n\t\trequires a touch attack. You don&#8217;t have a familiar which can safely deliver\n\t\tthe spell, so you need to put yourself at tremendous risk to apply this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">black tentacles<\/span>: Among the best area\n\t\tcontrol spells in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">explode head<\/span>: If the target has 20 or fewer\n\t\thit points, you shouldn&#8217;t need a 6th-level spell to kill it. If it has more\n\t\tthan 20 hit points you should be hitting it with a save-or-suck spell. I\n\t\treally want this spell to be good because it&#8217;s so funny, but it just\n\t\tisn&#8217;t.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">repulsion<\/span>: Situational, and at this\n\t\tlevel you have several other options which are more versatile that will\n\t\tsolve the same problems.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">insanity<\/span>: I really don&#8217;t like confusion\n\t\tbecause it&#8217;s so unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">orb of the void<\/span>: At this level you have a\n\t\tvariety of other options which also require fortitude saves but will\n\t\toutright kill enemies. The only appeal of this spell is marching an army of\n\t\tundead past it for the temporary hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">telekinetic storm<\/span>: Fireball with 1-round\n\t\tDaze and Stun. I&#8217;m confused why both conditions are applied since Stun is\n\t\tjust a better version of Daze. My best guess is that it&#8217;s to help overcome\n\t\tcondition immunities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dark Half<\/span> (Su): Increasing your spell DCs\n\tby 1 is great and the Will save bonus is nice since you&#8217;ll have relatively\n\tpoor Wisdom, but the bleed damage is mostly pointless. The number of rounds\n\tshould be fine so long as you only use this one rounds when you want to cast a\n\tsave-or-suck spell.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Morphic Form<\/span> (Ex): Unless you&#8217;re\n\tpolymorphing, you should be investing more in not being hit and less in\n\tsurviving hits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Safeguard<\/span> (Su): Permanent spell\n\tresistance is fantastic, but remember that it applies whether you want it to\n\tor not, and lowering spell resistance is a\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/coreRulebook\/combat.html#table-8-2-actions-in-combat\">Standard Action<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"dream\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dream<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dream starts of strong and gets gradually weirder and stranger as you gain levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Charisma<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Dream starts off with\n\tsave-or-suck spells, but gets into weird utility spells after Deep Slumber.\n\tThe theme is excellent, and most of the spells are at least usable.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">sleep<\/span>: The best save-or-suck spell for\n\t\tyour first several levels. It&#8217;s annoying that you&#8217;re locked into it since it\n\t\tbecomes totally useless at higher levels, but it&#8217;s still a good freebie.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">oneiric horror<\/span>: Single-target save or\n\t\tsuck. This will take a creature out of a fight for rounds\/level, but be\n\t\tcareful of the repeated saving throws.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">deep slumber<\/span>: The same issues as Sleep,\n\t\tbut with a higher hit dice cap it will be useful for a bit longer.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">sleepwalk<\/span>: Very situational normally,\n\t\tbut once you get Walking Dream this will allow you to create a stock of host\n\t\tbodies if you manage to find creatures sleeping naturally. Unfortunately,\n\t\tthere are no magical sleep spells with durations long enough to make this\n\t\twork, so you&#8217;ll need to actually ambush sleeping enemies somehow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">nightmare<\/span>: Very situational, but\n\t\tcombined with Oneiromancy it can be extremely potent against enemies who\n\t\tyou&#8217;re having trouble locating or drawing out of their lairs.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">cloak of dreams<\/span>: Extremely powerful, but\n\t\tit can be very dangerous since you need to be within 5 feet to affect\n\t\tcreatures. Your best bet is probably to use this while invisible and sneak\n\t\taround putting creatures to sleep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">ethereal jaunt<\/span>: Excellent for utility,\n\t\tinfiltration, and retreat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">dream voyage<\/span>: This is a very strange spell. Unless\n\t\tyour GM knows what the subject is dreaming about, I&#8217;m not sure how this\n\t\twould work. I wouldn&#8217;t expect to use this much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">microcosm<\/span>: As far as I can tell, this is a\n\t\tsave-or-suck spell with a potentially permanent duration. However, the text\n\t\tnotably omits what the spell actually does to the target. &#8220;You plunge the\n\t\ttargets&#8217; minds into a veiled immersive mindscape of your own design&#8221; is the\n\t\tclosest we get, and that&#8217;s flavor text. I post a thread on the\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/threads\/rzs2uczb?What-does-the-spell-Microcosm-do#1\">Rules Forums<\/a>, so hopefully someone will clarify.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dream Leech<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s really hard to find\n\ta creature that&#8217;s asleep and that you&#8217;re planning to talk to in the next 24\n\thours unless you put them to sleep and interrogate them later. This must be\n\tthe easiest method for recharging your Phrenic Pool, so it&#8217;s not surprise that\n\tthere&#8217;s such a small limit on how much and how often you can recharge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Oneiromancy<\/span> (Su): Oneiromancy is fantastic.\n\tCombine it with Dream Leach to effectively use Suggestion on a create that you\n\tput to sleep. Use it with Nightmare to convince a hidden enemy to meet you\n\tsomewhere public. Get clever.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mind Heist<\/span> (Sp): Put creatures to sleep,\n\tand instead of waking them to interrogate them you can just read their\n\tminds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Waking Dream<\/span> (Sp): It appears that this\n\teffect doesn&#8217;t end if the creature would normally wake up, like at the end of\n\ta sleep spell&#8217;s duration. If you can put an enemy to sleep, take over its body\n\tand use it to fight. If it dies, you return safely to your own body and\n\tre-join the fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"faith\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Faith<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your party lacks a cleric, this is a great option. It starts off slow, but really picks up at high levels when you get options like Prayer Aura. You get a little bit of healing, some spells from the cleric list, and eventually you get Miracle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Wisdom<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Mostly good options, most of\n\twhich aren&#8217;t on the Psychic spell list.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">bless<\/span>: A great buff at low levels, and\n\t\twith minutes\/level duration it can last through a fight or two.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">spiritual weapon<\/span>: Save-or-suck is always\n\t\ta better option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">magic vestment<\/span>: Largely useless for you,\n\t\tbut it can save your allies a fortune in gold spent on enhacing their armor\n\t\tand shields.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">guardian of faith<\/span>: Fancy protection from\n\t\tevil with a slightly better deflection bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">commune<\/span>: Very powerful, but the 500gp\n\t\tmaterial component is very expensive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">psychic surgery<\/span>: Situational. It&#8217;s a bit\n\t\tlike Restoration, but only for mental stuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">greater scrying<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\tpowerful when you need it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">greater planar ally<\/span>: Giving this to a\n\t\tspontaneous caster is cruel. It&#8217;s really expensive to use so you&#8217;re not\n\t\tgoing to cast it more than a few times in your character&#8217;s whole life.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">miracle<\/span>: Like Wish, but not quite as\n\t\tversatile and not nearly so costly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"\">Deity<\/span> (Ex): Not a huge restriction.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Energy<\/span>: Very limited access to\n\thealing spells, but at low levels before your party can afford a wand of cure\n\tlight wounds this will make a big difference. You also get to recharge your\n\tPhrenic pool when you heal things, which is a nice reward.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilience of the Faithful<\/span> (Su): This will\n\tsave you a few thousand gold pieces and open up your cloak slot, but cloaks of\n\tresistance are inexpensive compared to other defensive items so your resitance\n\tbonus may be worse than that of your allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prayer Aura<\/span> (Su): Prayer is a great buff.\n\tLuck bonuses are extremely rare. It&#8217;s unclear if the penalties against your\n\tenemies allow a save, and if they do you could probably just toggle the\n\tability on\/off on your next turn to force them to save again. Discuss it with\n\tyour GM to be sure. Activating this as a free action means that you can turn\n\tit on, throw a save-or-suck spell against debuffed enemies, and end an\n\tencounter using only one round of the duration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lore\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Lore<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge missed opportunity, the Lore discipline has a really cool flavor and some really good spells, but the abilities are almost universally worthless. The ability to gain extra Phrenic Pool points doesn&#8217;t function until 4th level, and doesn&#8217;t function without spending gold until at least 6th level. You also need to use the Skill Unlocks system to use one of the discipline&#8217;s abilities. The spell list is good, but locks you into several spells which will very rarely see use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Wisdom<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Several absolutely fantastic\n\toptions, but a few which you&#8217;ll only use rarely.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">comprehend languages<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\tuseful and largely replaces the need for the Linguistics skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">hypercognition<\/span>: You won&#8217;t be using this\n\t\tin combat, but outside of combat this is a significant bonus to every\n\t\tknowledge skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">dispel magic<\/span>: Someone in the party needs\n\t\tto have it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mind probe<\/span>: Situational, and it requires\n\t\tyou to invest in Sense Motive for it to be effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">retrocognition<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">legend lore<\/span>: Situational, but one of the\n\t\tmost useful divinations in the game. It&#8217;s essentially &#8220;ask the GM about the\n\t\tplot&#8221; as a spell. You might only cast it once or twice, which hurts for a\n\t\tspontaneous caster.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">greater arcane sight<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">moment of prescience<\/span>: At hours per level\n\t\tduration you can cast this before sleeping and use the effect the next day.\n\t\tSave this for saving throws; a +16 bonus (the minimum you could get) will\n\t\tmake you almost certain to pass even the most terrifying save DC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">divide mind<\/span>: It only lasts for one minute,\n\t\tbut it effectively means that you can cast quickened spells of 5th level and\n\t\tbelow without raising their spell level. If you can cast this before jumping\n\t\tinto a fight, it&#8217;s a game-changer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Illuminating Answers<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s annoying that\n\tthis requires you to learn and cast spells which the Lore discipline doesn&#8217;t\n\tgive you. The spells which trigger the effect are vaguely defined. The first\n\tspell that seems to fit is Augury, which is 2nd level, so you can&#8217;t get extra\n\tpool points until 4th level. It also has a 25gp focus <em>and<\/em> a 25gp\n\tmaterial component, so it can become a problem if you use it constantly. Blood\n\tBiography is the first spell without a gold cost, but it&#8217;s really situational\n\tand I don&#8217;t think I would waste a known spell on it if it didn&#8217;t get you\n\tPhrenic Pool points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Mnemonic Cache<\/span> (Su): This is a very difficult\n\tability to use. In real life an ability like this would be immenseley useful,\n\tbut it&#8217;s easily replaced by mundane methods like writing stuff down in a\n\tjournal. The best usage I can think of depends on the telepathic link part of\n\tthe ability, which allows you to transfer memories to people. Of course, they\n\treceive them like normal memories, so it&#8217;s rare that you&#8217;ll be able to provide\n\tany meaningful detail to your party beyond what you could convey by descibing\n\tthe event in detail. The second half of the ability is extremely situational,\n\tand doesn&#8217;t apply to symbol traps, which are the biggest thing you would want\n\tto use this on.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Superior Automatic Writing<\/span> (Ex): If you&#8217;re\n\tnot using skill unlocks, this is totally useless. Even if you do use skill\n\tunlocks, you&#8217;re forced to invest skill ranks in Linguistics, which is a\n\tlargely useless skill. Adding Commune to the list of potential spell effects\n\tis neat, but you can&#8217;t guarantee that you&#8217;ll need to cast it once a week.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Memory Palace<\/span> (Su): Permanent +2 (+4 if you\n\tstudy) to knowledge checks which your library covers. Not much at this level,\n\tbut still nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"pain\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pain<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of this discipline is exciting. The abilities are fun, the concept is neat, and everything makes sense thematically. Unfortunately, the entire discipline is based around dealing damage (already a weak option for spellcasters), and further handicaps itself by making much of the damage non-lethal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Charisma<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Most of the spell list\n\trelates to dealing damage, much of which is subdual. Damage is usually a poor\n\tstrategy for spellcasters, and this discipline doesn&#8217;t fix that.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">persuasive goad<\/span>: A terrible waste of a\n\t\tspell slot unless you&#8217;re interrogating a helpless enemy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">pain strike<\/span>: Too slow. Not useful in\n\t\tcombat, and Persuasive Goad does the same thing out of combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">vampiric touch<\/span>: A good way to offset your\n\t\tpoor hit dice, but without a familiar it can be dangerous to use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">mass pain strike<\/span>: Affecting multiple\n\t\ttargets doesn&#8217;t make Pain Strike better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">synapse overload<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t great,\n\t\tbut a successful save doesn&#8217;t reduce it. Staggering a creature is very\n\t\teffective if it relies on full attacks, but if it uses a single attack,\n\t\tspecial abilities, or spells, Staggered will have little effect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">mass inflict pain<\/span>: -4 to attacks is decent,\n\t\tbut by this level you have numerous better options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">waves of exhaustion<\/span>: No save, no spell\n\t\tresistance. Against melee enemies this can be significant handicap. Just\n\t\treducing their speed and preventing charges offers your melee allies a\n\t\tsignificant tactical advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">horrid wilting<\/span>: 1d6\/level single-target\n\t\tdamage. The worst way to be a spellcaster.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">mass suffocation<\/span>: Fantastic save-or-suck.\n\t\tBy the time you get this you can affect 9 creatures, which should win most\n\t\tencounters. The duration lasts long enough that you&#8217;re almost guaranteed\n\t\tthat the targets will fail at least one save, rendering them unconscious.\n\t\tSince you get to pick the targets, you don&#8217;t even need to worry about your\n\t\tallies getting in the way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Painful Reminder<\/span> (Su): At first and second\n\tlevel this can be significant. It won&#8217;t matter much at higher levels, but it&#8217;s\n\ta nice way to spend your swift action if you don&#8217;t have anything else to use\n\tit for. It also powers your phrenic pool recharge mechanic. Unfortunately,\n\tthis requires that you deal damage with spells instead of relying on\n\tsave-or-suck spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Power from Pain<\/span> (Su): Recharging your phrenic pool\n\tbased on damage isn&#8217;t ideal, especially since you have a chance for it to fail\n\tif you don&#8217;t roll enough damage. The scaling damage on Painful reminder will\n\tmake it more reliable, but it&#8217;s going to be difficult at low levels where you\n\tneed the extra points most. The daily uses are limited like every other\n\tdiscipline, but for some reason it&#8217;s dependent on Wisdom even though the\n\tdiscipline is Charisma-based. Hopefully this is an error, but the SRD has not\n\tbeen erratad yet.<\/p>\n<p><!-- TODO: CHECK FOR ERRATA --><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Live On<\/span> (Sp): This won&#8217;t be a ton of\n\thealing, but you&#8217;re a wizard-equivalent, so you shouldn&#8217;t be taking damage\n\tfrequently. You can also only use this on yourself, so its utility is limited,\n\tbut this will save your party the trouble of healing you themselves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Agonizing Wound<\/span> (Su): Skip the fear-stacking\n\tand go straight to panicked for a round. If you use one usage, Frightened is\n\tbetter than sickened (remember that Frighten includes Shaken, which applies\n\talmost identical penalties to sickened). If you use two usages, Dazed will\n\tprevent your enemy from taking actions or Panicked can provoke a bunch of\n\tattacks of opportunity. Nauseated is good, but in no way as good as Dazed or\n\tPanicked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"psychedelia\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Psychedelia<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This one starts off week and gets crazy at high levels. The low- and mid-level options are all mediocre at best, and work better as amusing novelties than actual character options. Then suddenly you get Hallucinogenic Aura and you can&#8217;t go out in public without sending innocent people into a fit frothing madness in which there is a very real chance that they will deal 1d8+str damage to themselves and bleed out in the middle of the street. If you manage to not be hunted down and murdered for your crimes against society, the high-level spells are fairly good. But you&#8217;ll need to make it to level 14 with little to no benefit from this discipline just to get some spells when you could just learn on your own since they&#8217;re already on your spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Wisdom<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Starts off very poorly, but\n\tgets great options at high levels.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">polypurpose panacea<\/span>: Amusing, but totally\n\t\tuseless in any practical sense.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">mad hallucination<\/span>: The target needs to fail\n\t\ta Will save to then take a penalty to Will saves. Why not just use whatever\n\t\tother spell you were going to follow up with?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">synesthesia<\/span>: This is an excellent debuff,\n\t\tespecially against enemy spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">confusion<\/span>: Confusion is unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mirage arcana<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">joyful rapture<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">waves of ecstasy<\/span>: Cone of Stun with a\n\t\tdecent fallback effect if targets pass the save.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">euphoric tranquility<\/span>: Remove the target\n\t\tfrom the fight with no save for rounds\/level. If you attack them there&#8217;s\n\t\tstill a chance that they can&#8217;t retaliate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">astral projection<\/span>: The safest way to\n\t\ttravel the planes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Drug Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cognatogen<\/span> (Su): +4 Intelligence for a few\n\tminutes. It will boost your spell save DCs, but that&#8217;s about it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warped Brain<\/span> (Su): Mind-affecting spells\n\tinclude a variety of effects, including scary things like dominate person.\n\tThis adds a great backlash effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hallucinogenic Aura<\/span> (Su): The effect is\n\tconstant, so it takes effect as soon as creatures come within 30 feet of you.\n\tWhile this is great for deterring enemies, it&#8217;s really annoying anywhere else\n\tsince you&#8217;re utterly unable to turn it off. The ability provides for an\n\tantidote which will help your party, but if you walk into a crowded area\n\tyou&#8217;re going to cause mass insanity and violence. Walking through a crowded\n\tmarket could be considered a war crime. It&#8217;s <em>that<\/em> dangerous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"rapport\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapport<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rapport discipline is a team player. You provide useful utility and defensive options to your allies, you eventually get teamwork feats which you can then share with Coordinated Effort, and you get the ability to share your Intelligence- or Charisma-based skill modifiers with your allies, opening up all sorts of skill uses to characters with poor skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Charisma<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: A mixed bag. Most of the\n\toptions are decent, and few are bad.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">charm person<\/span>: Fantastically useful in a\n\t\tworld where the vast majority of people you talk to are humanoids.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">enthrall<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">coordinated effort<\/span>: One level after you\n\t\tget a free teamwork feat, you get the ability to share it with your\n\t\tparty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">lesser geas<\/span>: Situational, and it takes\n\t\tquite a bit of forethought to make this useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">telepathy<\/span>: Much better than Tongues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">battlemind link<\/span>: This is a really neat\n\t\tspell, but since you&#8217;re not going to be making attacks the only useful\n\t\toption is the spellcasting option. Hopefully you have another full caster to\n\t\twork with.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mass hold person<\/span>: Situational, but very\n\t\teffective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">mass charm monster<\/span>: Very useful, but it\n\t\twon&#8217;t affect a huge number of creatures and it won&#8217;t help in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">overwhelming presence<\/span>: Incapacitates\n\t\tenemies for rounds\/level, but it won&#8217;t actually end a fight on its own.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Emotional Bond<\/span> (Su): A very useful way to\n\tkeep tabs on your allies until you can cast Telepathic Bond.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Emotional Push<\/span> (Su): This is fantastic,\n\tdespite the limited usage. Your allies need to share your daily uses, so be\n\tsure to reserve this for saves that are going to really matter. Also be sure\n\tto invest in your Charisma to make sure that the bonus is as big as possible.\n\tIf you start with 14 Charisma and get +6 from a headband, you&#8217;re granting a +5\n\tbonus, which is a massive bonus even if you only get to use it a few times per\n\tday.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Share Memory <\/span> (Sp): Situational, but a\n\tneat flavor. Sharing a memory with someone is much more interesting than\n\tsimply telling them what happened.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Team Player<\/span> (Ex): Teamwork feats are great,\n\tbut they need a lot of coordination with your allies. You can cast Coordinated\n\tEffort to share your teamwork feat with your allies, but until you&#8217;ve gained a\n\tfew more levels it&#8217;s a poor way to spend your 3rd-level spell slots. See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/teamwork_feats\">Practical Guide to Teamwork Feats<\/a>\n\tfor further guidance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shared Skill<\/span> (Ex): The possibilities here\n\tare great. Use Magic Device is a good fallback if you don&#8217;t know what else to\n\tuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"self-perfection\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Self-Perfection<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Self-Perfection discipline borrows from Monks in many ways, and the result is a little bit weird. Still, the abilities and spells are good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Wisdom<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Several fantastic options\n\tspread throughout the list.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">expeditious retreat<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">bear&#8217;s endurance<\/span>: Ability score buffs from\n\t\tthese spells aren&#8217;t especially helpful, and Constitution is the worst of\n\t\tthem. Suddenly losing 2 hit points per level is a good way to kill\n\t\tyourself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">haste<\/span>: One of the best buffs in the\n\t\tgame.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">freedom of movement<\/span>: Somewhat\n\t\tsituational, but grapple monsters are common, so this is very useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">echolocation<\/span>: Blindsight for 10\n\t\tminutes\/level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">transformation<\/span>: Become a fighter for\n\t\trounds\/level. This is a hard spell to use because it doesn&#8217;t solve some\n\t\tmajor problems like your poor hit points, your lack of decent weaponry, or\n\t\tyour lack of combat feats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">ethereal jaunt<\/span>: Excellent for infiltration\n\t\tand escape.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">iron body<\/span>: Potentially useful in\n\t\tcombination with Transformation, but still not especially useful for a\n\t\tstrictly mon-melee character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">akashic form<\/span>: Cast this every day at the\n\t\tstart of the day. It&#8217;s a free extra life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">AC Bonus<\/span> (Ex): AC isn&#8217;t especially\n\timportant for a dedicated spellcaster, but this is still a nice bonus. It\n\tcould be especially useful for multiclass builds like cleric\/psychic\/mystic\n\ttheurge or something.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Physical Push<\/span> (Su): Not especially useful,\n\tbut it&#8217;s pretty easy to use to recharge your phrenic pool. Find something\n\theavy and make a Strength check to lift it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bodily Purge<\/span> (Su): Some self-healing and the\n\tability to remove many frustrating effects which normally require a cleric.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Pure Body<\/span> (Ex): Many high-level monsters\n\tuse poison and disease, but as a spellcaster you should have options to\n\tprevent enemies from hitting you rather than attempting to survive attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tranquility\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tranquility<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tranquility does a lot of stuff involving stopping emotion effects. While that can be useful for psychic spellcasters who depend on &#8220;emotion components&#8221;, very few foes use emotion-based effects, so the abilities will rarely matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phrenic Pool Ability<\/strong>: Wisdom<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Great options early and\n\tlate, but the middle is a huge dead zone.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">telempathic projection<\/span>: Since Tranquility\n\t\tis Wisdom-based you&#8217;re probably not your party&#8217;s Face. Use this to make\n\t\tcreatures like your friends before they start talking.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">silence<\/span>: Off-switch for spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">mantle of calm<\/span>: Very situational, and it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t actually prevent people from killing you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mass daze<\/span>: If this wasn&#8217;t limited to\n\t\thumanoids it would be fantastic. In encounters with multiple humanoid\n\t\tenemies you can cast this repeatedly and shut down the encounter one round\n\t\tat a time while your allies kill things.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">serenity<\/span>: Nonlethal damage is difficult,\n\t\tand this doesn&#8217;t do enough damage to be a serious deterrent against enemies\n\t\tat this level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">psychic surgery<\/span>: Situational. It&#8217;s a bit\n\t\tlike Restoration, but only for mental stuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">mind blank<\/span>: Too situational. (I wanted to\n\t\tleave this blank for comic effect, but it wasn&#8217;t very helpful.)<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">euphoric tranquility<\/span>: 24-hour duration.\n\t\t+8 against mind-affecting effects covers nearly all Will saves, and blocking\n\t\tdivinations (including See Invisibility) means that you can turn invisible\n\t\tand comfortably hide knowing that magical means can&#8217;t expose you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">time stop<\/span>: Among the best spells in the\n\t\tgame.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mental Placidity<\/span> (Su): The bonus is\n\tfantastic, but unless you throw yourself against enemies with effects which\n\tcall for Will saves you&#8217;ll have trouble recharging your Phrenic Pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Calming Presence<\/span> (Su): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Purge Disquiet<\/span> (Su): There doesn&#8217;t appear\n\tto be a limit on how often you can do this, so you can refresh the effect\n\twhenever it wears off. I recommend using Shaken as your go-to since many fear\n\teffects start by making the creature Shaken.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Psychic Disciplines Abomination The spell options are bad and the features are mediocre.
