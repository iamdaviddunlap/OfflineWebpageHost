They replace or modify one or more Paladin class features, and provide alternate features in much the same way as an archetype. As described in the Oathbound Paladin Archetype, these Oaths are made as a sacred pact with the Paladin&#8217;s god or temple, and can be abandoned once their oath has been fulfilled. It stands to reason that the Paladin could also take new Oaths beyond character creation if it makes sense in the context of the campaign.

Otherwise, it is totally useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Purity<\/span> (Su): Very situational\n\tnormally, but if you have this oath it can be assumed that you are fighting an\n\tunusually large number of abberations.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleansing Flame<\/span> (Sp): The ability to smite\n\tevil is more effective than a small bonus to saves and attacks, especially if\n\tyour party relies more on attacks than spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cast into the Void<\/span> (Su): Basically Holy\n\tChampion for Abberations instead of evil outsiders.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Several interesting options, but\n\tnone of them are particularly useful.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">true strike<\/span>: Very hard to justify\n\t\tusing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">acute senses<\/span>: The bonus is nice, but the\n\t\tshort duration makes this hard to use. Useful for finding hidden objects\n\t\tlike secret doors.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">touch of idiocy<\/span>: This can be a good way\n\t\tto weaken the DCs of enemies spells and special abilities, and doesn&#8217;t allow\n\t\ta save, but the 1d6 penalties can be unreliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">spell immunity<\/span>: Very powerful if you\n\t\tknow what spells your enemies like to use, but predicting the spells of\n\t\trandom enemies is very difficult.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Aura of Courage, Aura of Justice, Holy Champion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Charity, Chastity, Fiends, Loyalty<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-against-fiends\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-against-fiends\">Oath Against Fiends<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite an excellent spell list, Oath Against Fiends is hard to justify even when you expect to face evil outsiders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Anchoring Aura<\/span> (Su): The aura version is\n\trarely useful. For it to make sense, you need to be fighting several enemies\n\twho are actively teleporting throughout the fight. Expending a use of Smite\n\tEvil to use Dimensional Anchor is excellent, especially considering how early\n\tyou get this ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Holy Vessel<\/span> (Su): The ability to augment your\n\tarmor and shield at the same time as your weapon is conceptually great, but in\n\treality it&#8217;s a waste of your limited enhancement bonus. Enchanting armor costs\n\thalf as much as weapons, so you&#8217;re already losing half of the value, and the\n\tlist of abilities is pathetic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Several interesting\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">resist energy<\/span>: Always handy, and you get\n\t\tit a level early.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">detect thoughts<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">invisibility purge<\/span>: The Paladin has very\n\t\tfew options for finding invisible creatures, and this is good to have at\n\t\thigh level when many enemies have access to invisibility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">plane shift<\/span>: Excellent to chase enemies\n\t\tinto their home planes or to send them somewhere unpleasant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Mercy (9th), Aura of Resolve<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Charity, Corruption, Savagery, Vengeance, Wyrm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-against-savagery\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-against-savagery\">Oath Against Savagery<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your campaign features frequent large groups of evil enemies, Oath Against\n\tSavagery makes the Paladin much better at handling mobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Reach<\/span> (Su): Reach is fantastic, but\n\tDivine Grace is one of the Paladin&#8217;s best abilities, and spending Smite Evil\n\tattempts to improve your reach is very expensive. This makes the most sense\n\twhen facing groups of enemies, while Smite Evil is typically best used for\n\tsingle opponents.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hordebreaker<\/span> (Su): The extra damage is nice,\n\tbut the improvement to Holy Reach is the real draw. This effectively makes\n\tHoly Reach an on\/off button for when you need to be an area control\n\tdefender.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Some absolutely fantastic buffs\n\twhich aren&#8217;t usually available to Paladins.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">deathwatch<\/span>: Ocasionally useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">protection from arrows<\/span>: With and\n\t\thours\/level duration, you should be running this every day. Being felled by\n\t\tpacks of archers is a serious problem when you expect to be fighting groups\n\t\tof enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">haste<\/span>: One of the best buffs in the\n\t\tgame.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">divine power<\/span>: Doesn&#8217;t stack with haste,\n\t\tbut the bonuses are fantastic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Divine Grace, Aura of Justice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Charity, Fiends, Loyalty, Wyrm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-against-undeath\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-against-undeath\">Oath Against Undeath<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t think of a single non-evil undead. 3.5 had one or two in the Book of Exalted Deeds, but I chose to ignore them because they were ridiculous. Oath Against Undeath gives the Paladin some abilities to fight undead and protect himself from the abilities of Undead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Undead<\/span> (Su): Detect Evil is\n\tconsiderably more versatile, and Detect Evil will detect undead, though it\n\twon&#8217;t tell you if the creature is undead if you don&#8217;t know already.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghost Touch Aura<\/span> (Su): Incorporeal creatures\n\tare a pain to fight, and paying for Ghost Touch is an expensive investment\n\twhich rarely pays off. Getting it for free will make you much less likely to\n\tdie to incorporeal creatures.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Life<\/span> (Su): Charms spells are\n\tuncommon and gentle, but negative levels can outright kill you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Superior Channeler<\/span> (Su): Channel Energy is\n\thardly the best way for the Paladin to destroy the undead, but their uses per\n\tday scale as they level, which can mean that the Paladin has a big pile of AOE\n\tpositive energy damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Darkvision is the only good\n\toption, though Darkvision is pretty fantastic.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">sanctify corpse<\/span>: Just take the body to a\n\t\tCleric.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">darkvision<\/span>: Fantastic on every\n\t\tcharacter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">searing light<\/span>: Lousy damage ray. Slightly\n\t\tless terrible against undead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">halt undead<\/span>: You should not be hiding, you\n\t\tshould be smiting!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Detect Evil, Mercy (3rd, 9th), Aura of Resolve, Aura of Justice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Charity, Wyrm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-against-the-wyrm\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-against-the-wyrm\">Oath Against the Wyrm<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you fight a lot of dragons, this is fantastic. If you fight a lot of anything else, you are going to have problems. The spell list includes some fantastic buffs, but the abilities are almost entirely exclusive to fighting dragons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Breath Evasion<\/span> (Su): If you&#8217;re fighting a\n\tlot of dragons this is fantastic, but otherwise its useless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Bond<\/span> (Sp): Fantastic against\n\tDragons, and the Mount version makes your Mount fearless, which is nice when a\n\tDragon shows up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon-Slaying Strike<\/span> (Su): This turns\n\tevery hit into a save or die for Dragons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Several fantastic buffs that\n\thave nothing to do with dragons.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">enlarge person<\/span>: Fantastic on any melee\n\t\tcharacter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">bear&#8217;s endurance<\/span>: The least useful\n\t\tability score enhancement spell because you can fall over dead when the\n\t\tduration ends.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">fly<\/span>: Fantastic on any character.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">stoneskin<\/span>: Fantastic buff, but the\n\t\tmaterial component is too expensive to cast daily.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Channel Positive Energy, Divine Bond, Holy Champion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Chastity, Fiends, Loyalty, Savagery, Undeath<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-against-charity\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-of-charity\">Oath of Charity<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Oath of Charity is a great flavor for a Paladin, and can help the Paladin to step up as the party&#8217;s primary healer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Charitable Hands<\/span> (Su): Using Lay on Hands\n\ton yourself is a Swift action, so you can afford to do it more frequently to\n\tcompensate for the lost healing. The additional healing to allies can really\n\thelp compensate if your party doesn&#8217;t include a primary healer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Charitable Mercy<\/span> (Su): Divine Bond is an\n\tunfortunate loss, but this adds a lot of versatility to Lay on Hands. The\n\tability to constantly retrain also means that you can have more high level\n\tmercies than normally possible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"prange\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Magic Vestment will save you a\n\tfortune, but the other spells are useless.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">magic stone<\/span>: Very poor damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">make whole<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">magic vestment<\/span>: With hours\/level duration,\n\t\tthis can save you a fortune on enhancing your armor and shield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">imbue with spell ability<\/span>: Your spellcasting\n\t\tis very limited already, so you don&#8217;t have enough to justify sharing it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Lay on Hands, Divine Bond<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Chastity, Corruption, Fiends, Loyalty, Savagery, Undeath, Vengeance<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-of-chastity\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-of-chastity\">Oath of Chastity<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You simply don&#8217;t get enough from Oath of Chastity to give up Divine Grace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Pure of Mind<\/span> (Su): Losing Divine Grace really\n\thurts. You still get the bonus to Will saving throws, but the bonuses against\n\tCharm and Figments are nearly useless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Pure of Body<\/span> (Su): You already get a bonus\n\tagainst Charm effects, and 50% immunity to critical hits is quite a lot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Nothing that you really need,\n\tbut some nice buffs at higher levels.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">remove fear<\/span>: You are immune to fear and\n\t\trpovide your allies with a bonus against it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">confess<\/span>: This seems sort of torturey for\n\t\ta Paladin. I&#8217;m not sure I would be comfortable with a Paladin using\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">heroism<\/span>: Great buff for yourself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">freedom of movement<\/span>: Great buff, but\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Divine Grace, Aura of Resolve<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Charity, Corruption, Vengeance, Wyrm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-of-loyalty\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-of-loyalty\">Oath of Loyalty<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Garbage. Totaly garbage. The signature ability, Loyalty Oath, would be nice if you could use it more than 3 times per day at very high level, and you have two bad options to end the effect prematurely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Loyal Oath<\/span> (Su): This is a really cool\n\tbodyguard ability, but it&#8217;s not very exciting, and it won&#8217;t win fights. Ending\n\tthe ability when someone eventually gets past the bonus totally defeats the\n\tpurpose of the ability because the bonus goes away.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Loyal Guardian<\/span> (Su): That&#8217;s nice of you to\n\ttake the hit instead of your friend, but ending the buff is probably worse\n\tthan just letting them take the hit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oath Spells<\/span>: A couple of decent buffs, but\n\ta Cleric or a Bar will provide better bonuses of the same type.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">wrath<\/span>: Decent buff, and it scales well as\n\t\tyou level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">aid<\/span>: Decent buff to use on yourself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">helping hand<\/span>: very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">sending<\/span>: Way too high level for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Smite Evil, Aura of Resolve<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Charity, Corruption, Savagery, Undeath, Vengeance, Wyrm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"oath-of-vengeance\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/paladin.html#oath-of-vengeance\">Oath of Vengeance<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like Smite Evil? Do you want to smite all of the evil forever? Take Oath of Vengeance, stop healing your friends, and start smiting things more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Wrath<\/span> (Su): If your party already\n\thas enough healing available that you don&#8217;t need to help out, this is a great\n\tway to continue fueling your Smite Evil throughout the day, especially at\n\tearly levels when you only have a handful of Smite Evil attempts. It&#8217;s also\n\tnotably the only way to get additional uses of Smite Evil beyond what you get\n\tfrom your normal level progression.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Powerful Justice<\/span> (Su): Giving up the\n\tadditional bonus to attack and the ability to bypass DR is annoying, but your\n\tallies should be able to hit and damage things without your help. The bonus\n\tdamage is still nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Oath Spells<\/span>: A couple of decent buffs and\n\tcouple of crappy damage spells.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">wrath<\/span>: Decent buff, and it scales well\n\t\tas you level, but it only applies against one creature, and it&#8217;s a common\n\t\tbonus type.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">confess<\/span>: This seems sort of torturey for\n\t\ta Paladin. I&#8217;m not sure I would be comfortable with a Paladin using\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">blessing of fervor<\/span>: Arguably better than\n\t\tHaste because it allows your allies to do so much more than just hit things\n\t\tfaster, <em>and<\/em> you get it a spell level early.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">order&#8217;s wrath<\/span>: Your DC will be awful, and\n\t\tthe damage is pitiful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Channel Positive Energy, Aura of Justice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Oaths: Charity, Chastity, Fiends, Loyalty<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Paladin Oaths are almost archetypes by themselves.
