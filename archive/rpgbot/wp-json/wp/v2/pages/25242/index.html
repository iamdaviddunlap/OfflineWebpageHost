With a broad and diverse spell list, the Wizard can solve nearly any problem magically. The Wizard has been my favorite class since 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons. Powerful, versatile, and thematically interesting, the Wizard goes out into the world to test their wits and their knowledge against whatever challenge the multiverse has to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, your role is defined by the spells you employ. You can serve as a Blaster with area damage spells like fireball, a Defender by summoning creatures to stand between your party and your enemies, a Face by enchanting other creatures, a Scholar with your vast Intelligence and ample skills, a Scout with divination spells and stealth options like Invisibility, a Striker with single-target spells like Disintegrate and Power Word Kill, a Support caster with a wide range of buffs, debuffs, and area control spells, and a Utility caster with access to all manner of spells for solving the world&#8217;s mundane problems with magic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In truth, there is very little that the Wizard can&#8217;t do, and while it&#8217;s not the uber-class that it was in previous editions, the Wizard is still a profoundly capable and versatile class. However, with great versatility comes great complexity. Playing a wizard involves a lot of planning, tracking, and management. You can keep the class simple by focusing on damage spells and solving your problems by blowing them up, but many wizards will have a large suite of specialized tools and will need to choose from a long list of options to employ in any given situation. If you&#8217;re afraid of &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221;, consider other class options like the Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Also see our supporting articles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-wizard\/ancestries-and-heritages\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26445\">Wizard Ancestries and Heritages Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-wizard\/arcane-schools\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26500\">Wizard Arcane Schools Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-wizard\/arcane-thesis\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26585\">Wizard Arcane Thesis Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/remastered-wizard\/wizard-feats\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"25243\">Wizard Feats Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/familiars-remastered\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31305\">Familiars and Pets Guide<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/remastered-arcane-spell-list\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"26525\">Arcane Spell List Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Remaster Changes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#attributes\">Wizard Attributes<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#standard-wizard\">Standard Wizard<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#polymorph-enthusiast\">Polymorph Enthusiast<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Wizard Ancestries and Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Wizard Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Wizard Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#varying-skill-feats\">Varying Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Wizard Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Wizard Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Wizard Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclass-archetype\">Wizard Multiclass Archetype<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Remaster Changes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arcane Schools have changed significantly. The remastered rules removed the concept of schools of magic, so schools are now organized around concepts rather than the 7 schools of magic that have existed in DnD for decades. Wizards choosing a school still get an extra spell slot, but rather than choosing from your school of magic, you prepare spells from a pre-determined list of school spells.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Intelligence. Like any spellcaster it&#8217;s used for your Spell Attacks and for your Spell DCs. Those are two of your most important stats, so keep your Intelligence as high as you can get it. Intelligence also grants you additional Trained skills at 1st level, allowing you to easily invest in numerous skills, including Lore options which other classes often need to ignore in favor of more important skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: 6+ hp is not a lot, and with\n\thorrible AC you&#8217;re extremely vulnerable.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Wizard&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are terrible. Your high Intelligence will give you an abundance\n\tof Trained skills, but that&#8217;s the height of the Wizard&#8217;s proficiencies in\n\tanything except spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: 6+Con hit points. Fortunately, you\n\thave plenty of room to boost your ability scores so your Constitution bonus\n\tcan compensate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Wizard&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are terrible. Your high Intelligence will give you an abundance\n\tof Trained skills, but that&#8217;s the height of the Wizard&#8217;s proficiencies in\n\tanything except spellcasting.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Trained at 1st level, and it\n\t\tmaxes out at Expert at 11th level. Expect to rely on allies for Perception\n\t\tchecks, and strongly consider Incredible Initiative if you don&#8217;t want to go\n\t\tlate in the turn order in every fight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Only one good saving throw.\n\t\tWill is a great option, but only one good saving throw is still a serious\n\t\thandicap, and it never improves past Master. Your other saving throws will\n\t\talso increase to expert, but no further. You can take the Canny Acumen feat,\n\t\tbut that won&#8217;t get you past Expert until 17th level, so you&#8217;ll spend most of\n\t\tyour career with absolutely dismal saving throws compared to your\n\t\tallies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Arcana, plus 2+int Trained skills\n\t\tat 1st level, for a total of 3+. That&#8217;s standard, and with 18 Intelligence\n\t\tat 1st level you&#8217;ll have plenty of trained skills. You should get more than\n\t\tanyone except the Alchemist and the Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Attacks<\/span>: Simple weapons and unarmed strikes. A\n\t\tdagger is your best weapon option. Don&#8217;t expect to use any weapon except in\n\t\tthe most unusual circumstances.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: No armor proficiencies, and your\n\t\tproficiency in Unarmored Defense never increases past Expert. Expect to rely\n\t\ton spells like Mystic Armor, and be sure that you have nice sturdy friends to\n\t\thide behind. The Wizard&#8217;s saves are also terrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spells<\/strong>: Standard progression for full spellcasters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Wizard Spellcasting<\/span>: The Wizard is a\n\tprepared Arcana spellcaster, preparing spells from their spellbook each day\n\tduring Daily Preparations. You add two spells to your spellbook for free every\n\tlevel, but you can also collect more from other sources.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <strong>Arcane Thesis<\/strong>: See our\n\t<a href=\"\">Wizard Arcane Theses Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <strong>Arcane School<\/strong>: See our <a href=\"\">Wizard Arcane Schools Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Bond<\/span>: Allows you to re-cast one prepared spell each day, potentially giving you an additional spell at your highest spell rank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards who select the School of Universal Magical Theory modify the benefits of the Drain Bonded Item action, allowing them to use it once per Spell Rank instead of just once per day. This is obviously great, but does come at the cost of a free Spell Slot per Spell Rank to prepare school spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attributes\">Wizard Attributes<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"standard-wizard\">Standard Wizard<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Intelligence and defenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: AC and Reflex saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Your Key Ability Score.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Will saves, Perception, some\n\tskills.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Probably a second dump stat.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"polymorph-enthusiast\">Polymorph Enthusiast<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The additional need for Strength causes some trouble, so you&#8217;ll need to balance your needs for 5 attributes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: With decent Strength and Handwraps of\n\tMighty Blows you can exceed the attack bonus provided by your polymorph forms,\n\tespecially if you&#8217;re not using your highest-level spell slots to cast them.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Helpful, but you&#8217;ll rely on the AC\n\tprovided by your spells much of the time so you may not need to invest\n\theavily.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Your Key Ability Score.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Will saves, Perception, some\n\tskills.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Wizard Ancestries and Heritages<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your highest priority is an Intelligence Boost.
