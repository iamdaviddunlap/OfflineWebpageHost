The inherent unpredictability of Wild Magic makes the subclass unreliable. Wild Magic Sorcery is also the only Sorcerer subclass in the 2024 PHB that does not have a spell list giving you additional prepared spells. Instead, you get Wild Magic. This is not a fair trade, and lacking the versatility provided by 10 additional prepared spells is a huge limitation compared to any other subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Wild Magic table will feature heavily in your experience playing a Wild Magic Sorcerer. Using Tides of Chaos consistently in order to force surges means that you can roll on the table multiple times per day, which is often a good choice because the vast majority of effects are benign. Not necessarily beneficial, but at worst harmless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the 2024 Wild Magic Sorcery Sorcerer.

You don&#8217;t get 20 spell slots until\n\t\tyou&#8217;re level 19, which means that you&#8217;re likely to go days at a time without\n\t\ttriggering Wild Magic this way even if you try your hardest to do so. Instead, expect to trigger surges by using Tides of Chaos.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The effects of Wild Magic are mostly benign, but there are a few options\n\t\t\tlike Polymorphing yourself into a goat or casting Fireball on your party.\n\t\t\tBut, since those options are in the minority, Wild Magic is usually\n\t\t\tsafe and frequently helpful, though the unpredictable effects mean that\n\t\t\tyou can&#8217;t count on it to be consistently useful.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tides of Chaos<\/span>: Use this on any ability\n\t\tcheck or saving throw where the outcome matters more than a handful of hit\n\t\tpoints. Easy Advantage that you can recharge this easily is incredibly\n\t\tpowerful.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you&#8217;re not expecting many fights on any given day, you can use level 1\n\t\t\tspell slots to easily recharge this, then inexpensively replenish the\n\t\t\tslots with Font of Magic. This can be fantastic for social situations and\n\t\t\tfor exploration, though Enhance Ability will be less expensive for\n\t\t\tnumerous ability checks of the same type in quick succession.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bend Luck<\/span>: When your allies fail a save\n\t\tagainst death by 1 or two, it&#8217;s heart-breaking. Spend the Sorcery Points and\n\t\tbe everyone&#8217;s best friend. 2 Sorcery Points is expensive, but your allies&#8217;\n\t\tlives are worth it.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Conversely, if an enemy narrowly passes a save against a level 1+,\n\t\t\tspending 2 Sorcery Points to turn that into a failure is absolutely worth\n\t\t\tthe cost. 2 Sorcery Points could get you a level 1 spell slot, but it will\n\t\t\tnever recover the Action you spent to cast a spell unsuccessfully.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Controlled Chaos<\/span>: This considerably\n\t\treduces the threat of the Wild Magic table and makes it more of a source of\n\t\tunpredictable buffs and comic relief.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tamed Surge<\/span>: Many of the Wild Magic\n\t\teffects can be very beneficial if you can predict when they&#8217;ll occur. For\n\t\texample: Misty Step behind your enemies, make all creatures within 30 feet\n\t\tvulnerable to Piercing damage, then Dash and fly to safety. Unfortunately,\n\t\tyou only get this once per Long Rest with no way to recharge it early.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/Sorcerer\/#backgrounds\" data-type=\"page\">other Sorcerers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"species\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Species<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/Sorcerer\/#species\" data-type=\"page\">other Sorcerers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/Sorcerer\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">other Sorcerers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/Sorcerer\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\">other Sorcerers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/Sorcerer\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\">other Sorcerers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/Sorcerer\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\">other Sorcerers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Wild Magic Sorcerer Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/Sorcerer\/#multiclassing\" data-type=\"page\">other Sorcerers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Wild Magic Sorcery Sorcerer Build &#8211; Wacky Chaos Fairy<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wild Magic is a powerful save-or-suck caster with the ability to give themselves Advantage on D20 Tests easily, but building yet another save-or-suck caster is boring, so we&#8217;re going to lean into the most chaotic options available.

Seeming lets you disguise your whole party as whoever you&#8217;re currently fighting.

The inherent unpredictability of Wild Magic makes the subclass unreliable. Wild Magic Sorcery is also the only Sorcerer subclass in the 2024 PHB that does not have a spell list giving you additional prepared spells. Instead, you get Wild Magic. This is not a fair trade, and lacking the versatility provided by 10 additional prepared spells is a huge limitation compared to any other subclass. The Wild Magic table will feature heavily in your experience playing a Wild Magic Sorcerer.
