The school boasts many of the most notable defensive spells including Shield, Absorb Elements, and Counterspell. The School of Abjuration Wizard gains additional features that provide enhanced protection and defense. This allows an Abjurer to be incredibly sturdy, even beyond the already above-average sturdiness of other optimized Wizards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Wizards are in fact quite sturdy when assembled correctly because of the interaction of <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dice-math-rpgbot-podcast-s2e92\/\">dice probability<\/a> and AC scaling in a system of bounded accuracy. There is quite a bit of math that is outside the scope of this article that breaks down the whole relationship, but the short version is that optimized full casters with an armor dip can wear a shield in one hand while casting spells with the other, have Shield and other spells ready when needed, and still contribute meaningfully to combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Optimized martials on the other hand need both hands dedicated to their weapon(s) of choice, leaving no room for a shield, and as non-casters, lack Shield and other defensive spells. The gap in hit dice matters less when the allegedly squishy casters are getting hit less often. And all of this is before we discuss the additional protective features of the School of Abjuration Wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Building an Abjurer Wizard is interesting in that the features are either passive defenses or boosts to specific reactive spells. This really leaves the core of what any particular Abjurer does quite open to personal choice. Contrast with <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/evoker\/\">Evokers<\/a>, for example, whose core feature is being better at blowing things up with magic and have features all about that or <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/necromancy\/\">Necromancers<\/a> who have features designed to <s>completely disrupt the play experience<\/s> command a small pile of undead minions. Abjurers simply have a magical force field that keeps them alive longer without being nudged towards any particular Wizarding ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With such freedom of style and sturdiness of body, we could be whatever we wanted. So that\u2019s why the example build below is not strictly an <em>Abjurer<\/em> build, but still makes decisions that benefit from the additional protections of <em>being<\/em> an Abjurer. We\u2019ll be making something tough that doesn\u2019t need to stand in the back but instead ignores those tired stereotypes of the frail wizard. That\u2019s right folks, you too can Krump Your Pointy Hat Pajama Man fallacies by bringing this thing to your next campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">School of Abjuration Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-abjuration-ability-scores\">School of Abjuration Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-abjuration-races\">School of Abjuration Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-abjuration-feats\">School of Abjuration Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-abjuration-weapons\">School of Abjuration Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-abjuration-armor\">School of Abjuration Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#school-of-abjuration-multiclassing\">School of Abjuration Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-school-of-abjuration-build-krump-your-pointy-hat-pajama-man\">Example School of Abjuration Build &#8211; Krump Your Pointy Hat Pajama Man<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#multiclassin-in-my-subclass-guide\">Multiclassin&#8217;?

Strangely, this feature incentivizes you to use your two free\n\t\tspells learned per level to learn literally anything except spells from your\n\t\tfavorite school.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Ward<\/span>: A great source of what\n\t\tessentially amounts to temporary hit points, but since they aren&#8217;t\n\t\ttechnically temporary hit points the two effects stack. The Ward itself begins at full HP the first time you cast an Abjuration spell each day, even if all you do is spend eleven minutes to Ritual cast Alarm on nothing important. It then lasts until you finish your next Long Rest.\n\t\t<p>Since the ward can take damage in your place, you may even be able to avoid saves to maintain Concentration when you take damage. This additional overshield is a resource and resources are meant to be spent, but don\u2019t be reckless and overextend. Be sure to take all the normal defensive precautions and the Ward will help mitigate when the dice just don\u2019t go in your favor.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to charge the ward, consider the\n\t\t\tEldritch Initiate feat to get Armor of Shadows. Armor of Shadows allows\n\t\t\tyou to cast Mage Armor on yourself at will, allowing you to fully charge\n\t\t\tthe ward whenever you have a few minutes to repeatedly cast Mage Armor in\n\t\t\torder to charge it.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Projected Ward<\/span>: Your party&#8217;s Defender\n\t\tlikely takes a lot more damage than you, so soaking some of it with your\n\t\tward can really cut down on how many resources your party must devote to\n\t\thealing. Just be aware that you\u2019ll be unable to cast Shield, Absorb Elements, and Counterspell in response to future triggering events should you block some damage to an ally.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Abjuration<\/span>: Situational by\n\t\tdesign, but very powerful in games which feature enemy spellcasters.\n\t\tCounterspell is an off-switch for those enemy spellcasters. Adding your\n\t\tproficiency bonus dramatically improves its effectiveness, making you able\n\t\tto easily prevent enemy spellcasters from doing anything at all without the\n\t\tneed to burn your highest-level spell slots. If you can also cast Enhance\n\t\tAbility (Intelligence) on yourself before walking into a fight with enemy\n\t\tspellcasters, you can counter spells with very little risk of failure.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Resistance<\/span>: Resistance to spells is\n\t\tgreat for resisting dangerous save or suck spells, and resistance to spell\n\t\tdamage makes you greatly resistant to direct damage spells which typically\n\t\tdon&#8217;t require saves (Eldritch Blast, Fire Bolt, etc.). Both halves of the\n\t\tfeature apply at the same time, so against spells which allow you to save\n\t\tfor reduced damage (Fireball, etc.), this is extremely effective because on\n\t\ta successful save you&#8217;ll often take just a quarter of the game. However,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re expected to counter spells rather than try to resist them, so this is\n\t\tmostly a redundant defense for when you&#8217;re outnumbered or surprised.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-abjuration-ability-scores\">School of Abjuration Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Not different from the advice in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#ability-scores\">Wizard handbook<\/a>.

Additionally, having access to Armor of Agathys allows for a fun interaction: If you get hit but the Arcane Ward absorbs all of the damage, the cold damage of Agathys still affects the creature that hit you without using up any of the temporary hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Svirfneblin<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a><\/sup>: There is one neat trick with Deep Gnomes and that is access to the Svirfneblin Magic feat. This feat allows the Deep Gnome to self-cast Nondetection at will with no material components. Normally this doesn\u2019t mean anything, but as Nondetection is a 3rd-level Abjuration spell, every cast would refill 6 hit points to the Arcane Ward. Compared to any other race spending a feat on Eldritch Adept for Armor of Shadows at-will Mage Armor spam, the minute difference in out of combat time to refill the ward from zero to the potential maximum is negligible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"school-of-abjuration-feats\">School of Abjuration Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>For anything not mentioned here you can follow the advice found in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/#feats\">Wizard Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Eldritch Adept<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Getting this to use Armor of Shadows to refill the ward between fights can be incredibly useful, especially if you\u2019re not armor dipping.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resilient (Constitution)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: No need for Con saves, my Arcane Ward will protect my Concentration.

Let me put it this way, half round up on a d6 is 4. Half round up on a d10 is 6. Arcane Ward is twice your Wizard level. Arcane Ward is like having the same hit points as a Fighter. With an Artificer dip you suddenly also have better AC than the Fighter and full spellcasting too. Take this at first level for that all-important Constitution save proficiency.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cleric<\/span>: This can do the same Armor things as the Artificer dip, but needs 13 Wisdom and lacks the free Constitution proficiency. For your trouble and investment you could choose the Order Domain if you\u2019re looking to add a bit of offensive support, or you could choose the Peace Domain (I\u2019m not apologizing for suggesting a broken good option, Tyler.), for even more defensive support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-school-of-abjuration-build-krump-your-pointy-hat-pajama-man\">Example School of Abjuration Build &#8211; Krump Your Pointy Hat Pajama Man<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>The beauty of a magic spell is not the threads that go into it.

Because the features we do get are more passive defenses or enhancements to spells like Counterspell that are cast as reactions, what we actually do on our turns is entirely up to personal choice. To that end, I am making build choices that synergize with our features, but doing my own thing in terms of offensive spell choice. Those build choices include starting with Artificer 1 before taking 19 levels in Wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassin-in-my-subclass-guide\">Multiclassin&#8217;?

I know I\u2019ve been going on about Summon spells for much of this build, which is really just a self-indulgent preference.

A is a constant that differs for each summon. X is the level of the spell. Each of the spells both adds the level of the spell to the damage of each hit and gains multiattack equal to half the spell level round down.<br><br>A good all-rounder summon like the Beholderkin from Summon Aberration does a respectable 27 DPR for an hour a day cast this way. If we were being lazy and only casting Firebolt alongside the Beholderkin, our total is 38.55.
