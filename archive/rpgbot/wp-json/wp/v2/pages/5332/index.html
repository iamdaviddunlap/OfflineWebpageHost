Most bloodlines have a bad choice of bonus feats, but you only get three of them so don&#8217;t place too much weight on the bonus feat list. Also keep in mind that you get your bonus spells several levels after you begin learning spells of that level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Also included below are the Wildblooded versions of bloodlines.

Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bloodlines\">Bloodlines<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Aberrant<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aberant bloodline gives you a diverse set of bonus spells, and some\n\trather odd bloodlines powers. The powers are largely centered around\n\tpolymorphing, but the only polymorph bonus spell you get is Shapechange at\n\t19th level. Still, everything provided by the bloodline is fairly solid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skill<\/span>: Knowledge (Dungeoneering) is\n\tone of the better knowledge skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: You get a fairly decent\n\tselection which covers a variety of schools and situations.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">enlarge person<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">see invisibility<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">tongues<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">black tentacles<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">feeblemind<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">veil<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">plane shift<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mind blank<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shapechange<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Nothing really great here\n\texcept for Improved Initiative. Improved Grapple may be a good option if you\n\tplan to polymorph into something that grapples.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Casting<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Disarm<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Grapple<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Unarmed Strike<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Will<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silent Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [dungeoneering])<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Polymorph spells\n\ttypically have fairly short durations, and Extend Spell can get you a lot of\n\tmileage. This largely removes the need for Extend Spell, which is pretty\n\tnice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Acidic Ray<\/span> (Sp): A solid combat option at\n\tlow levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Long Limbs<\/span> (Ex): You probably shouldn&#8217;t be\n\tmaking a whole lot of melee touch attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unusual Anatomy<\/span> (Ex): This is a pretty cool\n\tability, and you don&#8217;t loose it when you polymorph. It&#8217;s effectively the\n\tFortification armor property, which can make melee much less scary for you\/<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alien Resistance<\/span> (Su): Really solid spell\n\tresistance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aberrant Form<\/span> (Ex): This makes you really\n\ttanky in melee, which makes polymorphing a really great option for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Warped<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Only about half of the\n\tabilities on the table are good, and you definitely can&#8217;t depend on this\n\tability to give you something useful in your current situation. You give up\n\tthe extended Polymorph spell duration, which hurts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warp Touch<\/span> (Sp): Dazed is a good condition,\n\tand the DC for this ability scales as you level to remain useful. If you don&#8217;t\n\thave a good spell to use, this is an excellent way to lock down a target for a\n\tturn. I would take this over Acidic Ray any day of the week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Abyssal<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Abyssal bloodline is another polymorph bloodline. Your spells are, with a few exceptions, largely centered about buffing yourself to go into melee. This is a very dangerous place for a Sorcerer to be, and your bloodline powers don&#8217;t really give you anything useful to protect yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skill<\/span>: Knowledge (Planes) is okay,\n\tbut generally situational. Identifying outsiders can be really nice, but it&#8217;s\n\ta very small subset of all of the monsters in the game until high level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Your spells are mostly buff\n\tspells,but you get some really good ones. Cause Fear is garbage, but\n\teverything else can make a huge difference in a fight. Unholy Aura is a really\n\tfantastic cleric spell, and it gives you and your allies some really fantastic\n\tdefensive effects.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">cause fear<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">bull&#8217;s strength<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">rage<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">stoneskin<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">dismissal<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">transformation<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">greater teleport<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">unholy aura<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">summon monster IX<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: This looks more like a list\n\tof Fighter bonus feats.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Augment Summoning<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cleave<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Empower Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Bull Rush<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Sunder<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Attack<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [planes])<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: DR for your summoned\n\tcreature is pretty good, and with the exception of evil-aligned outsiders,\n\tthere are very few things with the ability to bypass DR\/good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Claws<\/span> (Su): If you are close enough to use\n\tclaws, you should either be running or polymorphed into something which\n\talready has some.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Demon Resistances<\/span> (Ex): Electricity damage\n\tisn&#8217;t super common, and neither is poison.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Strength of the Abyss<\/span> (Ex): Inherent\n\tbonuses are generally reserved for effects like Wish, which makes this pretty\n\tgreat. But you&#8217;re a Sorcerer, so you&#8217;re really only going to get mileage out\n\tof this while polymorphed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Added Summonings<\/span> (Su): Effectively doubles\n\tthe usefulness of your high level summon spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Demonic Might<\/span> (Su): Resistance to every\n\tenergy type except sonic, and free telepathy. It won&#8217;t win you any fights, but\n\tit&#8217;s pretty cool to have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Wildblooded: Brutal<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: 2 extra damage per spell\n\twill stop matting by level 3 or 4.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wings of the Abyss<\/span> (Su): By the time you get\n\tthis ability, you can cast Fly. One level later, you can cast Overland\n\tFlight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Accursed<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a really fantastic bonus spell list, this bloodline is disappointing. The powers are nice, but considerably weaker than spells you have access to at the levels at which you receive abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skill<\/span>: Perception is one of the most\n\trolled skills in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Several fantastic debuffs and\n\tsave-or-suck effects.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">ray of enfeeblement<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">touch of idiocy<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">ray of exhaustion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">bestow curse<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">feeblemind<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">eyebite<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">insanity<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">dimensional lock<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">energy drain<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: None of these feats make any\n\tsense for the bloodline, and they&#8217;re not good for a Sorcerer in general.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alertness<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blind-Fight<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Casting<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deceitful<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defensive Combat Training<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Endurance<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mounted Combat<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: You can join a hag\n\tcoven.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Horrific Visage<\/span> (Su): As a standard action\n\tyou can make a target shaken. Shaken is a pretty good condition, but spending\n\ta standard action on it is hard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wretched Endurance<\/span> (Ex): Bonus to saving\n\tthrows against a nice list of effects.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dread Gaze<\/span> (Su): Staggered is a very\n\tpowerful status condition, and the DC on this ability is respectable. The\n\tduration will largely cripple a target for several rounds. However, at this\n\tlevel you also have a lot of spells which will outright kill the target.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dream Walking<\/span> (Sp): Haunt someone&#8217;s dreams.\n\tIf you can see them, and they&#8217;re asleep, and you don&#8217;t like them, you can\n\tprobably just kill them in their sleep.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fearsome Surviva;<\/span> (Su): The DR is nice, but\n\tthe spell resistance is pretty low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Aquatic<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So you want to play Aqua Man? Well this is the way to do it. You get to control water and even communicate with aquatic creatures telepathically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skill<\/span>: Just Polymorph into a fish.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: The bonus spells are\n\tcertainly very water-themed, but they&#8217;re not particularly great.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">hydraulic push<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">slipstream<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">aqueous orb<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">geyser<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">control water<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">beast shape IV<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">summon monster VII<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">seamantle<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">world wave<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Really nothing useful for\n\tyou.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Athletic<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brew Potion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defensive Combat Training<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dodge<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mobility<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Silent Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Swim)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Toughness<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: The bonus to caster\n\tlevel is nice, but water spells aren&#8217;t particularly impressive. The morale\n\tbonus to your summons isn&#8217;t going to get you a lot of mileage either unless\n\tyou like summoning sharks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dehydrating Touch<\/span> (Sp): Sickened is a decent\n\tcodition, but the nonlethal damage is terrible.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aquatic Adaptation<\/span> (Ex): The swim speed is\n\tnice, and you get some cold resistance and natural armor. The blindsense is\n\tsituational, but fairly nice if it comes up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aquatic Telepathy<\/span> (Su): If you can find a\n\tway to give your allies a swim speed, you get easy telepathy. The Suggestion\n\tability is situational unless you bring your own fish, but the Demand and\n\tGreater Planar Ally abilities are pretty nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raise the Deep<\/span> (Sp): This gives you a way\n\tto bring your blindsense into play.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deep One<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic resistences and\n\tcosntant blindsense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Seaborn<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Unless you move around\n\tin a flying hot tub, you&#8217;re going to have trouble finding a use for this. Note\n\tto self: build a Sorcerer who moves around in a flying hot tub.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Water Blast<\/span>: Trip and bull rush in one\n\teffect. It&#8217;s not going to see a lot of use at later levels, but it&#8217;s nice\n\tcrowd control at low levels. This is considerably better than dehydrating\n\ttouch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just want to be a really fantastic vanilla Sorcerer, the Arcane bloodline is how you do it. You lose the flavor of other bloodlines, but you get to be absolutely fantastic at metamagic, and your bonus spells fill a lot of functions which adventuring parties absolutely need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skill<\/span>: Pick any knowledge. You already\n\thave Arcana, so Dungeoneering or Religion are good options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: If you&#8217;re the only primary\n\tcast in the party, your bonus spells cover almost every utility spell your\n\tparty needs to get by in the world.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">identify<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">invisibility<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">dispel magic<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">dimension door<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">overland flight<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">true seeing<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">greater teleport<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">power word stun<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">wish<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Several solid options.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Casting<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Counterspell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Will<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Scribe Scroll<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [arcana])<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Focus<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Still Spell<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Great for any offensive\n\tspell, and makes metamagic much more useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Bond<\/span> (Su): Either a super awesome\n\tfamiliar or a free spell per day. You generally have a ton of spells per day\n\talready, but one more certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Metamagic Adept<\/span> (Ex): Increasing the\n\tcasting time of your spells when you use metamagic is a minor inconvenience,\n\tand this removes it a few times per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">New Arcana<\/span> (Ex): Learn an extra free spell.\n\tSorcerers&#8217; biggest limit is their lack of spells known, so any new known\n\tspells are welcome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">School Power<\/span> (Ex): +2 DC to your favorite\n\tsave or suck spells. Imagine adding a total of +4 to the DC of your\n\tenchantment spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Apotheosis<\/span> (Ex): At this level, most\n\tcharged based magic items will be fairly weak, with tbe esception of Staves.\n\tYou have to use quite a few spell slots to replace the charges used, but this\n\teffectively lets you expand your spell list to include anything in the\n\tstaff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wildblooded: Sage<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This turns Sorcerers on\n\ttheir head. You suddenly have a flood of skill ranks, but likely lose all of\n\tyour sorcerous charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Bolt<\/span>: Force damage is pretty great,\n\tbut you give up Arcane Bond, which is really fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Boreal<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This bloodline attempts to turn the Sorcerer into a semi-melee DPS, and fails horribly. The spells don&#8217;t work to buff the Sorcerer, the feats provide no options which a Sorcerer should consider (except possibly Toughness), and the bloodline powers are weak and easily replicated with spells available long before the Sorcerer gets the abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skill<\/span>: Survival isn&#8217;t a particularly\n\timport skill, and you don&#8217;t get tracking, which is the most important use for\n\tit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Half of the spells attempt\n\tto make you scary in melee combat, and the other half are damage spells. None\n\tof them are particularly good, and the two ideas are mutually exclusive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">enlarge person<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">rage<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">elemental aura (cold only)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">wall of ice<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">cone of cold<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">transformation<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">giant form I<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">polar ray<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">meteor swarm (dealing cold damage)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: The only decent option is\n\tToughness, which still isn&#8217;t great.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Strike<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Diehard<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Empower Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Endurance<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Exotic Weapon Proficiency<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Attack<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Intimidate)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Toughness<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Cold spells are decent,\n\tand include some utility and damage spells which will be harder to resist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cold Steel<\/span> (Sp): Unusable at first level,\n\twhich is where you most need your bloodline powers. Beyond that, it is still\n\tonly mediocre, and you can rarely justify doing this in combat instead of\n\tcasting a spell which would do considerably more damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Icewalker<\/span> (Ex): The resistance is nice,\n\tbut the rest is highly situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Snow Shroud<\/span> (Su): A decent defensive\n\tbuff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blizzard<\/span> (Sp): Good way to escape or to\n\tprevent enemies from flying.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Child of Ancient Winters<\/span> (Su): Nice\n\tresistences. You can give yourself immunity to fire witha spell, so the\n\tvulnerability is negligible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wildblooded: Rime-Blooded<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This adds a nice\n\tsingle-target crowd-control effect to your cold spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Freezing Bolt<\/span>: Like a tiny cold-damage\n\tfireball. Or you could just cast fireball. Snow Shroud is a decent defensive\n\tbuff, and giving it up for a lousy offensive option hurts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Celestial<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Celestial bloodline adds a little bit of support magic and healing to the Sorcerer. The bloodline powers flashy and cool to use, but not particularly powerful, and your feat choices are awful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skill<\/span>: Heal is a decent skill if you\n\thave the wisdom to back it up, and you hopefully put some points into wisdom\n\tto have good will saves. Your skill ranks are very limited, but you also don&#8217;t\n\thave a lot of healing options as a Sorcerer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Bless is a decent first level\n\tbuff, and unless you have other morale bonuses available, it never stops being\n\tuseful. Your higher level spells include some great buffs and ulitity spells,\n\tbut the damage spells are not particularly great.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">bless<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">resist energy<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">magic circle against evil<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">remove curse<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">flame strike<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">greater dispel magic<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">banishment<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">sunburst<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">gate<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: A lot of really awful choices,\n\tand no really good ones.

Since they&#8217;re typically a few CRs behind what you&#8217;re\n\tfighting, this can go a long way to keep them in the fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Heavenly Fire<\/span> (Sp): Offensively, this is\n\treally only nice because it doesn&#8217;t allow resistance of any sort. The really\n\texciting part is that it provides you with a healing ability. At first level\n\twith 20 charisma, you get to heal 8d4 points of damage in a day, likely more\n\tthan your cleric can do. It doesn&#8217;t scale much with level, but healing\n\tabilities for arcane casters are very hard to come by.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Celestial Resistances<\/span> (Ex): Two\n\tresistances is pretty nice, but resisting 5 points of damage likely won&#8217;t\n\tchange much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wings of Heaven<\/span> (Su): Or you could cast\n\tOverland Flight. This would be green if it was continuous, or at least had a\n\tbetter duration.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Conviction<\/span> (Su): Rerolls are fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ascension<\/span> (Su): The resistances are really\n\tgood, and you gain permanent flight, and a permanent Tongues effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wildblooded: Empyreal<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This is a great idea if\n\tyou want to become a mystic theurge as a Sorcerer. You don&#8217;t get all of the\n\tskill ranks from the Arcane\/Sage bloodline, but you get insanely high will\n\tsaves and you can build around a single spellcasting ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sacred Cistern<\/span> (Su): You give up Wings of\n\tHeaven, and now you can channel energy to heal people. Unless you continue to\n\tput resources into charisma, which is pointless with your new Bloodline\n\tArcana, you won&#8217;t get to do it very often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Deep Earth<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The spells are mediocre unless you&#8217;re underground and the feats are terrible in any case, but some of the bloodline powers are very powerful. If you&#8217;re underground for the duration of the campaign, this might shoot up to blue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skill<\/span>: Dungeoneering is one of the\n\tbetter knowledge skills, and allows you to identify a wide variety of very\n\tstrong enemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: The spell selection is\n\thighly situational, but is fairly good if you&#8217;re underground.

The duration isn&#8217;t great,\n\tbut it&#8217;s almost a free stoneskin once a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Destined<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad. Bad, bad&#8230; bad. All of the Destined bloodline&#8217;s abilities are bad (except Within Reach). The spells are bad. The feats are worse.

I would assume it&#8217;s\n\tonly during surprise rounds, which is terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">It Was Meant To Be<\/span> (Su): Rerolls are\n\tgreat, but what you get to reroll is a pretty short (and terrible) list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Within Reach<\/span> (Su): I hope you have good will\n\tsaves. It might save your life once per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Destiny Realized<\/span> (Su): You&#8217;re probably not\n\tgoing to be making a lot of attack rolls, but not needing to roll for spell\n\tpenetration is kind of nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Wildblooded: Karmic<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This is a nice appology\n\tfor failing your concentration check, but you really shouldn&#8217;t plan to fail\n\tyour concentration check.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Fate&#8217;s Retribution<\/span>: You should not be attack\n\tfrequently enough for this to be useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Djinni<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of the Djinni bloodline the spell list, which includes several spells which you would be insane not to take.

Good to have at low levels when your spell options are\n\tlimited.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Decent\n\tresistance to Electricity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Whirlwind<\/span> (Su): As the Air Elemental&#8217;s\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/monsters\/universalMonsterRules.html#_whirlwind\">Whirlwind<\/a>\n\tability.

At this point you have Plane Shift as a spell, and can cast it\n\t6+ times per day because you&#8217;re a Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Draconic<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Draconic bloodline&#8217;s feats and spells are both excellent, but the bloodline powers are lackluster. If you don&#8217;t plan to lean on your bloodline powers, this is a very solid option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skill<\/span>: Perception is the most rolled\n\tskill in the game, and your wisdom should be passable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Lots of really solid, useful\n\toptions.

And dragons already have claws.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dragon Resistances<\/span> (Ex): Some mild energy\n\tresistance a small boost to AC. Not bad, but not super exciting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Breath Weapon<\/span> (Su): This keeps pace with\n\tmost of your damage spells, but the uses per day are very limited, and you\n\thave to be fairly close to use it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings<\/span> (Su): Permanent flight is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power of Wyrms<\/span> (Su): The immunities are\n\tnice, but the 60 foot blindsense is absolutely fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Linnorm<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: You won&#8217;t need natural\n\tarmor often, but the bonus gets fairly large at mid and high levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Spit<\/span>: Trade in your lousy claws\n\tfor the generic energy bolt power.

The abilities, spells, and feats are all great for investigation and social interaction, but the bloodline offers almost nothing in the way of combat options. If you can lean on your allies and your other Sorcerer spells for combat, this bloodline allows you to serve as a diviner, a scout, and a face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skill<\/span>: Sense Motive is a helpful\n\tskill if you are the party&#8217;s face. Plan to spend traits to gain access to\n\tDiplomacy and\/or Intimidate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Sleep is marked orange\n\tbecause you don&#8217;t get it until your 3rd Sorcerer level, at which point it is\n\tdifficult to use due to the limited HD. The remaining spells are largely\n\tdivinations, some of which are usually reserved for clerics. While these\n\tspells are powerful when they are needed, they are situational.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">sleep<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">augury<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">deep slumber<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">divination<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">dream<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shadow walk<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">vision<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">moment of prescience<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">astral projection<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Most of the feat options give\n\tyou bonuses on conversation skills, which helps you to serve as the party&#8217;s\n\tFace.

You don&#8217;t\n\tneed to concentrate, which is nice, but it&#8217;s still a cantrip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Precognition<\/span> (Su): Initiative bonuses\n\tare excellent for spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dreamshaper<\/span> (Sp): This is a really cool\n\tability for gathering information from unwilling targets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eye of Somnus<\/span> (Sp): Arcane Eye is a\n\tfantastic scouting spell, and the added Symbol of Sleep effect makes it a\n\tremote-controlled bomb.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Solipsism<\/span> (Ex): This is fantastic for\n\tmobility and for defense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Wildblooded: Visionary<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Ring of Sustenance does\n\tbasically the same thing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Visions<\/span>: You can <em>cast<\/em> Divination by\n\tthe time you get this ability.

Good to have at low levels when your spell options are limited.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Decent\n\tresistance to Fire, which is the most common energy type in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Efreeti Form<\/span> (Su): You get to partially\n\treplicate giant form for a few rounds per day, but a Sorcerer generally\n\tdoesn&#8217;t get much from being giant and muscular.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Movement<\/span> (Su): At this level you\n\tshould be flying at 90 feet per round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power of the Efreet<\/span> (Su): Because it&#8217;s a\n\tspell-like ability, you don&#8217;t need to provide the 1500 gp diamond to cast\n\tLimited Wish. At this point you have Plane Shift as a spell, and can cast it\n\t6+ times per day because you&#8217;re a Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elemental damage is the blunt hammer of spellcasting. It&#8217;s inellegent, it&#8217;s not versatile, and it&#8217;s easily resisted and avoided. This bloodline combines elemantal blasting with polymorphing into an elemental. Neither of these are particularly great options, so this bloodline isn&#8217;t particularly great either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skill<\/span>: Knowledge (Planes) is okay,\n\tbut generally situational. Identifying outsiders can be really nice, but it&#8217;s\n\ta very small subset of all of the monsters in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: <\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">burning hands<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">scorching ray<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">protection from energy<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">elemental body I<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">elemental body II<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">elemental body III<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">elemental body IV<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">summon monster VIII (elementals only)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">elemental swarm<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Depending on what element you\n\tpick, your bonus feats can be picked to complement your favorite elemental\n\ttype.

Fly straight up on your next turn and drop a fireball\n\twhere you were standing.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Movement<\/span> (Su): You wither gain a\n\tcool new movement type, or you get really fast.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Body<\/span> (Su): Some nice resistences,\n\tbut you already get them from Elemental Body IV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wildblooded: Primal<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This limits your\n\tversatility, but it gives you quite a bit of extra damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elementalist Summoning<\/span> (Su): The elemental\n\tresistance is situational, but the bonus energy damage on attacks is pretty\n\tnice. Summon a horde of things with lots of low-damage attacks, and throw\n\tfists full of dice at your enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fey<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really fantastic Enchanter bloodline. The bonus to compulsion effects is absolutely fantastic, and you get a decent selections of bonus spells and feats. Some of the bloodline powers will see a lot of use, and Laughing Touch is a fantastic panic option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skill<\/span>: Identify animals and fey.\n\tHelpful if you don&#8217;t have a druid or ranger handy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: You get some good compulsions\n\teffects, and a couple of other useful spells.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">entangle<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">hideous laughter<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">deep slumber<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">poison<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">tree stride<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">mislead<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">phase door<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">irresistible dance<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">shapechange<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: A few decent options,\n\tespecially if you like to make ranged touch attacks into melee.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dodge<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mobility<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Point Blank Shot<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Precise Shot<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quicken Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [nature])<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Many of the best\n\tEnchantment spells are Compulsion spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Laughing Touch<\/span> (Sp): A good panic option,\n\tbut you&#8217;re not going to go waving this around in combat. Note the lack of\n\tsaving throw.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Woodland Stride<\/span> (Ex): I have literally never\n\tseen this come up in a campaign.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fleeting Glance<\/span> (Sp): Free Greater\n\tInvisibility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fey Magic<\/span> (Su): Failing to overcome spell\n\tresistance sucks, so this is a nice reroll. No limit on uses makes it\n\tparticularly effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul of the Fey<\/span> (Su): DR 10\/cold iron is\n\tnice, since most things don&#8217;t carry cold iron weapons. Fey and demons can\n\tstill hurt your normall with their natural attacks because they also have\n\tDR\/cold iron, but that doesn&#8217;t make this any less useful. Animals not\n\tattacking you is also mildly interesting. The bonus Shadow Walk is cute, but\n\tyou&#8217;ve been casting it for 8 levels at this point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Sylvan<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get one.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Companion<\/span> (Ex): Even with the -3\n\tpenalty, the animal companion is going to be much more useful than Laughing\n\tTouch.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fey Wings<\/span> (Su): This would be great if it\n\twas constant or if the duration was better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Infernal<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the Fey bloodline centers on compulsion, the Infernal bloodline centers on persuasion. You get a bonus to DCs of Charm spells, as well as several bonus Charm spells, and Diplomacy as a class skill. This is a talking man&#8217;s Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skill<\/span>: Your charisma is absurd, so why\n\tnot take Diplomacy?.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: You get a good selection of\n\toffensive and utility spells.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">protection from good<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">scorching ray<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">suggestion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">charm monster<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">dominate person<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">planar binding (devils and creatures with the fiendish template\n\t\t\tonly)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">greater teleport<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">power word stun<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">meteor swarm<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Your options are limited, and\n\tlargely terrible.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blind-Fight<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Combat Expertise<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deceitful<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Extend Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Disarm<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Will<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [planes])<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Penetration<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Charm spells aren&#8217;t\n\tnearly as good as Compulsion spells, but this fits the theme of the bloodline\n\tvery well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Corrupting Touch<\/span> (Sp): If you are going to\n\trisk a melee touch attack, it needs to be for something far more powerful than\n\tShaken.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infernal Resistances<\/span> (Ex): The resistances\n\tare nice, but situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hellfire<\/span> (Sp): Basically Flame Strike, but\n\tno divine damage and it inflicts Shaken.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">On Dark Wings<\/span> (Su): Permanent flight is\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Power of the Pit<\/span> (Su): The resistences are\n\tnice, and you get something like Darkvision, but you can see in color.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Pit-Touched<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re casting\n\tspells during conversation, this will not get a lot of use. What you give up\n\tisn&#8217;t much better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">: Give up a blast effect for permanent hit points and fortitude saves.\n\t\tInherent bonuses are hard to come by, so this is fantastic.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Maestro<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus feats seem to assume that you have Bard abilities, but the bloodline porvides only one bard ability. The spell list is really the only redeeming quality of this bloodline, and even that is only average.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skill<\/span>: Perform doesn&#8217;t really do\n\tanything unless you&#8217;re a bard. You get the bard&#8217;s Fascinate ability, but that\n\tis hardly enough to justify wasting 50% of your skill ranks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: The spell list includes some\n\treally nice enchantment effects, and ends with one of the best kill spells in\n\tthe game.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">ventriloquism<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">hideous laughter<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">suggestion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">shout<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">dominate person<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">mass suggestion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">power word blind<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">greater shout<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">wail of the banshee<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: <\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deceitful<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Spell Focus (enchantment)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lingering Performance<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Persuasive<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Perform)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Focus (enchantment)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spellsong<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Still Spell<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Interesting. Still Spell\n\tsuddenly gives you +1 to your caster level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Beguiling Voice<\/span> (Ex): The ability doesn&#8217;t\n\tlist a DC, so I assume that you use the daze DC of 10+charisma. At low levels\n\tthis is fantastic, but the complete lack of DC scaling means that it won&#8217;t\n\twork after a few levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fascinate<\/span> (Ex): This is a fun ability, but\n\tyou can just cast Hypnotism or Rainbow Pattern and get the same effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Perfect Voice<\/span> (Su): Or you could cast\n\ttongues.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspire<\/span> (Sp): Or you could just cast Great\n\tHeroism with your crazy number of spells per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Grand Maestro<\/span> (Su): Still Spell isn&#8217;t\n\tnearly as important as Silent Spell, but I guess it&#8217;s nice to get for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Marid<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the Djinni, but cold-themed and considerably worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skill<\/span>: Knowledge (Planes) is okay,\n\tbut generally situational. Identifying outsiders can be really nice, but it&#8217;s\n\ta very small subset of all of the monsters in the game until high level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Several situationally useful\n\tspells, and a couple of good spells at the high elvels.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">obscuring mist<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">see invisibility<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">gaseous form<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">wall of ice<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">persistent image<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">elemental body III<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">plane shift<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">polar ray<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">wish<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Improved Initiative is a\n\tgreat choice, but the other options are unimpressive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dodge<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Empower Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Power Attack<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [planes])<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Finesse<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Changing the energy type\n\tfor energy spells really helps the versatility of your spell list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Frost Ray<\/span> (Sp): Respectable, generic, and\n\treliable. Good to have at low levels when your spell options are limited.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Decent\n\tresistance to cold.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Water&#8217;s Fury<\/span> (Su): Mediocre damage, but\n\tblinds the target for 1d6 rounds unless they pass the reflex save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Movement<\/span> (Su): There are plenty\n\tof easy ways to get a swim speed, and you won&#8217;t need it very often.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power of the Marid<\/span> (Su): Because it&#8217;s a\n\tspell-like ability, you don&#8217;t need to provide the 1500 gp diamond to cast\n\tLimited Wish. At this point you have Plane Shift as a spell, and can cast it\n\t6+ times per day because you&#8217;re a Sorcerer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Protean<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an interesting bloodline which combines some miss chance effects with area control effects. With some clever application, you can hold enemies in place and stack several percentage miss chances on yourself as protection. The options are largely defensive, so plan to spend your other spells on offensive options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skill<\/span>: Planes is a mid-range\n\tknowledge skill. Identifying outsiders is very helpful at high levels when you\n\tface powerful demons, devils, and elementals.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Your low level options are\n\tpurely defensive, then you get a couple of offensive spells and Major\n\tCreation, then suddenly you&#8217;re expected to Polymorph. Polymorphing is\n\tsomething that you need to plan for during character creation, and it&#8217;s hard\n\tto introduce this late in the game.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">entropic shield<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">blur<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">gaseous form<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">confusion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">major creation<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">disintegrate<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">greater polymorph<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">polymorph any object<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shapechange<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Not a lot of great options.\n\tDefensive Combat Training is important if you plan to Polymorph a lot.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Agile Maneuvers<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defensive Combat Training<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enlarge Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Fortitude<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Great Fortitude<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Craft [any])<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Focus<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Toughness<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Having your spells\n\tdispelled isn&#8217;t going to be a common problem, but this is certainly good\n\tinsurance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protoplasm<\/span> (Sp): Entangle and deal a few\n\tpoints of damage. Tanglefoot bags are a solid item at any level, so this is\n\tpretty fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protean Resistances<\/span> (Ex): Small amount of\n\tresitance to acid, which is uncommon, and resitance against petrification,\n\twhich is uncommon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Reality Wrinkle<\/span> (Sp): 20% miss chance is\n\tnice, and it stacks with other miss chances, such as Blur and Displacement.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spatial Tear<\/span> (Sp): Combines of the best area\n\tcontrol spells with one of the best escape spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Avatar of Chaos<\/span> (Ex): The resistences are\n\tnice, but the effects are fairly uncommon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-red\">Wildblooded: Anarchic<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This sounds terrible. You\n\tmight hit yourself with Acid Splash, or you might Detect Magic yourself. Who\n\tknows?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wild Feedback<\/span>: Highly situational, not reat\n\tdamagt<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-none\">Rakshasa<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a weird infiltrator\/shapeshifter bloodline, but not a polymorph bloodline. You get some weird bonuses to conversation stuff and some divination spells, but none of the abilities really synergize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skill<\/span>: Why use disguise when you can\n\tlearn Disguise Self?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Some useful enchantment and\n\tdivination spells.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">charm person<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">invisibility<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">suggestion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">detect scrying<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">prying eyes<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">mass suggestion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">greater polymorph<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">mind blank<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">dominate monster<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: For some reason the feats list\n\timplies that you should be wearing light armor.

In the even that they do identify your spells, they are typically helpless\n\tto do anything about it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silver Tongue<\/span> (Su): A bonus to bluff\n\tseveral times per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mind Reader<\/span> (Sp): Read minds quickly a few\n\ttimes per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hide Aura<\/span> (Sp): Constant Nondetection is\n\tnice if you have enemies who are spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alter Self<\/span> (Sp): Well if they&#8217;re going to\n\tgive it to you for free, there is no reason to not use it. Alter Self into\n\tsomething small with a cool vision type or movement type.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Outsider<\/span> (Su): DR 10\/piercing is fairly\n\tnice, and you become immune to effects like Dominate Person. At this level\n\tthere are equivalent effects which affect outsiders, but this limits the way\n\tother spellcasters can hurt you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Serpentine<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This bloodline offers a lot of really cool, fun abilities, and many of them are very powerful. The spells are, surprisingly, the least useful pat of the bloodline. Polymorphing is a good option for this bloodline to make use of the Serpent&#8217;s Fang ability, and the bonus feats and class skill make you a viable face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skill<\/span>: Diplomacy is one of the best\n\tskills in the game, and you have the charisma to back it up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: You get several excellent\n\tsave-or-suck spells, as well as delay poison and the ability to summon\n\tdinosaurs.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">hypnotism<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">delay poison<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">summon monster III (reptiles only)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">poison<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">hold monster<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">mass suggestion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">summon monster VII (reptiles only)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">irresistible dance<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">dominate monster<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Some interesting feats for\n\tconversation skills, and and some weird feats which really don&#8217;t make sense of\n\ta Sorcerer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Casting<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Combat Reflexes<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deceitful<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deft Hands<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Persuasive<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silent Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Bluff)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stealthy<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This includes\n\tCharm\/Hold\/Dominate Person. Expanding the list of creatures which can be\n\taffected hugely improves the utility of those spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Serpent&#8217;s Fang<\/span> (Ex): You should never be\n\tin melee enough to use this ability. Because it&#8217;s a shape changing effect, you\n\tprobably can&#8217;t harvest poison from yourself. If you polymorph into something\n\twithout a bite attack, you can use this to add a bite attack, which is likely\n\tyour best way to use this ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Serpentfriend<\/span> (Ex): Speaking with snakes\n\tporbably won&#8217;t see a lot of use, but the familiar is pretty fantastic, even\n\twith the -2 level penalty. Plus, you can harvest poison from your familiar.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Snakeskin<\/span> (Ex): The natural armor is really\n\tnice, but the bonus against poison and on escape artist won&#8217;t see a lot of\n\tuse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Den of Vipers<\/span> (Sp): Swarms are brutal\n\tenemies, and adding constitution damage poison to them is just cruel.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Scaled Soul<\/span> (Su): Polymorphing into a snake\n\tis a decent option at this point since you have access to the snakes poison,\n\tbut the poison DC on your Serpent&#8217;s Fang poison is considerably higher than\n\twhat you would get from polymorphing. So polymorph into the biggest\n\tcosntrictor snake you can be, then use Serpent&#8217;s Fang to be a poisonous\n\tconstrictor. Of, and you&#8217;re immune to poison and paralysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wildblooded: Envenomed<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Miles worse than the\n\tdefault Bloodline Arcana.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">: The poison DC is fantastic, and it&#8217;s constitution damage, but you give up\n\t\ta familiar for it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the weak first level bloodline power, the Shadow bloodline has a lot to offer. The spells work well with the abilities, and the feats aren&#8217;t entirely awful. If you want to play a stealth Sorcerer, you can&#8217;t do much better than this. At high levels, you get some very powerful bonus spells and some truly impressive powers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Class Skill<\/span>: Sorcerers aren&#8217;t typically\n\tscouts, but I guess if anyone was going to be, it would be a Shadow\n\tSorcerer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: You start off slow, but the\n\tShadow spells effectively give you access to entire schools of magic in one\n\tspell. This offsets much of the Sorcerer&#8217;s lack of versatility.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">ray of enfeeblement<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">darkvision<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">deeper darkness<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">shadow conjuration<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">shadow evocation<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shadow walk<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">power word blind<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">greater shadow evocation<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">shades<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: You want Silent Spell.\n\tStaying hidden is highly dependant on not pronouncing your spell components\n\tout loud. The other feats aren&#8217;t terribly helpful unless you cross-class into\n\tRogue or something.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Acrobatic<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blind-Fight<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dodge<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Draw<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Silent Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skill Focus (Stealth)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stealthy<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Finesse<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: This should really help\n\twith your stealth, especially at high levels where you have Greater\n\tInvisibility and really need another bonus to stealth. Because +20 from\n\tinvisibility isn&#8217;t enough.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Shadowstrike<\/span> (Sp): A melee touch attack that\n\tdoes a tiny amount of nonlethal damage, and inflicts Dazzled. Dazzled is\n\tbasically the least useful status condition in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nighteye<\/span> (Ex): Darkvision is very important\n\tfor stealthy characters, and this can save you the trouble of casting\n\tDarkvision. Keep in mind that this will enhance existing darkvision, so you\n\tcan stack it with the Darkvision spell to get darkvision beyond 60 feet. When\n\teverything is relying on darkvision, the one who can see the furthest has a\n\tmajor advantage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Well<\/span> (Sp): This is a really cool\n\tcombination of Hide in Plain Sight and Benign Transposition. You can hide\n\teasily with no cover, and the ability to switch your allies around has some\n\treally great tactical options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enveloping Darkness<\/span> (Sp): No save, no Spell\n\tResistance, No darkvision, and they&#8217;re entangled. This essentially means you\n\tcan walk through the area with impunity murdering people for 10 minutes per\n\tcaster level. You may only get to use it once per day, but this is basically a\n\tguranteed win unless your enemies brought Freedom of Movement.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Master<\/span> (Su): The Shadow Conjuration\n\tspells&#8217; biggest problem is that they are only partially real. This\n\tconsiderably reduces that problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Umbral<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: You should be spending a\n\tlot of time in shadows or darkness, so this is really helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloak of Shadows<\/span>: Help your fighter be\n\tstealthy. Shadowstrike is awful, so you&#8217;re not missing much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The spell list isn&#8217;t fantastic, and the feat list is mediocre. The bloodline powers are interesting, but not super powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skill<\/span>: Knowledge (Planes) is okay,\n\tbut generally situational. Identifying outsiders can be really nice, but it&#8217;s\n\ta very small subset of all of the monsters in the game until high level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: You only get a few really\n\tgood options at very low and very high levels.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">true strike<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">glitterdust<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">greater magic weapon<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">stoneskin<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">wall of stone<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">wall of iron<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">plane shift<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">iron body<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">wish<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Improved Initiative is a\n\tgreat choice, but the other options are unimpressive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dodge<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Empower Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Power Attack<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [planes])<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Finesse<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Changing the energy type\n\tfor energy spells really helps the versatility of your spell list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Acid Ray<\/span> (Sp): Respectable, generic, and\n\treliable. Good to have at low levels when your spell options are limited.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Decent\n\tresistance to cold.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Avalanche<\/span> (Su): This is a great way to keep\n\tenemies far away from you or to push them off cliffs.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Movement<\/span> (Su): Burrows speeds are\n\thard to find, and this gives you a great escape mechanism.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power of the Shaitan<\/span> (Su): Because it&#8217;s a\n\tspell-like ability, you don&#8217;t need to provide the 1500 gp diamond to cast\n\tLimited Wish. At this point you have Plane Shift as a spell, and can cast it\n\t6+ times per day because you&#8217;re a Sorcerer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Starsoul<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a solid bloodline. Many of the spells are very powerful, and the high level bloodline powers are flashy and exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skill<\/span>: Identify animals and fey.\n\tHelpful if you don&#8217;t have a druid or ranger handy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Some really great options in\n\there, but I&#8217;m not sure why Call Lightning Storm is on the list. It&#8217;s not a\n\tparticularly good spell, and doesn&#8217;t really fit the theme.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">unseen servant<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">glitterdust<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">blink<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">call lightning storm (dealing fire damage, damage increased outdoors at\n\t\t\tnight)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">overland flight<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">repulsion<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">reverse gravity<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">greater prying eyes<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">meteor swarm<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: More options than most\n\tbloodlines, but most of the options are bad. Quicken Spell is crucial at high\n\tlevels, and craft rod can be really nice if you like rods, but everything else\n\tis situational at best.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blind-Fight<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Craft Rod<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dodge<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Endurance<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Counterspell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Iron Will<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Will<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quicken Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Perception)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Toughness<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Dazzled is a really bad\n\tstatus condition.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Minute Meteors<\/span> (Sp): The damage is a bit\n\tlow, the AOE won&#8217;t help you much, and it&#8217;s a reflex save to completely\n\tnegate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Voidwalker<\/span> (Ex): Low-light vision is\n\tsituational, but you get two resitances and eventually you don&#8217;t need to\n\tbreath.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aurora Borealis<\/span> (Sp): Excellent crowd\n\tcontrol effect. Things are either fascinated, or they have to walk through a\n\twall of cold damage to reach you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Breaching the Gulf<\/span> (Sp): This is mean. You\n\tremove the target from combat, which is pretty nice, and deal some decent cold\n\tdamage every round. Because they can make a new save every round, they will\n\teventually return. Make sure that when they come back you&#8217;re ready for them.\n\tThey&#8217;re going to be super unhappy about the unplanned space travel.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Starborn<\/span> (Ex): You get immunity to cold,\n\timmunity to blindness, you can see in the dark, and you get fast healing. Very\n\timpressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Void-Touched<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Shut down enemy casters\n\tfor a round, then continue fireballing them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Black Motes<\/span> (Sp): Cold damage is slightly\n\tmore useful than fire damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Voidfield<\/span>: Instead of the weird fire wall\n\teffect, you get a scary combination of Ice Storm and Deeper Darkness. It won&#8217;t\n\tcompletely lock people down, but it&#8217;s an exciting crowd control effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stormborn<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few abilities worth getting excited about, a mediocre spell selection, and a poor feat selection. You get the ability to fly and use blidnsense in sever weather, which gives you arial superiority in storms, but that&#8217;s really the only exciting part of this bloodline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skill<\/span>: Identify animals and fey.\n\tHelpful if you don&#8217;t have a druid or ranger handy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: Most of your options are\n\tsituational, and they are all very weather-related.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">shocking grasp<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">gust of wind<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">lightning bolt<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">shout<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">overland flight<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">chain lightning<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">control weather<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">whirlwind<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">storm of vengeance<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Nothing worth getting excited\n\tabout.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deadly Aim<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dodge<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enlarge Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Far Shot<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Fortitude<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Point Blank Shot<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skill Focus (Fly)<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wind Stance<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Increasing the DC of your\n\tspells is always nice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thunderstaff<\/span> (Sp): The duration is going\n\tto be very short at low levels where this matters most, and at high levels you\n\thave much better uses for your turn, so this will likely see very little\n\tuse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stormchild<\/span> (Ex): Resistance to sonic is\n\trare, and two energy resistances is nice. Reducing the severity of winds is\n\tnice when you can fly and still use severe wind to keep other flyers grounded.\n\tThe blindense is pretty nice when you create fog effects but can still find\n\tyour enemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thunderbolt<\/span> (Sp): Decent damage, but it\n\twill be hard to affect more than one target.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ride the Lightning<\/span> (Sp): This is a really\n\tcool movement ability, and the damage is respectable. 15d6 damage will break\n\tthrough most solid barriers, including some stone walls if you roll well for\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Storm Lord<\/span> (Ex): Some cool resistances,\n\tbetter blindsight in weather effects, and you can heal yourself with lightning\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Arial<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: I hope you like using\n\tControl Weather to make it drizzle slightly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Windcaller<\/span>: This give you complete control\n\tover flight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Undead<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this is a necromancy-focused bloodline. The bloodline gets some good iconic necromancy spells, and the bloodline powers are flashy and exciting. If you want to control undead, this is an excellent option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Class Skill<\/span>: Knowledge (Religion) is a very\n\tsolid skill. You can identify undead, and it comes up frequently in\n\tadventures.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Spells<\/span>: All of your bonus spells are\n\tNecromancy spells, which makes sense. You get a few decent options, but\n\tnothing truly spectacular.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">chill touch<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">false life<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">vampiric touch<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">animate dead<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">waves of fatigue<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">undeath to death<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">finger of death<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">horrid wilting<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">energy drain<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Nothing really\n\tspectacular.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Casting<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Diehard<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Endurance<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Will<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Skill Focus (Knowledge [religion])<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell Focus<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Still Spell<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Toughness<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Charm Person on zombies.\n\tWhy not?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Grave Touch<\/span> (Sp): Shaken is a great status\n\tcondition, but you should not be marching around in melee touching people and\n\tyou most certainly shouldn&#8217;t be spending two turns making people\n\tfrightened.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Death&#8217;s Gift<\/span> (Su): Resistance to cold is\n\tnice, but resitance to nonlethal damage will probably never matter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Grasp of the Dead<\/span> (Sp): Decent non-energy\n\tdamage, and it pins targets in place. This is really great if you are\n\tsurrounded somehow..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incorporeal Form<\/span> (Sp): This is a greta\n\tutility and densive ability. Walk through walls, walk through enemies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">One of Us<\/span> (Ex): The immunities and\n\tresistences are nice, and you get to be ignored by unintelligent undead. Of\n\tcourse, at level 20 there are very few unintelligent undead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Wildblooded: Sanguine<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodline Arcana<\/span>: Better than charming\n\tmindless undead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">The Blood Is the Life<\/span> (Su): Grave Touch is\n\tterrible, and this give you an interesting healing mechanic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Verdant<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you can&#8217;t choose between playing a druid and playing a Sorcerer.
