Instead\n\tof trying to be a wild-shaping combat monster, fly around on your bat\n\tcasting spells and using ranged weapons. Use blindsight to locate\n\tinvisible enemies for your party. If you are in melee, you have messed\n\tup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Nature Bond<\/span>: The Bat isn&#8217;t even listed as\n\tan animal companion on the SRD.

Totem Transformation\n\tis a really cool, flavorful ability, and I love the versatility of\n\tsummoning bears at almost any spell level. However, the limitations on Nature\n\tBond and the weakened version of Wild Shape really bring the archetype down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nature Bond<\/span>: The\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">bear<\/span> isn&#8217;t a great choice for animal\n\tcompanion, and the domain selection is small and doesn&#8217;t contain a lot of good\n\toptions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal<\/span>: I assume that you must still\n\t\ttake a bear if you take the Animal domain, which really hurts the domain&#8217;s\n\t\toverall power.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Earth<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Strength<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Empathy<\/span> (Ex): This is in addition to\n\tthe normal Wild Empathy ability, which is already very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Totem Transformation<\/span> (Su): This is a really\n\tcool buff with three unique and interesting versions. If you are built for\n\tWild Shape, the natural weapons version can be a great way to get into melee\n\tbefore you get Wild Shape. The rest of the time, toughness is a solid option.\n\tThe ability to activate the bonus with smaller actions at high levels is nice\n\tbecause you don&#8217;t need to plan your bonus before combat starts to save your\n\tstandard actions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Totemic Summons<\/span> (Su): Way better than A\n\tThousand Faces. Bears aren&#8217;t great animal companions, but summioning them is a\n\tpretty good choice for Summon Natures ally. Naturally you might think &#8220;but if\n\tbears are bad animal companions, why are they good summons?&#8221; Animal Companions\n\tdon&#8217;t get stats matching their original animal. The Bear in particular has\n\tdecent stats to start with, but falls off very quickly compared to other\n\tchoices. Summoned bears are full size bears with all of their strength and\n\tdamage and generally awesome bear-ness, and you can enhance them to run the\n\tfull range up to Summon VIII.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Shape<\/span> (Su): Unfortauntely, there are\n\tonly four bears that you can transform into: Black Bears (Medium; Beast Shape\n\tI), Grizzly Bears, Polar Bears, and Dire Bears (All Large: Beast Shape II). At\n\tlevel 6 you can Wild Shape as a level 8 Druid if you Wild Shape into a bear. A\n\tlevel 8 druid can Wild Shape as Beast Shape II, so you can be a Dire Bear\n\tright from level 6. While it&#8217;s certainly nice to get Beast Shape II a level\n\tahead of Wizards, the Bear isn&#8217;t a very good option for Wild Shape because it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t get any special abilities, and its damage isn&#8217;t good enough to offset\n\tthe lack of Trip or Pounce. Losing two levels from your other Wild Shape\n\toptions also hurts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: A short list of fairly boring\n\tpassive feats. I would take toughness, Great Fortitude, then Improved Great\n\tFortitude. There really isn&#8217;t. Diehard and Endurance just aren&#8217;t very good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: A Thousand Faces, Nature Bond, Venom Immunity, Wild Empathy,\n\tWild Shape<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"blight-druid\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/druid\/archetypes\/paizo-druid-archetypes\/ape-shaman\/blight-druid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blight Druid<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blight Druid is a really cool concept. The abilities are a bit\n\tstrange, but Miasma and Plaguebearer could make for an excellent\n\tdefender. Without acces to an Animal Companion, the Blight Druid needs to\n\tbe more self reliant, and more dependant on spell in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Nature Bond<\/span> (Ex): While not as useful in\n\tcombat as an Animal Companion,\n\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Familiars<\/span> make excellent scouts and\n\tassistants.

The ability to calm vermin and undead animals it\n\tsituational, but very interesting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Miasma<\/span> (Ex): Sickened and Nauseated are\n\texcellent status conditions, and debuffing anyone unfortunate enough to stand\n\tnext to you is very helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blightblooded<\/span> (Ex): Not as good as\n\timmunity to poison, but nice to have.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plaguebearer<\/span> (Su): Blinding Sickness.\n\tBlinding Sickness every time.

Young Rocs\n\tcome into play at Summon VI, and you can stretch Rocs all the way up to Summon\n\tIX, which few other animal shaman archetypes can say. You have a few empty\n\tsummon levels in the middle, but you can summon multiples of lower-level\n\tsummons to summon a bunch of enhanced eagles.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wild Shape<\/span> (Su): This would be good if you\n\tcould actually Wild Shape into a Roc. Regretably, you can&#8217;t, and the Eagle is\n\ta poor Wild Shape choice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: None of the feats are\n\tparticularly good.

As a concept,\n\tNature Fang would make a lot more sense as a Ranger archetype. As it stands,\n\tDruids don&#8217;t really have a good way to make use of Studied Target, especially\n\tconsidering the Nature Fang gives up Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Studied Target<\/span> (Ex): You can only maintain\n\tone studied target, but this is otherwise the same as the Slayer&#8217;s version. I\n\tdon&#8217;t think that you can apply the DC boost to your spells because Studied\n\tTarget specifies &#8220;Slayer Class Abilities&#8221;, and makes no mention of spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slayer Talent<\/span>: Slayer Talents offer a lot of\n\tvery interesting options, including access to Ranger Combat Styles.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sneak Attack<\/span> (Ex): Wow. 1d6 Sneak\n\tAttack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swift Studied Target<\/span>: Studied Target works\n\tgreat as a Swift Action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Nature Sense, Nature&#8217;s Lore, Venom Immunity, Woodland Stride,\n\tWild Empathy, Wild Shape<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"pack-lord\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/druid\/archetypes\/paizo-druid-archetypes\/ape-shaman\/pack-lord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pack Lord<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While an amusing concept, the Pack Lord doesn&#8217;t work mathematically.

Doing so dramatically effects\n\tyour companions&#8217; hit points, AC, and their ability to hit and deal damage. If\n\tyou split your levels evenly, you may find that having even two companions\n\tmakes them completely useless.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Empathic Link<\/span> (Su): This is\n\tfantastic for scouting.

However, the random nature of the Reincarnation\n\ttable makes it very hard to predict what you will be when you come back.\n\tBecause chanhing races only affects your physical abilities, you may find\n\tyourself with a weird hodge-podge of racial abilities, and potentially much\n\tbetter stats than you had before you died.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wild Shape<\/span> (Su): Wild Shape is still\n\tgreat, but losing two levels limits its utility.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cheat Death<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic, especially on\n\ttop of your +4 bonus against these effects.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/span> (Ex): Weird,\n\tbut maybe a little more useful for a Druid than a Monk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Resist Nature&#8217;s Lure, Timeless Body, Venom Immunity,\n\tWild Shape, Woodland Stride<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Pack Lord<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"saurian-shaman\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/druid\/archetypes\/paizo-druid-archetypes\/ape-shaman\/saurian-shaman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Saurian Shaman<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dinosaurs are awesome, so this archetype is pretty great.

Dinosaurs run the whole range of summon\n\tlevels, and the ability to add templates to bring their summon level up or\n\tdown can allow you to bring a tactically relevant dinosaur into any fight at\n\tany level. Because dinosaurs are so much more diverse than the animals allowed\n\tto other animal shamans, this ability is considerably better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wild Shape<\/span> (Su): Unfortunately Dinosaurs\n\taren&#8217;t the best option for polymorphing because most dinosaurs are too large\n\tfor Beast Shape to allow.
