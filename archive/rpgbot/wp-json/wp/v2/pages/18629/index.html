You can play this subclass like a more typical ranger (Hunter or Monster Slayer for example), but you\u2019re going to miss out on a lot of what really makes the Fey Wanderer shine. Instead, it\u2019s built to lean into a Wisdom-based ranger with more emphasis on spellcasting and Face skills than your typical bow-wielding damage monster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to explore the Fey Wanderer, pick up Face skills like Persuasion. That\u2019s normally a difficult prospect for the Ranger, but, thanks to Otherworldly Glamour, you can add both Wisdom and Charisma to Charisma checks, allowing you to be profoundly effective as a Face. You can also create a character who is highly skilled in both Insight and in Charisma-based Face skills at the same time, which is normally difficult to do. Altogether, the Fey Wanderer adds Face to the list of the Ranger\u2019s possible roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Fey Wanderer&#8217;s spells and class features lean heavily on your spellcasting ability, which makes it tempting to use Fighting Style (Druidic Warrior), but be cautious if you go this route. Dreadful Strikes only works with weapons, so you shouldn&#8217;t rely on things like Produce Flame as your go-to attack option. Shillelagh will work great, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Fey Wanderer Ranger Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fey-wanderer-ranger-ability-scores\">Fey Wanderer Ranger Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fey-wanderer-ranger-races\">Fey Wanderer Ranger Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fey-wanderer-ranger-feats\">Fey Wanderer Ranger Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fey-wanderer-ranger-weapons\">Fey Wanderer Ranger Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#fey-wanderer-ranger-armor\">Fey Wanderer Ranger Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-wandering-fey-wanderer\">Example Build &#8211; Wandering Fey Wanderer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The most obvious benefit is\n\t\tthat it&#8217;s free, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there. There&#8217;s no action costs. It\n\t\tstacks with Hunter&#8217;s Mark&#8217;s damage bonus. The damage is psychic, which is\n\t\trarely resisted. It only applies once per target per turn, but if you can\n\t\thit multiple targets they&#8217;ll all take the bonus damage. It also applies on\n\t\tOpportunity Attacks (Hunter&#8217;s Mark does, too, but it&#8217;s still really nice).\n\t\tThe one drawback is that it doesn&#8217;t work quite as well as Hunter&#8217;s Mark does\n\t\twhen focusing on a single target, so Hunter&#8217;s Mark may still be worth the\n\t\tspell slot.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this applies once per target per turn, you&#8217;re motivated to attack\n\t\t\tmultiple targets if that&#8217;s an option. Ranged weapons work best for this,\n\t\t\tthough they may be difficult for the high-Wisdom build expected of the Fey\n\t\t\tWanderer. More likely you&#8217;ll want to use spells like Zephyr Strike to\n\t\t\tquickly move between and attack multiple targets.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fey Wanderer Magic<\/span>: The vast majority of\n\t\tthe options are only situationally useful, but you do get Misty Step, which\n\t\tis good on exactly 100% of characters.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-Level<\/span>: A strange choice\n\t\t\t\tmechanically, but the theme makes sense. Your save DC won&#8217;t match a full\n\t\t\t\tspellcaster unless you&#8217;re using Druidic Warrior to build around Wisdom,\n\t\t\t\tand Charm Person doesn&#8217;t give you any indication that it worked, so you\n\t\t\t\tneed to be extremely cautious when using it. You don&#8217;t get enough spell\n\t\t\t\tslots to cast it repeatedly just to be absolutely sure that it\n\t\t\t\tworked.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th-Level<\/span>: The best teleportation\n\t\t\t\toption in combat.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">9th-Level<\/span>: Essential in any party. A\n\t\t\t\ttypical ranger should not be the one casting this, but the Fey Wanderer\n\t\t\t\tis an exception. You don&#8217;t get the high-level spell slots to make this\n\t\t\t\tautomatically dispel stuff, and most rangers don&#8217;t have the Wisdom to\n\t\t\t\tback up the ability check, but the Fey Wanderer is all about Wisdom, so\nyou have a passable chance to succeed on the abilty check.\n\t\t\t\tStill, look for buffs like Enhance Ability if you can get\n\t\t\t\tthem to maximize your odds of success.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: Less of a go-to combat\n\t\t\t\tteleportation option than Misty Step, but it has better range and\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t require line of sight, so it&#8217;s more powerful outside of combat\n\t\t\t\tor if you need to completely escape an encounter. You&#8217;ll still get more\n\t\t\t\tfrequent use out of Misty Step thanks to its Bonus Action casting time\n\t\t\t\tand lower-level spell slot requirement, but Dimension Door can get you\n\t\t\t\tthrough walls and locked doors.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">17th-Level<\/span>: Situational. Not a great\n\t\t\t\toption in combat, but out of combat this provides a passably safe way to\n\t\t\t\tscout an area or to trick other creatures if mundane stealth won&#8217;t do\n\t\t\t\tthe trick for some reason.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Otherworldly Glamour<\/span>: One Face skill and\n\t\tyou add your Wisdom modifier to all Charisma checks on top of any Charisma\n\t\tmodifier. This is enough to make you an effective Face without high\n\t\tCharisma, but a little bit is still a great idea. You don&#8217;t want 8 Charisma\n\t\tdragging you down.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Beguiling Twist<\/span>: Hilarious and very\n\t\teffective, but likely difficult to use to its greatest potential.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The obvious use case is to take charm\/fear effects from your enemies and\n\t\t\tessentially redirect them back at your enemies. That works great, and can\n\t\t\tlead to scenarios like dragons being frightened by their own Frightful\n\t\t\tPresence. To make this as effective as possible, you want allies in your\n\t\t\tparty who can reliably pass saving throws against charm\/fear effects.\n\t\t\tThese are nearly always Wisdom or Charisma saves, so high scores in those\n\t\t\tability scores and proficiency in the saves both help, but also look for\n\t\t\tracial traits like Brave and class features which help like Aura of\n\t\t\tProtection.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The less-obvious use case is using this offensively. If you have allies\n\t\t\twho can produce charm\/fear effects (often spellcasters, but there are\n\t\t\tnon-spell options too), you can capitalize on any creatures who pass saves\n\t\t\tagainst your allies&#8217; abilities and force another creature to save against\n\t\t\tBeguiling Twist.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fey Reinforcements<\/span>: Summon Fey once per\n\t\tday for free without the 300gp material component. The spirit&#8217;s attack bonus\n\t\tis based on your Spellcasting Modifier and the spell is heavily dependent on\n\t\tspell level, both of which are hard prospects for many rangers. But even if\n\t\tit&#8217;s not quite as effective offensively as something summoned by a full\n\t\tspellcaster, it&#8217;s still an effective pet for up to an hour per casting.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The second benefit allows you to cast a shorter version of the spell\n\t\t\twithout the Concentration requirement, but that&#8217;s a really hard prospect\n\t\t\twith the Ranger&#8217;s limited pool of spell slots.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Misty Wanderer<\/span>: Misty Step for free\n\t\tseveral times per day, and you can even bring a friend along! This makes it\n\t\teasy to rescue your friends from grapples or restraints, and you become very\n\t\thard to keep in one place during combat.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fey-wanderer-ranger-ability-scores\">Fey Wanderer Ranger Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Ranger is already somewhat MAD, and Fey Wanderer doesn&#8217;t remove that issue.

I&#8217;d love to use Feylost from Wild Beyond the Witchlight, but flip it so we&#8217;re a fey who got lost and stuck on the material plane. Regardless, we&#8217;ll modify our background to end up with two skills and two tools\/languages.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We get Performance, Persuasion, and one instrument from our race.

From our class skills we&#8217;ll take Nature, Perception, and Survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nature, Performance, and Survival won&#8217;t do much for us, but we have all of the Charisma-based and Wisdom-based skills that we care about.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We want to avoid feats that use our Bonus Action because we need that free for Shillelagh and for several of our other spells, including Zephyr Strike. We want one hybrid feat to increase Wisdom, so we&#8217;ll take Gift of the Gem Dragon, but almost anything will work in that slot. Skill Expert would be an easy replacement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have two open spaces for ASIs or feats. Alert would make our passive skills absurdly high. Skill Expert would make another Face skill absurdly good. Fighting Initiate (Dueling) would be fine, but the +2 damage feels pretty silly at levels 16 and 19 alongside roasting people with Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride. Crusher could be fun, but won&#8217;t be amazing.

If we take a staff (not a quarterstaff, it needs to be a focus), it functions as a quarterstaff and a spellcasting focus at the same time. It won&#8217;t totally replace Warcaster, but it&#8217;s pretty close, and many of our spells either have a material component or only have Verbal components, so we won&#8217;t need to drop our focus often.<br><br>Shillelagh only last for one minute, but doesn&#8217;t take Concentration. If your DM allows it, and repeating the Verbal components won&#8217;t cause trouble, cast it repeatedly any time that you might encounter danger to save yourself the Bonus Action when combat starts.<br><br>If you go into combat without Shillelagh running and need to cast a different spell that turn (Zephyr Strike, etc.), consider drawing a dagger.<br><br>For our leveled spells we&#8217;ll take Ensnaring Strike and Longstrider.

That&#8217;s pretty good.<br><br>Otherworldly Glamour gets us proficiency in Deception, and allows us to add our Wisdom modifier to all Charisma checks. With Expertise in Persuasion, that gets us a total modifier of +8 at this level. Thanks to Speak with Animals, we can even apply our absurd Persuasion to beasts!<br><br>We learn Zephyr Strike so we can get into some hit-and-run tactics. We won&#8217;t need it all the time right now because we can frequently stand in melee and trade blows, but once we get Extra Attack we&#8217;ll want to be mobile so that we can spread Dreadful Strikes around.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: Gift of the Gem Dragon (Wis 17 &#8211; &gt; 18)<\/td><td>Gift of the Gem Dragon gives us a defensive way to use our Reaction in situations where we don&#8217;t anticipate making opportunity attacks.

In combat, we now start relying on hit-and-run tactics when facing multiple foes. Use Zephyr Strike to prevent opportunity attacks and try to apply Dreadful Strikes to two targets. If you don&#8217;t need to remain in melee with an enemy to keep it from running off to attack your frail allies, end your turn out of reach and force enemies to come to you. Zephyr Strike&#8217;s Bonus Action casting time will compete with Shillelagh, so start combat with Shillelagh then bring in Zephyr Strike if necessary. You have very few spell slots.<br><br>We pick up Enhance Ability to further improve our Charisma checks. +11 to Persuasion with Advantage is really good.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Roving<\/td><td>Our land speed is now 40 before we look at spells, and we get matching climb\/swim speeds.

We have high enough Wisdom to back it up, and the 6d10 damage is hard to beat. But for the same spell slot, Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride gets us guaranteed 3d6 damage per target per turn, doesn&#8217;t have a 5-target limit, and with 80 feet of movement we can reach numerous targets and still have our Action to bonk stuff. A second turn can easily put Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride ahead of Steel Wind Strike, and the gap gets bigger the more targets are in an encounter.<br><br>Steel Wind Strike&#8217;s appeal is the speed at which it functions and that it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration. If you&#8217;re running an existing Concentration spell (Guardian of Nature or Ashardalon&#8217;s Stride), you can cast Steel Wind Strike for a big burst of damage.
