Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character.

Hypnotic Gaze locks you into fighting within\n\t30 feet, but you&#8217;re in light armor with no shields and mediocre Dexterity, so\n\tyour AC is going to be terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 2\/3 BAB is fine,\n\tespecially since you only need to attack when you have nothing better to do\n\twith your turn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Two good saves, but you&#8217;ll want to\n\tinvest in your Fortitude save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Light armor, simple\n\tweapons, and a handful of other weapons. Except to spend a lot of time in a\n\tchain shirt wielding a sword cane.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: While not so versatile as the Bard\n\tor the Rogue, the Mesmerist gets 6+ skill ranks and has good skill list with a\n\tgood mix of knowledge and face skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spells<\/span>: 2\/3 spontaneous Charisma-based\n\tcasting. The Mesmerist&#8217;s spell list is almost exclusively mind-affecting like\n\tother psychic casters, and at only 2\/3 casting you&#8217;ll have issues with save\n\tDCs. Fortunately, Hypnotic Stare applies a big enough penalty to offset the DC\n\tgap between you and a full caster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Consummate Liar<\/span>: The bonus to bluff is\n\treally nice, but the Mesmerist has absolutely no reason to feint.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hypnotic Stare<\/span> (Su): -2 to Will saves is\n\tsignificant, and upgrading to -3 at 8th level is even better. For a class\n\twhich focuses so heavily on mental effects, this is absolutely essential.\n\tAnything with a high Will save might be out of your reach, and this penalty\n\tcould make or break you. This ability also sets the target for Painful Stare,\n\tBold Stare, and Stare Feats, which are the bulk of how you&#8217;ll contribute in\n\tcombat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Knacks<\/span>: Cantrips are fantastic regardless\n\tof their name. Unfortunately your list of options is very short, but you still\n\tget essentials like detect magic and prestidigitation.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Mesmerist Tricks<\/span> (Su): Most Trick options are terrible,\n\tand the limitation of one implanted trick at a time makes the ability really\n\tdifficult to use in any meaningful way until you get Manifold Tricks at 5th\n\tlevel. See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/mesmerist\/tricks\">Mesmerist Trick Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor help selecting tricks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Painful Stare<\/span> (Su): It&#8217;s a bit like sneak\n\tattack, but you can only do it once per round and the damage is terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Towering Ego<\/span> (Su): Will saves are important,\n\tand putting your Charisma bonus on top of your high Will saves should make you\n\tnice and resilient.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bold Stare<\/span> (Su): You need Psychic Inception.\n\tYou will die if you do not take it. I cannot emphasize that enough. The other\n\toptions are cool, and some of them are even worth taking, but Psychic\n\tInception is too important for you to not have it. Take that first, and just\n\tpretend that you didn&#8217;t actually get a choice because any other choice is like\n\tleaning on the point of a sword and hoping it&#8217;s not sharp enough to run you\n\tthrough.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Allure<\/span>: Unless you manage to get this going\n\t\tbefore combat starts it&#8217;s largely useless. It can help you sneak around due\n\t\tto the Perception penalty, but that seems situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disorientation<\/span>: Combined with\n\t\tDemoralizing State and Excoriating Stare, you can apply a total of -7 to\n\t\tattack rolls, dramatically handicapping your target.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Inception<\/span>: For a class so\n\t\tdependent on mind-affecting abilities, this is absolutely essential. A giant\n\t\tbug can easily kill you at most levels without this ability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sapped Magic<\/span>: As you gain levels, enemies\n\t\twill gain more special abilities like spells and breath weapons, and\n\t\treducing those DCs will keep you and your party alive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Slugishness<\/span>: The speed reduction is\n\t\tworthless, and reflex saves don&#8217;t help you much since you can&#8217;t cast\n\t\tanything like fireball.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Susceptibility<\/span>: Very helpful as the\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Face, but optimizing your Charisma-based skills is really easy and\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t get enough Bold Stare options to make this an obvious choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Timidity<\/span>: The penalty isn&#8217;t big enough to\n\t\tmatter for most foes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch Treatment<\/span> (Su): Having the option to\n\tremove status conditions is nice, but spending a standard action to remove\n\tmost of the conditions from an ally is usually a waste of your turn.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Minor Conditions<\/span>: Fascinated almost never happens to\n\t\tplayers (although in a occult campaign it might be more common). I have no\n\t\tidea why Shaken is on here, but Sickened is on the Moderate list. They do\n\t\tbasically the same thing, but Shaken is objectively more dangerous because\n\t\tof the fear stacking rules.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Moderate Conditions<\/span>: Mostly conditions that are\n\t\tannoying or partially debilitating.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Greater Conditions<\/span>: Ifg you have these conditions\n\t\tyou&#8217;re in a really bad situation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Manifold Tricks<\/span> (Su): Without this, Tricks\n\tare garbage. It&#8217;s just too hard to predict both what trick you need and what\n\tfriend you need it on.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mental Potency<\/span> (Ex): This might be a\n\thelpful way to squeeze some more usefulness out of your low-level spells, but\n\tthe scaling is too poor to be meaningful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Glib Lie<\/span> (Su): Extremely situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Masterful Tricks<\/span> (Su): See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/mesmerist\/tricks\">Mesmerist Trick Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor help selecting tricks<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rule Minds<\/span> (Su): Permanent Dominate Person.\n\tFind a big, important enemy and enslave them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You need Charisma, and you need to stay alive. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump to 7 and use a ranged weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: In light armor you need Dexterity to\n\tboost your AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Fortitude is your only bad save, and\n\tyou&#8217;ll need hit points to compensate for your light armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: More skill points can be really\n\tuseful depending on your party makeup.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: You need a bit for Will saves, but\n\tTowering Ego allows you to apply your Charisma as a bonus so you don&#8217;t need to\n\tinvest heavily in Wisdom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: Your spells and abilities are all\n\tCharisma-based.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 18<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 18<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 17<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Charisma bonuses are hard to find, but they&#8217;re basically the only thing you need.

The racial\n\tfavored class bonus improves your Painful Stare damage. It&#8217;s not a ton, but\n\tthe damage from Painful stare is so poor that it&#8217;s a significant\n\timprovement.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: Bonuses to two important abilities\n\tand a penalty to your dump state.

This\n\t\tcompetes with Demoralizing Stare somewhat, so don&#8217;t take both feats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Medium Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Your spells\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have Somatic components, so arcane spell failure doesn&#8217;t apply. You\n\t\tprobably don&#8217;t want to invest in enough Dexterity to have a decent AC, so\n\t\tmedium armor can be a great option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mesmerizing Feint<\/span>: You do not need to\n\t\tfeint.

Be sure to pick up at least one, and if you can spare the feats get a second before you pick up Compounded Pain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bleeding Stare<\/span>: Bleed damage rarely\n\t\tkills anything, and you get too little for this to compensate for your utter\n\t\tlack of damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Demoralizing Stare<\/span>: Even if it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\twork for fear stacking, Shaken is still a great status condition. Remember\n\t\tthat the target is taking the Will save penalty from Hypnotic Stare, so\n\t\tthey&#8217;ll have even more trouble hitting what should already be a difficult\n\t\tsave DC. This competes somewhat with Intimidating Glance, and since they\n\t\tboth apply Shaken you don&#8217;t want to take both.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Excoriating Stare<\/span>: Basically equivalent to\n\t\tDemoralizing Stare, but works on creatures that are immune to fear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fatiguing Stare<\/span>: Fatigued isn&#8217;t always\n\t\tuseful, and even against enemies who care it&#8217;s usually not a huge\n\t\thandicap.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intense Pain<\/span>: The extra damage is\n\t\tabsolutely not worth a feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Light Crossbow<\/span>:Probably the only weapon\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll ever use, and even then only when you don&#8217;t have anything better to\n\t\tdo.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sword Cane<\/span>: You should not be using melee\n\t\tweapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whip<\/span>: A whip is still a melee weapon, and\n\t\tyou should not be using melee weapons<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Studded Leather<\/span>: Starting armor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chain Shirt<\/span>: Probably your permanent armor\n\t\tunless you get medium armor proficiency and upgrade to a breastplate.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Darkwood Heavy Shield<\/span>: With no armor check\n\t\tpenalty, you can use this regardless of your lack of proficiency.
