The fighter trades their signature weapon and armor training for focus on the Close weapon group, some nice crowd control effects, and some minor debuffs. Altogether, the Brawler is good at battlefield control, disabling single targets, and hunting spellcasters. They may lack some of the basic damage of other fighter builds, but they make up for it in utility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Since spiked shields count as Close weapons, brawlers make an excellent sword-and-board duel-wielding fighters.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: Between your d10 hit points and\n\tyour heavy armor, you are very durable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: The biggest and best in\n\tthe game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Your fortitude saves are good, but\n\tyou will need to invest in your other saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: You get the best\n\tproficiencies of any class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Fighters only get 2+ skills, and very\n\tfew of your skill choices are worthwhile, so you will likely dump\n\tintelligence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: The main reason to play a\n\tfighter. Everything a fighter would want to take is a combat feat, and there\n\tare enough options that you never have to play the same fighter twice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bravery<\/span>: The brawler is one of very few\n\tfighter archetypes which doesn&#8217;t trade in Bravery for something more\n\tinteresting. A bonus to fear saves is very rarely useful, but it certainly\n\tdoesn&#8217;t hurt.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetype-features\">Archetype Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Fighters are proficient with\n\tbasically everything except exotic weapons. Some Close weapons are exotic, but\n\tthey are generally not worth a feat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Fighters get 2+ skills, and have a\n\tvery short skill list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Close Control (Ex)<\/span>: Bull Rush, Drag, and\n\tReposition are only situationally useful, and all do effectively the same\n\tthing: move the enemy from point A to point B. If you spend the feats, you can\n\tforce the enemy to draw attacks of opportunity when you move them. Unless your\n\tparty is full of rogues with combat reflexes, you&#8217;re probably better of just\n\thitting things instead of dragging them around between your party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Close Combatant (Ex)<\/span>: The bonus to attacks\n\tis basically the same as weapon training. The +3 damage is two points higher\n\tthan the normal weapon training bonus, which makes Close weapons roughly\n\tequivalent to most one-handed weapons in terms of damage. The close weapon\n\tgroup has very few fantasic options, which is unfortunate. I&#8217;m still confused\n\twhy Daggers aren&#8217;t a Close weapon.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Menacing Stance (Ex)<\/span>: This is the first\n\tsignature ability for the brawler. It makes it hard to hit you in melee, and\n\tmakes you very effective at locking down spellcasters. Combined with the Step\n\tUp and Disruptive feats, you are going to be very problematic for\n\tspellcasters. The scaling penalties keep this ability relevant into higher\n\tlevels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">No Escape (Ex)<\/span>: Combined with Step Up, this\n\tability is absolutely fantastic. Not only can people not get away from you,\n\tyou get an attack of opportunity when they try. If they try to withdraw, make\n\ta trip attempt. If they do manage to withdraw, just charge them next round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Stand Still<\/span>: You should already have Combat\n\tReflexes and Stand Still by now, so this is basically another combat feat. The\n\treal benefit here is the bonus on combat maneuver checks when using Stand\n\tStill.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Mastery (Ex)<\/span>: Decent, but\n\tconsidering no close weapon has a threat range greater than 20, it&#8217;s not going\n\tto see a lot of use. Your CMD should be insane by level 20, so being disarmed\n\treally shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: Any melee character&#8217;s\n\tbread-and-butter, but we need high dex to get the two-weapon fighting\n\tfeats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity opens up two-weapon fighting.\n\tSince you don&#8217;t get armor training, heavy armor is less appealing, which makes\n\tmedium armor attractive. Dex also adds additional effect to Combat Reflexes,\n\twhich can get some serious mileage on a brawler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: You have d10 hit points and strong\n\tfortitude saves, but you&#8217;re a front-line tank, so you need them both.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: You may want 13 for Combat Expertise,\n\tbut won&#8217;t benefit much from anything past that. Your skill list is garbage, so\n\textra skill points really won&#8217;t get you much. If you&#8217;re not using combat\n\texpertise, dump to 7.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: The only real benefit you get here is\n\twill saves. While will saves are certainly important, your other abilities\n\tneed more focus. Plus, you can always take Iron Will if you need it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Dump to 7 or 8. Even if you plan on\n\tintimidating, it&#8217;s not worth wasting crucial ability score points on\n\tcharisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:17<\/li>\n<li>Dex:17<\/li>\n<li>Con:14<\/li>\n<li>Int:7<\/li>\n<li>Wis:12<\/li>\n<li>Cha:7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:15<\/li>\n<li>Dex:17<\/li>\n<li>Con:14<\/li>\n<li>Int:7<\/li>\n<li>Wis:13<\/li>\n<li>Cha:8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:14<\/li>\n<li>Dex:15<\/li>\n<li>Con:13<\/li>\n<li>Int:10<\/li>\n<li>Wis:12<\/li>\n<li>Cha:8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Basically any race that makes a good fighter can make a good brawler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Dwarves are excellent fighters\n\tnormally. Bonus Constitution and Wisdom make them very durable, a +2 on saves\n\tagainst spells is fantastic, and Darkvision is always helpful. The Dwarven\n\tStability bonus is nice&#8230; for resisting other Brawlers. The speed penalty\n\tisn&#8217;t a problem, and Slow and Steady makes heavy armor more appealing after\n\ttrading in Armor Mastery.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: The bonuses to Dexterity is nice, but\n\tthe intelligence bonus is useless here. The constitution penalty hurts, and\n\tnone of the racial abilities do anything helpful. Alternate racial traits help\n\ta bit, but there are still better options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Gnomes are small, and get a penalty to\n\tstrength. Nothing a gnome has makes them a good brawler.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: That variable ability bonus goes\n\tstraight into strength or dexterity. If you are planning a class dip, Half-Elf\n\tis a good choice due to Multitalented. Their other racial bonuses are\n\tsituationally useful, but not game changers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Variable ability bonus to\n\tstrength or dexterity. Beyond the ability bonus, Darkvision is really the only\n\tthing Half-Orcs bring to the table. About on-par with Dwarves, but certainly\n\tnothing to get excited about. If you plan to use intimidate, the racial bonus\n\tis nice and can offset dumping your charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Halfling<\/span>: Halflings suffer the same issues\n\tthat Gnomes do.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: I&#8217;m going to throw a curve ball and\n\tsuggest a +2 bonus to strength or dexterity (I can&#8217;t throw a curve ball). The\n\thuman skill bonus matters very little for a fighter, but a bonus feat opens up\n\ta lot of options. If you aren&#8217;t planning a class dip, you would be\n\thard-pressed to find a better option than Human.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (Combat): Not very useful\n\t\tif your party has two or more melee characters, but potentially useful since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going to be duel-wielding.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): Bonus to a bad\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Easy Way or the Hard Way<\/span> (Combat): If\n\t\tyou plan on taking the Enforcer feat, this might be a good choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): A +2 bonus to\n\t\tinitiative is never a bad choice. If you can go before the enemy, you can\n\t\tget on top of them and hold them in place, which is what the Brawler is\n\t\tfor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resilient<\/span> (Combat): Your Fortitude save is\n\t\talready good, and there are several more beneficial trait options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tactician<\/span> (Combat): A small bonus to\n\t\tinitiative is nice, but the real draw is the bonus to attacks of opportunity\n\t\tonce per day. It&#8217;s annoying that it&#8217;s only once per day, but sometimes that\n\t\t+2 bonus is crucial.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Indomitable Faith<\/span> (Faith): A bonus to your\n\t\tworst save is never a bad choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Seeker<\/span> (Social): This makes perception a\n\t\tclass skill, thereby giving you at least one useful option for your meager\n\t\tskill points. The +1 bonus is a nice touch, but this would still be blue\n\t\twithout it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With only 2+ skill points, dumped intelligence, and the lousy fighter skill\n\tlist, your options are somewhat limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Why would anyone ever put\n\t\tranks in climb? You can mitigate most climb issues with a rope. For\n\t\teverything else, learn to fly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Handle Animal (Cha)<\/span>: You&#8217;re not on a horse.\n\t\tYou don&#8217;t train animals, you PUNCH THEM.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Your only social\n\t\tskill, and for good reason. You&#8217;re dumping charisma, so this likely won&#8217;t\n\t\tget a lot of use unless you build it into your feat selectin. With the\n\t\tEnforcer feat, it&#8217;s a good investment.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (dungeoneering)<\/span> (Int): Your\n\t\tintelligence is garbage, but one rank can let you make the very rare lucky\n\t\tknowledge roll. It can also help identify monsters very rarely.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (engineering)<\/span> (Int): Your\n\t\tintelligence is garbage, and this skill is garbage. Don&#8217;t double-dip into\n\t\tthe garbage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): You&#8217;re still not on a\n\t\thorse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): Basically the go-to\n\t\toption for fighters, despite it being cross-class. If you take the Seeker\n\t\ttrait, you can actually do some good with this skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Arguably the best\n\t\tfighter skill, survival can be crucial in some rare situations. You&#8217;re not\n\t\tdumping your wisdom, so you may as well put at least on rank here.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swim<\/span> (Str): If your DM tends to try\n\t\tdrowning you in your armor, one rank is a good investment. Otherwise, rely\n\t\ton your strength and buy a potion of water breathing for emergencies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Like any fighter, the Brawler depends heavily on feats. Fortunately, you get plenty of them. With normal feats at every odd-numbered level and bonus feats at every even-numbered level, you get a feat at every level (and two\/three at first).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bludgeoner<\/span>: Combines well with\n\t\tEnforcer.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Combat Expertise<\/span>: Really only useful if you\n\t\twant Improved Trip. Since you&#8217;re duel-wielding, you don&#8217;t want to give up\n\t\tprevious attack bonus to boost your already fantastic AC.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Disarm<\/span>: Disarming an really\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get you anything more than it would for anyone else. Menacing\n\t\t\t\tstance already gives people a penalty to attack rolls while adjacent to\n\t\t\t\tyou, and your AC should be fairly high, so weapon attacks shouldn&#8217;t be\n\t\t\t\tscary for you.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Trip<\/span>: Tripping shouldn&#8217;t be\n\t\t\t\tyour go-to tactic, but it can be useful in combination with No Escape.\n\t\t\t\tStep Up is a better choice for Brawlers, costs less feats, and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tneed Intelligence.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Greater Trip<\/span>: Unless you really\n\t\t\t\t\t\twant to focus on tripping, the additional bonus likely isn&#8217;t worth\n\t\t\t\t\t\tall of the feats required to get here.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: You already need\n\t\tresonable dexterity for Two-Weapon Fighting, so Combat Reflexes becomes goes\n\t\ta long way. Combined with Enlarge Person and No Escape, Combat Reflexes make\n\t\tyou very scary.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stand Still<\/span>: When combined with No\n\t\t\t\tEscape, you can actually prevent people from using the Full Withdraw\n\t\t\t\taction. People literally can&#8217;t get away from you.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dazing Assault<\/span>: The attack penalty hurts,\n\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re Two-Weapon Fighting, but Daze basically robs the target\n\t\tof their turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disruptive<\/span>: Suck it, wizard. This combines\n\t\twith Menacing Presence in a way that I think you will really enjoy.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellbreaker<\/span>: Suck it harder, wizard.\n\t\t\t\tWith Menacing Presence and Disruptive, casters are going to fail\n\t\t\t\tConcentration checks frequently. Combined with Combat Reflexes, you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tgoing to be a huge problem.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enforcer<\/span>: While it requires you deal\n\t\tnonlethal damage, Enforcer allows you to make free intimidate checks to make\n\t\tyour target Shaken. Shaken further drops the target&#8217;s attack rolls, which\n\t\tworks nicely with Menacing Presence. The Shaken effect lasts for a number of\n\t\trounds equal to the damage dealt, which should be plenty. Unfortunately you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t use Intimidate to move people past Shaken on the fear scale.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Fortitude<\/span>: You are on the front\n\t\tlines, and are going to get hit with a lot of stuff. Buffing your saves will\n\t\tkeep you alive, but your fortitude save is already going to be high.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Shield Bash<\/span>: This makes\n\t\tduel-wielding with a shield a viable option.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Slam<\/span>: The free bull rush\n\t\t\t\tattempt can be useful combined with Greater Bull Rush and Close Control,\n\t\t\t\tbut you&#8217;re usually better off keeping people next to you so that you can\n\t\t\t\tdebuff them and full attack them.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield Master<\/span>: This is a beautiful\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfeat. It eliminates those pesky -2 penalties for duel-wielding,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich I would happily spend a feat for. Allowing you to use the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshield&#8217;s enhancement bonus as a weapon enhancement bonus is amazing\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsince armor enhancement bonuses cost half as much as weapon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenhancement bonuses.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield Focus<\/span>: Your AC is going to be\n\t\tfine without this. A +1 shield bonus isn&#8217;t spectacular, and Dodge may be a\n\t\tbetter option since it boosts your relatively low touch AC.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Greater Shield Focus<\/span>: All the same\n\t\t\t\tproblems as Shield Focus, but sometimes you just really need a ton of\n\t\t\t\tAC.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Iron Will<\/span>: Will saves are the fighter&#8217;s\n\t\tbiggest weakness. Mind-controlling the fighter can cause a party to fall\n\t\tapart. If you have a spare feat, Iron Will is a great choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: You are on the front\n\t\tlines, and are going to get hit with a lot of stuff. Your reflex save won&#8217;t\n\t\tbe as bad as your Will save, but better saves is never a bad idea.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lunge<\/span>: Reach is any fighter&#8217;s friend, but,\n\t\tthe effect of this feat ends at the end of your turn, which means it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\taffect attacks of opportunity. There are very few cases where taking a\n\t\tfive-foot step is not a completely superior option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pin Down<\/span>: This is basically a combination\n\t\tof the No Escape ability and the Stand Still feat. If you combine No Escape\n\t\twith Pin Down, you get two attacks of opportunity when people try to move\n\t\taway, and Pin Down prevents them from moving if you hit (instead of dealing\n\t\tdamage).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Attack<\/span>: Power Attack is a difficult\n\t\tchoice for duel-wielding. You only get half of the power attack damage bonus\n\t\tfor off-hand attacks, and you have to give up attack bonus for less reward\n\t\tthan you would normally expect from Power Attack. Once you get Shield\n\t\tMaster, power attack is a better option because you can offset the attack\n\t\tpenalties so inexpensively.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Furious Focus<\/span>: Avoiding Power Attack&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tpenalties is nice, but Brawler is a two-weapon fighting build, so\n\t\t\t\tinvesting in a feat that only applies to one attack doesn&#8217;t make\n\t\t\t\tsense.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Bull Rush<\/span>: This feat really\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get you anything fun except access to Greater Bull Rush.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Bull Rush<\/span>: When combined\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith shield slam, Bull Rush suddenly becomes an interesting option.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can end a full attack by shoving your enemy through a bunch of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour party members. Keep in mind that this does not allow\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<em>you<\/em> to take attacks of opportunity.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Precise Strike<\/span>: If you are flanking\n\t\tfrequently, this is a decent choice to improve your damage output. Since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re duel-wielding, you&#8217;ll get extra attacks to to apply that extra\n\t\td6.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Step Up<\/span>: Always fantastic on a melee\n\t\tcharacter, Step Up allows you to keep people inside your Menacing\n\t\tPresence.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Following Step<\/span>: Slightly improves\n\t\t\t\tthe movement part of Step Up. Instead of taking a 5-foot step to follow,\n\t\t\t\tyou get to move 10 feet however you like without sacrificing your 5-foot\n\t\t\t\tstep on your turn.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Step Up And Strike<\/span>: Another free\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattack when people try to step away from you. This is nice on top of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo Escape, but since it&#8217;s somewhat situational, it&#8217;s hard to justify\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttwo feats.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Toughness<\/span>: You have d10 hit points and good\n\t\tconstitution, so you shouldn&#8217;t need Toughness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Almost all Close\n\t\tweapons are light, and Close Combatant provides a static damage bonus. This\n\t\tscreams Two-Weapon Fighting.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Double Slice<\/span>: This will add some nice\n\t\t\t\tdamage to your off-hand attacks, but Weapon Specialization will add\n\t\t\t\troughly the same amount of damage to both hands.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Two-Weapon Rend<\/span>: 1d10+1-1\/2 strength\n\t\t\t\tmod is a nice bit of damage, but you have several more reliable\n\t\t\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Take\n\t\t\t\tthis as soon as possible.<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Take\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis as soon as possible.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: If you put everything\n\t\tinto Dex, this might be a good idea. But don&#8217;t do that. Don&#8217;t do it. You\n\t\tneed strength for damage, so you should be able to rely on strength for\n\t\tattacks too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Focus \/ Weapon Specialization<\/span>: You\n\t\twill probably end up duel-wielding, which makes Weapon Focus \/ Weapon\n\t\tSpecialization and excellent choice. Weapon Specialization gets more mileage\n\t\tas you make more attacks, so try to use two identical weapons to maximize\n\t\tyour feats.<p><\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stage Combatant<\/span>: If you take Weapon\n\t\t\t\tFocus, this works better with Enforcer than Bludgeoner because you can\n\t\t\t\tuse it with weapons which deal any damage type.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your selection of weapons is fairly limited, and most of your options are lackluster. Even so, the Close weapon group offers some interesting options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">bayonet<\/span>: The only two-handed weapon in the\n\t\tClose weapon group, the bayonet is a mechanical death trap. They can only be\n\t\tused when attached a crossbow as a move action, rendering the crossbow\n\t\troughly equal to a club. Plus, you still need to spend a move action to\n\t\t<em>draw<\/em> the damn thing. There is literally no case in which a\n\t\tshortspear is worse. Why anyone would use this piece of trash,\n\t\t<em>especially<\/em> a Brawler, is beyond me.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">brass knuckles<\/span>: Brass knuckles are listed\n\t\tunder &#8220;Unarmed Attacks&#8221;, which means that using them draws attacks of\n\t\topportunity if you don&#8217;t have Improved Unarmed Strike. Save these for the\n\t\tMonk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">dan bong<\/span>: A very odd weapon, the Dan\n\t\tBong is one of the few Close weapons with a 19-20 threat range. They provide\n\t\ta +2 bonus to grapple, which is very rare on an item. The d3 damage is\n\t\tbasically average for the Close group, and the Defending quality is\n\t\toccasionally nice. If you like to grapple, this may be worth the feat, but\n\t\tcertainly not before you get Improved Grapple and Greater Grapple.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">emei piercer<\/span>: Costing three times as much\n\t\tas the dan bong and having fewer features, the emei piercer is not doing you\n\t\tany favors. A Monk might find them useful when they need to do some piercing\n\t\tdamage, but the Brawler isn&#8217;t going to find anything useful here.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">fighting fan<\/span>: d4 damage and x3 crit is\n\t\tpretty nice, but probably not worth the feat. The +2 bonus to feint is nice,\n\t\tbut since Brawlers don&#8217;t get bluff, it won&#8217;t see a lot of use. Not worth a\n\t\tfeat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">gauntlet<\/span>: Gauntlets are listed under\n\t\t&#8220;Unarmed Attacks&#8221;, which means that using them draws attacks of opportunity\n\t\tif you don&#8217;t have Improved Unarmed Strike. These are great if you get into a\n\t\tgrapple or get disarmed, and you get them for free with heavy armor.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">heavy shield<\/span>: Why would you use this when\n\t\tyou can get a spiked heavy shield instead?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">iron brush<\/span>: Let the monk have his weird\n\t\ttoy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">light shield<\/span>: Why would you use this when\n\t\tyou can get a spiked light shield instead?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">madu<\/span>: This is a very odd weapon indeed. A\n\t\tmadu is functionally a light spiked shield with some extra stuff. It makes\n\t\tFight Defensively and combat expertise considerably better, and has the\n\t\tPerformance quality. When combined with a Blocking weapon (such as a dan\n\t\tbong or tonfa), Fight Defensively is a really good option. The only downside\n\t\tis that it&#8217;s exotic, so you need to spend a feat to get anything more than\n\t\tyou would get from a spiked light shield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">mere club<\/span>: This is a fluff weapon for Aztec\n\t\tfans.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">punching dagger<\/span>: Hands down the best Close\n\t\tweapon in the Core Rulebook, the punching dagger brings d4 damage and x3\n\t\tcrit. With the extra +2 damage which Brawlers get above the normal Weapon\n\t\tTraining progression, the average damage on a punching dagger is 4.5,\n\t\tmatching that of a battle axe or longsword. If you don&#8217;t want to weild\n\t\tspiked shields, this is your go-to option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">sap<\/span>: d6 damage is pretty hard to find in\n\t\tthe Close group, but the damage is nonlethal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">scizore<\/span>: Another weird weapon. The scizore\n\t\tprovides a +1 shield bonus to AC, and a whopping d10 damage. Unfortunately,\n\t\tusing it to attack removes the shield bonus and applies a -1 penalties to\n\t\tattacks. Without that penalty to attacks, this might be a good choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">spiked armor<\/span>: d6 damage, x2 crit, can&#8217;t\n\t\tbe disarmed, and doesn&#8217;t take up a hand to use. If you use heavy armor,\n\t\tspend the 50 gold just to know that you have them in emergencies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">spiked gauntlet<\/span>: d4 damage, x2 crit,\n\t\tcan&#8217;t be disarmed, and doesn&#8217;t take up a hand to use. This is the armor\n\t\tspikes&#8217; little brother. If you&#8217;re not in heavy armor, buy two spiked\n\t\tgauntlets as backup weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">spiked heavy shield<\/span>: d6 damage, x2 crit.\n\t\tThe +2 shield bonus is nice if you want to duel-wield with a shield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">spiked light shield<\/span>: d4 damage, x2 crit.\n\t\tThe +1 shield bonus and damage aren&#8217;t as nice as the heavy shield, but you\n\t\tcan use two light shields without additional penalties, which makes your\n\t\tweapon focus\/specialization feats more effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">tekko-kagi<\/span>: The tekko-kagi is the only\n\t\tClose weapon with the Disarm quality. It also lets you disarm without\n\t\tprovoking attacks of opportunity. If you want to disarm, but don&#8217;t have the\n\t\tIntelligence for Combat Expertise, this may be a good investment. If you do\n\t\thave Combat Expertise, the +2 bonus is excellent. The entry mentions that\n\t\tthe tekko-kagi can be used defensively like a buckler, but doesn&#8217;t elaborate\n\t\ton the stats for doing so.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">tonfa<\/span>: A slightly better version of the\n\t\tclub, the tonfa is a reasonable choice. The Defending quality is nice if you\n\t\tlike to Fight Defensively, and d6 damage isn&#8217;t bad for the Close group.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">unarmed strike<\/span>: STOP. WHAT ARE YOU GOING.\n\t\tYOU ARE NOT A MONK.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">wooden stake<\/span>: Use it on vampires, but\n\t\totherwise pretend this weapon doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">wushu dart<\/span>: d3 damage, and it&#8217;s one of\n\t\tthe few non-exotic close weapons with a range increment. If you like to\n\t\tthrow things, this may be a good choice. Otherwise, look elsewhere.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This is a fighter archetype that really gets a lot of benefit from more class levels.
