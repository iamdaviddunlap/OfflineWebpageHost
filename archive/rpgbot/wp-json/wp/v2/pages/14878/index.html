Circle of the Moon focuses on Wild Shape and turns Druids into the most versatile martial characters out there while still giving them full spellcasting. Of course, they can\u2019t use those features at the same time until very high levels, but that still makes for an incredibly powerful character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The lion\u2019s share of your power comes from your versatility and bulk in melee combat. While other, more traditional Defenders may have a high AC and tricks to reduce incoming damage, you instead just put on health bars like rain coats and wear through them as needed. While this can make a character feel very strong, it means that your playstyle has to shift <em>dramatically<\/em> if you\u2019re unable to Wild Shape, often to something you\u2019re not very optimized for. Luckily, with the right spell selection, you can make sure to stay relevant no matter what the needs of the moment are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Circle of the Moon Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-moon-ability-scores\">Circle of the Moon Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-moon-races\">Circle of the Moon Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-moon-feats\">Circle of the Moon Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-moon-weapons\">Circle of the Moon Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-moon-armor\">Circle of the Moon Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-circle-of-the-moon-druid-build-moon-sailor\">Example Circle of the Moon Druid Build &#8211; Moon Sailor<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The wording on Wild Shape means that we get to keep skill proficiencies while shifted, though, so races with skill proficiencies are great. Also, any ability which isn\u2019t a spell but doesn\u2019t require your anatomy functions normally, so things like Halfling\u2019s Lucky, Brave, etc or Bugbear&#8217;s Surprise Attack work great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-moon-feats\">Circle of the Moon Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Skill Expert needs a discussion . While it\u2019s true that Skill Expert is a good way to increase your Athletics checks while shapeshifted, you can\u2019t replace any of the attacks in a Multiattack action with grapple\/shoves the same way you can with the Attack action, so this really only starts getting good at level 9 when you can be a Scorpion and need to keep things from getting out of your claws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler and I disagree on this part, though. He would interpret the rules for Wild Shape as using the set DC for breaking grapples as built into the monster stat block, but this doesn\u2019t make sense to me given that we already have a way to adjudicate targets breaking grapples from players. For monsters, it makes a lot of sense to reduce DM rolling and speed up combat, but it would be strange to have one character\u2019s grapples work differently than another character\u2019s. Talk that through with your DM before looking into this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-moon-weapons\">Circle of the Moon Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Nothing different than any other Druid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-moon-armor\">Circle of the Moon Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Walk out in hide armor because it\u2019s free, put on studded leather instead if you ignore this build guide and increase your Dex past 15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section briefly details some obvious and enticing multiclass options, but doesn&#8217;t fully explore the broad range of multiclassing combinations. For more on multiclassing, see our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re playing this as a frontline character, unsurprisingly, you can get a lot of good out of a 3-level dip into some martial classes. Barbarian is very popular for a number of reasons. Rage damage applies on each multiattack hit, so you can conceivably do much more of it than a character should, especially at low levels. If you go Totem and choose bear, you can get resistance to all damage which makes those animal hit points last twice as long, or choose wolf to grant advantage to your party and put on a shape with a ton of HP to provide it for as long as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fighter also has several great options. Echo Knight can let you be <em>two<\/em> dire wolves at the same time. Because you\u2019re the one making the attack, if something walks away from your Echo, your bite can make it prone on a failed save. Battle Master provides great utility as both Superiority Dice and Wild Shape recharge on Short Rest, incentivizing your group to let you recharge resources and then keep doing things like using Trip Attack (the maneuver) on the first hit of a multiattack so you get advantage on the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk would let you apply Unarmored Defense and Martial Arts while Wild Shaped. We care less about high AC than other subclasses because we get access to much beefier forms sooner, but there can still be value there. Martial Arts is a little strange. Taking the Multiattack action is not the Attack action, so it won\u2019t let you the bonus action attack or Flurry if you take at least 2 levels in Monk. Also, strictly speaking, \u201cUnarmed Attacks\u201d don\u2019t include attacks named Bite, Claw, Hooves, etc, so even if you make a single attack, it\u2019s entirely possible that none of these parts of Martial Arts would work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-circle-of-the-moon-druid-build-moon-sailor\">Example Circle of the Moon Druid Build &#8211; Moon Sailor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Building on the discussion above about the usability of racial traits, all of a Stout Halfling\u2019s abilities work while in Wild Shape.

Tyler is of the opinion that, since your Stout Halfling body is physically resistant to poison, changing your body into a house cat would remove that poison resistance. I think that no part of the ability specifies that it relies on anatomy, so you get to keep poison resistance. I guess that\u2019s up to DM determination since WotC has never clarified.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halfling Nimbleness should also work while transformed since it doesn\u2019t depend on your physical form, so feel free to walk into a Huge Giant\u2019s space while you\u2019re a Large beast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Sailor.

Now you can grab <em>two<\/em> enemies and hold them up to the Wall of Fire you\u2019ve dropped.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Elemental Wild Shape<br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Summon Draconic Spirit<\/td><td>In the Practical Guide to Wild Shape, Tyler talked about tactics for doing Fire Elemental things. You should definitely do that if you don\u2019t want to roast things in your pincers instead. But, sometimes, you should first summon a friend to help you with an especially challenging fight. Nothing stops you from saying that your Draconic Spirit looks like a guy in a tuxedo, mask and tophat.&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Heal<\/td><td>A staple for anyone who can take it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat:<br>&#8211; Bountiful Luck<br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Heroes\u2019 Feast<br><\/td><td>Now we also have something to do reliably with our reaction. Many things start to have very scary save-or-sucks at this level and being able to let our friends borrow some of our moon cosmic power.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Reverse Gravity<\/td><td>Reverse Gravity is a death sentence for anything that can\u2019t fly. If you cast it where there\u2019s nothing to grab, they don\u2019t even get a save of any kind. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re being pulled by\u2026 the moon?<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Fire Storm<br>Thousand Forms<\/td><td>Thousand Forms is nice if you\u2019re out of Wild Shapes, can\u2019t rest, and need to do one of a few specific things <em>right now<\/em>. Fire Storm is nice for being a big pile of very aimable damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Feeblemind<\/td><td>Now we can banish someone\u2019s intellect to the shadow realm. Wait, that\u2019s not right.<br><br>This is also the level where we can start turning into a giant crocodile or a brontosaurus. Man, the power creep towards the end is real.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat:<br>&#8211; Resilient (Con 15 -> 16)<br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/practical-guide-to-animal-shapes\/\">Animal Shapes<\/a><\/td><td>We\u2019re mostly grabbing Resilient for the proficiency at this point, but that proficiency will be applied to whatever huge Con score we get from our chosen form.<br><br>I\u2019m not going to do a better job of explaining Animal Shapes than Bea did. I will say, though, that you should definitely encourage each of your friends to come up with what their transformation sequence looks like. Maybe they all come out as different color variations on the animals.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Foresight<\/td><td>No concentration required, so just slap this Holy Grail of a spell on and enjoy winning for a whole day.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Timeless Body<br>Beast Spells<br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/true-polymorph-and-shapechange\/\">Shapechange<\/a><\/td><td>Honestly, I probably wouldn\u2019t ever cast this because it\u2019s not Foresight.<br><br>Beast Spells is awesome, though. You can now do some of your tricks without dropping form, allowing you to Healing Word people up with no concern at all for Wild Shape uses.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Feat: Mobile<br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; True Resurrection<\/td><td>Mobile is a great addition to your enormous arsenal of moon-related sticks, jewelry, and compact mirrors (for scrying, of course). All parts of the feat should apply while Wild Shaped. The extra movement is excellent for carrying things while grappling them as movement costs double when you do. <br><br>Dashing shouldn\u2019t really come into play, but it\u2019s nice to have if you prepare some different spells that make big areas of difficult terrain, you then plan on charging into, and the ability to walk away from things is <em>excellent<\/em>. Claw two things, grab them both, tail a third thing and walk away to roast your prizes safely on your Wall of Fire.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Archdruid<\/td><td>This is easily among the best capstones in the game. Now, as a Moon druid, you can Eternally be any animal you\u2019ve seen (still can\u2019t do animals you Make Up), and you can cast way more spells while in the forms. This is a little anti-synergistic because, now that you have infinite uses of wild shape, you mind way less dropping out of it to cast and then bonus action shifting back, but it still <em>feels<\/em> really good, which most class capstones don\u2019t.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction DnD Druids are known for a few things: casting nature-themed magic, having an animal companion (in this edition, sadly relegated to an optional class feature), and turning into animals to fight.

Of course, they can\u2019t use those features at the same time until very high levels, but that still makes for an incredibly powerful character.
