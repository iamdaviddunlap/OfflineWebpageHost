Similar to Rogue Talents or Barbarian Rage Powers, you get one at every even numbered Witch level. However, unlike Rogues, Barbarians, and many other classes with similar customization mechanics, Witches get a Hex at first level in addition to the typical every-even-level progression. This makes single-level class dips into Witch very appealing for many Hexes which don&#8217;t depend on a DC or scale with level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, Hexes can be used an infinite number of times in a day, which really extends the Witch&#8217;s usefulness beyond its spells per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hexes\">Hexes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Beast of Ill-Omen<\/span> (Su): Bane isn&#8217;t very good,\n\tand the penalty doesn&#8217;t scale with level. However, this can be thrown on your\n\tfamiliar long beforehand, and gives you a free single-target debuff, which is\n\tcool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Blight<\/span> (Su): Hugely situational, and not very\n\tgood even in situtions where it would apply.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cackle<\/span> (Su): Cackle&#8217;s effectiveness is\n\tdefined entirely by the effectiveness of the Hex you are extending. Agony is\n\tthe only applicable Hex from the Major Hex list, but it isn&#8217;t the best option.\n\tEvil Eye and Misfortune are the best options: their durations are short, but\n\ttheir effects are crippling. Extending the duration of these effects\n\tfunctionally multiplies the usefulness of those hexes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cauldron<\/span> (Ex): The Witch gets access to a\n\tfantastic list of spells, including Cure spells, so potions can be an\n\texcellent choice. You can also take this at first level and start pumping out\n\tpotions of Cure Light Wounds right off the bat. The +4 bonus to Craft\n\t(Alchemy) is just icing on the cake.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Charm<\/span> (Su): The duration is very short,\n\tand improving a targets disposition by one step isn&#8217;t much. Casting Charm\n\tPerson will yeild much better results. This can be extended with Cackle, which\n\tcan lead to you standing and cackling like a mad man while your new friend\n\tstares at you uncomfortably.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Child-Scent<\/span> (Ex): Unless you are playing\n\tpedo-bear or stealing puppies, this is not useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Coven<\/span> (Ex): Potentially useful for NPC\n\twitches or for cool roleplaying, but otherwise not very useful for players.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disguise<\/span> (Su): Excellent for infiltration,\n\tbut somewhat situational. Disguise Self isn&#8217;t on the Witch spell list, so this\n\tcan add an extra option otherwise not available to the Witch.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Evil Eye<\/span> (Su): Adding a -2 to attacks or\n\tsaving throws can be very debilitating. Even with a successful save, the\n\ttarget still takes the penalty for 1 round, which can really help weaken a\n\ttough enemy. Rules as written, you can extend the duration with Cackle even if\n\tthe target passes the initial save. Increasing the penalty to -4 makes this\n\teven better. However, you may find that you are often better served by casting\n\ta spell.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Feral Speech<\/span> (Su): Animals very rarely\n\thave anything interesting to discuss.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flight<\/span> (Su): The bonus to swim seems a\n\tlittle but out of place, but makes sense as flavor because you are supposedly\n\tlighter. Fly is not on the Witch spell list, and flight is crucial for\n\tspellcasters, especially at high levels. Splitting the duration into\n\tone-minute increments helps to stretch the usage throughout the day more than\n\tyou could expect from a single Fly spell. Keep in mind that you can still use\n\tFeather Fall at will to save any falling allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fortune<\/span> (Su): Because it costs your\n\tstandard action to use this, don&#8217;t expect to use this in combat. Instead, use\n\tit for skill checks on things like disabling traps, and on saving throws\n\tagainst ongoing effects outside of combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Healing<\/span> (Su): This provides a bit of free\n\thealing every day. While this is incredibly useful at first level, it will\n\tquickly be eclipsed by a Wand of Cure Light Wounds. The scaling at 5th level\n\tis a nice nod, but not enough to keep this relevant as your level\n\tincreases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Misfortune<\/span> (Su): Pick the biggest enemy in\n\tthe fight, and drop this on them in round one, then extend it with Cackle.\n\tRerolling every attack will greatly improve your party&#8217;s chances of survival,\n\tand rerolling saving throws will make the target considerably more vulnerable\n\tto effects of all kinds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nails<\/span> (Ex): You really shouldn&#8217;t be\n\tspending a lot of time in melee combat. However, this can be a good choice for\n\tclass dipping or for the Hexcrafter Magus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Steep<\/span> (Sp): Getting access to the\n\tPoison spell as early as 2nd level is great, but this is very difficult to\n\tbring into play. You need to find some way force your enemies to eat whatever\n\tyou poison. Granted, this could work pretty easily by throwing poisoned meat\n\tinto rooms with unintelligent (and hungry) monsters or animals.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Prehensile Hair<\/span> (Su): This is fantastic\n\tfor class dips for Rogues or characters focuses on natural weapons. I can&#8217;t\n\tthink of any other source which adds a Hair attack, so this is a great way way\n\tto add an extra attack to your full attacks. However, a typically witch will\n\thave trouble using this for anything but flavor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Scar<\/span> (Su): This has some interesting\n\toptions. The most obvious is to scar a recurring enemy, but a better option is\n\tto scar your allies. With the ability to cast Hexes on your allies from up to\n\ta mile away, you can use Hexes like Healing, Fortune, or Ward while you are\n\toff doing other things. Heck, you could sit outside while your party goes into\n\tthe dungeon and support them with Hexes at long range.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slumber<\/span> (Su): Single target save or suck.\n\tThe DC scales to keep pace with your spells, and affects creatures of any hit\n\tdie. There is no Witch for whom this is not a fantastic option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Swamp Hag<\/span> (Sp): Hugely situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tongues<\/span> (Su): Comprehend Language and\n\tTongues are situational, but come up frequently. Having both always available\n\tis nice, but both are already on the Witch&#8217;s spell list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Unnerve Beasts<\/span> (Su): Hugely situational, and\n\twill probably hurt you more than anyone else.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Lung<\/span> (Su): Hugely situational, but\n\tWater Breathing isn&#8217;t on the Witch spell list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ward<\/span> (Su): Throw this on your party&#8217;s\n\tDefender before and after every fight. Losing the bonus every time it is\n\tbypassed is annoying, but this can hugely reduce the subject&#8217;s need for a Ring\n\tof Protection or a Cloak of Resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"major-hexes\">Major Hexes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Agony<\/span> (Su): Nauseated largely disables the\n\ttarget, and makes them very vulnerable. However, Slumber puts things to sleep\n\tand will have the same save DC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beast Eye<\/span> (Su): Conceptually very cool,\n\tbut Arcane Eye is probably better. You do gain the animals senses, which is\n\tnice for Scent, but you don&#8217;t get control of the creature.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cook People<\/span> (Su): A one-hour duration is\n\tpretty great for spells like Bull&#8217;s Strength, which typically have durations\n\tin minutes per caster level. This duration makes it possible to replace\n\tability enhancing items, assuming you have enough bodies to keep your cookie\n\tjar full. Age resistance is already on the Witch spell list and has a\n\tconsiderably longer duration than one hour, so don&#8217;t waste your time on that\n\teffect. You might consider keeping cookies of Neutralize Poisong and Cure\n\tDisease hand because they don&#8217;t cost anything to create. Keep in mind that\n\tcooking and eating a sentient creature is generally considered an evil act, so\n\tcheck with your GM if your character is not evil.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hag&#8217;s Eye<\/span> (Su): Arcane Eye is a very solid\n\tdivination, but it&#8217;s already on the Witch spell list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hidden Home<\/span> (Sp): Very cool for NPC\n\twitches or for campaigns where you spend a lot of time in one place, but\n\totherwise not useful for a typical adventurer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hoarfrost<\/span> (Su): Horrifying and deadly, but\n\tbecause the damage only ticks once per minute, this is totally useless in\n\tcombat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ice Tomb<\/span> (Su): This can serve as either a\n\tsave or suck effect to disable and capture enemies, or as a suspended\n\tanimation effect to protect and preserve your allies. For strict combat\n\tpurposes, Slumber is better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Infected Wounds<\/span> (Su): Totally useless in\n\tcombat, and disease effects can be removed very easily, so this won&#8217;t be very\n\teffective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Major Healing<\/span> (Su): Free healing is always\n\tnice, but by this level, a Cleric will have Heal available, and you will get\n\tit before this Hex scales up to Cure Critical Wounds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Nightmares<\/span> (Su): Hugely situational. If you\n\tdislike someone enough to curse them with this, it&#8217;s generally better to just\n\tkill them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Retribution<\/span> (Su): This is great for big\n\tdamage-dealing monsters. It&#8217;s unfortunate that you or your allies need to take\n\tdamage for the Hex to take effect, but the reality of combat is that your\n\tallies are going to take damage at some point.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Speak in Dreams<\/span> (Sp): Situational, but\n\tvery cool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Vision<\/span> (Su): Entirely dependant on your\n\tGM.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Waxen Image<\/span> (Su): This is a cool way to\n\tcontrol or debuff a target. The individual effects aren&#8217;t super powerful, and\n\tspending a standard action to activate them is probably not as good as casting\n\ta spell, but the effects could be very powerful if used well. Consider making\n\tthe target move in combat to draw attacks of opportunity, or making your enemy\n\tstaggered before he can charge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weather Control<\/span> (Su): Situational, but\n\tpotentially very powerful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Witch&#8217;s Brew<\/span> (Ex): By this level, potions\n\tare usually not relevant. Also, many GMs allow the creation of multiple items\n\tin a day as a house rule because spening 8 hours to create one potion which\n\ttakes up 5% of the gold worth of magic items that you can create in a day\n\tseems completely ridiculous.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"grand-hexes\">Grand Hexes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Death Curse<\/span> (Su): By this level you have much\n\tmore effective save or suck effects which don&#8217;t allow three saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dire Prophecy<\/span> (Su): Good debuff; adds all\n\tof the potential penalties of Evil Eye simultaneously.\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eternal Slumber<\/span> (Su): Like Slumber on\n\tsteroids. This is an absolutely fantastic save or suck effect. Because you can\n\tuses Hexes as often as you like, you can just spam this against enemies until\n\tit works.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Forced Reincarnation<\/span> (Su): Hillarious, but\n\tvery unpredictable. You could just keep hitting your allies with this until\n\tthey are the race which they want to be, or your could just go around\n\treincarnating people into badgers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Life Giver<\/span> (Su): No big deal, just\n\tResurrection as a Standard Action with no material component.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Natural Disaster<\/span> (Su): Storm of Vengeange\n\tand Earthquake are both big, flashy spells, but they are complicated to use\n\twithout doing just as much damage to yourself and your party.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Spirit<\/span> (Sp): Ghosts are very\n\tpowerful, and if your GM is open-minded this can let you gain a very powerful\n\tally.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Witch&#8217;s Hut<\/span> (Su): Very cool. Great way to\n\tcarry your loot around, and a great way to gurantee that you always have a\n\tcomfortable place to sleep. However, not particularly powerful compared to\n\tother Grand Hexes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Hexes are a great way to customize your Witch.
