A few who understand the complexity of the battles that rage throughout the planes have taken up a dangerous path, entering into powerful pacts with the foulest abominations of the Lower Planes to turn evil against evil. These daring Summoners are Malconvokers, and they bargain with their lives. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Complete Scoundrel<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider looking through your new splatbook. You see a PrC for casters that loses a caster level. Already you think &#8220;This better have some great class abilities.&#8221;, you are ready to turn the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first level ability has a +1 metamagic added to spells for free. You think &#8220;That&#8217;s not enough to make this worthwhile&#8221; &#8211; if you weren&#8217;t bored you would have already gone to the next PrC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth level ability effectively doubles one of your specialty feats. You now think &#8220;Still not enough.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth level ability then <strong>adds +4 Metamagic to spells for free<\/strong> (that&#8217;s +5 levels of metamagic for free). You read it again &#8211; yes &#8211; that&#8217;s +5 metamagic levels to spells free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You must have been reading the Malconvoker.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many advantages to playing a Summoner, but if you are willing to focus completely on summoning &#8211; nothing beats a Malconvoker. You may not have the best HP, BAB, AC, or be as good at the other spells &#8211; but when it comes to Summoning &#8211; you will be king.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to the time I looked at the Malconvoker I was of the opinion that you should never consider a PrC that reduces your spellcasting level. The Malconvoker does this at level 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, level one of the Malconvoker gives an extend spell effect on all Summon Monster spells where you summon evil creatures as long as you beat their sense motive with a bluff (free action bluff)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth level of the Malconvoker gives a +2 to damage on all attacks and +2 HP\/HD to any evil creatures which were summoned with the first level ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth level of Malconvoker adds an extra creature when you summon an evil creature. <strong>That&#8217;s basically a free Twin Spell.<\/strong> If you use a Summon Monster to summon lesser level creatures, it works out closer to an empower spell (still very good).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a Wizard\/Cleric who pops off the occasional Summon Monster spell \u2013 this isn\u2019t a worthy trade. If you are a Wizard\/Cleric who specializes in Summon Monster spells \u2013 this is just too good to pass up.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-many-levels-should-i-take\">How many levels should I take?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Malconvoker is a 9 level PrC. The first 5 levels will focus primarily on Summon Monster spells, the final 4 levels focus more on Planar Binding spells. It is a decent choice for full 9 level progression \u2013 but there are options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best ability the Malconvoker gets is Infernal Legion at level 5, this makes level 5 an ideal breaking point if you want to pick up some different PrC levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Level 6 gives you (IMO) the best Planar Binding ability with Deceitful Bargaining. This gives a decent break point with lots of Summon Monster specialization, and decent boost to Planar Binding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Levels 7-9 are decent &#8211; nothing spectacular, but you aren&#8217;t losing spellcasting levels either &#8211; so it&#8217;s still solid.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"which-class-should-i-qualify-with\">Which class should I qualify with?<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"cleric\">Cleric<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Not a bad choice if you start with the Summoning domain. You will give up the wizard\u2019s alternate class features in exchange for a better AC and BAB. Take this if Summoning isn\u2019t your only focus. (Actually, one tactic that can be excellent for Cleric\/Malconvokers is to use Twin Spell or Repeat Spell metamagic along with Divine Metamagic for extra conjurations. It is a feat hungry build &#8211; but by high levels this can add up to quite a few creatures &#8211; at least comparable with the Master Specialist 10 option for Conjurers &#8211; thank you Sigfried for the suggestion)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; there is an alternate class ability in the Planar Handbook for Clerics at level 4 that allows turning of summoned creatures (which could be handy for failed bluff rolls) at a penalty of -3 levs for turning undead. This seems to me like an easy choice.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"wizard\">Wizard<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is my favourite option. Especially when using the various alternate class features which can improve Summon Monster spells. Obviously, you should specialize in Conjurer. If your DM does not allow the Rapid Summoning alternate class feature from UA \u2013 go with Cleric or archivist instead. It is that one option that makes the Wizard shine as a Malconvoker.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wizard-class-variants-to-takenot-to-take\">Wizard Class Variants to take\/not to take:<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Focused Specialist:<\/strong> I would not recommend this for most wizards going into high level campaigns, but since you will be memorizing at least 3 Summon Monster spells per level &#8211; this is actually a no-brainer. You do have to give up one more spell school (which hurts) &#8211; but alternate casting is the secondary purpose of your character.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhanced Summoning:<\/strong> You get Augment Summoning as a free feat at first level instead of Scribe Scroll. This is a no-brainer. If you continue Conjurer to level 5, your summons are harder to dispel (+2 caster level check). If you continue to level 10, your Augment Summoning bonuses improve to +6\/+6. Feel free to jump ship early on. The first level ability is the best.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapid Summoning:<\/strong>This is a must have. Yes, you must sacrifice Immediate Magic (which hurts), but you have no choice. You are a summoner first and foremost. Standard action Summon Monster spells are what makes the Conjurer Summoner better than the Cleric summoner.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spontaneous Summoning:<\/strong>This is a bad option. No need for spontaneous summoning &#8211; just memorize it. Your spells lose a whole level by using this variant &#8211; definitely not worth it at any level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"archivist\">Archivist<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is a pretty strong entry choice. You will be able to cast both Summon Monster and Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally (of course none of your Malconvoker abilities will extend to Summon Nature&#8217;s ally &#8211; but your Summoning feats\/items will). You will need to take one of the other methods to make your summoning rapid (Feats\/magic items). This just means more options when summoning &#8211; and options are always good. Dark Knowledge has excellent Synergy with Summoned Creatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think flavor-wise this is also a good option. A very nice mix with Malconvoker.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"wu-jen\">Wu Jen<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Not a bad option. You are looking at fewer spells to cast than a specialist wizard, and there&#8217;s no Rapid Spell variant, however, your DM might consider allowing Rapid Spell as an applicable spell secret since it&#8217;s a 1 level metamagic enhancement. This would have to be houseruled though &#8211; because in the RAW it isn&#8217;t offered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most attractive part of the Wu Jen would be the ability to reroll initiative rolls. That can be a big boost for a Summoner. (only if you are using Rapid Metamagic though)<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Can\u2019t qualify until level 7, and since you will be casting the same spell most of the time \u2013 spontaneous casting is less of an advantage. (you will actually have less castings than a focused specialist conjurer as well). However, Bluff is a class skill, and CHA will be high \u2013 which is an advantage to Bluff and to Planar Binding spells. (Bonzai also points out that Sorcerers can get the summoning domain with a 5th level substitution level in CC. This gives all the spells of the domain and the +2 CL for Conjuration (Summoning) spells). The thing to think about with the sorcerer\/wizard choice is this: Do I want the CHA, or the Rapid Summoning? My personal preference is for the standard action castings &#8211; but there is definitely a counter-argument to be had.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Options: Some other options exist in the Splatbooks (such as favoured soul) \u2013 none are particularly better suited than the above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose one of the non-conjurer options, or your DM does not allow Unearthed Arcana material (Rapid summoning variant in particular). Then take the Rapid spell feat, use Metamagic School Focus (Conjuration) to power it 3 times\/day. At higher levels, Arcane Thesis can give you unlimited uses with SM IX and VIII for example.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-not-to-take\">What NOT to take<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>(Just because you &#8220;can&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean you &#8220;should&#8221;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/span>: Yep, the Bard can qualify by level 7. However, you won&#8217;t get many summon spells per day, you will get lower level summon spells, and you will never get access to Summon Monster VII, VIII, or IX. Buffing abilities aside, this makes the Bard a sub-par summoner.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beguiler\/True Necromancer\/Warmage etc<\/span>: This applies to any arcane caster that does not have Summon Monster III on their casting list. The &#8220;trick&#8221; of course is to take the Arcane Disciple feat with the Summoning Domain which will give access to SM III. Of course you won&#8217;t get access to SM VI, VIII, or IX &#8211; and the rest you can only cast once per day. Always a terrible option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"should-i-go-into-another-prc\">Should I go into another PrC?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>What other PrC\u2019s mesh nicely with Malconvoker?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is any that boost Summon Monster\/Conjuration\/Planar binding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Thaumaturgist (DMG):<\/strong> Extend spell metamagic on all Summon Monster spells for free is nice (but not huge at high levels)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Master Specialist (CM):<\/strong> The 4th level grants your caster level to HP of summoned creatures, level 10 allows you to quicken 3 standard action spells\/day. If you have the Rapid Spell conjurer variant \u2013 that\u2019s your Summon Monster spells<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Paragnostic Apostle (CC):<\/strong> Can give all your summons Fast Healing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fatespinner (CA):<\/strong> Have your summoned creature reroll its Sense Motive with &#8220;fickle finger of fate&#8221;, or you could just reroll your Bluff with &#8220;resist fate&#8221;- or, if necessary, both. Works for opposed CHA rolls for Planar Binding spells too. Furthermore &#8211; you can add spin to your Bluff checks too. Break at level 4 for maximum synergy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Archmage (DMG):<\/strong> Originally I didn&#8217;t think so &#8211; then I thought of using every High Arcana to switch the Malconvoker&#8217;s highest spell slots for Summon Monster SLA&#8217;s. With 2 uses per day each &#8211; that&#8217;s a whole lot more SM VIII&#8217;s and IX&#8217;s. Qualifying for the PrC is easy enough. A dip into MS gets you Skill Focus (Spellcraft), you already have Spell Focus (Conjuration)&#8230;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sacred Exorcist (CD): <\/strong>Too easy to qualify for, regardless of base class. A nice scaling unnamed bonus to various rolls against evil outsiders that includes BLUFF. First level gives you Turn Undead &#8211; allowing the non-clerics to take the various divine feats and such. Some other nice features too. Worthy for a 1 level dip &#8211; or a 10 level marathon swim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"not-as-good-as-it-sounds\">Not as good as it sounds:<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Nar Demonbinder (UE):<\/strong> Unfortunately, although the flavor of this class is perfect, the mechanics for spellcasting hurt you too badly to be worth it. You will give up 9th level spells completely, and you will get 1 casting of an 8th level spell. When you go back to your previous class &#8211; you are building on your spellcasting from before you took the PrC &#8211; making 15th level your best spellcaster progression. Ouch!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ultimate Magus (CM):<\/strong> You can actually combine Ultimate Magus with Nar Demonbinder to make a half decent summoning build. I&#8217;ve actually charted out the spellcasting for this build &#8211; and although it holds its own &#8211; it isn&#8217;t your best bet. If you are in love with the Ultimate Magus (many are) &#8211; it is do-able.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"never-take\"><strong>Never<\/strong><strong> take:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Alienist:<\/strong> You just removed all evil Summons from your Summon Monster list.

Get enough to qualify for Malconvoker \u2013 then Max it out.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Languages:<\/strong> Infernal and Abyssal, plus Ignan, Terran, Auran, Aquan and Celestial. Languages are important for communicating with your summoned creatures. You will get Infernal and Celestial to qualify for Malconvoker &#8211; but I would suggest adding Abyssal and Terran as an absolute minimum. If you have a high INT build &#8211; get all the extraplanar languages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Knowledges:<\/strong> The Planes and Arcana. A bit of knowledge in what you do.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spellcraft:<\/strong> Good for any caster. Especially for you &#8211; it fortifies your Magic Circle for planar binding spells.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Concentration:<\/strong> Also good for any caster. If you don\u2019t have the Wizard \u2013 rapid spell variant \u2013 then this is twice as important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"malconvoker-feats\">Malconvoker Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>See the Summoning Handbook thread above. In addition:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summon Elemental (CM):<\/strong> Any summoner should take this Reserve feat as soon as it&#8217;s available (CM). This grants a standard action Elemental Summoning. The Elemental will be Small, Medium or Large depending on the level of the summoning spell you use to power it &#8211; and will last 1 round\/level per level of the spell used to power. See my &#8220;Fun with Summon Elemental&#8221; rant at the beginning of the Summon Monster section.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved Initiative (PHB):<\/strong> is nice to have in conjunction with Rapid Summoning. It gives your boys a better chance to hit the enemy flat footed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practiced Spellcaster (CA):<\/strong> Get that spellcasting level you lost back<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cloudy Conjuration (CM):<\/strong> Nice ability &#8211; summon the creature beside the opponent and cover your opponent in sickening smoke for free. Keep in mind that you just granted them concealment (though the right summons ignore that).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Demon Mastery (FC I):<\/strong> Gives +1 CL for summoning demons and +2 on the CHA check on Planar Binding spells. By RAW the +2 should apply to all Planar Bindings whether they be demon or not &#8211; but best make sure your DM understands that before you take the feat. (Thanks to Sir Agenon for the suggestion and to Nanshork for pointing out the +2 bonus is good for any Planar Binding by RAW)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fiendish Summoning Specialist (PH): <\/strong>Allows you to add one evil creature per level to your summon monster spells. It will require you to be of non-good alignment though (restricting you to the neutral alignments). (Planar Handbook) &#8211; (thanks to Roccu for this suggestion &#8211; very good!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Item Familiar (UA):<\/strong> This feat is a variant from Unearthed Arcana. It allows you to &#8220;invest&#8221; 3 skill points into a magic item, in return the item grants a +1 unnamed bonus to any skill you choose (How about &#8220;Bluff&#8221;?). You can keep increasing the bonus up to your actual rank in the skill &#8211; so that can create a HUGE bluff score if you are willing to sacrifice your other skills. (Thanks Neomikelch for this suggestion)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Divine Metamagic (CD):<\/strong> If you are a Cleric &#8211; and combine this with Twin or Repeat spell &#8211; (or potentially both) you can get a lot of summoned creatures onto the board. If your DM allows Nightsticks &#8211; this is easily as good as the other DMM\/Nightstick abuses. Without nightsticks &#8211; it is still viable on a lesser level. An archivist could qualify if Sacred Exorcist levels are taken.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Divine Accuracy (LM):<\/strong> Any Cleric or Malconvoker that has multiclassed with Sacred Exorcist can easily qualify for this very impressive feat that will allow you to exchange a turn attempt for re-rolls on missed attacks by you and your allies. Since summoned creatures sometimes have a decent miss chance &#8211; and you have multiples on the map &#8211; this becomes exceedingly good.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Chain Spell:<\/strong> Can&#8217;t be used for summoning &#8211; but can be used for Buffs &#8211; an Archivist might consider chaining a Magic Fang spell for example.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapid Spell: (CD)<\/strong> If you don&#8217;t have Rapid Summoning &#8211; this is the way to get Standard Action castings. You will need to combine it with DMM or Metamagic School or some other trick to be used without decreasing spell level though.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Metamagic School: (CM):<\/strong> Reduce the cost of Metamagic to conjuration spells by one three times\/day. No minimum level increase &#8211; so works with Rapid Spell. However &#8211; also useful with Extend Spell at low levels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arent-spirit-shamans-and-druids-better-summoners\">Aren&#8217;t Spirit Shamans and Druids better summoners?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The belief comes from the comparison of Summon Monster vs Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two spell chains have different strengths:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally:<\/strong> Most offense and HP as soon as possible<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Summon Monster:<\/strong> More defense (DR\/resistances), more INT, more SLA creatures, more choices.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see many creatures on the Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally list show up on the next level of Summon Monster (For example &#8211; the wolf appears on the Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally I list, but on the Summon Monster II list). The only difference is that the Fiendish\/Celestial template is added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This template adds to neither TO HIT or to DAMAGE which means that in combat &#8211; well &#8211; you do the math.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does add to INT however (makes INT 0, 1 or 2 animals\/vermin into INT 3 magical beasts). This means the creature can understand the summoner (by RAW they understand common)- allowing the summoner to issue direct commands; &#8220;Attack that guy&#8221;, &#8220;Grapple&#8221;, &#8220;Grab that weapon off the ground&#8221;, or &#8220;Come defend me.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animals from Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally can be directed with &#8220;Animal Handling&#8221;, but this requires a skill check, doesn&#8217;t occur until the next round, and has a limited list available. Even with Speak With Animals, it is likely the DM will restrict you to the normal actions an animal can be directed to do, though you should be able to avoid the skill check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you go to the higher level spells &#8211; this ceases to happen. In fact &#8211; you will see Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally lists become smaller and smaller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In either Eberron or FR (not greyhawk) there are also more feats available to enhance creatures summoned with Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally. Greenbound (FR) is especially potent at low levels &#8211; making animal summons much tougher than their Summon Monster counterparts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At higher levels these feats become less of a factor. Greenbound only works with animals (there are less and less available at higher levels) and prevents some of the better buffs (such as Animal Growth).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the basic truth behind Summoners: At low levels, Spirit Shamans and Druids are your best summoners. If you go Malconvoker though, at level 10 the Malconvoker build makes the better summoner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My suggestion is that a Summon Monster specialist hold off on summoning until Summon Monster III is available, focusing more on their other spells. From levels 5-9, summoning will be good &#8211; but not great. At level 10, it will become great &#8211; and remain so for the rest of the campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course with an Archivist you get the best of both worlds &#8211; as long as you can get the Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally spells into your prayer book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So &#8211; if your campaign is going to level 9 and that&#8217;s it &#8211; then you are better off focusing on Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally &#8211; beyond that level &#8211; Summon Monster is where it&#8217;s at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an added note &#8211; Fiendish creatures that previously had an INT score of 0 (vermin) receive Feats and Skills. There is no set way to determine what these feats and skills should be. Ask your DM &#8211; they should probably choose those feats (if they let you pick &#8211; welcome to broken stinky cheese).<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-so-great-about-summoning-anyways\">What&#8217;s so great about summoning anyways?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons to play a Malconvoker. First and foremost &#8211; maybe you like the flavor. I love the very idea of the Malconvoker &#8211; playing a dangerous game with dark forces of great power. But let&#8217;s forget that &#8211; these are the Char Op boards. So in the context of that &#8211; this is why summoning (specifically with a Malconvoker) is great:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A Malconvoker can substitute for a party fighter-type:<\/strong> The casting should be a standard action &#8211; and then you have huge expandable blobs of HP blocking you and your precious caster allies from the baddies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Malconvokers are masters of Battlefield control <\/strong>&#8211; Whether you want to Grapple, Bull Rush, Sunder, or Trip &#8211; there is a summoned monster that can do it. How&#8217;s a grapple score of +52 sound to you? You can get this with a summoned monster &#8211; without any buffing at all. Oh yeah &#8211; and you get two of them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Malconvoker can substitute for the party scout:<\/strong> At mid to high levels &#8211; those low level Summon Monsters have to be good for something. You can summon creatures with excellent Hide\/Move silently\/Spot\/Listen and search checks. Many also have tremorsense or blindsense for picking up invisible foes. Have them check stuff out for you &#8211; then report back. You&#8217;ve got great durations. Oh yeah &#8211; can your party scout glide through walls? You should have gotten the Malconvoker to send an earth elemental through &#8211; have him come back and report.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Malconvoker has spell versatility:<\/strong> Really you do. Check out the lists below for some of the Spell Like Abilities available to summoned monsters. Summon the one you need &#8211; and have it cast the spell for you. For example &#8211; how many Walls of Ice can a 14th level Conjurer cast? If you said 2\/round for 15 rounds for a total of 30, you would be wrong (if that conjurer happens to be a Malconvoker)- because the Malconvoker does that with one SM VII (Ice Devilx2), and he has 3 memorized &#8211; so 90 would actually be the correct number.<br><br>Oh &#8211; wait &#8211; I forgot Deceptive Summons. Make that 180. That&#8217;s without any magic item enhancements.<br><br>And the SLA&#8217;s available are nearly endless &#8211; and since you don&#8217;t have to pick which creature (S) you are summoning until you cast the spell &#8211; that&#8217;s spell versatility.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Malconvoker can check for traps:<\/strong> While the term &#8220;trapmonkey&#8221; is normally a metaphorical term &#8211; to you it&#8217;s literal. Oh those poor celestial monkeys.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Malconvoker saves the Cleric healing spells:<\/strong> There is no better way to get an opponent&#8217;s attention off you than to grapple him with a summoned creature. The enemy attacks the creature &#8211; and at the end of the combat &#8211; if the creature is still alive &#8211; you dismiss it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Malconvoker can do great damage to opponents:<\/strong> Check out the Fiendish tiger. Now pretend you summon 2 with Fiendish legion at level 10. Buff them both up with Augment\/Infernal fury. Summon them on either side of your opponent &#8211; and have them both charge &#8211; gaining 5 attacks each (one with flanking bonus). Work out the damage. Yeah &#8211; it&#8217;s huge. Next round they&#8217;ll keep attacking and the damage will keep coming.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Malconvokers are good against all opponents:<\/strong> If the opponent is a flyer &#8211; summon 2 Giant Wasps, if the opponent is Aquatic, summon 2 giant sharks, if the opponent is burrowing, summon 2 Dire Weasels, If the opponent is a spellcaster, summon high SR creatures, etc etc etc. The Summon Monster list is big at all levels. Lots to choose from for any occasion.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-two-main-focuses-of-the-malconvoker\">The two main focuses of the Malconvoker:<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summon-monster-spells\">Summon Monster Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Malconvoker\u2019s abilities most strongly work to enhance these spells. Deceptive Summons at level 1, Infernal Fury at level 4, Infernal Legion at level 5, Resistance at level 7, and Safe Summoning at level 9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hint:<\/strong> When using Infernal Fury you can place both creatures anywhere in your range. Use them to flank your opponent and both full attack \u2013 with flanking bonuses. Or even better \u2013 have the critters on opposite sides of your opponent \u2013 but have one of them 10\u2019 away. Have the one that is 10\u2019 away charge (getting charge and flanking bonuses) and the other just attack (with flank).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously you should take all 9. Always have many of these spells memorized \u2013 no spell is better for you than this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the nature of the Malconvoker \u2013 evil creatures tend to be your best summon. After 5 levels in Malconvoker \u2013 Evil creatures will almost always be your best bet.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"planar-binding-spells\">Planar Binding Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>These are great spells I would suggest that a Malconvoker use even if they break from the class at level 5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some major considerations you must make. Especially if you are a Conjurer\/Malconvoker:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must have access to Abjuration in order to use Planar Binding spells (For Magic Circle against evil)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enchantment school is very helpful (multiple spells will help you in your opposed CHA check &#8211; some might help you avoid it altogether)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Necromancy school has similar bonuses to Enchantment (although less so)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you play a Specialist wizard or a Focused specialist wizard &#8211; never give up Abjuration or Enchantment. Necromancy is less important, but still helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fun-with-summon-elemental-reserve-feat\">Fun with Summon Elemental Reserve Feat:<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>So I said in the Feat section you should definitely take this. You want it in your level 9 feat slot &#8211; so plan for it. Why is it so great anyways?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All reserve feats tend to work in a specific way &#8211; they tend to copy the spell they are powered by, only much less potent, and often less versatile. However &#8211; they can be used over and over again &#8211; as a SU ability. In order to make a Reserve feat worthwhile &#8211; you must exploit the &#8220;infinite use&#8221; part as much as you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, when you use the feat &#8211; the elemental will be neutral &#8211; so you won&#8217;t get Infernal Fury, Infernal Legion, Deceptive Summons etc. It does however benefit from your Augment Summoning ability &#8211; this is quite useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does have a lot going for it for a &#8220;non-spell&#8221; if you think about it. Both for Combat Use as well as Utility Use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you first get the feat &#8211; you will be powering it with a level 4 summon spell (Um &#8211; probably SM IV). It will be a standard action to use &#8211; last for 4 rounds, be a small elemental, and you can only have one at a time. So what do you do with that?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use the Earth Elemental to glide through the walls, floor, or ceiling if they are rock and report what&#8217;s on the other side.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the Earth Elemental to open any doors\/chests etc you think might be trapped.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the Earth Elemental to test hallways you think might be trapped.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the Water Elemental to check out the &#8220;Murky Water&#8221; that seems to be in every dungeon.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the Water Elemental&#8217;s Drench ability to put out fires and magical fires<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the Fire Elemental to start Large fires<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Combat: Use any elemental to flank<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Combat: Use the Earth or Air Elemental to &#8220;Aid Another&#8221; on attacks or AC (90% to succeed)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Combat: Use the Earth Elemental to Bull Rush &#8211; with a touch attack it will likely hit &#8211; the Bull Rush is a long shot of succeeding though &#8211; but the chance isn&#8217;t that bad (Total Bull Rush +2)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Combat: Use any elemental to provoke the attacks of opportunity from your enemy &#8211; now your allies and summoned creatures are no longer in danger unless the enemy has combat Reflexes. A way to open up your enemy for a Grapple Attempt by a summoned creature.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once the Spell that Powers the Feat is 6th level or higher &#8211; the Elemental becomes Medium Sized:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Bull rush of the Earth Elemental becomes reasonably good. (Total Bull Rush +8)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chance to Aid Another is now 95% (fails on a one only)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once the Spell that powers the Feat is 8th level or higher &#8211; the Elemental becomes Large:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Bull Rush now pretty good (+14 modifier)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elemental now has DR 5\/-<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Technically &#8211; you can use an Air or Water elemental to do the vortex\/whirlwind and move enemies. In more drastic situations &#8211; you can have it move you &#8211; though you will take a bit of damage from this maneuver.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In all cases the Elemental will not be an overly impactful combatant &#8211; it&#8217;s just too weak for the level in which you are when you get it. However &#8211; lots of useful things to do with them &#8211; both inside and outside of combat. Not a feat for use when you are fighting the BBEG &#8211; but against his minions &#8211; this can save you spells while still giving some Battlefield control, minor buffing, as well as attracting enemy attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your &#8220;To Hit&#8221; will never be high enough to use these elementals for straight combat &#8211; in many cases you will need a 20 to hit. If you do want to make &#8220;attack&#8221; maneuvers &#8211; attempt Trips and Bull Rushes. The touch attack makes it much easier for you to hit, and opposed STR checks give you a chance of success (on things like Grapple or Disarm where BAB is added &#8211; you have no realistic chance). Remember &#8211; your STR and CON are higher than the MM version by 4 each (Augment Summoning), this will give a measurable boost.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summon-monster-spells\">Summon Monster Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summon-monster-i\">Summon Monster I<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>For non-core summonable creatures &#8211; please check <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150108134347\/http:\/\/forums.gleemax.com\/showthread.php?p=14042017#post14042017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">THIS<\/a> out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Things to know about SM I:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combat: A dog or a badger are decent combatants when you are levels 1 or 2, but at higher levels they are more for flanking\/aiding another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(A nice tactic is after your original summons are engaging the enemy \u2013 cast a SM I, pick Dire Rat, have them flank your summon\u2019s opponent, and have them \u201cAid another\u201d. That\u2019s +4 for your main summon to hit.) Their own damages will be too small to have any effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid summoning these against opponents with Cleave!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small monstrous spider can web a medium creature. Even though the webs aren\u2019t strong \u2013 they take a standard action to remove. That has use even at high levels (provided they can hit).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside Combat: At mid-high levels the SMI spell ceases to be much use in combat beyond aiding\/flanking (and with Malconvoker 5, your summoned creatures are probably already flanking)\u2013 however there are other uses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main ones are probe\/trap monkeys. Monstrous Spiders have tremorsense and can detect invisible foes for you. Celestial Monkeys make trapmonkey a non-metaphorical term, as they can turn handles and open chests. Poor celestial monkey. Dire rats are excellent scouts with hide\/move silently\/spot and listen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed with the Malconvoker: The Spiders will be most useful to you in combat (as a secondary spell) bring them in to flank or to web. Tremorsense find hidden foes. Use Dire rats for scouts or aid\/flank buddies. With Deceptive summons they should have time to do the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treantmonk\u2019s favourite: The Fiendish spider \u2013 it\u2019s OK off the bat \u2013 webbing remains good for a few more levels. Tremorsense will be useful for a long time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wasted our time with: The Scorpion.

It blows, but might have some use if fighting within a darkness spell, inside a fire, or against a poisonous foe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combat: Your best two combatants at this level are the riding dog and the wolf. The riding dog does a bit more damage\/better to hit, the wolf has Trip. The large centipede has a not bad grapple if grappling is what you want to do (it will provoke an AoO). Medium spiders can web up to large foes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside Combat: Not much here unless you are out of SM I, in which case the medium spider can fulfill the role of the small easy enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed with the Malconvoker: The wolf becomes the best combatant, but purely secondary compared to what you can summon with higher level spells. The wolf (augmented) has a +5 to hit and a +3 trip modifier. If you think this can help \u2013 throw them in as a secondary summons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treantmonk\u2019s favourite: The Fiendish wolf. The first battlefield control summons. Wolf\u2019s trip ability saves an otherwise poor SM level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wasted our time with: The Celestial giant bee.

A Dretch doesn\u2019t match up to a fiendish ape, but it can cast a stinking cloud and then scare, and then enter combat \u2013 with 3 attacks\/round. This is the first level that elementals become available. Summon Monster III is one of the best Summon Monster spells for its level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combat: Before Malconvoker, the Celestial Bison is a star. Afterwards, Fiendish ape. If you want Improved Grab, you have two options at this level \u2013 the croc is usually the stronger choice of the two. At this level some creatures have DR 5\/magic and some don&#8217;t. The ones that do are the Celestial Bison, the Fiendish Ape, the Fiendish Huge Centipede, and the Fiendish Dire Bat. Keep this in mind when thinking about HP of your summons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside Combat: Earth elementals can glide through walls, come back, and tell you what they saw. If you have pyromaniac tendencies, the fire elemental\/hellhound burn stuff real good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed with the Malconvoker: Got to like the fiendish ape. Great chance to hit, 3 attacks\/round, good HP. If you want size, the centipede is HUGE, this is your strongest bet for pure grapple score. Constrictors and Crocs both get Improved Grab if you don\u2019t want to provoke an AoO. The Crocs stats are better, but the constrictor does better damage once the grapple is in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treantmonk\u2019s favourite: The Fiendish ape. Why do I like the ape more than the bison? Well, statistically it\u2019s almost as good (HP suffers a bit), but you get 3 attacks, it can pick up stuff, and it\u2019s evil. (Better for after Malconvoker levels)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wasted our time with: The Fiendish Boar. This doesn\u2019t nearly stack up to the Bison or the Ape \u2013 what were they thinking?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Celestial black bear<\/strong> &#8211; 3 HD Medium magical beast, HP:25, To hit:+8 Not very impressive \u2013 go with the bison or ape.

For straight combat SM IV does not shine above SM III as it did over the previous level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combat: For charging the celestial lion is terrific. Dire wolves get Trip (with a decent score) and good HP. Howlers get the terrific quills (and they are stackable). Against one BBEG, the howlers are the way to go. Against multiples \u2013 the dire wolf is better. If DR of the opponent is a problem \u2013 Lantern Archons ignore it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside Combat, or non melee combat aids: Lantern archons are stuffed with useful SLA\u2019s, and if summoned close can protect your party with aura of menace and magic circle against evil. If you are approaching large groups of enemies \u2013 a yeth hound can be sent 305\u2019 ahead and bay. That\u2019s a 300 radius spread!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed with the Malconvoker: Summoning 2 dire wolves that begin in flank and both are making trip attempts is huge. Even after SMV is available this is a strong option. If the opponent is very large \u2013 then go with howlers. The quills stack, and those -1\u2019s add up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treantmonk\u2019s favourite: The howler. Once you can summon 2 at a time those quills add up. I love that they lower saves too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wasted our time with: The Celestial Giant Owl.

The attack only does 1d6 and has a not great chance of hitting (2 per round with full attack), it is ranged however and ignores DR. Against a high DR critter this could be a good summons \u2013 but don\u2019t count on the +2 attack to hit very often. More of a defensive choice (for the magic circle and the aura) than an offensive one.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Celestial giant owl <\/strong>&#8211; 4 HD Large magical beast, HP:34, To hit:+9 Go with either the giant eagle or the giant wasp.

The constrictor snake is now your best all round grappler though (for the first time).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside Combat, or non melee combat aids: Lots here.

(thanks to Ancillary for pointing out that they can&#8217;t be used to counterspell though. Oops.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treantmonk\u2019s favourite: Bone Devils.

The invisibility has been overrated IMO.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fiendish monstrous centipede, colossal(0)<\/strong> &#8211; 24 HD Colossal magical beast, HP:312, to hit: +20 Yes \u2013 it\u2019s colossal. You can now grapple with a +44. HP are very good. Attack is OK (tiger is better). Poison DC is now 25. Not your best melee option \u2013 but the grapple score is great (you can now hope to succeed grappling huge opponents).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fiendish dire tiger(+1)<\/strong> &#8211; 16 HD Large magical beast, HP:240, to hit:+22 This is a nice charge summon. With large size it will only grapple Med or smaller opponents \u2013 but 5 charge attacks \u2013 4 of them will be +24 to hit. Not your best choice against high DR creatures though since the attacks are spread out so much.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fiendish monstrous spider, gargantuan(0)<\/strong> &#8211; 16 HD Gargantuan magical beast, HP:224, To hit:+17 Can web any size creature now.

If the DR is a problem for the Dire Tiger \u2013 this guy can probably pound through it. Yeah \u2013 that\u2019s 630 HP of summons in one spell \u2013 nice.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Vrock (demon)(+16)<\/strong> &#8211; 10 HD Large outsider, HP:190, To hit:+17 5 attacks\/round.

Disappointing really. You might want to summon 1d3 SM VIII\u2019s for combat. (Except I always roll a one!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combat: Because of Malconvoker you want to stick with evil. However, elementals would otherwise be your best bet. For evil \u2013 if you have room, colossal spiders are good, as are gargantuan scorpions. Bebiliths get rend armor which is always good. Hezrou\u2019s get stench and Improved Grab.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside Combat or non-melee combat abilities: Leonal\u2019s wall of force at will is worth individual mention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed with the Malconvoker: Bebiliths become your best combat choices unless you have lots of room (in which case, go with your bugs). HP aren\u2019t as great as they might be, but mixed with Augment, Infernal Fury, and a ring of mighty summons \u2013 the HP will be multiple hundreds anyways. (Assuming Caster level 20, Bebilith has 260 HP). If space is an issue \u2013 the Barbed devil is a decent combatant for a medium creature (HP will be around 220), and has a nice fear effect (will save 20)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deserving special mention: If you have the room \u2013 a Colossal Spider summoned with infernal fury (so easy at this level), a ring of mighty summons, and at least 4 levels of Master Specialist by a 20th level caster (your caster level for summons may be higher than this at 18th level) will have 468 HP. You can summon 2 with one spell \u2013 that\u2019s almost 1000 HP of creature summoned with one spell. This puts summon elemental monolith to shame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treantmonk\u2019s favourite: Fiendish Colossal Monstrous Spider \u2013 The spider starts and ends the list. They tend to be a weak choice in between \u2013 but look at it this level \u2013 that\u2019s tough. Colossal size can be a problem though. Still, when you get the opportunity to summon a pair of these \u2013 it will be worth the wait.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wasted our time with: Couatl, Green Slaad, Night Hag. What are any of these doing in SM IX? Night hag should be SM VII!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Couatl<\/strong> &#8211; 9 HD Large outsider, HP:108, To hit:+14 Use magic device +15 \u2013 that\u2019s about the best of it.

Decent protection choice (Protective aura 20\u2019, +4 deflection, +4 resistance \u2013 both vs evil, lesser globe of invulnerability, magic circle against evil.) SLA highlights: At will: Wall of force, polymorph. 3\/day: Cure critical wounds, neutralize poison, remove disease. 1\/day: Heal. CL 10. Has Roar ability: 60\u2019 cone holy word spell.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Celestial roc<\/strong> &#8211; 18 HD Gargantuan magical beast, HP:306, to hit:+23 Obviously a possible all-party transport (if you need it at this level).

Rend armor is good against heavily armoured foes (If you can hit them at all \u2013 claw attacks +16 \u2013 you must hit with both). Poison is DC 26 and delivered with the +21 bite attack. Not a bad combat choice.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fiendish monstrous spider, colossal(0)<\/strong> &#8211; 32 HD Colossal magical beast, HP:448, To hit:+28 Poison DC 30 (Str 2d8 loss) is very strong. Grapple is best of entire list at +52. 30\u2019 reach. HP will be highest you can get too (896 HP on one summon spell). These are a lot better than the centipedes of last level. Great melee choice \u2013 if you can find the room.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hezrou (demon)(+2)<\/strong> &#8211; 10 HD Large outsider, Sense Motive , HP:213, To hit:+16 Stench is a good ability. DC 26 Fort or be nauseated (any creature within 10\u2019).

id=\"general-guidelines-for-nonsummoning-spells-and-how-they-work-with-your-summoned-creatures\">General guidelines for non-summoning spells and how they work with your summoned creatures.<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the most general guidelines I can give:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summoned Monsters are intended to keep your enemies away from you, to eat up their attacks, to prevent their attacks, and ultimately to kill or incapacitate them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are intended to be expendable &#8211; never forget that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A SM that dies has done its job for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vision Obscurement:<\/strong> The spells which cause vision obscurement are too many to mention, but include fog\/mist\/darkness spells most commonly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can be very helpful spells. Most fog\/mist spells will reduce enemy vision to 5&#8242;. If the SM is all they can see &#8211; it is likely that is what they will attack. This is good for you and your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore &#8211; SM with Blindsense or Tremorsense (Bats, Scorpions, Spiders) will be able especially effective in these environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Movement reductions:<\/strong> The spells which prevent or slow movement from your enemies can also be very helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These spells will encourage opponents to focus on the opponents that are closer. It is your job to ensure said opponent is a SM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned before &#8211; any attack on a SM is an attack that was not made on your allies (and even more importantly &#8211; you)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Offensive Buffing:<\/strong> The spells which make your SM better offensively are also very useful for obvious reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polymorph is the king of these buffs. For a quick example consider a Gargantuan Centipede (SM VI) might be turned into a 12-headed hydra &#8211; giving 11 extra attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haste is probably #2 &#8211; but may be #1 if you have lots of summoned creatures on the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that Str buffs do not stack with augment summoning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Defensive Buffing:<\/strong> For the most part I would suggest that this isn&#8217;t worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is your SM job to take damage after all, and they are all easily replaced. Mage Armor IS very cheap though (and at high levels, Mage Armor &#8211; mass is also quite cheap) and gives a +4 AC that will be stackable with almost any SM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would suggest any Defensive buff that is not at least 2 levels lower than the slot used to summon the creature in the first place is a waste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healing:<\/strong> This is pretty much always a terrible choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save your healing for your allies. Your summons are going to disappear soon anyways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving an extra round or two through healing isn&#8217;t going to pay off in the long run. (The exception might be a &#8220;Heal&#8221; spell on a SM IX that is taking loads of HP damage over an extended period. That&#8217;s about it)<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summon-monster-and-your-other-spells\">Summon Monster and your other spells:<\/h4>\n\n\n<p><strong>Generalizations:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fog\/Mist spells<\/strong>: These all are great when combined with Spiders, Scorpions and Dire Bats. Your opponents can&#8217;t see &#8211; but they can.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Call Zelekhut, Call Marut, Call Kolyarut:<\/strong> See my MYTHS section. These are inferior spells &#8211; honest! Your summoned monsters are much tougher at the same level &#8211; your planar bindings last much longer &#8211; and neither require XP.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 1:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Grease:<\/strong> Use your Summoned Grappler to grapple the enemy &#8211; then cast a grease underneath them to watch the pair grappling on the ground. This makes it twice as hard as the BBEG that has a good grapple score to dispatch your creature as the grapple gets re-engaged and re-engaged again.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mage Armor:<\/strong> In a wand this is great (since duration of 1\/hr is plenty). Your summoned creatures have Dex and Nat armor, but no actual armor. Mage armor is perfectly stackable with any of them. Not bad at all.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Obscuring Mist:<\/strong> Any of the mist\/fog spells work great when combined with creatures that use Blindsense\/Tremorsense. That includes all the Fiendish Scorpions, Spiders and Dire Bats. Now they can see your opponent, but your opponent can&#8217;t see them (Or you)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Benign Transposition:<\/strong> This spell is so incredibly useful for a summoner it isn&#8217;t funny. Your pal is in the jaws of the Purple Worm &#8211; ready to be swallowed whole? Switch him with your perfectly willing first level summoned creature. Unfortunately for the Purple Worm &#8211; that creature will be like chinese food &#8211; he&#8217;ll be hungry again a few rounds later. Any time you want to get an ally out of harm&#8217;s way &#8211; this spell mixed with a summoned monster is HUGE. Keep in mind that you can switch yourself with a summoned creature with this spell too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 2:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fog Cloud:<\/strong> See obscuring mist<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Glitterdust:<\/strong> Throw this on the combat in which your Spider, Scorpion or Dire Bat is involved. Everyone gets blinded &#8211; of course your summoned creatures have other ways of sensing your opponents.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Web: <\/strong>To be used when your opponents decide they would like to leave the vicinity of your summoned creatures. (*Nice* &#8211; my DM has houseruled that spiders can traverse web spells. That makes this spell extra tasty. Ask your DM today)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Baleful Transposition:<\/strong> So who actually wants to switch places with the enemy caster and be completely surrounded by his bodyguard. Your summoned creature &#8211; that&#8217;s who.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Chain of Eyes:<\/strong> This is a useful &#8220;scouting&#8221; spell. Plop it on your summoned creature and send them ahead &#8211; they can pass it off to the next one as needed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Snake&#8217;s Swiftness:<\/strong> Give your summoned creature a free attack. Best for use with the heavy hitters with a single attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 3:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stinking Cloud:<\/strong> Don&#8217;t bother. Use SMIII to summon a Dretch and have it cast this for you. Then have the Dretch cast scare, then have the Dretch enter melee. See???<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mage Armor, Mass:<\/strong> The hugeness of this spell after level 5 Malconvoker should be self-evident. Very good!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Haste:<\/strong> Mass buff that gives all your creatures measurable bonuses. This works best when combined with single attack creatures.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mass Snake&#8217;s Swiftness: <\/strong>This can be a show-stopper. Surround your enemy with allies and summoned creatures then cast this for lots of fun.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dimension Step:<\/strong> Move your allies around for maximum tactical advantage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 4:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Evard&#8217;s black tentacles:<\/strong> For non-Malconvokers only. You can summon creatures with just as good grapple scores. By level 10 you can summon multiple creatures with much higher grapple scores and Improved Grab &#8211; that do more damage, take hits etc. Isn&#8217;t being a Malconvoker fun?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bloodstar:<\/strong> This makes me so happy! *wipes tear from eye*. Imagine this &#8211; a bloodstar over an enemy &#8211; then have your 2 Fiendish Tigers charge. One claw &#8211; loose a con point, 2 claw &#8211; loose a con point, 1 bite &#8211; loose a con point, 1 rake &#8211; loose a con point, 2 rake &#8211; loose a con point. That&#8217;s the first tiger&#8230;This might be a better enhancement for multiple attack critters than polymorph!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Translocation Trick:<\/strong> Your opponent Monk rushes to grapple the caster &#8211; wow this caster is a great grappler &#8211; and he squeezes tight too! It&#8217;s almost like he&#8217;s a huge constrictor snake or something&#8230;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Polymorph:<\/strong> Almost too obvious to make the list. Look at the Centipedes as your ultimate polymorph since they always have the most HD for their spell level. You can use a Gargantuan Centipede to make the viscous 12-headed variety. I believe by RAW if you haste it, then it will have 24 attacks with a full attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 6:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Acid Fog:<\/strong> This combines very nicely with any acid resistant creatures (Devils and Demons for sure). Have them grapple your foe &#8211; then hit them with this. Even non acid-resistant summons can work this way. So what if your summoned creature dies along with the opponent?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Level 7:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brilliant Aura:<\/strong> This will give all your summoned creatures a significant offensive boost (transmutation)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesser planar binding spell should be available at character level 10 for most Malconvokers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need a Magic Circle Against X. Magic Circle against evil can be used in binding any non-good creature, Magic Circle against good can be used to bind any non-evil creature &#8211; so if you have both you have covered all your basis. (Or against Law and Chaos if you prefer.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use your Spellcraft to fortify the circle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick an extradimensional creature with 6 HD or less (preferably one with a lower CHA score)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offer them a deal, as in &#8220;Serve me unquestioningly for the next 8 days&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You then have a CHA contest with the creature. The DM will give you a positive modifier if you sweeten the deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spells to use to help you:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally &#8211; you shouldn&#8217;t fight fair.

Cha 14. Has some great SLA&#8217;s, and good in combat too.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bearded Devil:<\/strong> Lawful Evil. CHA 10. Good combatant. Can be your bodyguard.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bralani (Eladrin):<\/strong> Chaotic Good. CHA 14. These guys are great &#8211; but your alignment could be in danger if you start enslaving good outsiders.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Elemental, Medium:<\/strong> Neutral. Cha 11. Not particularly tough &#8211; but as scouts they can be fairly useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Formian Taskmaster:<\/strong> Lawful Neutral. CHA 19. The CHA is a little high &#8211; but they get Dominate Monster as a (Su) ability. Wow!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Janni, Genie:<\/strong> Neutral. Cha 13. A decent choice. Invisibility (self), Move silently, Listen and spot makes them a decent scout. They are OK in combat as well.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Succubus (Demon):<\/strong> Chaotic Evil. CHA 26. The CHA is insane &#8211; but if you complete the spells I suggested above &#8211; it is do-able. The SLA&#8217;s are great &#8211; including Charm Monster at will.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hell Hound:<\/strong> Lawful Evil. CHA 6. Easy CHA test. Not the toughest choice &#8211; but easier to control.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Howler:<\/strong> Chaotic Evil. CHA 8. Easy CHA test &#8211; and pretty tough too. Just a tank for you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nightmare:<\/strong> Neutral Evil. CHA 12. Now you ride in style.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shadow Mastiff:<\/strong> Neutral Evil. CHA 13.

As the Shadow Mastiff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Binding the Succubus:<\/strong> Treantmonk&#8217;s guide:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you want to bind a Succubus, but the 26 CHA scares you? Here&#8217;s what you do (let&#8217;s assume you are a conjurer with a 10 CHA):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are at least 8th level &#8211; so pony up the 4,500 and get a circlet of persuasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cast Magic Circle against evil. Use Spellcraft to fortify it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cast Lesser Planar Binding &#8211; call the Succubus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cast a Geas on her first thing. &#8220;Drink a glass of water from the pitcher over there.&#8221; Point to a pitcher outside the circle. Wait 4 days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cast Eagle&#8217;s splendor before you return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now hit her with Bestow Curse. Her saves are currently at -8 (total will save -1). As long as you peirce SR you are golden (if not &#8211; cast again!). Suddenly her saves\/checks are at -12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now hit her with Cause Fear. Now she&#8217;s frightened (or shaken if by some miracle she saves). Her ability checks are now at -14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to propose a deal. No reason to make it lovely. Ask her to serve you for the remainder of the spell &#8211; to follow all your commands, in both word and intent, to never take action that could harm you, and to give you her true name. &#8211; and she will be released at the end of the spell. This is a crappy deal for her &#8211; so you get no bonus to negotiation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her negotiate modifier: -6<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your negotiate modifier: +5<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there&#8217;s any doubt &#8211; go ahead and pony up 3000 gp for a Moment of Prescience scroll. It&#8217;s a one shot deal &#8211; but the additional +16 to your roll makes this a sure thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once she agrees -drop the cause fear, the curse, and the circle (so she can have her drink of water). She&#8217;s back to normal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you give her the warning. &#8220;I know your true name now &#8211; if you ever screw me over &#8211; during the duration of the spell, or afterwards &#8211; I&#8217;ll use it to summon you again. I&#8217;ll also cast again and summon an IMP. I&#8217;ll give the imp this deal &#8211; &#8220;do whatever you want to this succubus for the duration of the spell &#8211; and I expect nothing in return.&#8221;, you&#8217;ll be defenseless in one of those circles you were just in, but I&#8217;ll let him out of his, I expect the Imp will take the deal &#8211; I get the impression they have LOADS of built up hostility.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Preventing Revenge:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should expect that the outsider won&#8217;t be happy you Bound it. It may consider revenge. Travel to the material plane isn&#8217;t easy for evil outsiders (which is why they haven&#8217;t invaded). However, it may visit this world again &#8211; and it will remember you. You have options as to how to prevent its retaliation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A) Scare it straight.<\/strong> Demons\/Devils have no immunity to fear. If you have it&#8217;s true name you can call it again and do something horrible to it. The threat of such an act (if they believe you) may deter them from attempting revenge. You do hold the superior hand in this game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>B) Finish the job.<\/strong> Nothing says the Demon\/Devil will survive the entire Planar Binding. Since it&#8217;s a called creature, not a summoned one, if you kill it, it&#8217;s gone for good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planar Binding works exactly like lesser planar binding except now the HD limit is 12. It is truly quite amazing the power level of creatures you can call with this spell. Here&#8217;s some good options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(If you&#8217;ve taken the 6th level of Malconvoker &#8211; you can effectively drop the CHA of evil Planar Bindings by 10.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Creatures that you can call with Planar Binding:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Greater Barghest (lawful evil)<\/strong> &#8211; Hmmm&#8230;mass enlarge and mass bull&#8217;s strength as SLA&#8217;s &#8211; invisibility sphere at will.

However, it will give a nice\n\t\tunnamed bonus to CHA checks as well as a morale bonus to attacks etc. of\n\t\tallies (including your summoned creatures)<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sandals of the vagabond<\/span>: Gives a +2\n\t\tinitiative and immunity to exhaustion. It&#8217;s the +2 initiative that is the\n\t\tbiggest draw for me. Depends on what niche your Malconvoker is filling.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ring of Mighty Summons<\/span>: This item is a\n\t\tno-brainer. 14,000 gp isn&#8217;t bad for a ring, and your Deceptive Summoning\n\t\twill cancel out the 1\/2 duration penalty. My suggestion is to get it by\n\t\tlevel 10. As this is usable 3\/day, you might want 2. (Or 3 with a Hand of\n\t\tGlory)<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rod of Silent Spell<\/span>: Around the mid\n\t\tlevels are your best chance to get hit with a Silence Spell. Therefore the\n\t\tRod of Silent Spell is the right Metamagic Rod for those levels. Still not\n\t\ttoo expensive &#8211; and very handy to have.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Staves<\/span>: Any staff with Summon\n\t\tMonster rocks in your hands. It can also free up some much appreciated spell\n\t\tslots for other spells: Healing\/Conjuration depending on what kind of\n\t\tspellcaster you are.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Choker of Eloquence, Greater<\/span>: +10\n\t\tcompetence bonus to Bluff (and some other stuff &#8211; who cares?). This doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tstack with your circlet of Persuasion, but the extra +7 to bluff makes it a\n\t\tworthy acquisition.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rod of Maximize, Greater<\/span>: At the high\n\t\tlevels, the metamagic rod you want is this one. Getting 4 ice devils with a\n\t\tSummon Monster VIII is a great deal.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of Intellect<\/span>: Obviously a good\n\t\tinvestment. Get more spells, better DC&#8217;s (for those Planar Binding\n\t\tEnchantment\/Necromancy enhancers), and more skill points (can&#8217;t have too\n\t\tmany knowledges). If you use combining rules &#8211; combine it with the Circlet\n\t\tof Persuasion. Otherwise &#8211; maybe eyeglasses of intellect?<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloak of Charisma<\/span>: Also a good\n\t\tinvestment. Boost your Bluff and Planar Binding checks, and completely\n\t\tstackable with the Circlet of Persuasion.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Panic Button<\/span>: I recommend picking a\n\t\tcouple of these up (Dimension Door). You gave up immediate magic so you\n\t\tcould get Rapid Spell. It was a worthy trade, but leaves a hole &#8211; and this\n\t\tis your patch.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Invisibility<\/span>: Invisibility +\n\t\tSummoning is a great combination. I think it&#8217;s pretty self-evident.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rod of Rapid Spell, any<\/span>: For a Cleric\n\t\tbuild &#8211; this could be alot easier than finding various ways to be able to\n\t\tuse the feat for free. Recently another thread pointed out that not all\n\t\tArcane casters get to use the UA variants &#8211; so for them this is an option\n\t\ttoo.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Golden Desert Honey (CM)<\/span>: For 300 gp per\n\t\tdose, it allows any summoning spell that normally requires a full round\n\t\taction to be cast as if Rapid Spell were placed upon it. For long term use,\n\t\tthis is too cost restrictive &#8211; but for emergencies &#8211; carrying 2-3 doses of\n\t\tthis could be a very cheap lifesaver.<\/li\n\t>\n\n\t<li\n\t\t><strong>Ehlonna&#8217;s Brooch\/Nature&#8217;s children<\/strong>: Worthy of special\n\t\tmention. I can&#8217;t imagine my Malconvoker worshipping Ehlonna\/Nature &#8211; but if\n\t\tyou choose for yours too &#8211; you will get +1 HP\/HD on summons, and +1 CL. They\n\t\tcost you next to nothing, and it&#8217;s all completely legal &#8211; but the cheese\n\t\treeks from where I&#8217;m standing.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"malconvoker-example-builds\">Malconvoker Example Builds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you have any good Cleric Malconvoker builds &#8211; make sure to post them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conjurer (UA variants: Rapid summon, Enhanced Summon) 3\/Master Specialist 10\/Malconvoker 6\/Paragnostic Apostle 1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Gets 3 quickened SM IX per day &#8211; all summons get Fast Healing 5)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conjurer (UA variants: Rapid summon, Enhanced Summon) 10\/Malconvoker 5\/Master Specialist 4\/Paragnostic Apostle 1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Augment Summoning increases to +6\/+6 plus Fast Healing 5)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conjurer (UA variants: Rapid summon, Enhanced Summon) 5\/Malconvoker 5\/Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil 7\/Archmage 3<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Takes advantage of the nice Iot SV abilities while maintaining summoning ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conjurer (UA variants as above) 3\/Master specialist 4\/Malconvoker 6\/Paragnostic Apostle 3\/Fatespinner 4<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This will probably end up being my current character&#8217;s final build.

If you are playing any kind of summoner at all, you should ask your DM their opinion on these variants. They all are advantageous to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A) Specific Creatures:<\/strong> This is huge &#8211; think about SM IV for example. The difference of the Howler from the Dire Wolf is small. So which to summon? Easy &#8211; roll stats for both and pick the one you got lucky with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that rolling stats for every creature you summon would be fantastically time consuming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; the advantage of resummoning the same creature is obvious &#8211; Use your summon elemental reserve feat to summon an earth elemental. Send him through the wall &#8211; listen for carnage ensuing. The next day, you re-summon the earth elemental:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malconvoker: &#8220;What killed you on the other side of that wall?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earth Elemental: &#8220;This time it was a Werebear. P.S.: I hate you.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is so amusing to think that poor celestial monkey I keep summoning to be my &#8220;trapmonkey&#8221; is always the same monkey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>B) Replacing Creatures:<\/strong> Wow &#8211; this is a no-brainer if your DM allows it. If you have a sticky DM &#8211; you can just take the best Celestial Creatures, and switch them for Fiendish Creatures -thus applying Fiendish Legion, Infernal Fury, and Deceptive Summons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>C) Improving Creatures:<\/strong> There may be alignment problems equipping a bunch of evil creatures to the hilt &#8211; but giving your Bearded Devil an adamantium Glaive is an interesting idea.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dispelling-the-mythconceptions-and-mythtakes-about-summon-monster\">Dispelling the mythconceptions and mythtakes about Summon Monster:<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Generalizations:<\/strong> Myths usually have some basis in truth. This is the case with all these myths. First time I looked at Summon Monster I was less than impressed. A quick flip through the MM revealed that the creatures available were underwhelming for the level of spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t seriously consider specializing in Summon Monster until the Malconvoker. Infernal Legion was the key. It also is the key to dispelling these common myth-steps.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-1-druids-are-better-summoners-than-any-arcane-build\">Myth #1: Druids are better summoners than any arcane build.<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is based on the truth that a core Druid makes a better summoner then a core Cleric\/Wizard. What makes this a myth when you include non-core is that a Druid is not twice as good &#8211; which he would need to be to keep pace after Infernal Legion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, a Cleric (with summoning domain) and a Wizard (Focused Specialist Conjurer) will be able to summon far more creatures due to the vastly superior number of castings they have over the Druid.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-2-the-cr-of-summon-monster-creatures-does-not-keep-up-with-your-level-so-high-level-summon-monster-spells-suck\">Myth #2: The CR of Summon Monster creatures does not keep up with your level &#8211; so high level Summon Monster spells suck.<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is true &#8211; if you aren&#8217;t specialized. A Malconvoker is doubling the number of creatures, and increasing their HP by 2 per HD. Augment Summoning is increasing HP by 2 per HD. Augment Summoning is adding to TO HIT scores. Augment Summoning and Malconvoker are adding to damage. Master Specialist 4 adds your caster level to the HP of creatures summoned. Add a few of these things together &#8211; and the creature you summoned won&#8217;t look anything like what you saw in the MM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number you saw beside &#8220;CR&#8221; in the MM does not nearly define the creature(s) you just summoned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it like playing a fighter. If your combat style is always approach enemy &#8211; roll die &#8211; roll damage, you will suck. In order to make the fighter work, you must use your skills and feats to improve your combat ability and options. You must make sure that the increases to hit and to damage outpace your standard bonuses for levelling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the same with the Summoner. If you are not focusing on Summon Monster &#8211; you will suck at it. If you focus at it &#8211; you can shine<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-3-clerics-make-better-summoners-than-wizards-because-they-get-the-same-spells-at-the-same-level-but-are-better-in-all-nonspellcasting-ways\">Myth #3: Clerics make better summoners than wizards because they get the same spells at the same level, but are better in all non-spellcasting ways.<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is definitely true if you are using core-only. However, the addition of non-core material makes this comparison harder and harder to make. Clerics can use Divine Metamagic to fuel Rapid Spell, as well as other metamagics (though it has limited uses per day). Furthermore they get access to the Summoning Domain (this isn&#8217;t a huge advantage &#8211; but still nice).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards can get Rapid Summoning (this is the big one), Focused Specialist, and have a range of spells I consider superior when synergized with summoning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each has their advantages and disadvantages.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-4-you-cant-make-a-good-arcane-build-if-you-take-a-prc-that-makes-you-give-up-a-caster-level\">Myth #4: You can&#8217;t make a good Arcane build if you take a PrC that makes you give up a caster level<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>After Complete Arcane came out this was definitely true. The key was that in no case did the class abilities come close to making up for an entire lost level of spellcasting. Infernal Legion is what makes this a myth for Summoners. One level of spellcasting does not double the power of your spells &#8211; infernal legion does.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-5-wizards-are-useless-in-an-antimagic-zone-like-the-eye-ray-of-a-beholder\">Myth #5: Wizards are useless in an antimagic zone &#8211; like the eye ray of a beholder.<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Partially True. All casters have a tough time in anti-magic zones. A summoner has an advantage over other casters though since their pre-summoned creatures get an SR check vs the anti-magic. This means you should focus on summoning high SR creatures in these cases (such as the Xill).<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-6-wizards-are-useless-against-magic-immune-creatures-like-golems\">Myth #6: Wizards are useless against magic immune creatures &#8211; like Golems.<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is based on the idea that spellcasters are bad against golems &#8211; which can be true. Actually, the opposite is true for any summoner. Most casters are somewhat gimped by Golems, summoners are not really affected at all since the Golems magical immunity does not protect them from summoned creatures.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-7-summon-monster-ix-sucks-just-compare-it-to-summon-elemental-monolith\">Myth #7: Summon Monster IX sucks &#8211; just compare it to Summon Elemental Monolith:<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is definitely true for most casters. An Elemental Monolith is just tougher than a Fiendish Colossal Spider. However, if you compare the stats &#8211; a pair of Fiendish Colossal Spiders buffed with Infernal Fury have the combat advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also doesn&#8217;t factor in that SM spells are always more versatile than specific summon spells.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"myth-8-summon-monsterplanar-binding-arent-as-good-as-the-call-inevitable-spells\">Myth #8: Summon Monster\/Planar Binding aren&#8217;t as good as the Call Inevitable spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is true for a pathetic non-Malconvoker &#8211; for you it&#8217;s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Call inevitable.<\/strong> Consider the first available &#8211; Call Zelekhut. This is a 5th level spell that summons 1-74 HP creature. No Augment summoning (it&#8217;s a calling spell), no Ring of Mighty Summons, No Infernal Fury.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or &#8211; you could summon 2 creatures with an equivalent level spell that each have 100+ hp, better BAB, Better Damage, Better Grapple, etc etc etc. However, you don&#8217;t get to spend the 100 xp &#8211; sorry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Duration is important to you &#8211; a Planar Binding, Lesser is the same level. It also won&#8217;t cost you any XP, and has a duration of 1 day\/level. Call Zelekhut? One hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The others are no better compared to equivalent level spells cast by a Malconvoker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Take him my slaves!
