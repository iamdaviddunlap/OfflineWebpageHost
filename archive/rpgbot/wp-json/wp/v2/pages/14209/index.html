Using some oddities of the Totem Warrior\u2019s Bear Totem, we still gain some benefits of Raging while wearing Heavy Armor. We then use Aura of Hate to add Charisma to damage, which makes up for not getting Rage damage in our Armor. Additionally, while Rage prevents spellcasting, Divine Smite is not a spell. This culminates in a rather resilient force of might on the battlefield, with high AC and resistance to all damage types, ready to tear into its foes: The Totembreaker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"totembreaker-build-scourge-of-nature\">Totembreaker Build &#8211; Scourge of Nature<\/h2>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-plain has-small-font-size is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Battle doesn&#8217;t need a purpose; the battle is its own purpose.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You don&#8217;t ask why a plague spreads or a field burns.

We can\u2019t cast spells, but Smite is not a spell. So naturally we\u2019re a Paladin. And if the name of the build didn\u2019t give it away, we\u2019re an Oathbreaker to add our Charisma mod to damage rolls. But we\u2019re also a Totem Barbarian, so we can add Rage Damage to damage rolls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not trying to be \u2018the Tank\u2019 here, we\u2019re trying to be hard to kill and do a lot of damage.

As a prepared Divine caster we can freely choose from the entire list daily, so we\u2019re not locked into spell selections.

We\u2019ll have 2 uses of +2d8 damage at this level, and we suggest using Reckless Attack to fish for Crits to Smite on. The choice to Smite on a given attack can be made after you see the results of the attack roll and, since it&#8217;s &#8220;extra damage,&#8221; the dice will be multiplied on a crit which is why this tactic is such a staple for Paladins.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 &#8211; Paladin 3<\/td><td>4 (+2)<\/td><td>Divine Health<br>Sacred Oath (Oathbreaker)<br>Channel Divinity<\/td><td>Immune to Disease.
