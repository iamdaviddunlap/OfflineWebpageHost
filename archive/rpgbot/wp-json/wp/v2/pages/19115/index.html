Forge Domain Clerics make good Defenders, and have enough durability damage output to be a threat in combat even without relying on leveled spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, Forge Domain&#8217;s reliance on fire damage can be liability, as fire\n\tresistance and immunity are common.

The\n\t\t\tForge Domain&#8217;s spell list is almost entirely composed of spells not\n\t\t\tnormally available to clerics, including a couple excellent offensive\n\t\t\toptions from the Paladin spell list and some great utility options from\n\t\t\tthe Wizard spell list.\n\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: Identify is only\n\t\t\t\t\toccasionally necessary, and can generally wait for you to take a full\n\t\t\t\t\trest to prepare it. Searing Smite is \n normally a paladin-exclusive spell, and your spell save\n\t\t\t\t\tDCs will be higher than most paladins&#8217;. Even at high levels, it\n\t\t\t\t\tremains a cheap and reliable damage boost for your weapon attacks,\nthough it may not be worth concentrating on it to maintain the 1d6 ongoing damage unless your target is\nconcentration on a spell or they&#8217;re a troll. Searing Smite targeting a Con save doesn&#8217;t help, either.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Heat Metal is only\n\t\t\t\t\tsituationally useful since most monsters don&#8217;t use armor or weapons,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut when it works it works very well. Magic Weapon is a great buff,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut you already have Blessing of the Forge, so it feels redundant.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Elemental Weapon and\n\t\t\t\t\tMagic Weapon are partially redundant, but it&#8217;s nice that you get both\n\t\t\t\t\toptions. Elemental Weapon is great for characters who make numerous attacks, like fighters. Protection From Energy is a staple buff that every party\n\t\t\t\t\tneeds handy.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">7th Level<\/span>: Neither spell is on the\n\t\t\t\t\tCleric spell list, and both are excellent.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Again, neither spell is\n\t\t\t\t\ton the Cleric spell list. Both spells are fantastic.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Heavy armor is\n\t\t\talways welcome on a cleric, regardless of their role, but it&#8217;s especially\n\t\t\timportant on a front-line cleric like the Forge Domain Cleric.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blessing of the Forge<\/span>: Put a free +1\n\t\t\tweapon into the party on a functionally permanent basis. Absolutely\n\t\t\tcrucial if your game doesn&#8217;t use magic items, but even if it does this is\n\t\t\ta wonderful and flexible buff.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Artisan&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>:\n\t\t\tPossibly situational, but extremely versatile. Trapped in a pit? Make a\n\t\t\tladder. Stuck door? Make a portable ram. Blocked tunnel? Make a pickaxe.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul of the Forge<\/span>: The damage resistance\n\t\t\tis welcome, but a fixed bonus to AC like this is extremely rare in 5e.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Strike<\/span>: The bonus damage is\n\t\t\tgood, but fire is among the most commonly-resisted damage types.

I mostly make problems.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forge Domain is generally very straightforward. Put Blessing of the Forge on a friend&#8217;s weapon, grab a shield and heavy armor, and walk into melee casting Word of Radiance or whatever else fits the needs of the moment. But writing that build for the umpteenth time is no more fun for me to write than it is for you to read, so let&#8217;s do something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make an actual weapon-using cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll be the first to tell you that <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\">clerics are bad at using weapons<\/a>. Cantrip damage is consistently more effective than Divine Strike. But Forge Domain gives us a guaranteed +1 weapon, and we can also bring in a weapon cantrip (Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade) to further boost our effectiveness with a weapon. Combining this with other staple cleric tactics (Spiritual Weapon, Spirit Guardians, etc.) could work very well, and it makes us a meaningful threat in melee beyond the fact that we&#8217;re in melee range. Altogether, this will make us a more effective Defender than we could be otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combo alone does not make us a big damage dealer. In fact, we barely remain in Target DPR for most of the level range, and even then only if enemies trigger the bonus damage from Booming Blade. Opportunity Attacks (especially with Warcaster) will improve this greatly, but they&#8217;re not a guarantee. If you absolutely need to do damage, it will need to come from your leveled spells. Remember: your job as the Defender is to be durable (hard to kill or incapacitate) and sticky (hard to escape).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we&#8217;re leaning harder into being a front-line Defender than we are into the typical cleric tactics, our ability scores, feats, and spell choices are going to look different from your typical cleric. We&#8217;re emphasizing Defender more at the expense of Blaster\/Controller options, but in some cases staple cleric options like Spirit Guardians are still great and arguably even better for us than for a typical cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build assumes no optional class features except the expanded spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This build is unusually MAD for a cleric, so we&#8217;re using the Custom Origin rules with the Half-Elf to shuffle some points around. We&#8217;ll max Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom, and dump everything else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>It would be really fun to do this build with a fire genasi or something, but that&#8217;s not where I&#8217;m going with this. Instead: Custom Origin High Half-Elf. Clerics aren&#8217;t great with skills, and we&#8217;re doing something a little MAD and trying to make melee attacks work on a cleric, so we want three Ability Score Increases and we want Booming Blade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green-Flame Blade is obviously much more thematic, but this is an optimization guide. If your DM sees what you&#8217;re doing and recoils, offer to switch to Green-Flame Blade as a peace offering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also use the High Elf or Variant Human with Magic Initiate, but that would require rearranging some ability scores and feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Guild Artisan feels appropriate.

Crusher gets us +1 Strength and the ability to move an enemy when we hit them with a weapon attack. Combined with Booming Blade, we can bonk something with our mace, move it out of reach, and punish it for trying to move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 8 we take Warcaster. We want to be able to use our Crusher+Booming Blade combo in place of an Opportunity Attack, solidifying our role as a Defender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 12 we max Strength to 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At levels 16 and 19 we increase Wisdom to 18 and then to 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th> Level <\/th><th> Feat(s) and Features <\/th><th> Notes and Tactics <\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>Cantrips Known<br>&#8211; Guidance<br>&#8211; Toll the Dead<br>&#8211; Word of Radiance<br>Domain Spells<br>&#8211; Identify<br>&#8211; Searing Smite<br>Divine Domain: Forge Domain<br>Bonus Proficiencies<br>Blessing of the Forge<\/td><td>Throw Blessing of the Forge onto your mace and start swinging Booming Blade around.

Forge Domain Clerics make good Defenders, and have enough durability damage output to be a threat in combat even without relying on leveled spells.
