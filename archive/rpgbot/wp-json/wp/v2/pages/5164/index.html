Where the Fighter is the master of arms and armor, the Monk is the master fighting unarmed and unarmored. While some monks use a handful of specialized Monk Weapons, most monks fight unarmed. Where fighters often differentiate themselves by the arms and armor they use, monks are most easily differentiated by the stances that they use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a party, the Monk is a Defender and a Striker, standing on the front lines of melee combat to keep foes far away from their less sturdy allies. In some cases, the Monk can also access some area of effect abilities, but those options aren&#8217;t numerous or reusable enough to make the Monk viable as a Blaster. With sufficient investment in certain skills, the Monk can also serve as a Scout due to their need for high Dexterity and Wisdom, allowing them to fill roles traditionally covered by both the Fighter and the Rogue. However, this broad skillset doesn&#8217;t come without cost. Monks are extremely MAD, and despite Pathfinder 2e&#8217;s generous number of Ability Boosts you simply can&#8217;t be good at everything that the Monk can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other classes, the Monk does not have a subclass option. Instead, monks are generally defined by the styles that they use, if any. This notably means that a monk could totally reconstruct their build with enough time to retrain their feats, though their options may be affected by how you&#8217;ve chosen your ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-features\">Monk Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores-strength\">Strength-Based Monk<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores-dexterity\">Dexterity-Based Monk<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores-ki\">Ki Monk<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#monk-feats\">Monk Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#monk-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#monk-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells\">Monk Focus Spells &#8211; Ki Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-features\">Monk Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Strength or Dexterity. Your key ability is used for all of your Monk class feature DC&#8217;s with the exception of Ki Spells, which are Wisdom-based.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: 10 hit points is standard for\n\tfron-line martial characters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: Monks are fantastic\n\tdefensively, especially at low levels. With no items and without actively\n\tdoing anything, they can expect an AC of 18 or 19, and they&#8217;re Expert in every\n\ttype of saving throw. However, monks have few attack proficiencies and\n\tseverely lack good ranged weapon options, and their Perception proficiency\n\tstarts poor and barely increases. In short, monks are really good at what they\n\tdo best, but they&#8217;re bad at nearly everything else.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perception<\/span>: You never get past Expert\n\t\tnormally, and despite decent Wisdom you&#8217;re still not going to be good at\n\t\tPerception. Consider Canny Acumen as you approach 17th level so that you can\n\t\tget up to Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Expert in all saving\n\t\tthrows, and due the Monk&#8217;s normal spread of ability scores you&#8217;ll be good at\n\t\tall of them. Unfortunately, only two of them will rise to Master, then one\n\t\tof those two will rise to Legendary, so one of your saving throws will be\n\t\tstuck at Expert forever. You can take Canny Acumen to raise the third saving\n\t\tthrow to Master, but that won&#8217;t take effect until 17th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skills is normal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attacks<\/span>: You only get simple weapons and\n\t\tUnarmed Attacks. Most monks will choose to rely on Unarmed Attacks, but you\n\t\tcan also choose Monastic Weaponry to get a better selection of weaponry.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Defenses<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get any armor, but you\n\t\tstart at Expert in Unarmored Defense, so your AC will be good. With 18\n\t\tDexterity, you could have an AC of 19 at 1st level with no items of any\n\t\tkind. You can then pile typed bonuses on top of that. Monks are one of the\n\t\tonly classes to reach Legendary in Unarmored Defense (Champion do too, but\n\t\tthey&#8217;re much less likely to fight unarmored), and with some investment in\n\t\tExplorer&#8217;s Clothing or Bracers of Armor, your AC should be excellent.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: Your Monk Class DC can be either Strength- or\n\t\tDexterity-based, which works for any monk build. You&#8217;ll use it for a number\n\t\tof important Monk Class Feats like Stunning Fist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Blows<\/span>: This is so good that\n\tmulticlass characters can&#8217;t get it until 10th level. It&#8217;s mostly the same as\n\tmaking two individual Strike actions because the Multiple Attack Penalty still\n\tworks normally. A turn in which your only attacks come from Flurry of Blows is\n\ta perfectly fine turn, and since you&#8217;ll have additional actions you can use\n\tthem for things like Stepping and Grappling. Also note that you can only use\n\tFlurry of Blows with Unarmed Attacks unless you take the Monastic Weaponry\n\tfeat, in which case you can also flurry with Monk weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Powerful Fist<\/span>: This is an average of 1\n\tadditional damage per damage die, and you&#8217;re almost certainly going to\n\toverride this with a Stance or by using a weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monk Feats<\/strong>: See Monk feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Movement<\/span>: +10 ft. of movement is\n\ta 40% increase over the normal 25 ft. speed of most humanoids, and the bonus\n\tincreases by another 5 ft. every 4 levels to a maximum total bonus of 30\n\tft.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mystic Strikes<\/span>: +1 Handwraps of Mighty\n\tFists are level 2 items, costing just 35 gp., and they&#8217;re your most important\n\titem. If you don&#8217;t have a +1 weapon by 3rd level when you get Mystic Strikes\n\tyou&#8217;re doing something very odd or your DM isn&#8217;t giving you enough treasure.\n\tOf course, if you&#8217;re using weapons primarily this is a helpful way to fall\n\tback on Unarmed Attacks if your weapon is ineffective for some reason. This\n\tcan be a helpful option once abilities like Metal Strikes come online.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Alertness<\/span>: More Perception is always great,\n\tbut it would be nice if you went further than Expert.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Strikes<\/span>: More proficiency with your\n\tattacks is always good. Remember that if you took Monastic Weaponry this also\n\tapplies to the affected Monk weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Path to Perfection<\/span>: Bring one saving throw\n\tto Master.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More damage is great,\n\tand since you can use Flurry of Blows to make more attacks than most\n\tcharacters you can get a lot of mileage out of small bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metal Strikes<\/span>: Absolutely essential if\n\tyou&#8217;re not using a weapon because you don&#8217;t get to change what your hands are\n\tmade of. For weapon users, it&#8217;s helpful if your weapon happens to be the wrong\n\tmetal.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monk Expertise<\/span>: An important boost to\n\timportant options like Stunning Fist, as well as to your spell DCs with Ki\n\tSpells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Second Path to Perfection<\/span>: Bring a second\n\tsaving throw to Master.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Graceful Mastery<\/span>: Another +2 to AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Strikes<\/span>: Another +2 to your\n\tattacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: Double the\n\tdamage bonuses from Weapon Specialization.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Third Path to Perfection<\/span>: Bring one of your\n\ttwo previous selections from Master to Legendary. Tragically, your third\n\tsaving throw will be left at Expert unless you also take Canny Acumen to raise\n\tit to Master.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Adamantine Strikes<\/span>: The rules for\n\tadamantine weapons allow adamantine weapons to ignore half the hardness of\n\tstruck items, so long as the attacking weapon&#8217;s hardness exceeds that of the\n\ttarget item. Unfortunately, you don&#8217;t have a Hardness, so you don&#8217;t get that\n\tbenefit. You get to ignore resistance to non-adamantine weapons, but that&#8217;s\n\tall.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Graceful Legend<\/span>: Improve your AC, your Class\n\tDC, and your spell attacks\/DC all at once. This is a really fun level, even if\n\tit&#8217;s only numeric improvements.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfected Form<\/span>: You&#8217;re guaranteed at least a\n\t10, but you can still roll natural 20&#8217;s. In many cases, that means that you\n\tcan guarantee that you will hit with at least one Strike every turn. If you\n\tuse Stunning Fist and Flurry of Blows, that means that you can potentially\n\tstun a target every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks were famously MAD in Pathfinder 1st edition; because Wisdom defined so many of their capabilities, including their AC, it was an essential ability score. The 2nd edition Monk is still MAD, but their hit points are better and their Wisdom is considerably less important, so it&#8217;s not quite as bad as it once was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An extremely important note: Wisdom is used to determine the Monk&#8217;s Spell DC&#8217;s, so if you plan to use Ki Spells (Focus Spells) that allow saving throws, you need high Wisdom. For other monks, Wisdom is no more useful than it is for any other character, and you can even use many Ki Spells without worrying about Wisdom. Tragically, the text specifying that Wisdom determines the Monk&#8217;s spell DC was omitted in the first printing of the core rulebook. Hopefully we&#8217;ll see written errata soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores-strength\">Strength-Based Monk<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Strength-based monks focus primarily on hitting stuff and doing damage. Your attacks won&#8217;t be any more accurate than a Dexterity-based monk&#8217;s attacks because Finesse is so readily available, but your attacks will deal more damage and options like the Bo Staff and Dragon Style are considerably more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Choose Strength as your Key Ability\n\tboth so that it gets and extra +2 Ability Boost, but also so that it sets your\n\tMonk Class DC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Even if you choose to emphasize\n\tStrength, you still want high Dexterity. Monks fight unarmored, so you need\n\tDexterity to pad your AC. You can probably stop at 20 (+5) Dexterity, which\n\tyou should reach at 15th level, because the Dexterity Cap on Explorer&#8217;s\n\tClothing is +5 and you want to be able to put Magic Runes on your clothes. The\n\tbig exception is Mountain Stance, which gives you a Dex Cap of +0, so you can\n\tstart at 1st level with 10 Dexterity and never suffer a reduced AC (so long as\n\tyou&#8217;re in your Stance). This cap eventually rises to +2 with some class feats,\n\tso you&#8217;ll want to reach 14 Dexterity at some point, and doing it during\n\tCharacter Creation is a fine time to do it if you can spare the boosts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential for hit points and saving\n\tthrows.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Intelligence will give you more\n\tTrained skills at first level, and more skills means that you can more easily\n\treplace a Rogue outside of combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Helpful for Perception and some\n\tskills, but you don&#8217;t need very much Wisdom. Even if you plan to explore some\n\tKi Spells like Ki Strike, you can (and should) easily avoid spells which allow\n\tsaving throws.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump. Monks have no dependence on\n\tCharisma. If you have the skills for it you might serve as your party&#8217;s Face,\n\tbut other members of your party will be more able to easily emphasize that\n\tskillset.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores-dexterity\">Dexterity-Based Monk<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity-based monks will have higher AC than Strength-based monks, but they&#8217;ll have lower damage output. They&#8217;ll also be more effective as Scouts because of their higher Dexterity, which will help you with skills like Stealth and Thievery..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: You still add your Strength bonus to\n\tdamage even if you&#8217;re attacking with Dexterity, so most monks need at least a\n\tlittle bit of Strength for the damage bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Your key ability. Finesse is readily\n\tavailable on various unarmed strikes, as well as on some monk weapons.\n\tDexterity also sets your AC. Expect to exceed the Dex Cap on Explorer&#8217;s\n\tClothing\/Bracers of armor, but it will be only be by +1 or +2, and the AC\n\tbonuses from the runes on your armor will likely exceed those bonuses at an\n\tinsignificant cost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential for hit points and saving\n\tthrows.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Intelligence will give you more\n\tTrained skills at first level, and more skills means that you can more easily\n\treplace a Rogue outside of combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Helpful for Perception and some\n\tskills, but you don&#8217;t need very much Wisdom. Even if you plan to explore some\n\tKi Spells like Ki Strike, you can (and should) easily avoid spells which allow\n\tsaving throws.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump. Monks have no dependence on\n\tCharisma. If you have the skills for it you might serve as your party&#8217;s Face,\n\tbut other members of your party will be more able to easily emphasize that\n\tskillset.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores-ki\">Ki Monk<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Ki Monks are the only monks which actually need Wisdom, but Dexterity is still your definitive ability. You are, first and foremost, a martial artist. No matter how many Ki Spells you learn, you&#8217;re still limited to a Focus Pool of just three points, so you can cast at most three Ki Spells per encounter. You want those to be as impactful as possible, but after you spend those points you need to go right back to punching things and you need to be good at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: You don&#8217;t need a ton of Strength\n\tsince all it&#8217;s doing for you is adding a flat numeric bonus to your damage. 14\n\tis plenty at first level because that gets you +1 damage with Propulsive\n\tattacks from Wild Winds Stance, but if it&#8217;s convenient you may want more for\n\tfighting in melee.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity should be your go-to option\n\tbecause you can use it with ranged attacks like Wild Winds Stance. You&#8217;re also\n\tlikely to have higher AC than Strength-based monks, which is always nice, but\n\tyou&#8217;ll deal less damage with your attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Essential for hit points and saving\n\tthrows.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Only useful for skills, and given the\n\tchoice between more Strength and more Intelligence, you should go for\n\tStrength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: The DC for your spells is determined by\n\tyour Wisdom. You want it to be as high as possible, but remember that\n\tDexterity is still\n<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump. Monks have no dependence on\n\tCharisma. If you have the skills for it you might serve as your party&#8217;s Face,\n\tbut other members of your party will be more able to easily emphasize that\n\tskillset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because monks are so MAD, good ability boosts are much more important than\n\tthey are for most classes. Using the Voluntary Flaw rules is a great idea in\n\tmost cases because you need increases to multiple physical ability scores, and\n\twith the exception of Free Ability Boosts there&#8217;s no way to get an Ability\n\tBoost to all three physical ability scores from your Ancestry.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Constitution and Wisdom is a great\n\tstart, and the free boost can go into your choice of Strength or Dexterity.\n\tVoluntary Flaws are an option, but you&#8217;ll need to change the +2 Wisdom to -2\n\tWisdom or to take -4 Intelligence. Either option is fine, but they&#8217;ll probably\n\tfeel bad when you write them down.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The Elf&#8217;s Constitution penalty is\n\thard for many martial characters, and the Monk is no different. The\n\tIntelligence increase isn&#8217;t especially useful, either. Use the Voluntary Flaws\n\trule to change the +2 Int to -2 Int and offset the Constitution Flaw. That\n\tleaves you with +2 Dexterity and a Free Ability Boost which you can use for\n\tStrength or Wisdom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: The Gnome&#8217;s ability scores are a very\n\tdifficult starting point, similar to the Elf&#8217;s. Because the Gnome&#8217;s Ability\n\tFlaw is in Strength, you&#8217;ll want to stick to Dexterity-based builds or Ki Monk\n\tbuilds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Goblin<\/span>: A Wisdom flaw makes Ki Monk builds\n\tdifficult, but otherwise the Goblin is a fine choice. Use the Voluntary Flaws\n\trule to change the +2 Cha to -2 Cha, and put both Free Ability Boosts into\n\tyour physical ability scores so that you get +2 to all three. Unbreakable\n\tGoblin, combined with Cat Fall and feats which allow you to jump absurd\n\tdistances can help bridge you deal with problems normally solved by flight,\n\twhich is commical if nothing else.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Dexterity and Wisdom boosts are\n\tgreat, and you can survive a Strength Flaw if you don&#8217;t want to deal with the\n\tVoluntary Flaws rules, but you may still want to use them to offset the\n\tStrength Flaw. Halfling Luck is a great option for the Monk because you&#8217;re\n\talready going to be good at every type of Saving Throw, and you can use\n\tHalfling Luck on those rare occasions that you fail a save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Take Versatile Heritage to get\n\tToughness to make yourself more durable. Use the Voluntary Flaw rules to dump\n\tIntelligence and Charisma, giving you three Free Ability Boosts to do with as\n\tyou please. If you&#8217;re not building a Ki Monk, put them in your physical\n\tability scores. If you&#8217;re building a Ki Monk, put them in Dexterity,\n\tConstitution, and Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Pick a background which gives you a boost to the ability scores which you care about (physical ability scores, plus Wisdom for Ki Monks). The skills and Skill Feats which you care about depend heavily on your role within the party, but Athletics and Acrobatics are safe choices, and Wisdom-based skills can also be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble deciding, here are some suggestions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Hermit<\/li><li>Martial Disciple<\/li><li>Street Urchin<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Increases at 3rd and 5th level to raise skills to Expert, increases at 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th level to raise skills to Master, and increases at 15th, 17th, and 19th level to raise skills to Legendary. That means that you can maximize at most three skills, and the rest of your skills might not advance beyond Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Feats at even-numbered levels, giving you a total of 10 Skill Feats (and maybe another from your Background) by 20th level. Generally, you want to invest these feats in the same skills which you are choosing to maximize, though in some cases you may want to grab feats from skills which don&#8217;t require that you be more than Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): A broad range of\n\t\tapplications, and you&#8217;ll have enough Dexterity to be good at it.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Assurance<\/span>: Useful in combat, and\n\t\t\t\tknowing that you&#8217;ll get a consistent result from those checks makes\n\t\t\t\tskill actions much easier to rely upon.

Cat Fall can help mitigate those\n\t\t\t\tissues, and if you&#8217;re clever you can use the additional safe fall\n\t\t\t\tdistance to get more out of your movement then fall great distances\n\t\t\t\twithout issue.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcana<\/span> (Int): Intelligence is a dump\n\t\tstat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Athletics<\/span> (Str): Athletics-based actions\n\t\tare very useful for the Monk. You spend a lot of time fighting with one or\n\t\tboth hands free, making options like grappling, shoving, and tripping both\n\t\teasy to use and option very effective.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Assurance<\/span>: Useful in combat, and\n\t\t\t\tknowing that you&#8217;ll get a consistent result from those checks makes\n\t\t\t\tskill actions much easier to rely upon.

Even if no one else in your party has it, being Trained can\n\t\tstill go a long way.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Occultism<\/span> (Int): Intelligence is a dump\n\t\tstat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Performance<\/span> (Cha): Charisma is a dump\n\t\tstat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Religion<\/span> (Wis): An important knowledge\n\t\tskill, and you have enough Wisdom to make it work.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Society<\/span> (Int): Intelligence is a dump\n\t\tstat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Monks need high Dexterity\n\t\tto boost their AC, so they&#8217;re already most of the way to making good use of\n\t\tStealth. Proficiency and an occasionaly increase can make you an excellent\n\t\tScout.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Swift Sneak<\/span>: The Monk has the most to\n\t\t\t\tlose by moving at half their speed, but at the same time it&#8217;s also less\n\t\t\t\tof a problem because your speed will still be excellent.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thievery<\/span> (Dex): You have high enough\n\t\tDexterity that you can handle picking locks, disarming traps, and other\n\t\tthings typically handled by the Rogue or a simialr class.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats\">Monk Feats<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-1\">1st Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crane Stance<\/span>: One of the more defensive\n\t\tstance options at 1st level, Crane Stance is a great defensive option for\n\t\tmonks with high Dexterity. The extra jumping distance is neat, but extremely\n\t\tsituational. Note that the AC bonus is a Cirumstance bonus, so it won&#8217;t\n\t\tstack with the bonus from a shield if you&#8217;re using one.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Stance<\/span>: Dragon Stance is the most\n\t\tUnarmed Strike damage you can get, but the attacks also have some of the\n\t\tworst traits. The only interesting trait is Backswing, which is just a worse\n\t\tversion of Agile. Dragon Stance is one of few monk options which lacks\n\t\tFinesse, so it&#8217;s only a good option for Strength-based monks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gorilla Stance<\/span>: Solid damage, and the\n\t\tcombination of both backswing and forceful means that hit or miss you&#8217;re\n\t\trewarded for making numerous Strikes in the same turn. If you just want to\n\t\tstand around and hit people without much fussing, that&#8217;s very appealing, but\n\t\tthe combination of weapon traits adds some complexity which might not be\n\t\tapparent at a glance because you don&#8217;t need to take any extra Actions to\n\t\tmake use of the style.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Rush<\/span>: Very situational. Notably, this\n\t\tfeat does not expand your Focus Pool if you already have one, so I don&#8217;t\n\t\trecommend taking this if you already have a Focus Pool.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Strike<\/span>: At low levels, being able to\n\t\tuse Ki Strike for a 1-turn boost to damage looks really tempting, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tnot as useful as a permanent benefit you could get from other 1st-level\n\t\tfeats like a Stance feat. You might consider this later if you&#8217;re going for\n\t\ta build which emphasizes Focus Spells (a &#8220;Ki Monk&#8221;). Notably, this feat does\n\t\tnot expand your Focus Pool if you already have one, so I don&#8217;t recommend\n\t\ttaking this if you already have a Focus Pool.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monastic Archer Stance<\/span>: If you want to\n\t\tbuild a ranged monk, this is the way to do it. The ability to apply Monk\n\t\tClass Feats which are typically melee-only allows you match melee monks\n\t\tcapabilities without giving up your bow. However, you need be within half of\n\t\tyour bow&#8217;s first range increment to use those feats, so there is always an\n\t\tincentive to be relatively close to your targets. Half of a shortbow&#8217;s range\n\t\tis still 30 ft., which is still enough to keep you at least one Stride out\n\t\tof reach for many creatures. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that this is one\n\t\tof very few ways that the Monk can avoid needing a high Strength score to\n\t\tboost their damage output.\n\t\t<p>I&#8217;m not going to maintain a full list of the feats and abilities which\n\t\t\tcan be applied through Monastic Archer Stance, but Stunning Fists is a\n\t\t\tgood example.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monastic Weaponry<\/span>: Choosing to use monk\n\t\tweapons generally means choosing weapons over stances. That&#8217;s a perfectly\n\t\tfine choice, and you won&#8217;t need to worry about spending an Action to enter\n\t\tyour Stance every time you enter combat. However, don&#8217;t expect to be able to\n\t\tshift tactics any faster than Stance-based monks. As soon as you get into\n\t\tmagic weapons, you&#8217;ll likely be as attached to a single weapon as you are to\n\t\tyour own arms.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mountain Stance<\/span>: At 1st level, this gives\n\t\tyou an AC of 19 (+5 proficiency with Unarmored Defense, +4 Status) with 10\n\t\tDexterity. That will match the AC of other monks with 18 Dexterity. Because\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t need to significantly raise your Dexterity you can focus on other\n\t\tability scores. You will still want 14 Dexterity at some point as you gain\n\t\tfeats which further improve Mountain Stance, but boosting Dexterity at 5th\n\t\tand 10th level will get you the Dexterity you need before the feats become\n\t\tavailable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stumbling Stance<\/span>: Backstabber offers a\n\t\tmodest, but reliable damage boost if you can make the target Flat-footed.\n\t\tConveniently, Stumbling Stance offers built-in ways to make that happen by\n\t\tusing Feint or by being hit with a melee Strike. This won&#8217;t be as easy to\n\t\tuse as something simple like Gorilla Stance, and I&#8217;m not convinced that it&#8217;s\n\t\tany better for the added complexity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tiger Stance<\/span>: Tiger Stance is great if\n\t\tyou just want to stand and hit enemies, but its emphasis is on hit-and-run\n\t\ttactics. Dealing ongoing Bleed damage and allowing you to Step 10 feet\n\t\tencourages you to hit a target, then Step away to put yourself out of the\n\t\ttarget&#8217;s reach. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think you can combine this with the\n\t\tElf Step feat because both feats specify exact distances that you can\n\t\tStep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wolf Stance<\/span>: If you have an ally like a\n\t\trogue who benefits significantly from flanking, this is a great option. If\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t rely on flanking, Tiger Stance will likely be more effective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ancestral Weaponry<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\tonly because not every ancestry has a suitable set of ancestral weapons.\n\t\tDwarfs get the Clan Dagger and the Dwarven War Axe, neither of which are\n\t\tnotably better than existing options. Catfolk get claw blades and kenky get\n\t\twakizashim both of which may be viable if you&#8217;re building around\n\t\tweapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Brawling Focus<\/span>: Over the course of your\n\t\tlife you&#8217;re going to make a lot of critical hits. The Critical\n\t\tSpecialization effect for Brawling weapons causes enemies to become Slowed 1\n\t\t(assuming that they fail a Fortitude Saving Throw), which robs them of an\n\t\tAction on their next turn. Of course, Stunning Fist makes the target Stunned\n\t\ton the same save, and doesn&#8217;t require a Critical hit. You can combine the\n\t\ttwo, but if you need to choose one it should be Stunning Fist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crushing Grab<\/span>: Crucial if you like\n\t\tgrappling, otherwise skip it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dancing Leaf<\/span>: Magical flight will make this\n\t\tobsolete and until that time it&#8217;s doubtful that the tiny amount of extra\n\t\tjump distance will matter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Fist<\/span>: Situational. You only\n\t\twant to use this when attacking enemies which are weak to a specific\n\t\telement. Otherwise, Lawful, Negative, and Positive damage are all fantastic\n\t\toptions that are very rarely resisted.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shooting Stars Stance<\/span>: Similar in many\n\t\tways to Monastic Archer Stance, the only practical difference between the\n\t\ttwo is which weapon you can use. A Shortbow, even at half of its range\n\t\tincrement, can still apploy monk abilities and feats out to 30 ft. The\n\t\tShuriken&#8217;s range increment is just 20 ft., so it has trouble matching the\n\t\tShortbow&#8217;s range. However, the Shuriken isn&#8217;t limited to applying abilities\n\t\tand feats within a fixed range: if your shuriken can hit it, you can apply\n\t\tthe feat. If you can somehow throw a shuriken 120 ft. (the end of 6 range\n\t\tincrements) and still hit with the -12 attack penalty, you can apply\n\t\tStunning Fist or whatever else. Also note that since shurikens are a thrown\n\t\tweapon, they apply your Strength modifier to damage rather than half like a\n\t\tcomposite bow would with the Propulsive property.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Fist<\/span>: Using Flurry of Blows to\n\t\trepeatedly attack a single creature will happen constantly, and adding the\n\t\tability to rob the target of an action by stunning them makes your attacks\n\t\tconsiderably more dangerous.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cobra Stance<\/span>: Poison damage is an\n\t\tinteresting prospect. It gets you around resistances to typical weapon\n\t\tdamage types, but poison is also a common resistance\/immunity. You also gain\n\t\tpoison resistance, which is neat. The biggest problem is the 1d4 damage die,\n\t\tbut I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a deal breaker.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflect Arrow<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flurry of Maneuvers<\/span>: The listed\n\t\tmaneuvers are all fantastic, but since you&#8217;re relying on Flurry of Blows\n\t\talready, you probably have spare Actions to spend on maneuvers. The only\n\t\tcase I can think of where you want to use this is if you only want to make a\n\t\tsingle maneuver and a single Strike in the same turn, and that&#8217;s a very\n\t\tspecific circumstance which I don&#8217;t think justifies this feat. In those\n\t\tcases you may just need to give up on the Strike, perform your maneuver, and\n\t\tbe done with it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flying Kick<\/span>: Possibly useful as a way to\n\t\tcross difficult terrain, but primarily intended to allow you to attack\n\t\tflying enemies. At low levels this may be tempting, but magical flight is\n\t\tright around the corner so expect to retrain this if you choose to take it.\n\t\tIf you don&#8217;t have any other option, ranged weapons should be able to handle\n\t\tflying enemies, though your options are admittedly very limited.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Guarded Movement<\/span>: While many\n\t\tmelee-oriented enemies have the Attack of Opportunity reaction, most do not.\n\t\tIf you&#8217;re fighting a melee enemy, you probably want to continue fighting\n\t\tthat enemy rather than running away from it to fight something else. If you\n\t\tdo want to get away, you can typically Step away without cutting into your\n\t\tattacks significantly because Flurry of Blows allows you to make two Strikes\n\t\tin a single Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Peafowl Stance<\/span>: Unless you got a sword\n\t\tfrom Ancestral Weapons, you&#8217;re using a Temple Sword with this because there\n\t\tare no other options. This stance sacrifices the ability to make other types\n\t\tof Strikes for the ability to get a free Step every round. A Step isn&#8217;t\n\t\talways useful, but the ability to get a free Action at this low level is\n\t\trare. If you have an ally who relies on enemies being Flat-Footed, such as a\n\t\trogue, this can be a great way to quickly flank enemies without cutting into\n\t\tyour damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stand Still<\/span>: Similar in many ways to\n\t\tAttack of Opportunity, Stand Still has a more restrictive trigger, but it\n\t\tgains the ability to halt a creature if you score a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wholeness of Body<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to take\n\t\tone Focus Spell, make it Wholeness of Body. The hit point recovery is\n\t\tfantastic, and since Focus can be recovered for free with sufficient time\n\t\tyou can use Wholeness of Body to remove diseases and poisons and to return\n\t\tto full hit points after most fights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-6\">6th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Abundant Step<\/span>: Even limited teleportation\n\t\tis still teleportation, and teleportation is really good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Align Ki<\/span>: If you&#8217;re built to rely on the\n\t\tMonk&#8217;s Focus Spells, you probably already too Wholeness of Body. This will\n\t\tadd to the amount of healing, and allow you to heal using other Focus\n\t\tSpells, but with the 1-hour cooldown it&#8217;s not worth the feat. Use Wholeness\n\t\tof Body, Refocus, repeat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crane Flutter<\/span>: If you&#8217;re enganging an\n\t\tenemy in melee one-on-one, you can expect to use this nearly every round,\n\t\tpotentially gaining an extra attack every round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Roar<\/span>: Frightened 1 applies some\n\t\thelpful debuffs, but the area of effect is small and Dragon Roar uses your\n\t\tIntimidation DC rather than your class DC, so you need to invest heavily in\n\t\tIntimidation and you need to have high Charisma, which is hard because\n\t\tnothing else about the Monk requires Charisma.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gorilla Pound<\/span>: There are a lot of\n\t\tpositives and negatives to consider here, so bear with me. Intimidation is a\n\t\thard choice for the Monk because they have so little reason to invest in\n\t\tCharisma, but getting to Expert in Intimidation is easy, and you&#8217;re not\n\t\tgiving up an Action to Demoralize which is a nice benefit. The bonus damage\n\t\tis going to be +3 if you succeed on Intimidation or +6 if your Critically\n\t\tSucceed, both of which are decent damage bonuses that add onto the already\n\t\texcellent benefits of applying the Frightened condition. This notably has\n\t\tthe Flourish trait, so you can&#8217;t use it in the same turn in which you use\n\t\tFlurry of Blows, so you&#8217;re giving up a free Strike in exchange for a free\n\t\tDemoralize. That&#8217;s an even trade, and you can still use Flurry of Blows on\n\t\tlater turns, which you&#8217;ll do a lot becuase Demoralize grants temporary\n\t\timmunity after it wears off.\n\t\t<p>You also get a climb speed, which is really nice. Climb speeds are the\n\t\t\tnext best thing to flight.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Taken as a whole, it&#8217;s difficult to rate Gorilla Pound. It&#8217;s good, but it\n\t\t\trequires a lot of investment which is going to be hard for many monks, and\n\t\t\ttaking an optional Flourish is really hard when Flurry of Blows is so good\n\t\t\tand so hard to forgo. Making on less Strike also means that you&#8217;re not\n\t\t\tbenefiting as much from the Forceful weapon trait, so you could argue that\n\t\t\tthis intentionally sidestaps part of what makes Gorilla Stance appealing.\n\t\t\tI think this is a situationally useful option. It&#8217;s helpful in some cases,\n\t\t\tbut you don&#8217;t really need it even if you go for Gorrila Stance.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Blast<\/span>: One of very few ways that the\n\t\tMonk can handle groups of enemies efficiently. Unfortunately, it requires\n\t\tthat you already have Ki Spells, so hopefully you learned one at a previous\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mountain Stronghold<\/span>: Raising the\n\t\tDexterity cap of Mountain Stance raises your AC by 1, and you can use the\n\t\tMountain Stronghold action to gain AC similar to the way the Raise a Shield\n\t\taction works. This raises your AC by a total of 3 (in addition to your AC\n\t\tincreasing by 1 every level), though you do need to spend an Action to get\n\t\tthe +2 Circumstance bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">One-Inch Punch<\/span>: If your stance doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tgrant the Agile trait on your Strikes and has a large damage die, this could\n\t\tbe appealing. However, it&#8217;s difficult to justify this when you have Flurry\n\t\tof Blows for free.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Return Fire<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stumbling Feint<\/span>: Spectacular, and a great\n\t\taddition to Stumbling Stance. Flurry of Blows now allows you to do a total\n\t\tof <em>three<\/em> Actions worth of stuff with a single Action. That alone\n\t\twould be <span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>, but on top of that if you\n\t\troll a Success the target is Flat-Footed for both attacks from Flurry of\n\t\tBlows. You can still roll a Critical Success when you Feint to make the\n\t\ttarget Flat-Footed even longer.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tiger Slash<\/span>: The extra damage dice are\n\t\tnice, and since it&#8217;s only a single Strike your Multiple Attack Penalty won&#8217;t\n\t\thamper your damage output unless you&#8217;ve made other Strikes earlier in your\n\t\tturn. However, since you&#8217;re pushing the target away from you you will likely\n\t\thave issues making any other attacks in the round. I don&#8217;t think that I\n\t\twould use this as a go-to attack option, especially since you can make a\n\t\tFlurry of Blows and a Step (stepping 10 ft. thanks to Tiger Stance) with the\n\t\tsame number of Actions, and usually that will have a similar or better\n\t\teffect. You might use this to follow up a Flurry of Blows, but even then\n\t\tmaking a Strike and a Step will guarantee that you put distance between\n\t\tyourself and the target regardless of the outcome of the Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Step<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Whirling Throw<\/span>: Situational, but much\n\t\tmore effective than Shove, and there&#8217;s definitely room for abuse here. If\n\t\tyou multiclass into Fighter and take Combat Grab, you can make a Flurry of\n\t\tBlows, follow up with Combat Grab, then finish up your turn with a Whirling\n\t\tThrow, hurling your oponent a sizeable distance and dealing a pile of damage\n\t\twhile not concerning yourself with a Multiple Attack Penalty since the\n\t\taction doesn&#8217;t have the Attack trait. Of course, this means three feats\n\t\t(Whirling Throw, Fighter Multiclass Dedication, Basic Maneuver) for a gimic\n\t\tthat you can&#8217;t necessarily use every turn, and that&#8217;s often a hard\n\t\tinvestment to make.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wolf Drag<\/span>: With the same number of\n\t\tactions you could Trip the target then make a Flurry of Blows. Due to the\n\t\tadditional number of rolls, you&#8217;re more likely to get at least some benefit\n\t\tfrom those actions rather than the all-or-nothing you get with Wolf Drag,\n\t\tand if you&#8217;re lucky you may even be able to hit twice with Flurry of Blows\n\t\tdespite the -4 Multiple Attack Penalty for going this route. This also\n\t\tleaves your third Action free.\n\t\t<p>However, Wolf Drag has some advantages. Since it doesn&#8217;t require an\n\t\t\tAthletics check, you&#8217;re able to effectively trip foes without relying on\n\t\t\tAthletics, which makes it an option for monks with low Strength and\n\t\t\tagainst foes with good defenses. You also don&#8217;t need to roll anything to\n\t\t\ttrip the target: if you hit, they fall prone. If you lead with Wolf Drag,\n\t\t\tyou can follow it with a Flurry of Blows against your now-prone target,\n\t\t\toffsetting most of the -4 Multiple Attack Penalty (remember that Wolf\n\t\t\tStance&#8217;s attacks are Agile, and Wolf Drag only counts as one attack for\n\t\t\tthe Multiple Attack Penalty).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Fatal d12 looks neat, but it&#8217;s a very minor part of the feat. You&#8217;re most\n\t\t\tlikely to score a critical hit on your first attack each turn, but you&#8217;re\n\t\t\there for the Trip effect.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-8\">8th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arrow Snatching<\/span>: Deflect Arrow is already\n\t\tvery situational, and improving a very situational option is rarely a good\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clinging Shadows Initiate<\/span>: See Focus\n\t\tSpells, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ironblood Stance<\/span>: A great option for\n\t\tweapon users, this provides a small amount of universal damage resistence.\n\t\tIt notably allows you to perform a new type of unarmed strike, but does not\n\t\tlimit you to those strikes like many stances, which makes this a stance\n\t\tusable by monks who prefer to rely on weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mixed Maneuver<\/span>: Delaying the Multiple\n\t\tAttack Penalty until after you make both maneuvers is nice, but this is only\n\t\tuseful for builds which are heavily reliant on the affected maneuvers. For\n\t\tsuch builds, using Mixed Maneuvers to Grapple and Trip a target (or to\n\t\teither to two targets), is a great way to keep foes on the ground since\n\t\tGrabbed\/Restrained both prevent the target from standing. Characters who use\n\t\tof Mixed Maneuvers won&#8217;t use it every round, but the Grapple\/Trip combo is a\n\t\tgood go-to option every time you move to a new target who you can reliably\n\t\tGrapple\/Trip and who is worth the Actions to do both.\n\t\t<p>Using Mixed Manevuers leaves you with your third Action free, but at your\n\t\t\tmaximum Multiple Attack Penalty you&#8217;ll likely want to use it for something\n\t\t\tother than a Flurry of Blows, such as a Stride to get close enough to use\n\t\t\tMixed Maneuver. This generally means that one turns where you&#8217;re using\n\t\t\tMixed Maneuvers you should plan to give up damage output for that turn, so\n\t\t\tyou need to be sure that using two maneuvers will be more impactful than\n\t\t\tjust hitting the same creature.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pinning Fire<\/span>: Since the feat doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tspecify, I&#8217;m assuming that it takes an Action to perform the Athletics\n\t\tcheck. The DC is low enough that creatures will be able to escape with ease\n\t\teven if they&#8217;re not proficienct in Athletics, but the fact that they need to\n\t\tspend an Action to do so puts you at a huge advantage because it costs you\n\t\tnothing to apply this, but the target needs to either give up on the idea of\n\t\tmoving (in which case you can shoot them to death at range) or spend an\n\t\tAction to remove the effect. Honestly, the fact that there&#8217;s a DC at all\n\t\tseems mostly unnecessary, but low-Strength enemies might struggle to escape\n\t\tif their rolls are poor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tangled Forest Stance<\/span>: Stand Still can\n\t\tgenerally cover this need, but Stand Still eats your Reaction so it only\n\t\tworks once per round, so Tangled Forest Stance works better for multiple\n\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wall Run<\/span>: Very cool, but totally useless\n\t\tcomapred to magical flight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wild Winds Initiate<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-10\">10th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cobra Envenom<\/span>: Persistent damage is really\n\t\tgood, and the fact that this is multiplied by your weapon damage dice means\n\t\tthat it will remain a significant source of damage for your whole career.\n\t\tAdding 5 ft. of reach to this attack allows you to use it for hit-and-run\n\t\ttactics with less risk of triggering Reactions, too. The only problem is the\n\t\t1-minute cooldown, but if you only get to use this once per encounter it\n\t\twill still be impactful. Use it early in the encounter to maximize the\n\t\tpotential persistent damage which you can deal.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knockback Strike<\/span>: If you want to get\n\t\tenemies away from you, Whirling Throw is considerably better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Peafowl Strut<\/span>: Peafowl Stance gives you a\n\t\tfree Step every turn if you can hit once. Peafowl Strut is a Flourish, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re using it in place of Flurry of Flows. If you do hit with the attack\n\t\tfrom Peafowl Strut, you can Step twice, Strike, then Step again. This allows\n\t\tyou to dance in and out of melee reach, forcing your enemies to spend their\n\t\town Actions to Stride or Step to reach you. However, the Monk is typically\n\t\ttheir party&#8217;s Defender, so you&#8217;re expected to interpose yourself between\n\t\tyour enemies and your comparably frail allies. Repeatedly removing yourself\n\t\tfrom melee makes it easy for enemies to talk around you in order to reach\n\t\tyour allies. Using this also reduces the number of attacks that you&#8217;re\n\t\tmaking, thereby reducing your damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prevailing Position<\/span>: A +4 Circumstances\n\t\tbonus as a Reaction is <em>huge<\/em>. That&#8217;s double the bonus from Raise a\n\t\tShield, and you only need to use it as a Reaction rather paying a persistant\n\t\ttax to maintain the bonus. You do drop out of your Stance, however, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll need to spend an Action on your next turn to get back into your\n\t\tStance. Still, if this prevents you from taking a pile of damage it&#8217;s\n\t\tprobably worth the Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sleeper Hold<\/span>: Difficult to justify\n\t\tunless you can somehow guarantee that you&#8217;ll score a critical success after\n\t\tseveral attempts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wind Jump<\/span>: An absolutely essential option\n\t\tfor nearly any monk. This is the Monk&#8217;s only built-in flight option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Winding Flow<\/span>: Situational, but extra\n\t\tmovement never hurts, and if you&#8217;re heavily reliant on position (possibly\n\t\tfor flanking) or you like to hit enemies then withdraw, this can make doing\n\t\tso considerably more effective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-12\">12th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Diamond Soul<\/span>: Situational by design.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disrupt Ki<\/span>: Enfeebled 1 is a really\n\t\tminor debuff since the penalty is small and it only applies to\n\t\tStrength-based rolls and DC&#8217;s, but you&#8217;re primarily using this for the\n\t\tongoing damage. I&#8217;m not sure that the math justifies spending two Actions to\n\t\tdo this when you could just make another Strike, but in prolonged fights or\n\t\tagainst enemies with vulnerability to Negative damage this can yield an\n\t\timpressive amount of damage (assuming that the target doesn&#8217;t get lucky on\n\t\tthe Flat Check to end the effect at the end of their turn).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dodging Roll<\/span>: Basic Reflex Saves are very\n\t\tcommon, and while the Monk&#8217;s saving throws are excellent, you still take\n\t\tdamage from things like breath weapons and fireballs even if your Succeed on\n\t\tthe save. The ability to move a tiny bit and add some temporary damage\n\t\tresistance will save you a lot of damage throughout your character&#8217;s\n\t\tcareer.\n\t\t<p>If you took Prevailing Position, you might skip this or retraint\n\t\t\tPrevailing Position. They&#8217;re both good, but they overlap too much to\n\t\t\tjustify having both.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focused Shot<\/span>: Situational, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\tbuild for Monastic Archer Stance this is definitely worth considering. Cover\n\t\tand Concealment are more problematic while fighting at range than they are\n\t\twhile fighting in melee, and this makes those challenges considerably less\n\t\tproblematic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Knockback<\/span>: Whirling Throw is still\n\t\ta much better option, though admittedly you need to Grapple the target first\n\t\tto use it. Still, Shove is a very situational option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Meditative Focus<\/span>: If you&#8217;re relying on\n\t\tFocus Points in any significant way, you need this. The rules for Refocus\n\t\tare written specifically so that you can&#8217;t Refocus multiple times in\n\t\tsuccession: After you regain a Focus Point by any means, you must spend a\n\t\tFocus Point again before you can Refocus. So: If you have a Focus Pool\n\t\tlarger than one point, you almost certainly need this feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Overwhelming Breath<\/span>: If physical damage\n\t\tresistance is a problem often enough that you need this, your GM is trying\n\t\tvery hard to make martial characters less effective. You should not need\n\t\tthis feat. If you do take this, it combines well with Ki Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stance Savant<\/span>: Another action early in a\n\t\tfight might make a big difference, and if you&#8217;re using stances like Mountain\n\t\tStance or Ironblood Stance you want those up and running at the beginning of\n\t\tcombat to protect yourself before your first turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Form Lock<\/span>: Hillarious, but too situational.\n\t\tI love the idea of wresting a creature until it returns to its natural form,\n\t\tbut how often do you expect to face shapeshifters?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ironblood Surge<\/span>: Remove the Action tax to\n\t\tbenefit from Iron Sweep&#8217;s Parry trait, and increase the damage resistance\n\t\tfrom Ironblood Stance by a few points. Of course, if you&#8217;re not\n\t\tStrength-based the base damage resistance from Ironblood Stance will match\n\t\tor exceed your Strength modifier, which dramatically devalues this feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mountain Quake<\/span>: Possibly +1 AC and an AOE\n\t\tcrowd control effect which you can use repeatedly. Forcing enemies to spend\n\t\tan action to stand is absolutely worth the feat and the action, and you get\n\t\ta little bit of damage as a bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-bluw\">Shadow&#8217;s Web<\/span>: See Focus Spells, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tangled Forest Rake<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Timeless Body<\/span>: Damage resistance is\n\t\talways tempting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tongue of Sun and Moon<\/span>: Spellcasters have\n\t\tbeen able to address language barriers for a long time by this point in your\n\t\tcareer, and your dumped Charisma makes you a poor candidate for a Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whirling Blade Stance<\/span>: The only characters\n\t\tthat would need this are monks built to use melee weapons. This adds the\n\t\tability to use those weapons to make ranged attacks. However, with a 10-foot\n\t\trange increment you might as well just Stride to reach your target. For the\n\t\tcost of such as high-level feat, you might also consider getting an enhanced\n\t\tShuriken with a Returning Rune as a backup weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Winds Gust<\/span>: If you are using Wild\n\t\tWinds Stance, this is an absolutely spectacular way to handle crowds of\n\t\tenemies. If you can hit at least three targets, this should be your go-to\n\t\toption. The fact that there&#8217;s no cooldown of any kind makes this even\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enlightened Presence<\/span>: Nearly all Will\n\t\tsaves are against mental effects, so this is a significant defensive bonus\n\t\tfor your party.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flinging Blow<\/span>: Too situational. The Shove\n\t\tAction will suffice in nearly any case where this is useful. Perhaps the\n\t\tonly redeeming point is the additional damage from the pushed creature\n\t\thitting something else, but by this level you&#8217;ll deal more damage in total\n\t\tby making another Strike.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Master of Many Styles<\/span>: Using multiple\n\t\tstances is hard and rarely effective, so this feat is situational and only\n\t\tworthwhile in builds that have found a way to capitalize on multiple stances\n\t\tsomehow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Medusa&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: See Focus Spells,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">One-Millimeter Punch<\/span>: Too situational. Use\n\t\tthe Shove Action instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quivering Palm<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s only\n\t\tSave-or-die option, and it can still Stun the target even if they don&#8217;t\n\t\tdie.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shattering Strike<\/span>: Situational.\n\t\tTypically you&#8217;ll want to find other ways past a target&#8217;s resistances like\n\t\tweapons made of special metals, or using class features like Mystic Strikes,\n\t\tMetal Strikes, and Adamantine Strikes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Diamond Fists<\/span>: More damage never hurts.\n\t\tThis is especially useful if your Unarmed Attacks have the Agile trait, and\n\t\tif you like to stand still and make numerous Strikes in a single turn. The\n\t\textra damage scales as you make multiple attacks, so the more you focus on\n\t\tattacking, the more effective Forceful becomes. It&#8217;s exceptionally rare to\n\t\tbe able to combine both Agile and Forceful, so this is a uniquely powerful\n\t\toption for the Monk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Empty Body<\/span>: Being Etheral is extremely\n\t\tpowerful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Center<\/span>: You can use thise once per\n\t\tminute as a Free Action, and it&#8217;s easy to overlook just how amazing that is.\n\t\tOnce per minute means that you can use it at least once per combat. Using\n\t\tthis as a Free Action means that you can cast the Focus Spell to activate\n\t\tthe stance as a Free Action rather than the 1 Action it typically takes to\n\t\tcast Clinging Shadows Stance or Wild Winds Stance. Since this doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tconsume a Focus Point, you&#8217;re not left without your favorite Stance even if\n\t\tyou can&#8217;t Refocus, and you can spend your Focus Points on other Focus Spells\n\t\twithout worry. For a Ki Monk this is an absolute game changer.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Form<\/span>: Go Super Saiyan for 1 minute.\n\t\tYour hair changes color and glows, an aura of light surrounds you, and you\n\t\tcan fly. This is the most anime thing I&#8217;ve ever seen on a monk having played\n\t\tacross three editions of D&amp;D and two editions of Pathfinder. Jokes\n\t\taside, this is pretty good. Flight, a small bonus to damage on your Strikes,\n\t\tand the corona deals some automatic damage. You get to choose the damage\n\t\ttype when you cast the spell, and between lawful, negative, and positive\n\t\tyou&#8217;re basically guaranteed to have a way to get around damage\n\t\tresistances.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Meditative Wellspring<\/span>: Essential if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re relying heavily on Focus Spells, but for other monks it&#8217;s not worth\n\t\tsuch a high-level feat slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swift River<\/span>: Essentially a permanent\n\t\tFreedom of Movement effect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Triangle Shot<\/span>: Good, but not essential.\n\t\tIt&#8217;s easy to compare this to making a Flurry of Blows followed by an\n\t\tadditional Strike. You get three attacks in either case, but there are some\n\t\tdifferences. With Flurry+Strike, only the two flurry attacks combine their\n\t\tdamage for the purpose of resistances, and the third attack takes the\n\t\tmaximum Multiple Attack Penalty. Since bows don&#8217;t have Agile, that -10\n\t\tpenalty is a big problem. With Triangle Shot, you get three attacks all at a\n\t\t-2 penalty, and you combine the damage from all three for the purpose of\n\t\tresistances. So you&#8217;re more likely to hit with all three attacks, and you&#8217;ll\n\t\thave less trouble with resistances, but all three attacks need to target the\n\t\tsame creature (which usually isn&#8217;t a problem unless the creature dies before\n\t\tthe final attack).\n\t\t<p>Those benefits may feel somewhat minor, especially for a feat at this\n\t\t\tlevel, but if you manage to hit with all three attacks (which is easier\n\t\t\twithout a -10 Multiple Attack Penalty), you apply a big pile of persistent\n\t\t\tbleed damage. Taken as a whole, this should be your go-to option when you\n\t\t\tneed to focus damage on a single target.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deadly Strikes<\/span>: A numerical improvement\n\t\tto your damage output, but it&#8217;s not tactically impactful. It doesn&#8217;t let you\n\t\tdo anything that you couldn&#8217;t already do, and as nice as Deadly is this just\n\t\tisn&#8217;t enough for a 20th-level feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enduring Quickness<\/span>: In many cases you&#8217;ll\n\t\tfind yourself in melee and unable to use this without provoking Reactions\n\t\tfrom melee-focused enemies. In other situations, you&#8217;re already fast enough\n\t\tthat your regular Stride actions will nearly always be sufficient. Winding\n\t\tFlow provides a similar benefit, and it&#8217;s available at 10th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fuse Stance<\/span>: Conceptually fantastic, but\n\t\tlimited by the current selection of stances. Crane Stance and Mountain\n\t\tstance both limit you to a single type of Strike, but other stances can be\n\t\teasily combined. Ironblood is generally an easy option for a second stance\n\t\tbecause it&#8217;s literally always useful and doesn&#8217;t require you to change your\n\t\ttactics in any way to make it effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Impossible Technique<\/span>: This is insanely\n\t\tgood. You&#8217;re good at every type of Saving Throw, and being able to reroll\n\t\tone save every round makes you incredibly difficult to kill. If you&#8217;re not\n\t\tfacing enemies which rely on abilities which trigger Saving Throws\n\t\t(spellcasters, enemies with breath weapons, etc.) you can force rerolls on\n\t\tattacks, essentially giving you a significant boost your AC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-feats\">General Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Canny Acument<\/span>: This can raise either your\n\t\tweakest save or your Perception to master, but not until 17th level, making\n\t\tit a great option for a hihg-level General Feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Toughness<\/span>: More hit points are always a\n\t\tgood idea, but as soon as Paizo publishes more interesting General Feats\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll likely find that you can&#8217;t justify Toughness.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Untrained Improvisation<\/span>: Intelligence is\n\t\ta dump stat for many monks, which means that you likely won&#8217;t have many\n\t\ttrained skills. Monks are also MAD, which means that you&#8217;ll have several\n\t\thigh ability scores. That means that you can do a lot with skills in which\n\t\tyou&#8217;re untrained despite lacking the +2 bonus from being Trained. You&#8217;ll\n\t\tstill be limited to actions which you can make untrained, but you&#8217;ll be very\n\t\tgood at them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bo Staff<\/span>: The Temple Sword will deal just\n\t\tas much damage and only takes on hand, but the Bo Staff&#8217;s properties are\n\t\tmore useful.

The damage die is small,\n\t\tbut if you&#8217;re using weapons you&#8217;ll still want to carry some shurikens.\n\t\tThey&#8217;ll still apply your Strength bonus, making them a fantastic option\n\t\tdespite their low damage die. The Shuriken is also the only Thrown weapon\n\t\twith the reload property, which appears to override the normal Action\n\t\trequired to draw a weapon, allowing you to draw and throw a Shuriken as a\n\t\tsingle action. When you get into magic weapons, get a Returning property\n\t\trune as soon as possible so that you can throw a single shuriken repeatedly\n\t\trather than needing to buy a pile of them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Temple Sword<\/span>: The best weapon damage die\n\t\tavailable as a monk weapon, but the traits aren&#8217;t great.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unarmored<\/span>: Literally your only choice.\n\t\tGaining armor proficiency from feats, even from multiclass archetype feats,\n\t\tisn&#8217;t as effective because your proficiency won&#8217;t increase beyond Trained\n\t\t(or Expert if you get a second Champion archetype feat).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shield<\/span>: A shield can be a great option\n\t\tfor the Monk. Flurry of Blows is your go-to attack option in most builds,\n\t\tand subsequent attacks will suffer a significant Multiple Attack Penalty\n\t\t(Agile helps a bit), so you might find that your Action is better spent to\n\t\tRaise a Shield rather than making another Strike. If you go this route,\n\t\tconsider taking the Shield Block feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells\">Monk Focus Spells &#8211; Ki Spells<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Rush<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ki Strike<\/span>: A fine go-to option to boost\n\t\tyour damage, but it will eat your Focus Points very quickly so save it for\n\t\twhen your target is disadvantaged somehow (Flat-Footed, etc.) and you&#8217;re not\n\t\tgoing to do anything that turn except hit things so that you can maximize\n\t\tthe damage you get for your Focus Point.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wholeness of body<\/span>: If you take exactly one\n\t\tFocus Spell as a monk, make it this one. Given enough time to repeatedly use\n\t\tthis and Refocus, you can always return to full hit points, recover from\n\t\tpoisons, and recover from diseases. Even in combat, this costs a single\n\t\tAction and restores an impressive number of hit points, making it a great\n\t\tway to recover hit points in the middle of a fight.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Blast<\/span>: One of very few ways that the\n\t\tMonk can easily handle large groups of enemies. The damage scaling is good,\n\t\tespecially if you use at least two Actions, and leaving an extra action\n\t\tmeans that you can afford to spend it to Stride and position yourself to hit\n\t\tas many targets as possible. The 3-Action option only deals 1d6 more damage\n\t\tthan the 2-Action option, so only use it if you can make the 60-foot cone at\n\t\tleast as effective as moving to a better position and using the 30-foot\n\t\tcone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Abundant Step<\/span>: Teleportation is always\n\t\tgood, but this is limited both by your speed and your line of sight. You can\n\t\tstill use it to bypass many obstacles like high cliffs or dungeon bars and\n\t\tthe like, and you can use to easily reach squishy enemies like spellcasters\n\t\twhich are often protected by more martially-inclined enemies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Clinging Shadows Stance<\/span>: This has a ton of\n\t\tgreat things going for it. Negative damage is rarely resisted (except by\n\t\tundead), so despite the small damage die this is a great way to get around\n\t\tdamage resistances. The Grapple and Reach traits allow you to grapple\n\t\tenemies while potentially remaining outside of the target&#8217;s reach, allowing\n\t\tyou to hurt them without them being able to respond. The +2 Circumstance\n\t\tbonus to the DC to to Escape your grapple is a mathematically significant\n\t\tbonus which will help you to maintain your position of superiority.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wild Winds Stance<\/span>: For a Ki Monk, this is\n\t\toften your go-to option in combat. It&#8217;s also the most effective option or\n\t\tthe Monk to fight at range for an extended period. However, due to the\n\t\tStance rules, it has some risky limitations. If you&#8217;re unable to Refocus\n\t\tbetween fights, you may find yourself unable to use this. If combat ends\n\t\t(and therefore your Stance ends) BS a new combat begins shortly thereafter\n\t\t(an ambush, a poorly-chosen door, etc.), you may find yourself without your\n\t\tfavorite stance. Make sure that you can still fight at least passably well\n\t\twithout relying on this stance. Also remember that since these are ranged\n\t\tattacks, you&#8217;ll want to build around Dexterity rather than Strength, though\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll still want at least 14 Strength to get some damage out of the\n\t\tPropulsive trait.\n\t\t<p>Wild Winds Stance gives your Unarmed Attacks the Propulsive property,\n\t\t\twhich allows you to apply half of your Strength Bonus to damage, so if you\n\t\t\tplan to use this consistently you should probably stop improving your\n\t\t\tStrength at either 14 or 18.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This is a core option for Ki Monks, but it&#8217;s not essential for other\n\t\t\tmonks. If you need a convenient ranged options, some shurikens will\n\t\t\tsuffice.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wind Jump<\/span>: By this level you can easily by\n\t\tMaster in Acrobatics (level+6), granting you a total bonus of +15 before\n\t\tconsider your Dexterity modifier. With the Assurance skill feat that&#8217;s a\n\t\tguaranteed result of 25 at this level, so you&#8217;ll need to roll to hit the\n\t\tDC of 30. If you have at least\n\t\t18 Dexterity (easy by this level, assuming you started with no less than 16\n\t\tDexterity), you have a better-than-even chance on a roll, and your odds\n\t\tof success improve if you can find persistent bonuses from items and as you\n\t\tgain more levels. Flight is an\n\t\tabsolutely essential tactic at high levels, so being able to fly\n\t\tconsistently without relying on allied spellcasters or items is an important\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"blue\">Shadow&#8217;s Web<\/span>: Despite the description, the\n\t\tprimary effects of Shadow&#8217;s Web are a 30-foot burst of negative damage and\n\t\tthe Enfeebled condition. The damage isn&#8217;t spectacular compared to regular\n\t\tspells, but it&#8217;s a focus spell which deals AOE damage for a class which has\n\t\tnearly no options for handling crowds. The Enfeebled condition doesn&#8217;t last\n\t\tlong, but it&#8217;ll weaken martial enemies briefly. You can stun and immobilize\n\t\tenemies which critical fail their save, but relying on critical failures on\n\t\tsaves rarely works out how you&#8217;d like it to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Medusa&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: Save-or-suck as a Focus\n\t\tSpell. The ongoing effect has the Incapacitation trait, so it&#8217;s not going to\n\t\twork on powerful enemies, but against the vast majority of enemies this is a\n\t\tgreat way quickly eliminate them. The target does need to fail at least one\n\t\tsaving throw to be permanently petrified, but at the bare minimum they&#8217;ll be\n\t\tSlowed for two rounds, losing a total of three Actions. That alone is a\n\t\tmassive tactival advantage, even if the target has no realistic chance of\n\t\tbecoming petrified, so even if the target is high enough in level that the\n\t\tIncapacitation trait makes it unlikely that you&#8217;ll petrify the target this\n\t\tis still a fantastic debuff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quivering Palm<\/span>: Even with the unusual\n\t\tmechanics, this is still a save-or-die effect, and those are always good.\n\t\tThe target is still stunned even if they succeed (though not if they\n\t\tcriticall succeed), which can still be very helpful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Empty Body<\/span>: Being Ethereal is extremely\n\t\tuseful both as an escape mechanism and as a way to safely infiltrate and\n\t\tscout dangerous places.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-\">Ki Form<\/span>: <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"magic-weapon-runes\">Weapon Property Runes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grievous<\/span>: Most monks make attacks in the\n\t\tBrawling group, and the Critical Specialization for Brawling weapons makes\n\t\ttargets Slowed 1 if they fail a save. Applying a -4 penalty dramatically\n\t\timproves the odds of the target failing, and by high levels the 700gp cost\n\t\tis easily affordable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Speed<\/span>: If standing still and making a\n\t\tbunch of Strikes is a regular option for you, Speed adds one more Strike.\n\t\tYou&#8217;ll still suffer the Multiple Attack Penalty normally, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing Flurry of Blows and making a total of 3 additional Strikes, you&#8217;re\n\t\tlikely to hit with some of them despite the -10 penalty (-8 with Agile).\n\t\tThis gets even more appealing if your attacks are Forceful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ghost Touch<\/span>: Dirt cheap compared to other\n\t\tproperty runes, and without it you&#8217;re severely disadvantaged against\n\t\tincorporeal enemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"other-magic-items\">Other Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bracers of Armor<\/span>: Slightly cheaper than\n\t\tthe equivalent effects from enhancing a suit of Explorer&#8217;s Clothing, but you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t transfer runes and you can&#8217;t buy it piecemeal over time, so enhancing\n\t\tExplorer&#8217;s Clothing may work out to be cheaper if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to\n\t\tloot the runes that you want.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Handwraps of Mighty Fists<\/span>: Essential for\n\t\tany monk who is not primarily relying on weapons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Multiclassing into spellcasting classes works in a somewhat unique way for the Monk due to how Ki Spells work. When you choose your first Ki Spell, you get to choose if your spellcasting is Divine or Occult, and you become Trained with spells of that type and your proficency improves as you gain levels. Choosing a class which matches that type of spellcasting (Such as Cleric or Sorcerer for Divine, Bard or Sorcerer for Occult) allows you to capitalize on that improving proficiency, keeping your offensive spells effective despite not taking additional Multiclass Archetype Feats to progress your spellcasting benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemist<\/span>: Mutagens have a lot to offer\n\t\tmartial classes like the Monk. Unfortunately, your Advanced Alchemy level\n\t\tstays at 1 unless you invest a large number of feats, and you may be able to\n\t\tget similar benefits from Monk Class Feats. If you do pursue Alchemist, I\n\t\tstrongly recommend the Juggernaut Mutagen.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Barbarian<\/span>: Rage is a great option for the\n\t\tMonk, but since the damage bonus is halved with Agile weapons\/attacks, your\n\t\toptions for attacks and stances are severely limited. If you&#8217;re going for\n\t\tstances over weapons, you&#8217;ll want to stick to Dragon Tail, Falling Stone,\n\t\tand Iron Sweep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/span>: When you get your first Ki Spell\n\t\tyou can choose to be an Occult spellcaster, so you&#8217;ll get the scaling Occult\n\t\tproficiency, but your Bard spells will still be Charisma-based so they won&#8217;t\n\t\tbe as effective offensively as Cleric spells would be.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Champion<\/span>: The Fighter will typically\n\t\tprovide more useful options than the Champion, though you may get some\n\t\tbenefit from the Champion&#8217;s Focus Spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cleric<\/span>: If you have one or more Ki Spells,\n\t\tyou get the scaling proficiency as you gain levels, plus Ki Monks will\n\t\talready have Wisdom high enough to back them up. An offensive cantrip can be\n\t\tabsolutely fantastic improvements to your ability to fight at range,\n\t\tespecially when options like shurikens or Wild Winds Stance are ineffective\n\t\tor unavailable. I recommend taking Divine Lance and Shield if no other\n\t\toptions seem appealing. You can also gain access to a number of great Focus\n\t\tSpells to complement any Ki Spells which you might learn if you go beyond\n\t\tCleric Devotion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid<\/span>: If you want spellcasting, the Cleric\n\t\tis a much better option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: Fighter grants you proficiency\n\t\tin Simple and Martial weapons, but you&#8217;ll never use it because the\n\t\tproficiency never improves unless you waste another feat. The real appeal is\n\t\tthe Fighter&#8217;s class feats. Feats which work while you have a free hand lik\n\t\tCombat Grab are great additions to the Monk&#8217;s capabilities. Fighters also\n\t\thave several Stance feats, but until we get some options for archer monks\n\t\tthey&#8217;re not very interesting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger<\/span>: Most of the Ranger&#8217;s best options\n\t\tare based on their Prey mechanic, and while you&#8217;ll often have spare Actions\n\t\tthanks to Flurry of Blows, Prey creates a constant Action tax early in an\n\t\tencounter which competes for space with initiating a stance, and the\n\t\tbeginning of an encounter is when your Actions are the most important.s<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span>: Many monk stances give you Unarmed\n\t\tStrikes which have the Finesse trait, so they can be use with Sneak Attack.\n\t\tYou&#8217;ll need to take the Sneak Attacker feat, but with Flurry of Blows you&#8217;ll\n\t\thave more opportunities to apply the bonus damage than many other\n\t\tcharacters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sorcerer<\/span>: You can choose a bloodline\n\t\twhich provides Divine spellcasting, but the spells will still be\n\t\tCharisma-based, and Charisma is typically a dump stat for the Monk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wizard<\/span>: If you want spellcasting, Cleric is\n\t\ta much better option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Monk is most easily compared to the Fighter.
