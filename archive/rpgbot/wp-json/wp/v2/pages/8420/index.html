Throughout its history, the Oracle has been the\n\tdivine equivalent to the Sorcerer, sharing the cleric&#8217;s armor and weapon\n\toptions but using the Sorcerer&#8217;s spellcasting mechanics. In Pathfinder 2e,\n\tthat means using a Spell Repertoire like the Sorcerer while getting similar\n\tequipment to the Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Oracle and the Sorcerer are so similar, it&#8217;s natural to draw some comparisons, especially since the Sorcerer can also use the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/divine-spell-list\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"5178\">Divine spell list<\/a>. The <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/oracle\/mysteries\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"8433\">Oracle&#8217;s Mystery<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/bloodlines\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"7263\">Sorcerer&#8217;s Bloodline<\/a> serve to distinguish the two classes thematically, and while the handful of bloodlines that use the Divine spell list will often feel similar in many ways, oracles have more room for diversity while stil using the same spell list. The Oracle&#8217;s Mystery also comes with Drawbacks and a condition track, where the Sorcerer&#8217;s Bloodline is purely beneficial, so the Oracle brings some additional complexity that can be fun to play with at the cost of additional challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Playing an oracle is challenging. The Oracle&#8217;s Curse is frequently frustrating and requires a lot of tracking and cost\/benefit calculations. The Focus Spells (called &#8220;Revelation Spells&#8221;) are no better than those of other classes, but come with additonal cost. The Oracle&#8217;s Class Feats are limited in number, and there are unusually many bad options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Oracle&#8217;s skills and saves are poor in many ways, and despite several options intended to support oracles using weapons they remain terrible at doing so. Your best bet is to play the Oracle like a weird sorcerer, and in many cases a sorcerer with the Divine Spell List will be both easier to play and more effective, if only because you&#8217;re not saddled with the Oracle&#8217;s Curse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Oracle Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#conventional\">Conventional<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#battle-mystery\">Battle Mystery<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Oracle-feats\">Oracle Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Oracle-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Oracle-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Unfortunately you may need to dump\n\t\tIntelligence to compensate for other deficiencies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attacks<\/span>: Only simple weapons (unless you\n\t\tselect the Battle Mystery), and you&#8217;ll never be good with them. You&#8217;re\n\t\tbetter than the Wizard, but that&#8217;s a low bar.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Only light armor (unless you\n\t\tselect the Battle Mystery), and your proficiency never advances past Expert.\n\t\tSpending feats to get better armor is a good idea for most oracles unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re comfortable fighting from the back lines.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spellcasting DC<\/strong>: Standard for spellcasters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Divine Spellcasting<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heightened Spells<\/span>: Heightening spells is\n\t\tan important mechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many spells scale with spell level,\n\t\tremaining effective long past their base spell level. Since oracles use a\n\t\tSpell Repertoire, you need to learn spells at multiple levels to heighten\n\t\tthem in most cases, though Signature Spells are an exception.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Fantastic every time, on any\n\t\tcharacter, in any amount. Oracles learn 5 cantrips at level 1 and never get\n\t\tmore, but you can replace them by retraining or when you gain a level so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not locked into whatever you pick at first level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Repertoire<\/span>: Spell Repertoires are\n\tless versatile than spellcasting like the Cleric&#8217;s or the Druid&#8217;s. You know a\n\tfixed number of spells which grows as you gain levels, and while you don&#8217;t\n\tneed to prepare your spells ahead of time you also lose the flexibility of\n\tchanging your spells every day. You also need to learn the same spells at\n\tmultiple levels if you plan to heighten them, which is a difficult cost to\n\tpay. Fortunately, the Oracle&#8217;s Signature Spells feature (see below) allows you\n\tto heighten some of your spells without learning them multiple times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mysteries<\/strong>: See my\n\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/classes\/oracle\/mysteries\">Oracle Mysteries Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelation Spells<\/span>: You start with a Focus\n\tPool of 2 points for free, which is very generous. The wording of the feature\n\tis a little vague, but you do still follow the usual rules for Refocusing, so\n\tyou can only recover one point until you cast another Focus Spell, so you only\n\trecharge the full pool when you rest (until you get a feat that lets you\n\tRefocus to get more points back). You also get two Focus Spells, so you have\n\tmore options for your Focus Points than most characters do at first level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oracular Curse<\/span>: The drawback for your\n\tRevelation Spells, Oracular curse is a sort of &#8220;death spiral&#8221; mechanic where\n\tthings get worse for you the further you go down the track. At first level,\n\tyour curse can be in its &#8220;Basic&#8221; state, its &#8220;Minor&#8221; state, its &#8220;Moderate&#8221;\n\tstate, or you can be overwhelmed. Each time you cast a Revelation Spell, your\n\tcurse increases one step. You can reduce your curse to Minor by Refocusing,\n\tbut you can only get back to Basic if you rest for 8 hours. You add the\n\t&#8220;Major&#8221; state at level 11 and the &#8220;Extreme&#8221; state at level 17, each of which\n\tadds another step before you become Overwhelmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming Overwhelmed sucks. Don&#8217;t do it unless you&#8217;re absolutely desperate.\n\tOnce you&#8217;re Overwhelmed, you can&#8217;t cast or sustain your Revelation Spells\n\tuntil you get a full rest. That means that if you cast a Revelation Spell that\n\tmade your Overwhelmed, you can&#8217;t Sustain that spell. You can still Refocus to\n\treduce your curse and use your Focus Points for other Focus Spells, but your\n\tRevelation Spells are gone for the day. Once you hit level 17 and get Extreme\n\tCurse, you&#8217;re also Doomed 2 until you rest. Again: becoming Overwhelmed sucks.\n\tDon&#8217;t do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, becoming Overwhelmed by your curse is actually fairly difficult. At first level, you get 2 Focus Points. If you spend both, you&#8217;re at Major. If you Refocus, you go to Minor and get 1 Focus Point so you can only get back up to Major.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need another Focus Point from another source (likely from a class feat or from an archetype, but there are Ancestry Feats and items which can help, too). If you don&#8217;t get Focus Points from other sources, you&#8217;ll get a third point at level 11 when you get Major Curse, but you still can&#8217;t make yourself Overwhelmed unless you somehow get a Focus Point some way besides refocusing. I think this mechanic is in place specifically to discourage you from going beyond the maximum Focus Pool size of 3 by using items or feats which restore a Focus Point<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oracle Feats<\/strong>: See Oracle feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Signature Spells<\/span>: A powerful and important\n\tfeature, this allows you to heighten a small set of spells without learning\n\tthem multiple times.

At least your Wisdom is good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Major Curse<\/span>: An important progression step,\n\tthis allows you to cast more Revelation spells in succession without becoming\n\tOverwhelmed. It also raises your Focus Pool size to 3 and lets you get 2\n\tpoints back from Refocusing. Most classes need a class feat to do that, so\n\tthis is a really nice feature.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Expertise<\/span>: Too little, too late, and\n\tyou never get any better than this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Reflexes<\/span>: Your Reflex saves max\n\tout at Expert, and even then not until 13th level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat, but you get this very late.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: A miniscule damage\n\tboost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Spellcaster<\/span>: Better spell attacks and\n\tspell DCs.

A reroll once per 10 minutes with no Action cost is nice\n\tinsurance when you&#8217;re doing something hard. You can also Refocus to get 3\n\tFocus Points back, which is exciting since most classes need to spend a feat\n\tto do that.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Resolve<\/span>: Very powerful.

Still, I know people want to play battle\n\toracles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: Battle clerics get heavy armor at\n\tlevel 1, so building around heavy armor and Strength is generally the way to\n\tgo.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dex<\/span>: Dump.

It&#8217;s a\n\t\tneat idea, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the issue of the Oracle&#8217;s awful weapon\n\t\tproficienct progression, and the 1d6 bonus damage doesn&#8217;t scale so as you\n\t\tgain levels it becomes gradually less useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Access<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Varies wildly in usefulness depending on your mystery and the associated\n\t\tdomains, but since most domains are available to multiple deities, you have\n\t\ta wide selection of spells to choose from.

It is\n\t\tCursebound, which is a problem, but it works in literally every encounter,\n\t\twhich can&#8217;t be said for most focus spells.

If Haunts are going to feature prominently in your\n\t\tgame, if you expect to face a lot of spirits, or if your GM likes to have\n\t\tshadows attack you through walls and floors, this may be worth the feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Steady Spellcasting<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: The Flat Check is too difficult to make this feat an easy choice. You\n\t\thave a success rate of just 30%.

Even so, make sure that you\n\t\thave decent Wisdom and item bonuses to buff your Will save or you may\n\t\tfind that you&#8217;re hurting yourself more than your target.\n\t\tIf you&#8217;re confident that you won&#8217;t be drawing a lot of attacks in\n\t\tyour current encounter, this could be a quick way to end a fight\n\t\twhile spending minimal resources, but weigh the cost carefully\n\t\tbefore using this rather than using it at the beginning of every\n\t\tencounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Read Disaster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: I love Augury.

This has no cost except time, so it&#8217;s a\n\t\tgreat option when allies are doing things between combat like using Medicine\n\t\tto heal or using Craft to repair their equipment.
