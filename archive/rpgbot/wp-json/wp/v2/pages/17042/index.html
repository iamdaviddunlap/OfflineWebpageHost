Don&#8217;t take this\n\tarchetype expecting it to make you the party&#8217;s primary healer, but instead\n\ttake it to add some additional healing to a class which otherwise wouldn&#8217;t\n\thave any. The cleric is on the floor, but here comes the barbarian with eleven\n\therbs and spices to patch things up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"herbalist-vs-alchemist-multiclass\">Herbalist vs Alchemist Multiclass<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>You might want to compare the Herbalist to the Alchemist Multiclass. For\n\trequirements, instead of a skill (Nature) and skill feat (Natural Medicine)\n\tthe Alchemist MC Dedication requires 14 Intelligence. Both dedications grant\n\tthe\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alchemical Crafting<\/a> feat\n\tand a number of reagents per day. Notably, Alchemist does not require anything\n\tspecial to get your full level worth of reagents as opposed to Herbalist only\n\tgetting half for not being in the wilderness. On top of this, the Alchemist MC\n\tis not limited to any subsection of Alchemical Items and has an array of feats\n\tthat grant some of the Alchemist&#8217;s class features, such as\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Actions.aspx?ID=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quick Alchemy<\/a> or other\n\tAlchemist feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, unlike Herbalist, the Alchemist MC requires two feats at 6th and\n\t12th to eventually gain an Advanced Alchemy level of Level-5. If you&#8217;re just\n\tlooking to add Alchemical Healing to your toolset, Herbalist will do more for\n\tyou with less investment in the long run. If you want a broader array of\n\tAlchemical power, you might look into the Alchemist MC or just take the\n\tAlchemical Crafting feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#herbalist-vs-alchemist-multiclass\">Herbalist vs Alchemist Multiclass<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#herbalist-feats\">Herbalist Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#who-should-use-this\">Who Should Use This?<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

This is good because we need to learn the 1st-level Healing formulas,\n\t\tthey are not auto-granted by the Dedication feat directly. As there are only\n\t\tthree such formulas, we are free to add one other 1st-level Alchemical\n\t\tformula to our book for creation with standard crafting. We are granted\n\t\tExpert in Nature and the ability to use Nature and healer&#8217;s tools for\n\t\tcrafting Alchemical items with the \u201cHealing\u201d trait. This does not prevent us\n\t\tfrom also using the Crafting skill and alchemist&#8217;s tools for non-healing\n\t\tAlchemical items with our Alchemical Crafting feat.

We gain a total number of reagents equal to half of\n\t\t\tour level unless we perform our daily preparations in the wilderness, in\n\t\t\twhich case we use our whole level for a total. If you&#8217;re staying in\n\t\t\tcivilization, plan to take a morning hike in the nearest national park.\n\t\t\tKeep in mind that things are made in batches of two identical items per\n\t\t\treagent, thus with 2 reagents, we could produce 4\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=91\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elixir of Life (Minor)<\/a>\n\t\t\tor 2 Elixir of Life and 2\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=80\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Antidote (Lesser)<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=1983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fresh Ingredients<\/span><\/a>\n\t\t2: As a skill feat, we can take this at the same time as taking our\n\t\tDedication feat if we want to, which is a way to fast track getting two\n\t\tfeats in order to take a second Dedication. However, actually using this\n\t\tfeat isn&#8217;t great for most people. You have to not spend some of your reagent\n\t\tpool making Elixirs in order to have them on hand to spend for a bonus to a\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Actions.aspx?ID=57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Treat Wounds<\/a> check.\n\t\tKeep in mind that one reagent is two Elixirs, which are 1d6 healing each at\n\t\tminimum, so just mix up the Elixirs.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=3614\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Gravelands Herbalist<\/span><\/a>\n\t\t4 (Uncommon): This feat has multiple extra prerequisites of being trained in\n\t\tReligion and being a member of the Knights of Lastwall, but the benefit it\n\t\tprovides does not really justify being a feat, let alone having the extra\n\t\trequirements. It teaches you to make soup. Special soup that gives you a\n\t\tsmall bonus to Stealth, but only against Undead. And that&#8217;s all this feat\n\t\tdoes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=1984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Poultice Preparation<\/span><\/a>\n\t\t4: This feat is why you become an Herbalist. Instead of creating Healing\n\t\tElixirs, the same properties are instead turned into poultices, bandages\n\t\tsoaked in topical medicine. This changes the action to use these items from\n\t\tdrinking to applying the bandages, allowing you (or someone else holding\n\t\tone) to apply the poultice to an adjacent target. If that were all it did,\n\t\tit would still be Blue, but upon application, the action also counts as\n\t\tassistance for making a check to remove persistent damage from Acid,\n\t\tBleeding, or Fire. This feat also applies to any Elixir with the \u201cHealing\u201d\n\t\ttrait you craft with standard crafting, not just the free stuff you make\n\t\twith your daily allotment of reagents.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=1985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Endemic Herbs<\/span><\/a>\n\t\t6: While the benefits are nice, it does unfortunately require spending an\n\t\textra batch of reagents to add the effect to one item, effectively giving\n\t\tyou half as many uses per day for a small extra bonus dictated by where you\n\t\thappen to be. It might have some uses, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend taking this\n\t\tunless you&#8217;re using Free Archetype and you want to take both of the level 6\n\t\tfeats here.<\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=1986\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expert Herbalist<\/span><\/a>\n\t\t6: Very simple, very useful.

Technically you can wait an extra three levels to automatically learn the\n\t\timproved Elixirs of Life, but I would recommend learning those formulas as\n\t\tyou reach their minimum levels in order to craft a proper supply with the\n\t\tnormal crafting rules.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"who-should-use-this\">Who Should Use This?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Anyone who wants a little additional healing ability and can afford to miss a\n\tfew levels of class feats to get this minor in Alchemy would do well to pick\n\tthis up.
