If you know where you want to go, it\u2019s much easier to plan a route to get there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t at least have a general plan, you may find that gaining a level means a scramble to decide which options your want to take, and you may eventually find that your character isn\u2019t as strong as you want them to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How far ahead to plan is up to you. Some people plan their characters all the way to 20th level, but that&#8217;s typically overkill. Most characters don\u2019t last that long, either because a campaign ends or because the character dies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend planning to the point that your character has all of the options which you consider essential to your build. If you\u2019re not sure, plan until level 5 and see how you feel about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optimize-to-the-party\">Optimize to The Party<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Dungeons and Dragons is a game about a party of adventurers with diverse backgrounds and capabilities coming together to overcome challenges. Sometimes there are dungeons. Sometimes there are dragons. But there is always the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an actual game, the most effective character is one that meets the needs of the party. This is a team game. Be a team player.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The classic dnd party is cleric, fighter, rogue,  wizard. There\u2019s some nuance beyond that, but if you\u2019re new to character optimization it\u2019s helpful to figure out which of those four roles you\u2019re going to fill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optimize-to-the-party\">Specialization vs. Generalization<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>No one character can be good at everything. DnD is a game that usually rewards specialization and punishes generalization. Every member of the party is expected to cover a handful of capabilities, and together the party can overcome the challenges you ca  expect in a game of DnD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few characters can successfully be generalists. Bards are perhaps the best generalist in the game, but they\u2019re rarely a perfect replacement for a party of diverse specialists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"play-something-you-like\">Play Something You Like<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>No matter how well you have built your character, if you build something that you don\u2019t enjoy playing you\u2019re not going have fun. Building an optimized character you don\u2019t intend to play is fun on its own, but if you\u2019re actually going to play the character, be sure that you\u2019re picking options that are actually fun for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"before-you-build\">Before You Build<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"establish-expectations\">Establish Expectations<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s generally considered to polite to talk to your group (or at least your DM) about the game before you build your character. Ask if there are any options you should avoid (races which don\u2019t exist in their setting, banned character options, etc.); if they\u2019re using any variants, house rules, or optional rules; and if they want you to build your character in any specific way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-much-will-you-optimize\">How much will you optimize?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I try to reiterate this point every time I discuss character optimization: not every character needs to be flawlessly optimized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important that your character is not optimized so well that you feel like a clear outlier in the party, but you also shouldn\u2019t optimize so poorly that your character is a liability for the party. Again: be a team player.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players who have a little experience with character optimization can usually do this \u201cby feel\u201d once you get an idea of what everyone else in the party wants to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If everyone in the party is optimizing, discuss it with the group and agree on roughly how powerful your party wants characters to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races-and-class\">Class, Subclass, Race, Subrace<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Your race and class are the two largest decision points in your build, which is why people typically state those things first when describing a character. Just as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is very different from a ham and cheese sandwich, a halfling rogue is very different from a dwarf fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as those two decision points are the most important descriptors of your character, they are also your most defining decisions mechanically. Picking a race\/class combination which works well together is crucial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>While you can make almost any race\/class combination work thanks to the Custom Origin rules and updated race mechanics, races other traits still make for better or worse combinations. Peanut butter and ham is a sandwhich, but not a very good one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick your race and class in either order. If you want to start with a race you like, start from one of our <a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/races\/\">race handbooks<\/a> and pick a class that works well for your race of choice. If you want to start from your class, start from one of our <a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/\">class handbooks<\/a> and check the races section for recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you cant decide which to pick first, flip a coin. Either option is great. I\u2019ve built legions of characters both ways and they all come out equally great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Every class has a subcategory which people refer to as a \u201dsubclass\u201d. This is your bardic college, your roguish archetype, your wizard school, etc. They have a different name on every class. Some subclasses will do a lot to define how your character plays, so picking a subclass when you create your character is a good idea even though many classes don&#8217;t get their subclass at level 1. Remember: plan ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subraces\">Subraces<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Some races have a \u201csubrace\u201d, which is a smler designation within that race. If your race offers subraces, you must pick one. You receive the traits of both the core race and the subrace. For example: high elf is a subrace of elf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Races with subraces are no better or worse than races without subraces, just different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve picked your race and class, your ability scores are the next logical step. Each class depends on one or more ability scores to function, and having high scores in those ability scores is crucial to your character&#8217;s success. Generally character optimizers use the &#8220;Point Buy&#8221; method when generating ability scores because there&#8217;s no randomness involved and you can tailor your ability scores to your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5th edition assumes that you will start with a 16 or better in your class&#8217;s most important ability score (<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">I did the math<\/a>), and it&#8217;s difficult to over-emphasize how important it is that you do that. Starting below 16 will put you behind the math for at least 6 levels, but more likely 8 levels. That&#8217;s a long time to suffer for a mistake that&#8217;s easy to avoid during character creation. If you&#8217;re not sure which ability score is most important for your class, check the Ability Scores section of our class handbook for your class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t get your most important ability score to at least 16, you may have chosen a poor race\/class combination. This is less of a problem if you&#8217;re using the custom origin rules (see Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything) or races published after the release of Tasha&#8217;s which no longer give you a fixed set of ability score increases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your class, don&#8217;t skimp on Constitution. Everyone needs hit points. I generally consider 14 Constitution adequate for anyone except front-line martial characters like barbarians and fighters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some classes like monks and paladins need high scores in multiple ability scores. It&#8217;s often difficult to start with 16 or better in more than one or two ability scores, so I recommend putting a 16 into whatever you&#8217;ll be using to attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Every character gets a background, and the background rules are intentionally very permissive. While you&#8217;re free to use a background as-written (and most people do, including character optimizers) you&#8217;re technically allowed to mix and match parts of backgrounds. Every background will give you two skill proficiencies and two proficiencies in tools or languages. Pick whichever options support your role in your party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has changed somewhat over 5e&#8217;s liftime. Starting with Dragonlance: Shadow the Dragon Queen, backgrounds have started granting a bonus feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"smaller-decision-points\">Smaller Decision Points<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Many classes will offer smaller decision points as you take levels in the class. This can include spells and features like the Warlock\u2019s Invocations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These smaller decision points are a great way to customize and optimize your character. Take a look at our <a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/\" data-type=\"page\">classes section<\/a> for breakdowns of spells, invocations, and other stuff for each class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advanced-topics\">Advanced Topics<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>It is perfectly fine to build a character without any of these options, but as you dig deeper into charter optimization these options will offer more options to improve your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Feats are technically an optional rule, but i\u2019ve never seen a group play without them. Feats offer additional options to customize and optimize your character beyond what your race and class offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While feats are powerful, they\u2019re not free. You take feats instead of an Ability Score Increase, and in most cases you\u2019ll do that before your most important ability score hits 20. This puts you 5% behind the game\u2019s math, so you need to be sure that your feat is good enough to offset that cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Another optional rule that basically everyone uses, multiclassing allows you to take levels in multiple classes. You need to meet some ability score requirements to multiclass into and out if an individual class, so it\u2019s essential to plan multiclassing right from level one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s rare for players to take an even number of levels in multiple classes. Instead, players typically take a \u201ddip\u201d into other classes, often taking only one or two levels before going back to their primary class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Magic items are technically an optional rule, but every official published campaign uses them and in my experience everyone likes them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you typically can\u2019t decide which magic items your character will find in play. Building a character who needs some specific item to function is risk unless you can start your campaign with that item. You may be able to ask your DM to give you the item as loot or to let you buy one, but be sure to discuss that with your DM when you establish expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"refining-decisions\">Refining Decisions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>At this point you have picked your race, your class, your ability scores, your background, and any minor decision points like spells or a fighting style, and you should have a general idea of how you will advance your character in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start playing, give your character one more look and be certain that you&#8217;re happy with all of your choices. Moving resources around to support decisions that you made later in the process can do a lot to improve your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character-advancement\">Character Advancement<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you planned ahead, you should generally know what you&#8217;re going to do whenever your character gains a level. But it&#8217;s also helpful to reevaluate your plan whenever you gain a level. Just because you wrote down &#8220;take 3 levels of wizard&#8221; when you built the character doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re locked into that plan days, weeks, or months later. Sometimes your needs and goals change. Sometimes you&#8217;ve learned more about the character and want to go a different direction. Sometimes you get a shiny new source book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process for advancing your character is much the same as building your character at first level, and all  of our various character optimization articles will be just as useful at level 20 as they are at level 1. Even better: now that you have a general plan in place, you&#8217;ll likely need less time to decide what you want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-it-bad\">Is Character Optimization Bad?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>No. Basic character optimization is not only normal, it&#8217;s actually expected by the game rules. 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons assumes that you&#8217;re going to start with at least 16 in your primary ability score. The game expects that your Constitution is going to be higher than 10. The game expects that you&#8217;re going to design your character to complement the rest of your party. These are all core parts of the game&#8217;s design, and choosing not to take those basic steps is either a deliberate choice to make the game harder for yourself or a lack of understanding of the game&#8217;s mechanics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who optimize characters go by many names: Min-maxers, munchkins, power gamers, try-hards, etc. These titles are occasionally meant in a derogatory fashion, but those prejudices illustrate a philosophical difference between members of the community. Even people who turn up their nose at character optimization still do it, whether they acknowledge it or not. Even the least mechanically-inclined players won&#8217;t walk into a game with a wizard with 8 intelligence except as a joke to be shared among friends.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You now know everything that you need to know to optimize a character.
