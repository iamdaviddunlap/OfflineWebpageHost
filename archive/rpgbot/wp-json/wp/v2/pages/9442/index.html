Their primary function is\n\tto serve as the Caretaker for a Monstrous Companion, and their class features\n\trevolve around that central capability. Dexterity\/Wisdom builds will be\n\tcommon, and like the Ranger, Strength\/Wisdom builds are possible but difficult\n\twith little or no payoff for the additional difficulty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Comparisons to the Beast Master Ranger and the Drakewarden Ranger are\n\tnatural. But where the Ranger is a ranger with a pet, the Beastheart is built\n\taround their Monstrous Companion, and without a companion they largely cease\n\tto function until they can find a minute to meditate and return their\n\tcompanion to life. You&#8217;re still capable of making an attack which does\n\tpassable damage, but your companion provides the Ferocity needed to fuel\n\teverything interesting that the Beastheart does in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>All that said, when your companion works, it can <em>really<\/em> work. Between Primal Exploits and the class&#8217;s other features, you and your companion can be very effective both offensively and defensively, allowing you to serve as both a Defender and a Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of combat you&#8217;re reliant exclusively on skills, but your effective rolls extend little beyond Scout. You can supplement these capabilities with your companion&#8217;s skill proficiencies, but most companions won&#8217;t have useful skills until your get Beyond Instinct at level 5, and even then their effectiveness won&#8217;t match a player. Altogether the Beastheart fills a role in the party similar to a fighter or a ranger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Beastheart is built around Monstrous Companions, I strongly\n\trecommend reading my\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/mcdm-monstrous-companions\/\">Practical Guide to Monstrous Companions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Beastheart Class Features<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#subclasses\">Beastheart Subclasses &#8211; Companion Bond<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Beastheart Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores-dexterity-based\">Dexterity-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores-strength-based\">Strength-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Beastheart Races<\/a>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#races-ravnica\">Races of Ravnica<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races-wildemount\">Races of Wildemount<\/a>\n\n\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Lineages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Beastheart Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Beastheart Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Beastheart Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Beastheart Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Beastheart Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Beastheart Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Beastheart Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-rare\">Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-very-rare\">Very Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-legendary\">Legendary Magic Items<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

I strongly recommend also reading my\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/mcdm-monstrous-companions\/\">Practical Guide to Monstrous Companions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Natural Language<\/span>: Tgis isn&#8217;t quite Speak\n\tWith Animals. In some ways it&#8217;s worse, but in some ways it&#8217;s better. Speak\n\tWith Animals allows you to communicate more complex ideas, which is helpful if\n\tyou need more specific information. But Natural Language also works on\n\tMonstrosities, and doesn&#8217;t require your 8-Charisma druid or ranger to make\n\tCharisma checks, instead allowing you to use Wisdom (Animal Handling) which\n\tthe Beastheart should already be good at.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Primal Exploits<\/strong>: You start with three and get two more at\n\teach of levels 10 and 17 for a total of 7. See Primal Exploits, below, for\n\thelp picking.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Superior Ferocity<\/span>: Monstrous Companions use\n\ta DC of 10+PB for their features. You DC is 10+Wis+PB, so for this to have any\n\timpact your Wisdom needs to be 16 or better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Companion Bond<\/strong>: Companion Bond is the Beastheart&#8217;s subclass.\n\tFor help, see Subclasses &#8211; Companion Bond, below.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Caregiver<\/span>: Excellent. This saves us\n\tthe trouble of taking Skill Expert or a rogue dip. Animal Handling becomes\n\tcrucial as you get better at generating more Ferocity and want to avoid\n\trampages, and Master Caregiver arrives early in your career before you have\n\ttime to wish that you got it sooner.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beyond Instinct<\/span>: The additional Ferocity\n\tgeneration is minor, but still very helpful to power both your companion&#8217;s\n\tfeatures and your Primal Exploits. An additional saving throw is a massive\n\tdefensive benefit. I recommend Constitutution, Wisdom, Dexterity, Charisma,\n\tStrength, and Intelligence in that order of priority. They&#8217;ll get more at\n\thigher levels. They also gain a skill from a short list. I recommend\n\tPerception or Stealth in most cases, but Investigation can also be useful,\n\tespecially since Beyond Instinct allows them to use Wisdom in place of your\n\tcompanion&#8217;s 5-ish Intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Signature Attack (1 die)<\/span>:\n\tMonstrous Companions&#8217; attacks don&#8217;t improve by any other method, so this is a\n\tcrucial damage increase as you gain levels. This level also makes your\n\tcompanion&#8217;s attacks magical, which is important for overcoming increasingly\n\tcommon resistance to non-magic weapon damage types.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Faithful Companion<\/span>: Rampages, while\n\tannoying, should be a rarity thanks to your presumably high Animal Handling\n\tbonus. At higher levels they may become a problem once Beyond Instinct causes\n\tFerocity to accumulate faster, and you&#8217;ll eventually want to build up Ferocity\n\tfor high-level Primal Exploits. The removal of the Bonus Action cost to\n\tcommand your companion isn&#8217;t especially helpful right away (though see\n\tRejuvenating Ferocity, below), but in a few levels Mystic Connection gives you\n\ta powerful Bonus Action option, so you will have a few occasional uses without\n\tneed to stress over what&#8217;s going to eat your Bonus Action on any given\n\tturn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Rejuvenating Ferocity<\/span>: The amount healed\n\talmost certainly isn&#8217;t large, and since you can only use this a few times per\n\tlong rest, you&#8217;re likely only going to use this when your companion is at 0\n\thit points. As long as they dropped to 0 with at least 1 point of Ferocity,\n\tyou can pop them back up and get right back to fighting, just like you would\n\theal a party member with Healing Word. 5e is weird that way. You&#8217;re not going\n\tto use this to heal your companion back to full hp, and you&#8217;re not intended to\n\tdo so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Strike (1d8)<\/span>: Pick Thunder damage.\n\tThis gives you a reason to attack beyond triggering your Primal Exploits. It\n\tfollows the same damage scale as the Cleric&#8217;s Divine Strike subclass feature,\n\tbut since the Beastheart needs to take the Attack action to trigger some\n\tPrimal Exploits, you may not be able to complement this damage with Booming\n\tBlade.\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mystic Connection<\/strong>: Mystic Connection offers an additional\n\tbenefit tied to your type of companion. These are typically either a passive\n\tability like as a move speed or an ability activated as a Bonus Action.\n\tIndividual types of Mystic Connection are assessed in my\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/mcdm-monstrous-companions\/\">Practical Guide to Monstrous Companions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beyond Instinct Improvement<\/span>: 2 more Ferocity\n\tgeneration for a total of 1d4+3+X, and another saving throw proficiency. At\n\tthis level you have a total of 5 exploits and your companion has had all of\n\ttheir feature for a long time, so there&#8217;s a lot that you can spend Ferocity\n\ton.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Signature Attack (2 dice)<\/span>: More\n\tdamage. You should be at 3d6 at this level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Loyal to the End<\/span>: Charm and fear effects\n\tare common, so immunity to both provides broad protection against problematic\n\tstatus conditions imposed by many enemies like dragons and vampires.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Keen Senses<\/span>: Perception is the most-rolled\n\tskill in the game, and this is essentially permanent Advantage on every\n\tPerception check that you care about (though it doesn&#8217;t apply to taste or\n\ttouch). This also raises your Passive Perception by 5 (as normal for\n\tAdvantage), making it very hard for other creatures to evade your notice. The\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/combat#Search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search<\/a>\n\taction is frequently overlooked by players, but it&#8217;s essential for finding\n\tenemies who are hiding, invisible, or otherwise undetected. It can often feel\n\tlike a problematically high cost to spend your Action to Search, so doing it\n\tas a Bonus Action with your absurdly effective Perception means that hidden\n\tenemies are basically no longer a problem. Of course, you need to roll a 16 or\n\tbetter to beat your Passive Perception, so if you have a better use for your\n\tBonus Action, do that instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Strike (2d8)<\/span>: Your attacks still\n\taren&#8217;t amazing, but they&#8217;re enough to make a difference even though you\n\tprobably only make one attack each turn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beyond Instinct Improvement<\/span>: 1d4+5+X\n\tFerocity per turn and another save. That&#8217;s enough Ferocity that on average\n\twhen facing one enemy, your companion generates 8.5 Ferocity, enough to use\n\ttheir most powerful feature every turn. That&#8217;s not always the right option,\n\tbut the fact that it is an option is exciting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Signature Attack (3 dice)<\/span>: 4d6\n\tdamage is respectable. It won&#8217;t match a fighter or another player character,\n\tbut you&#8217;re also not relying exclusively on your companion&#8217;s Signature\n\tAttack.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon the Wilds<\/span>: A big area of effect, a\n\tgreat duration, the effects are devastating, and you can move it 30 feet to\n\tkeep pace with most creatures&#8217; move speeds. You can even move it upward to hit\n\tflying creatures. If you have a save-or-suck caster in the party if your\n\tcompanion has a save-or-suck effect like the Basilisk companion&#8217;s Lesser\n\tPetrifying Gaze, this makes those options horrifyingly effective, not to\n\tmention making enemies dramatically less threatening. This could easily be the\n\twin condition in every encounter in which you use it. If this was once per\n\tlong rest I would still rate it <span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unbreakable Friendship<\/span>: No more rampages.\n\tYour companion&#8217;s hit points essentially stop mattering unless something hits\n\tit for half of its hit point maximum in one hit (at this level that should be\n\tsomewhere around 65 damage at minimum), so it functionally has unlimited hit\n\tpoints but could go down to a big critical hit or a spell. You also finally\n\tstart combat with enough Ferocity to do something exciting on turn 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Beastheart Subclasses &#8211; Companion Bond<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"subclasses-ferocious-bond\">Ferocious Bond<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Have you considered just letting your companion Rampage all the time instead\n\tof actually commanding them? Because that&#8217;s what Ferocious Bond is all about.\n\tLet your companion rampage and chase them around hitting stuff. Unfortunately,\n\trampage eats most or all of your companion&#8217;s Ferocity, which largely prevents\n\tusing Ferocity Actions or Primal Exploits, thereby negating many of your build\n\tchoices. The subclass expects that you&#8217;re going to lean into rampage on most\n\tor all of your turns and encourages you to do so, but the tactical cost is\n\thigh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Ferocious Bond is fine at throwing yourself your companion into melee\n\tto go poke things with sticks, the fact that the subclass struggles to work\n\talongside Primal Exploits makes it extremely difficult to play to any great\n\teffectiveness if you want to do anything except poke things with sticks. It is\n\tabsolutely simplest beastheart subclass, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s especially\n\teffective due to the fundamental disconnect between how the subclass works and\n\thow you use Ferocity Actions and Primal Exploits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the one character on which I would consider Armor of the Caregiver a\n\tgood choice. Occasionally your positioning won&#8217;t work out how you&#8217;d like and\n\tyour rampaging companion will take a swing at you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frenzied Charge<\/span>: This is dangerous, but\n\tit&#8217;s the central idea around which the subclass is build. You need to be\n\tcertain to keep your companion far away from yourself and your allies in\n\tcombat for risk of your companion attacking you. The extra attack is nice,\n\teffectively doubling your damage output at low levels. The added damage output\n\tis minor as you gain levels since Primal Strikes only works once on each of\n\tyour turns, but being able to attack as a Reaction (especially once you get\n\tAdvantage from Furious Rampage) leaves your Action for other things like\n\tactivating exploits, using items, or potentially casting spells if you\n\tmulticlass.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fury of the Wise<\/span>: This makes Intimidation a\n\tworthwhile Face skill for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Energizing Rampage<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to let\n\tyour companion Rampage, this is nice because they&#8217;ll still have some Ferocity\n\tleft for Primal Exploits. Or if you&#8217;re just letting Rampage do the work,\n\tthey&#8217;ll get back to their next Rampage much sooner. If you do plan to use\n\texploits, try to keep the cost down to 4 Ferocity, as you&#8217;ll find it nearly\n\timpossible to use more expensive exploits without turning off your entire\n\tsubclass for a round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Furious Rampage<\/span>: By this level, Beyond\n\tInstinct adds 3 Ferocity when your companion gains Ferocity at the beginning\n\tof their turn. Since you start from a floor of 4 whenever your companion\n\trampages, you have a 50% chance of hitting the 10 Ferocity needed to trigger a\n\trampage before you consider any creatures which might be adjavent to your\n\tcompanion. This means that your companion can rampage frequently (or\n\tconstantly once Beyond Instinct improves again at level 15), triggering\n\tFrenzied Charge often. Be sure to stay close to your companion (ideally with\n\tan enemy between the two of you) so that you both get easy Advantage on your\n\tattacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invigorated Rampage<\/span>: Make them blinded first\n\tor frightened if they&#8217;re already blinded. By now you should have consistent\n\tAdvantage on your companion&#8217;s rampage attack and your Frenzied Charge attack,\n\tso you and your companion should be able to hit reliably.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"subclasses-hunter-bond\">Hunter Bond<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A natural Scout and Striker, the Hunter Bond feels conceptually similar to the Ranger. It&#8217;s good at stealth and damage output, but doesn&#8217;t add a lot of complexity beyond the base class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chosen Quarry<\/span>: Similar in concept to the\n\tdamage boosts from Hex or Hunter&#8217;s Mark. Because this is used without an\n\taction when your companion gains Ferocity, it&#8217;s entirely possible to use this\n\tat the beginning of your first turn in combat, especially once Beyond Instinct\n\tadds additional Ferocity each turn.<\/p>\n<p>The damage applies when you or your\n\tcompanion hit the target, which encourages you and your companion to focus\n\tyour attacks and make numerous attacks just as you would with Hex or Hunter&#8217;s\n\tMark. You can&#8217;t use this with Eldritch Blast since it requires weapon attacks\n\tand your Bonus Action is monopolized by commanding your companion for a while,\n\tso you likely won&#8217;t get more than 2d6 damage out of this per turn. Still,\n\tthat&#8217;s a decent damage boost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunter&#8217;s Instincts<\/span>: Survival is only\n\tsituationally useful, but making it work in place of Insight and giving you\n\tExpertise in it certainly makes it more effective.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Primal Warding<\/span>: The effect is good, but\n\tthis is difficult to use in combat, and outside of combat it&#8217;s often easy to\n\tcircumvent. The trap explicitly requires that creatures &#8220;walk&#8221; into it, but I\n\tassume that&#8217;s to exclude other movement types, not to allow slithering,\n\tcrawling, dancing, etc.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Synchronized Stealth<\/span>: If you take the Quick\n\tHide Primal Exploit, you can take the Attack action, allow your companion to\n\tHide as a Reaction, triggering Synchronized Stealth to allow you to then Hide\n\tas a Reaction. Hiding in combat is a good way to get Advantage on your attack\n\tand to avoid drawing fire, but it typically requires hit-and-run tactics or\n\tranged combat, both of which are difficult for most companions.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unseen Hunters<\/span>: Note that this is not\n\tinvisibility as the spell. It&#8217;s just the inivisibility condition, so you have\n\tnone of the restrictions of the spell Invisibility. You&#8217;re free to attack or\n\twhatever else for the effect&#8217;s duration.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"subclasses-infernal-bond\">Infernal Bond<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Similar in theme to the Warlock, Infernal Bond uses the power of devils to empower your and your companion. Infernal Bond offers more decision points than any other variety of beastheart, allowing you more options to customize and optimize your build. Among its options are the ability to give any companion flight and the ability to teleport, offering powerful mobility options for a class that&#8217;s often limited to walking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Devil&#8217;s Understanding<\/span>: These aren&#8217;t great\n\tskills for the Beastheart, but they fit the theme of the subclass nicely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Infernal Exploits<\/strong>: A surprisingly large list of additional\n\texploit options. Note that you can only take <em>one<\/em> Infernal Exploit at\n\t3rd level and one more at level 11. These exploits aren&#8217;t available as an\n\toptions when the core class features grant you Primal Exploits. See below for\n\tmore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hell&#8217;s Charmer<\/span>: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fiendish Traits<\/strong>: A great way to customize your companion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Barbed Hide<\/span>: Nice, but the damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tsignificant enough to deter most CR-appropriate enemies. This will keep mobs\n\t\tof low-CR enemies from swarming your companion, but that&#8217;s not a frequent\n\t\toccurance, and you can use those situations to accumulate Ferocity quickly\n\t\tand retaliate with expensive Ferocity Actions or Primal Exploirts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiendish Immunities<\/span>: Immunity to two of\n\t\tthe most common damage types in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fiery Weapons<\/span>: 1d6 damage isn&#8217;t a huge\n\t\tdamage boost since your companion typically makes just one attack per round,\n\t\tand fire resistance\/immunity is common.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings<\/span>: Flight is a crucial tactical option\n\t\tthat most compenions simply can&#8217;t produce, and without the ability to fight\n\t\tat range, most companions need this to be functional against flying\n\t\tenemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Infernal Exploits improvement<\/strong>: One more exploit from either\n\tthe 3rd or 11th-level list.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiendish Form<\/span>: This should be your Bonus\n\tAction on your first turn of nearly every encounter. The benefits are\n\texcellent, and by this level Beyond Instinct allows you to generate 1d4+5+X\n\tFerocity, so even if you roll a 1 you have enough.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infernal-exploits\">Infernal Exploits<\/h5>\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infernal-exploits-3\">3rd Level<\/h6>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Drain Them<\/span>: Expensive, and you may\n\tfrequently find that your companion loses roughly the same amount of hit\n\tpoints over the course of the next round. If you just need to keep your\n\tcompanion going for another round or two, this can buy you time for the rest\n\tof your party to come to the rescue, but using the same Ferocity to\n\tincapacitate your target in some way (such as by using your companion&#8217;s\n\t5th-level Ferocity Action) will often be a better option because it will both\n\tprevent damage to your companion and harm your opponent. That said, this works\n\ton critical hits, and healing a bunch of damage on a crit feels nice.\n\tUnfortunately, with only one attack per turn, crits will be rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hellish Wound<\/span>: Ongoing damage is great for\n\tenemies with a big pile of hit points, such as legendary creatures, but the\n\tdamage doesn&#8217;t scale in any way and 1d10 damage per round will quickly stop\n\tbeing impactful. Most combats last 3-5 rounds, so you really don&#8217;t have time\n\tto stack a bunch of these onto one target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infernal Teleport<\/span>: Teleportation breaks\n\tgrapples, removes you from dangerous locations, and potentially gets you into\n\tmelee with frail enemies who are hiding behind more sturdy creatures. The\n\trange is decent, and weirdly this doesn&#8217;t require line of sight. Unfortunately\n\tyou can&#8217;t use it outside of combat since Ferocity only exists in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wicked Deception<\/span>: Only situationally\n\tuseful, and immunity to the Charmed condition is common.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"infernal-exploits-11\">11th Level<\/h6>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Brimstone Teleport<\/span>: If you can hit two or\n\tmore enemies with this, you will consistently do more damage than you could\n\twith weapon attacks. Keep in mind that the range is considerably smaller than\n\tInfernal Teleport and doesn&#8217;t allow your companion to teleport. I wouldn&#8217;t\n\ttake both teleportation options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chains from Hell<\/span>: Restrained is a great\n\tstatus condition. Even without the damage, this would be very good. If you can\n\tgenerate enough Ferocity, you can repeatedly restrain targets, severely\n\tlimiting their ability to fight back.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dark of Hell<\/span>: Most creatures can&#8217;t see in\n\tmagical darkness, so this puts you and your companion at an advantage both\n\toffensively and defensively.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Infernal Flames<\/span>: Decent damage in a\n\treasonably large AOE. If you can hit two or three enemies with this, it will\n\teasily do more damage than a Signature Attack. Of course, the cost is high, so\n\tyou really want to hit 3 or more enemies to justify the cost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Rain<\/span>: Poisoned is a great status\n\tcondition, but Constitution saves tend to be high, and resistance\/immunity to\n\tpoison are common, so this will be unreliable<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"subclasses-primordial-bond\">Primordial Bond<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Similar in them to the druid, Primordial Bond gives you exploits which feel very similar to druid spells, plus some nature-themed options which make your companion more dangerous. The addition of blasting options can help handle crowds, which is normally a challenge for the Beastheart, but few of the Nature Exploit options are truly worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nature Exploits<\/strong>: You get one at 3rd level and another at\n\t11th level. You can retrain a Nature Exploit every level (Fiendish Bond can&#8217;t\n\tdo this), allowing you to retrain your 3rd-level exploit for a new 11th-level\n\texploit when you reach 11th level if you&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Primal Understanding<\/span>: Nature isn&#8217;t a great\n\tskill for the Beastheart since it&#8217;s Intelligence-based, but it fits the\n\ttheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Allied Earth<\/span>: This is a great way to make\n\tyour companion &#8220;sticky&#8221; so that it&#8217;s difficult for enemies to get away from\n\tthem. Any move speed except land speed doesn&#8217;t care about this, unfortunately,\n\tbut most fights still take place on the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nature Exploits improvement<\/strong>: A second exploit. Consider\n\tretraining your first Nature Exploit if you want another 11th-level\n\texploit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Stampede<\/span>: Potentially very damaging\n\tif there are numerous enemies in the are and you can accumulate a bunch of\n\tFerocity to raise the damage dealt. There&#8217;s no save and force damage\n\tresistance is basically non-existent, so while the damage is small it&#8217;s very\n\tconsistent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Allied Weather<\/span>: A great retaliation option.\n\tKnocking foes prone won&#8217;t always keep them prone since standing up only costs\n\thalf of their movement, and the damage won&#8217;t be spectacular, but knocking foes\n\tprone might significantly impede Multiattack or it might knock flying\n\tcreatures to the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nature-exploits\">Nature Exploits<\/h5>\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nature-exploits-3\">3rd Level<\/h6>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Shield<\/span>: Absorb Elements, but you\n\tcan share it. This is amazing at any level and will prevent a massive quantity\n\tof damage over the course of your career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Freezing Strike<\/span>: Inexpensive, a good damage\n\tboost that scales with level, and a minor debuff to the target. This is a\n\tgreat go-to option if you don&#8217;t have anything better to do with your Ferocity\n\tand your Action, but if it&#8217;s your best option every turn then your build is\n\tprobably struggling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sickening Strike<\/span>: Poisoned is a great\n\tdebuff, but Constitution saves tend to be high and poison resistance\/immunity\n\tis common.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wings When I Need Them<\/span>: Easy temporary\n\tflight. Since this is activated at the beginning of your and your companion&#8217;s\n\tturn and ends at the beginning of the target&#8217;s next turn, you can repeatedly\n\treactivate this to maintain flight so long as you have the 5 Ferocity to do\n\tso. That&#8217;s hard at low levels, but once Beyond Instinct adds a flat bonus to\n\tthe Ferocity generated each turn this will become increasingly useful. You\n\tmight forgo this option at low levels, then pick it up Beyond Instinct at\n\tlevel 5 or when it improves at level 10.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nature-exploits-11\">11th Level<\/h6>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lava Geyser<\/span>: More damage than you&#8217;ll do\n\twith an attack if you hit two targets, and knocking targets prone can be\n\thelpful if your allies can act before the target(s) stand up again.\n\tUnfortunately, the AOE is tiny.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Eruption<\/span>: Not a ton of damage,\n\tbut you can activate this after you hit successfully, and since the damage is\n\t&#8220;extra damage&#8221; it&#8217;s multiplied on a critical hit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plant Prison<\/span>: A great way to lock down\n\tsingle enemies, and at this cost you can use this every turn to keep the\n\ttarget restrained as long as they continue to fail saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Stinging Swarm<\/span>: Lines are a hard AOE to use,\n\tthe line is short, and Constitution saves tend to be high.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thunderous Rebuke<\/span>: Expensive, and\n\tConstitution saves tend to be high. It feels really good to combine this with\n\tAllied Weather, but it&#8217;s just not very effective.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"subclasses-protector-bond\">Protector Bond<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Protector Bond attempts to turn the Beastheart and their companion into a bodyguard build. But, due to the positioning requirements for the features, you typically need to be in melee with the same creatures that your melee allies are in order for the subclass features to function. Even then, enemies can simply choose to attack you and your companion, and most of your subclass features cease to function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Beast Vitality<\/span>: More hp never hurts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pack Phalanx<\/span>: Similar in concept to\n\tFighting Style (Protection), but it requires you to be adjacent to the\n\tattacker rather than the target. The position will be difficult unless you&#8217;re\n\triding your companion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Thickened Hide<\/span>: Monstrous Companions don&#8217;t\n\tget fantastic AC until your Proficiency Bonus scales a bit. It&#8217;s not clear if\n\tthis would apply when your companion is wearing armor, but I assume that it\n\tdoes not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Sentinel Companion<\/span>: At this point you want to\n\t<em>encourage<\/em> enemies to attack your allies, which can be difficult to do\n\tmore than once since you&#8217;re actively punishing them for doing so. Coupled with\n\tthe positioning requirements of Pack Phalanx, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to make\n\tthis impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Undying Protector<\/span>: This makes it\n\texceptionally difficult to reduce you to 0 hp. Being at 1 is still scary, but\n\tbetween this and prominent options like Healing Word, death is much less\n\tthreatening.<\/p>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"primal-exploits\">Primal Exploits<\/h5>\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"primal-exploits-1\">Primal Exploits: 1st Level<\/h6>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Aid Us, Friend<\/span>: Most companions don&#8217;t have\n\ta way to use their Bonus Action consistently, and the Help action can have a\n\tmajor impact if you use it before an ally makes a single high-damage attack\n\tlike a Sneak Attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bring Them Down<\/span>: Considering how easy it\n\tis to get back up once prone (unless the target is also grappled), the cost\n\there is very high. This isn&#8217;t a go-to option, but if your companion has a\n\tbuilt-in grapple option, you can combine this with that option to perform the\n\tGrapple+Shove combo in one attack. Of course, the handful of official\n\tcompanions with a grapple option that&#8217;s applied via a Signature Attack also\n\tmake the target Restrained, which is better than making them prone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Drag Them<\/span>: Only situationally useful, but\n\ta good way to break grapples if your companion doesn&#8217;t already have a way to\n\treposition enemies like the Bulette&#8217;s Violent Attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feral Reflexes<\/span>: This can negate attacks\n\troughly 10% of the time, and 2 Ferocity cost is small enough that you\n\tgenerally shouldn&#8217;t think twice about spending it. You use this after the\n\tattack is a hit, so you generally know whether +2 AC will turn a hit into a\n\tmiss, similar to the spell Shield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hurricane Blow<\/span>: Only situationally useful,\n\tbut if your companion doesn&#8217;t have a way to reposition enemies to break\n\tgrapples, this is a good option to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">No Escape<\/span>: Only situationally useful. Most\n\tcompanions have 30-foot speed or better, and situations where they need more\n\taren&#8217;t common enough to consume one of your very few Primal Exploit slots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Pounce<\/span>: For companions that don&#8217;t\n\thave a built-in attack that grapples (which is most of them), this is very\n\tuseful. It doesn&#8217;t care about size, it doesn&#8217;t care about their Athletics or\n\ttheir Acrobatics checks, and as such it&#8217;s easy to use on creatures which might\n\tbe difficult to grapple. The targets do get a Dexterity save, so companions\n\twith built-in grapple options can still do this better, but for other\n\tcompanions this is a huge tactical advantage. This is especially useful for\n\tflying companions, who can grapple enemies to reduce their speed to 0, causing\n\tthem to fall to the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Hide<\/span>: Your companion needs to be in\n\ta position to hide before you attack, so expect to go back and forth between\n\tyourself and your companion within your turn so that you can position them for\n\tthis. If your attack hits and their Stealth check works, your companion may\n\tget Advantage on their next attack. Just keep in mind that most companions\n\taren&#8217;t proficient in Stealth (though see Beyond Instinct) and many don&#8217;t have\n\tgood Dexterity. If you want to use this, make sure that Stealth is a good fit\n\tfor your companion, and even then you have two points of failure so you need\n\tto be very sure that this will work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thrash<\/span>: Many of the big melee brutes that\n\tyour companion will spend a lot of time fighting will have poor Wisdom saves,\n\tand using this on those foes makes them dramatically less dangerous. I would\n\tskip this on the Giant Spider because their Distracting Attack and Web\n\tfeatures provide similar benefits, but for any other companion this is\n\texcellent.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"primal-exploits-10\">Primal Exploits: 10th Level<\/h6>\n\n\n<p>Exploits at this level cost a lot of Ferocity, but remember that Beyond\n\tInstinct also improves at 10th level, so your companion now gains 1d4+3+X\n\tFerocity per turn, averaging to 5.5 plus the number of adjacent enemies. You\n\tlikely can&#8217;t use these exploits every turn, but you can use them frequently,\n\tespecially if there are numerous enemies in an encounter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Crushing Charge<\/span>: Decent damage, and if you\n\tyou can extend the length of the line by changing your speed. A Strength\n\tsaving throw may be easier than making an Athletics check to shove, so even if\n\tyou only need one creature prone this may be a good way to make that happen.\n\tThe damage isn&#8217;t fantastic unless you can hit multiple foes, but it&#8217;s good\n\tenough that you won&#8217;t feel bad about not attacking.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Expanding Fury<\/span>: A huge improvement to the\n\tMimic&#8217;s Adhesive Pseudopods and the Sporeling&#8217;s Spore Burst, but most\n\tcompanions won&#8217;t benefit and the Ferocity cost is huge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Furious Vengeance<\/span>: Not all companions have\n\tan option that works with this, but the Earth Elemental and the Mimic both do,\n\tand expanding the radius on those Ferocity Actions makes them much safer to\n\tuse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Marked Prey<\/span>: Many companions require a\n\tsaving throw on their 5th-level Ferocity Action, and the effects are usually\n\texcellent. The added insurance of imposing Disadvantage on that save makes\n\tthose actions much more effective. Keep in mind that this only applies\n\t<em>when the Ferocity Action is used<\/em>, so any additional saves, such as\n\tthose against the Basilisk&#8217;s Lesser Petrifying Gaze, are not affected by\n\tMarked Prey.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Shout<\/span>: Resistance and immunity to\n\tfear are common, and the range is short, but the Frightened condition is very\n\tpowerful when it works. This doesn&#8217;t grant the targets immunity at any point\n\tlike similar features often do, so if you can keep enough Ferocity to fuel\n\tthis you can spend a whole fight running and screaming to keep enemies\n\tFrightened.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wrath of the Pack<\/span>: Knocking targets prone\n\tcan be very effective, but you need to use this after you hit with an attack,\n\tthen if your companion misses their attack it has no effect, so there are\n\tmultiple points of failure. Still, you only use this after you hit and it\n\tcosts half as much as Crushing Charge. If your companion has grappled the\n\ttarget already or could grapple them with another attack, this could be a good\n\tcombination, not to mention the additional damage output from giving your\n\tcompanion another attack.<\/p>\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"primal-exploits-17\">Primal Exploits: 17th Level<\/h6>\n\n\n<p>Exploits at this level require Ferocity above the 10 Ferocity threshold at\n\twhich you risk your companion going on a rampage until you get Unbreakable\n\tFriendship at level 20. Fortunately, you have Expertise in Animal Handling and\n\tyour Wisdom should be at least decent, so you should reasonably have a skill\n\tbonus of +15 or better by now. On a natural 1, your companion could then have\n\t11 Ferocity and you&#8217;re guaranteed to prevent a rampage, but anything higher\n\tthan that will be risky and your skill bonus won&#8217;t improve any further without\n\tmagic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Sport<\/span>: Activate this after you hit,\n\tand you and your companion can both get an extra attack, as much as doubling\n\tyour normal damage output for that turn. Unfortunately Primal Attack&#8217;s damage\n\tboost only works once per turn, but you do get 4d6 bonus damage on your second\n\tattack to replace it. If possible, find a way to get Advantage on these\n\tattacks, such as by knocking the creature prone on a previous turn or by using\n\tyour companion&#8217;s actions before you use Blood Sport.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Break the Earth<\/span>: Drop a few creatures into a\n\t50-foot deep pit. The damage won&#8217;t be amazing, but it buys you a lot of time\n\twhile they climb out of the pit. If you and your party can stand around the\n\tedges, you can shove enemies back into the pit repeatedly, trivializing the\n\tencounter unless your enemies can fly (in which case, don&#8217;t drop them into a\n\tpit) or teleport (in which case you spent Ferocity to make them spend spell\n\tslots).<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bury the Dead<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t great at\n\tthis level, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be. Prone and Restrained will massively\n\thamper most creatures, and the target need to make a skill check against your\n\tsave DC. Most creatures aren&#8217;t proficienct in Athletics even if they&#8217;re very\n\tstrong, so the math is hugely in your favor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Imbue Projectile<\/span>: Decent damage is a good\n\tAOE and a good damage type, but it&#8217;s only marginally more damaging than\n\tFireball, which isn&#8217;t going to win many fights at this level, and the 14\n\tFerocity cost is extremely steep.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rend<\/span>: Two points of failure make this\n\tunreliable, which is hard to justify at such a high cost. The effects are\n\tgreat if it works, but the best way to make this work is to knock the target\n\tprone beforehand, which reduces the benefits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Form<\/span>: Expensive and the duration is\n\tvery short, but the tactical applications are very still very interesting.\n\tYou&#8217;re most likely going to use this to reposition yourself to somewhere\n\thelpful or to reach enemies who might be flying or behind cover, but you&#8217;ll\n\tneed to use your and your companion&#8217;s Action to actually do something about\n\tthem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Beastheart Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Beastheart&#8217;s ability score needs closely resemble the Druid&#8217;s. The Quick Build entry for the class recommends making either Strength or Dexterity your primary ability score, but that seems misguided. Your Wisdom score determines your most important skills (Animal Handling and Perception), your Primal Exploit DC, and your Monstrous Companion&#8217;s DC&#8217;s for their abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dexterity only matters for your AC and your one attack per turn, and while that single attack will be your Action on most turns, Wisdom will have better tactical benefits then just a little extra damage from higher Strength or Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can find a way to get Shillelagh (Magic Initiate, Druid, Ranger), you\n\tcan build around Constitution and Wisdom exclusively, simplifying your ability\n\tscore needs considerably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores-dexterity-based\">Dexterity-Based<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: If you build around Strength, you&#8217;re\n\tgoing to be MAD due to needing 14 Dexterity for medium armor.

Two-handed\n\tweapons are a bad idea, too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: 14 at minimum to fill out half plate,\n\tbut probably more so that you can be good at Stealth and use both finesse and\n\tranged weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points.

It&#8217;s not a bad idea, you just\n\t\twon&#8217;t be able to use it every single turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mounted Combatant<\/span><sup>PHB<\/sup>: An excellent choice\nif you plan to ride your companion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Beastheart Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your weapon is entirely secondary to your companion&#8217;s capabilities and your\n\tPrimal Exploits.

The Beastheart doesn&#8217;t get Extra Attack, so the Loading\n\t\tproperty isn&#8217;t a problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dagger<\/span>: If you&#8217;re built for Dexterity but\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going into melee, but want to be able to switch to ranged combat\n\t\teasily, daggers are a decent choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dart<\/span>: If you&#8217;re built for Dexterity but\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going into melee, darts are a good ranged option because you can use\n\t\tthem while also using a shield. Daggers also work, especially since they can\n\t\talso be used in melee.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Greataxe<\/span>: With d8 hit points you really\n\t\twant a shield. Plus, most of your damage will come from your companion and\n\t\tPrimal Strike, so the difference in damage between a greataxe and a\n\t\tone-handed weapon isn&#8217;t significant enough to give up the AC of a\n\t\tshield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Javelin<\/span>: The best ranged option for\n\t\tStrength-based builds. Bring several.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longbow<\/span>: The best ranged option for medium\n\t\tplayers, but the only major improvement is in your range since the\n\t\tBeastheart doesn&#8217;t get Extra Attack.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Net<\/span>: Profoundly difficult to use to good\n\t\teffect. If you want to restrain enemies, take a Monstrous Companion that can\n\t\tdo it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scimitar<\/span>: Your most likely melee option.\n\t\tBasically identical to the Shortsword except for damage type.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shortswords<\/span>: Your most likely melee\n\t\toption.

If you&#8217;re building\n\taround Strength, wear medium armor or multiclass so that you can get heavy\n\tarmor. In either case, you want to wear a shield if you&#8217;re in melee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Beastheart Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because the Beastheart isn&#8217;t an official class, as a DM I don&#8217;t recommend\n\tallowing multiclassing. Multiclassing is already a way to introduce some of\n\tthe game&#8217;s largest problems, and third-party publishers frequently don&#8217;t have\n\tthe time or resources to research all of the possible problems that can be\n\tintroduced by multiclassing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do like that MCDM was smart enough to strictly limit what players get for\n\tmulticlassing into the Beastheart. One level of Beastheart already gets you a\n\tcompanion that scales based on the Caretaker&#8217;s level and Proficiency Bonus,\n\twhich is more impactful than what you get from any official class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This section briefly details some obvious and enticing multiclass options, but doesn&#8217;t fully explore the broad range of multiclassing combinations.

Watch out for cleric spells which use\n\t\tyour Bonus Action because they&#8217;ll conflict with commanding your\n\t\tcompanion.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Druid<\/span>: A single level to pick up some\n\t\tWisdom-based options like Shillelagh, Produce Flame, and Thorn Whip will\n\t\tmake you much more effective offensively. However, you give up the ability\n\t\tto wear metal armor, so you&#8217;re trading new offensive options for reduced AC\n\t\tunless you also max out Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: Starting at 1st level as a\n\t\tfighter gets you heavy armor, which makes a Strength-based build more\n\t\tviable. Wisdom is still more important, of course. Fighting Style\n\t\t(Protection) or (Interception) both give you a powerful way to protect your\n\t\tcompanion which will significantly add to their durability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monk<\/span>: 16 Dex and 20 Wis gets you 18 AC,\n\t\twhich will beat light armor for the same ability scores. Martial Arts will\n\t\tgive you a consistent use for your Bonus Action once you no longer need it\n\t\tto command your companion, but your attacks will still be relatively weak\n\t\tuntil you raise your Dexterity a bit more.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranger<\/span>: Two levels for Druidic Warrior\n\t\tgets you access to the druid cantrips without the restrictions against metal\n\t\tarmor, but two levels might not be worth it for a marginal improvement to\n\t\tyour own effectiveness.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Beastheart Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Items without a book abbreviation superscript are taken from the Beastheart\n\tand Monstrous Companions PDF.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Moon-Touched Sword<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: The cheapest way to make your attacks magic to bypass damage\n\t\tresistances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Badge of Battle +1<\/span>: A significant\n\t\timprovement to your companion&#8217;s effectiveness in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Badge of Ruin +1<\/span>: It&#8217;s possible to build a\n\t\tcompanion without relying heavily on saving throws, in which case a Badge of\n\t\tBattle is better.

Their primary function is to serve as the Caretaker for a Monstrous Companion, and their class features revolve around that central capability. Dexterity\/Wisdom builds will be common, and like the Ranger, Strength\/Wisdom builds are possible but difficult with little or no payoff for the additional difficulty.
