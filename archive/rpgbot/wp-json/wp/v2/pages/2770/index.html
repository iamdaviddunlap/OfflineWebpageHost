Mechanically, tieflings have traits which associate them with devils, such as the fire resistance, Darkvision, and innate spellcasting. Tieflings have recieved a lot of attention in the rules, giving them an unmatched number of variants and subraces, allowing you to deeply customize your character to suit your preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your choice of variant or subrace, Tiefling is a very strong race option. Their ability score increases are good even without the custom origin rules, they have resistance to one of the most common types of non-weapon damage, and their innate spellcasting offers a variety of useful options depending on your subrace. If you use the custom origin rules, things get even better because you can mix and match your innate spellcasting to suit your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tiefling-traits\">Tiefling Traits<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#tiefling-subraces-and-variants\">Tiefling Subraces and Variants<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-custom-origin\">Tiefling Classes (Customizable Origins)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#classes-default\">Tiefling Classes (Default Rules)<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Tiefling Feats<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The mechanics were essentially &#8220;retconned&#8221; to make the Player&#8217;s Handbook Tiefling into a subrace. Thanks to the variants presented in Sword Coast Adventurer&#8217;s Guide and the subraces presented in Mordenkainen&#8217;s Tome of Foes, the Tiefling has the longest list of subrace options of any published race, totaling an impressive 14 individual subraces and variants. These options make tieflings diverse, flexible, and viable in an impressively large number of builds. However, because the subraces all shuffle around the Tieflings ability increases and spellcasting, it can often feel like they&#8217;re all the same race with a pallet swap rather than subraces which differ in theme and personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interactions of variants and subraces for Tieflings can be confusing. The Sword Coast Adventurer&#8217;s Guide states that the Feral variant is compatible with the other published variants, and Jeremy Crawford has clarified that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeremyecrawford\/status\/1006002281165176833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you can use any of the variants with DM permission<\/a>, so you could use a variant alongside a subrace if your DM allowed it. Of course, if you&#8217;re using the custom origin rules in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything, the Feral Tiefling variant has no effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I think that the variants presented in Sword Coast Adventurer&#8217;s Guide should be treated like subraces, and therefore shouldn&#8217;t be combined with other Tiefling subrace options, including those contained in Mordenkainen&#8217;s Tome of Foes. Even combining the Feral variant with other variants seems like a potentially complicated and problematic option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that&#8217;s wonderful from a character optimization perspective, it also means that you can cobble together a Tiefling for essentially any build which really defeats the purpose of having numerous, diverse races. If building a Tiefling allows three individual choices within the race (feral or regular, subrace, and potentially another variant), the Tiefling quickly becomes one of the most powerful races in 5e without using the custom origin rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The custom origin rules in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything level the playing field in a lot of ways, so the Tiefling is no longer an easy build choice in nearly every class by combining some set of subraces\/variants. Now that every race gets flexible ability score increases, the Feral Tiefling variant is totally irrelevant. You can now also pick any tiefling subrace exclusively for its spell selection, which offers many exciting optimization options. The winged tiefling variant becomes a go-to option for any build that can&#8217;t already fly easily, supplanting the aarakocra as the best option for racial flight.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-custom-origin\">Tiefling Classes (Customizable Origins)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section assumes that you&#8217;re using the option &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/character-options#CustomizingYourOrigin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Customizing Your Origin<\/a>&#8221; rules presented in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything.

A good fit in a party full of\n\t\tsneaky characters like rogues, trickery clerics, and illusionists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Zariel<\/span>: An excellent option for a\n\t\tfront-line Purple Dragon Knight. The spells include smite spells from the\n\t\tPaladin spell list, offering some great offensive options.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Variant: Feral<\/span>: The only way to play a\n\t\tTiefling without a Charisma increase, the Feral variant is the best option\n\t\tfor any archetype except Purple Dragon Knight. Eldritch Knight is an obvious\n\t\tchoice, but don&#8217;t feel locked into it solely because you have a +1\n\t\tIntelligence increase, and remember that the innate spellcasting is still\n\t\tCharisma-based.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Variant: Winged<\/span>: The ability increases\n\t\twon&#8217;t be helpful unless you combine this with Feral, but permanent\n\t\tnonmagical flight is a massive tactical advantage. Just keep in mind that\n\t\tthe wings don&#8217;t work in heavy armor, so you&#8217;ll want to build around\n\t\tDexterity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monk\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\">Monk<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dispater Tiefling and Glasya Tiefling are both options because they provide\n\trelevant ability increases, but I think the Feral variant is your best bet.\n\tGlasya can be very sneaky and tricky thanks to their free spells, but the\n\tvanilla tiefling spells may be a better complement to the monk&#8217;s combat\n\tabilities, offering a mix of magical utility and damage that monks can&#8217;t\n\treplicate on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"paladin\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\">Paladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to play a front-line tank, Paladin is the Tiefling&#8217;s go-to\n\toption, beating out Fighter because the Tiefling&#8217;s ability increases work so\n\tnicely for the Paladin. Darkvision is great for facing enemies in the dark\n\twhere they live, and fire resistance adds to the Paladin&#8217;s already fantastic\n\tdurability. The Tiefling&#8217;s innate spellcasting is also Charisma-based, which\n\tworks very well for the Paladin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Tiefling variants work very well for the Paladin, so you have plenty of\n\toptions to make your Tiefling Paladin unique. Charisma increases are obviously\n\tfantastic, but you likely also want a Strength or Dexterity increase, but if\n\tyou use the Blessed Warrior fighting style, and you can build your palading\n\taround Charisma and barely concern yourself with Strength or Dexterity. You\n\tshould also consider how your subrace&#8217;s spells will contribute to your overall\n\tbuild. Here are some suggestions based on the Tiefling subraces which work\n\tbest for the Paladin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dispater<\/span>: The ability scores line up\n\t\tnicely for a Dexterity-based Paladin, and the spells make for an\n\t\tunconventional character. Disguises and the ability to detect thoughts may\n\t\thelp you to locate and defeat enemies by more subtle means than a typical\n\t\tpaladin.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Glasya<\/span>: The ability scores line up\n\t\tnicely for a Dexterity-based Paladin, but the spells don&#8217;t cater to your\n\t\ttypical Paladin playstyle.
