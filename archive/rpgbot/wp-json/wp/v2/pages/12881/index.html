Keep in mind that the state of the meta periodically changes as new source materials are released, and the article will be updated accordingly as time allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"rating- wp-block-heading\" id=\"features\">Oath of Glory Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oath Spells<\/span>: Many of the spells on\n\t\tthe list are fantastic, even allowing the Glory Paladin to shoulder the burden of Concentrating on some potent buffs, freeing up the party\u2019s casters for area control or other spells. Keep in mind though, that, while Aura of Protection\n\t\thelps, the Paladin isn&#8217;t proficient in Constitution saving throws. If\n\t\tyou plan to shoulder this burden regularly in combat, consider the Resilient feat or the\n\t\tWar Caster feat to improve your success rate with Concentration saves.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd-Level<\/span>: Guiding Bolt is hard\n\t\t\t\tbecause paladins generally can&#8217;t invest enough in Charisma to be good at\n\t\t\t\tspell attacks. You likely won&#8217;t cast it often, but it is still a decent ranged attack spell if you&#8217;re out of melee range. Heroism is a great defensive option. At the early levels where the fear immunity is helpful, your Charisma will be too low for good temp HP, and the high levels where the temp HP isn&#8217;t relevant, you&#8217;re immune to fear.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th-Level<\/span>: Enhance Ability is just an\n\t\t\t\tall-around great spell, useful both in and out of combat, though your\n\t\t\t\tmost likely use case in combat is for Strength, and you can use Peerless\n\t\t\t\tAthlete for that, so save Enhance Ability for outside of combat when you\n\t\t\t\tneed things like Advantage on Charisma checks in social situations.\n\t\t\t\tMagic Weapon is great if you don&#8217;t have a permanent magic weapon, but it requires Concentration so generally you&#8217;ll want to cast something else unless you absolutely need this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th-Level<\/span>: Two fantastic buffs, but\n\t\t\t\tboth require Concentration. That said, self-casting haste and freely sharing it with a Find (Greater) Steed as per the steed spell allows a mount to both Dash and Disengage on every round, which quadruples its total movement and ignores opportunity attacks while still giving the Glory Paladin an extra attack. Protection From Energy is a staple defensive buff at every level.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: We&#8217;re unlikely to have the Charisma to make Compulsion reliable, and the effect is not that useful. Compelling targets to run away in a direction and using our Concentration just makes fights take longer than they need to.\nFreedom of Movement is\n\t\t\t\tgreat, but only situationally useful. Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, and you can share it with your steed.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-red\">17th-Level<\/span>: A divination which everyone\n\t\t\t\telse has been casting for 8 levels. Flame Strike is helpful for handling\n\t\t\t\tcrowds, but the damage is unremarkable at this level and your save DC is\n\t\t\t\tlikely poor compared to a full spellcaster.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Channel Divinity<\/span>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Peerless Athlete<\/span>: Strength (Athletics)\n\t\t\t\tincludes checks to Grapple and to Shove, both of which are staple\n\t\t\t\ttactical options for front-line melee classes like the Paladin. The fact\n\t\t\t\tthat you can activate this as a Bonus Action makes it easy to use this\n\t\t\t\twithout cutting into your attacks, and the 10-minute duration can last\n\t\t\t\tthrough several encounters if you move quickly. Using the classic\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">Grapple+Shove combo<\/a>\n\t\t\t\tis an easy way to provide Advantage for yourself\n\t\t\t\tyour other melee allies, and so Peerless Athlete can be a great way to\n\t\t\t\tmake that combo easier.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inspiring Smite<\/span>: A decent number of\n\t\t\t\ttemporary hit points, and while usually you&#8217;ll horde them for yourself,\n\t\t\t\tthe ability to share them with allies offers a fantastic tactical\n\t\t\t\toption. Keep in mind that you need to use Divine Smite before you can\n\t\t\t\tactivate this, so be sure to keep a spell slot ready so that you can\n\t\t\t\tsmite something and trigger Inspiring Smite.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Alacrity<\/span>: 10 ft. of extra speed\n\t\tis nice for the paladin and their mount even if it&#8217;s unreliable for allies in the middle of combat.\n\t\tOther players will likely be able to\n\t\tmove further with good positioning than by working to stay within\n\t\tthe aura&#8217;s tiny radius, but because the aura takes effect at the beginning of an ally&#8217;s turn it&#8217;s our job to get the aura in position to push our team that extra 10 feet across the finish line.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glorious Defense<\/span>: This is a fantastic\n\t\tdefensive ability, combining the AC bonus of the spell Shield with a free\n\t\tcounterattack. Be sure to grab a ranged weapon or a weapon with Reach to\n\t\tenjoy the effect to its fullest.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aura of Alacrity (improvement)<\/span>: The\n\t\teffect doesn&#8217;t improve, but the radius does. The tiny radius is the biggest problem\n\t\twith positioning the aura, but 10 feet gives us plenty of wiggle room to try to get more than one ally into the aura before we end our turn.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"20\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Living Legend<\/span>: The effects are all\n\t\tspectacular and broadly useful. Don&#8217;t be tempted to use this for Charisma\n\t\tchecks in social situations; you can cast Enhance Ability for that.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-glory-ability-scores\">Oath of Glory Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Paladins want three stats, Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, and Glory doesn\u2019t deviate in that department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: We need this to wear our heavy armor and hit with melee attacks to deliver Divine Smites.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: A common save that we might have to deal with.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: This is our hit points, and our Concentration saves.

If you took the alternative Variant Human build, this is just +2 Strength for 18 Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our scores here should be STR 18 CON 16 CHA 16 and we should have Polearm Master.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twelfth Level: Another ASI for +2 Strength to cap it at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sixteenth Level: ASI for +2 Charisma to 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nineteenth Level: ASI for +2 Charisma capping at 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Divine Sense<br>Lay on Hands<br>Martial Weapons<br>Heavy Armor<br><br>Skills<br>-Acrobatics<br>-Animal handling<br>-Athletics<br>-Intimidation<br><br>Feat: Resilient (+1 Constitution)<\/td><td>We can walk out with Chainmail, a Warhammer or Longsword, a Shield, and a Spear.<br><br>We can either sword and board or leave our shield stowed so we have a free hand to grab people.<br><br>Our AC will be 16 or 18 with the Shield.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>1st-Level Spells<br><br>Divine Smite<br><br>Fighting Style<br>-Dueling<\/td><td>We have access to our first level of spells now as well as the power to spend spell slots to Smite. Because we\u2019re a prepared Divine caster and can change our spells on a daily basis, refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/spells\/\">Paladin Spell List Breakdown<\/a> for general spells in addition to the <a href=\"#spells\">list above<\/a> for our Oath spells.<br><br>We choose Dueling as our fighting style so we can stab people harder while grappling.<br><br>We could also go with Unarmed, provided your DM is ok with you taking that as a Paladin. It would add a little extra damage while grappling a target, but we would still want to stab the target repeatedly with a spear because Divine Smite and Polearm Master don&#8217;t work with fists.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Divine Health<br><br>Sacred Oath<br>-Oath of Glory<br><br>Channel Divinity<br>-Peerless Athlete<br>-Inspiring Smite<\/td><td>Being Immune to Disease is nice.<br><br>We take our Oath of Glory, which gives us access to a list of spells and two Channel Divinity powers.<br><br>Peerless Athlete gives us Advantage on skills and a few other benefits that would make us a Peerless Athlete.<br><br>Inspiring Smite hands out some Temporary Hit Points right after we use Divine Smite. Using this does take our bonus action, but the nice thing is that we can divide the pool of temp HP how we want to all the targets.<br><br>Using the whole thing on yourself is certainly an option, but if you think an ally might be in for a bit of hurt don\u2019t hesitate to discourage your foes by dropping the whole pile on your ally.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>ASI<br>-Strength +1 (17=&gt;18)<br>-Charisma +1 (15=&gt;16)<\/td><td>We grab an ASI to push up Strength and Charisma to increase both bonuses by 1.<br><br>This is important as Aura of Protection will be active soon and we want that 16 Charisma for the +3 to all Saves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br>2nd-Level Spells<\/td><td>Now, if we grab someone, we can stab them in the same turn. Or shove them to the ground.<br><br>We also have 2nd-level spells now so we should cast <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#find-steed\">Find Steed<\/a> at some point <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/mounted_combat\/\">to get a mount<\/a>.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Aura of Protection<\/td><td>Our Charisma modifier is added to all saves now. This is great because we rely on some nice Concentration spells that we don\u2019t want to break, and between this and Resilient (Constitution) we have a +9 modifier to Constitution saves at this level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Aura of Alacrity<\/td><td>Our walking speed increases. This is very specific: <em>walking<\/em>. Not swimming or climbing or flying. This means that while this will apply to any mount we ride and any animal driven chariot, later flying mounts from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#find-greater-steed\">Find Greater Steed<\/a> will not have their flying speed increased. Creatures which gain a flying speed equal to their walking speed (all of the flying races in Monsters of the Multiverse) will still have their flying speeds increased as a result.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: Polearm Master<\/td><td>Now we can get an extra swing in on a bonus action if we\u2019re using a spear. More importantly we can do things like shove or grab and stab then bonus action to stab again. The off-hand bonk also applies the +2 damage from Dueling if we\u2019re using a one-handed weapon like a spear.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>3rd-Level Spells<\/td><td>It\u2019s time to self-cast Haste so that it can automatically be shared on our Find Steed mount, doubling the steed\u2019s movement speed and granting it a second action.<br><br>Now the steed can use both Dash and Disengage every turn, which combined with the double speed of haste means the steed moves at four times speed and never provokes opportunity attacks. Or if you don\u2019t care, your mount can move 6 times its speed.<br><br>Oh and I guess we can attack an extra time.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Aura of Courage<\/td><td>You, your horse, and all the friends within 10 feet of you are immune to fear. Because of your glorious golden abs.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Improved Divine Smite<\/td><td>More damage on every attack. Both of our attacks with Extra Attack, our Bonus bonk, and if we\u2019re Hasted one more swing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Strength (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>Be glory, do muscles.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>4th-Level Spells<\/td><td>Time to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#find-greater-steed\">Find Greater Steed<\/a>. It\u2019s like Find Steed, but with wings (or bigger teeth, but you definitely want wings).<br><br>But hold your pegasi before you get the idea to grab someone and fly off into the sky like my fellow authors did. By the rules, if we start a grapple while mounted, the grapple will break if the mount\u2019s movement moves us.<br><br>But maybe talk to your DM about this. I suggest that a Strength (Handle Animal) check might allow you to drag someone along while riding.<br><br>No, you didn\u2019t read that wrong, we\u2019re making this check about how well you can stay in the saddle with just your legs while your hands are busy grappling. Failure would just dismount you without moving or breaking the grapple.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Cleansing Touch<\/td><td>Just flex away the bad magic.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Glorious Defense<\/td><td>Parry and Riposte. Look at all these attacks.<br><br>It\u2019s kinda like casting Shield, but doesn\u2019t last the whole round.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Charisma (16=&gt;18)<\/td><td>Improve our Aura of Protection, our Spell DCs, and our Glorious Defense.<br><br>Like some kind of God Stat.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>5th-Level Spells<\/td><td>Some nice options here. If we can\u2019t be mounted, Holy Weapon is better DPR than having the extra attack from Haste.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Aura Improvements<\/td><td>Our Auras all increase in size.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>ASI: +2 Charisma (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>Capping this out to 20 caps our Save DCs, adds +5 to all allied saves within 30 feet, and makes Glorious Defense +5 to AC.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Living Legend<\/td><td>Kinda ridiculous. For a minute we get Advantage to Charisma checks, reroll failed saves as a reaction, and once on each of our turns we just turn a miss into a hit because we\u2019re too cool to miss.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Be a symbol of perfection Be a legend, Be a cult Take their praise, take their collection As the multitudes exult &#8211;It\u2019s Tough to be a God Introduction The Oath of Glory is as much a showman as it is a hardened warrior.
