Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Inquisitor Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points isn&#8217;t much for a\n\tcharacter on the front line, but it&#8217;s enough to take a few hits. Fortunately\n\tyou get medium armor and shields, and you have good saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: At medium BAB, the\n\tInquisitor can hold their own with a weapon, but don&#8217;t expect to fight it out\n\twith a fighter and win.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: With good Fortitude and Will saves,\n\tand with reasonable dexterity, the Inquisitor&#8217;s saves are good across the\n\tboard.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple weapons, shields, and\n\tmedium armor would be enough to get the job done, but the Inquisitor gets a\n\tfew other options as well. Most notably, the Inquisitor gets proficiency with\n\tthe repeating crossbow. I would never recommend using one, but it&#8217;s ammusing\n\tto know that the Inquisitor doesn&#8217;t need a feat to do so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: 6+ skill points will let you do a\n\tlot of things. The Inquistitor&#8217;s skill list include all of the face skills,\n\tall of the most important knowledge skills, Perception, and Stealth. You can\n\tdo almost everyting but pick locks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spells<\/span>: The inquisitor learns and casts\n\tspells like a Bard: they have a limited list of spells known, and can cast\n\tthem spontaneously.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain<\/span>: The domain abilities are only half\n\tof what makes a domain good, and without the spell list the value of a domain\n\tchanges greatly. You can also take an Inquisition in place of a domain. See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/domains\">Cleric Domain Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor help choosing a domain.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<!-- or my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/inquisitor\/inquisitions\">Inquisitor Inquisitions Breakdown<\/a> for help selecting an Inquisition.--><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Judgment<\/span> (Su): A few times per day the\n\tInquisitor can choose an ongoing buff which lasts for an entire combat. Many\n\tof the buffs are great, and provide bonuses which you usually need to plan\n\twell in advance.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Destruction<\/span>: There are much better ways\n\t\tto get damage bonuses this size.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing<\/span>: This is the only inquisition that\n\t\tyou would really want to last beyond the end of the combat. Fast healing can\n\t\tdo a lot to compensate for the Inquisitor&#8217;s d8 hit points, especially in\n\t\tlong, protracted fights.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Justice<\/span>: You should be good enough at\n\t\thitting things that you don&#8217;t need this, but once in a while it can be nice\n\t\tto hit more often than usual.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Piercing<\/span>: Because Inquisitors aren&#8217;t\n\t\tprimary casters, they typically shouldn&#8217;t cast a lot of spells against their\n\t\tenemies, especially those with spell resistance. The bonus to Concentration\n\t\tchecks is nice, but you will generally only need to concentrate to cast\n\t\tdefensively, and your highest DC is only 27.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection<\/span>: Sacred bonuses are extremely\n\t\trare, so this will stack with almost anything you have. The bonus doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tscale very quickly, but it can be very nice if you need a little more\n\t\tAC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Purity<\/span>: This can be fantastic when facing\n\t\tenemy spellcasters or enemies with scary special abilities like dragons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resiliency<\/span>: This is great against enemies\n\t\twith numerous small attacks (or numerous small enemies). Against enemies\n\t\twith small numbers of big attacks, Healing or Protection may be better\n\t\tchoices.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resistance<\/span>: It&#8217;s not a ton of\n\t\tresistance, but it&#8217;s quick to activate. If your enemy is only dealing energy\n\t\tdamage every few rounds, you may do better to use the Healing inquisition\n\t\tand recover HP in the rounds between energy attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Smiting<\/span>: Very helpful for handling DR on\n\t\toutsiders and golems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Monster Lore<\/span> (Ex): Very helpful for\n\tidentifying monsters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Stern Gaze<\/span> (Ex): This helps quite a bit if\n\tyou are the party&#8217;s face.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cunning Initiative<\/span> (Ex): Initiative bonuses\n\tare always fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Detect Alignment<\/span> (Sp): Great for scouting\n\tand for determining people&#8217;s alignments.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Track<\/span> (Ex): Situational, and very rarely\n\timportant.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Solo Tactics<\/span> (Ex): Take Precise Strike to\n\tget bonus damage when flanking. Take Coordinated Charge to follow your allies\n\twhen they charge. This makes teamwork feats much better without requiring your\n\tallies to contibute.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Teamwork Feat<\/span>: Combined with Solo Tactics,\n\tthis grants you a huge number of tactical options. You also get the ability to\n\tchange your most recently gained teamwork feat, which means you can change to\n\tsomething with difficult prerequisites or a situational use case.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bane<\/span> (Su): Bane is almost never a good\n\tchoice for a permanent weapon enhancement because you can never gurantee that\n\tit will be useful. Inquisitors can throw it on their weapon and gurantee that\n\tit will be effective. Unfortunately, the number of rounds per day is very\n\tsmall, so save this for big important enemies. Note that bane also allows you\n\tto bypass DR.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Discern Lies<\/span> (Sp): Situational, and you\n\tshould already be great at Sense Motive due to Stern Gaze. You also have the\n\tspell Discern Lies avaialable as 4th level spell.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Second Judgment<\/span> (Ex): As though Judgment\n\twasn&#8217;t cool enough, now you get to use two at a time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stalwart<\/span> (Ex): Like evasion for Will and\n\tFortitude saves. Combined with a Ring of Evasion and good saving throw\n\tbonuses, you can be effectively immune to anything with a saving throw. I&#8217;m\n\tnot sure why you can&#8217;t do this in heavy armor, but that&#8217;s not a problem\n\treally.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Bane<\/span> (Su): Here, have a bunch more\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Exploit Weakness<\/span> (Ex): It is difficult to\n\tbring this to bear, but it&#8217;s a very cool flavor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Third Judgment<\/span> (Ex): Three Judgments at\n\tonce. Turn on Healing, Protection, and Purity, and you&#8217;re basically\n\tindestructible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Slayer<\/span> (Ex): Increase the bonus from one of\n\tyour Judgment types by 1 or 2, depending on the Judgment and your level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Judgment<\/span> (Su): Save or Die with a\n\tdecent DC, and you can use it once every 1d4 rounds with almost no\n\tpreperation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, their wide range of abilities also makes the Inquisitor somewhat Multiple Ability Dependent (MAD). When planning your Inquisitor, be sure to decide which roles you wish to focus on and adjust your ability scores accordingly. This guide assumes that the Inquisitor is primarily a melee character, and these ability scores reflect that decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: Likely your primary combat ability\n\tscore. Teamwork feats, which are a major part of the class, typically depend\n\ton being in melee combat alongside your allies. Because you have other\n\tcapabilities, you aren&#8217;t as dependent on strength as Fighters or other\n\tstrictly combat-focused classes, so you don&#8217;t need to dump all of your\n\tresources into Strength. Even if you prefer ranged weapons, Strength is an\n\timportant source of additional damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Breastplate has a maximum dexterity\n\tbonus of +3, so a 16 in dexterity goes a long way to boost your AC, your worst\n\tsave, and your ranged attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Con<\/span>: Always key for hit points, especially\n\twith your.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Not strictly necessary, but nice for\n\tskill ranks and Knowledge skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Your spellcasting ability. Becuase\n\tyou&#8217;re a 2\/3 caster and don&#8217;t rely on direct spells to defeat opponents, you\n\tdon&#8217;t need to focus on Wisdom in order to boost your AC. You won&#8217;t need more\n\tthan 16 Wisdom, and you won&#8217;t need that much for quite a while, so don&#8217;t take\n\tmore than 15 Wisdom at start to save points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Unless you plan to be a Face, dump\n\tCharisma. Even if you need Intimidate, Stern Gaze gives you more than enough\n\tof a bonus to overcome an ability penalty. You can also take the Conversion\n\tInquisition, which allows you to use your Wisdom score in place of Charisma\n\tfor social skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Arrray<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 15<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 11<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 10<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Arrray<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 15<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your race determines a lot of your other character decisions as an\n\tInquisitor. Bonuses to ability scores can allow you to shift ability score buy\n\tpoints around to focus on other areas. Racial proficiency with a good weapon\n\tis nice, and extra vision types are fantastic if you plan to be stealthy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Bonuses to both constitution and your\n\tcasting ability are nice, plus you get Darkvision and some nice defensive\n\tbonuses. The penalty to Charisma makes it hard to be a Face, but you can excel\n\tat everything else that an Inquisitor does. If you have a favorite Judgment,\n\tthe Dwarf favored class option can be a good choice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The Elf might make for a good ranged\n\tInquisitor, but most of the Elf&#8217;s spellcasting-related abilities are wasted on\n\tthe Inquisitor. The Elf favored class bonus allows you to learn additional\n\tspells, but Inquisitors are not primarily defined by their spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Gnomes don&#8217;t get anything that\n\tbenefits an Inquisitor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus is\n\talways nice, and Skill Focus can be nice to compensate for low ability scores.\n\tLow-light vision is situational, but nice to have. Consider taking the\n\tDrow-Blooded alternate racial trait to get Darkvision, and the Half-Elf\n\tfavored class bonus is helpful if you depend heavily on teamwork feats. If you\n\tdon&#8217;t want to lean on Teamwork feats a lot, you can take the Elf or Human\n\tfavored class bonuses to learn extra spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The half-orc gets proficiency with\n\tthe Falchion (one of the best two-handed weapons), a racial bonus to\n\tIntimidate, darkvision, and a flexible ability score bonus. These bonuses work\n\tvery well for the Inquisitor. The Half-Orc favored class bonus isn&#8217;t great, so\n\tconsider taking the Human favored class bonus to get extra spells known.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Good for stealthy or social\n\tInquisitors who prefer ranged weapons. The Halfling favored class bonus is\n\thelpful if you depend heavily on teamwork feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always a good choice, you can put\n\tyour ability score enhancement in almost any ability, and the skill points are\n\talways useful. The Human favored class bonus allows you to learn additional\n\tspells, but Inquisitors are not primarily defined by their spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (Combat): You should\n\t\tgenerally be fighting alongside your allies to take advantage of your\n\t\tteamwork feats, but sometimes it&#8217;s nice to work alone.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): Reflex saves are\n\t\tyour worst save, so this is a good way to round out your defenses if you are\n\t\tnot focused on ranged combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dirty Fighter<\/span> (Combat): 1 damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tmuch, but melee inquisitors do very well while flanking, so this can play\n\t\tinto your combat strategy very well.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): Initiative bonuses\n\t\tare great, but not as important for Inquisitors as they are for primary\n\t\tcasters or chargers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resilient<\/span> (Combat): Bonus to one of your\n\t\tgood saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Beacon of Faith<\/span> (Faith): This can be\n\t\treally fantastic if your domain\/inquisition is good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disdainful Defender<\/span> (Faith): Divine\n\t\tspells are half of all spells.

Perhaps the best comparison is to a vanilla fighter: tons of options, but you&#8217;re not comitted to any of them by default. Teamwork feats seem tempting, but since you don&#8217;t get a way to share them with allies, they&#8217;re no more useful for an inquisitor than for anyone else. However, there are a handful of feats which specifically pertain to Inquisitors which we can examine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Channeling Scoure<\/span>: Your Inquisitor levels stack with\n\t\twhatever class gave you Channel Energy. If you really like Channel Energy\n\t\tand want to multiclass, this might be useful, but that&#8217;s a really specific\n\t\tbuild.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Instant Judgment<\/span>: About to be dropped\n\t\tbelow 0 hit points? About to be targeted with a save-or-suck spell? Use your\n\t\tImmediate Action and switch your Judgment to keep yourself alive. You can\n\t\tnormally switch your Judgment on your turn as a swift action, but that\n\t\trequires knowing what you will need ahead of time. You can&#8217;t always do that,\n\t\tunfortunately, so this offers a wonderful defensive option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Righteous Healing<\/span>: First, it&#8217;s in-combat\n\t\thealing. Unless someone is unconcious, in-combat healing is usually a\n\t\tterrible idea. Second, the amount healed is very small.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shared Judgment<\/span>: Extremely versatile.\n\t\tChances are good that whatever Judgment you pick will be useful for someone\n\t\telse in the party. Worst-case scenario, use this with the Healing Judgment\n\t\tto save someone who&#8217;s low on hit points. Of course, it&#8217;s somewhat redundant\n\t\twith the Lend Judgment spell, and learning a spell is a much lower\n\t\tinvestment if you don&#8217;t plan to use this frequently. Plus, Lend Judgement\n\t\tlets you both benefit from the effect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Inquisitor has limited weapon proficiencies. Because I can&#8217;t guess at your setting, your pantheon, or character&#8217;s deity, I am only able to assess the weapons available to all Inquisitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Crossbow, Heavy Repeating<\/span>: Amusing but\n\t\tterrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heavy Mace<\/span>: Strictly worse than the\n\t\tmorningstar.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Morningstar<\/span>: The best one-handed simple\n\t\tweapon. It is cheaper and lighter than a heavy mace, does the same damage,\n\t\tand can bypass two types of DR instead of one.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longbow<\/span>: Even if you aren&#8217;t built for\n\t\tranged combat you should carry a Longbow. The range is fantastic, and mighty\n\t\tcomposite longbows are the gold standard of ranged combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longspear<\/span>: The only weapon available to\n\t\tthe nquisitor which grants reach. Reach is pretty awesome, and there aren&#8217;t\n\t\tany simple weapons that deal more damage than a d8.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shortspear<\/span>: The shortspear has all of\n\t\tthe benefits of a spear, but allows you to use a shield in exchange for a\n\t\tslightly smaller damage die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spear<\/span>: The spear trades the longspear&#8217;s\n\t\treach for a range increment, allowing you to throw the spear without\n\t\tpenalty. This can be a fun tactical option, but throwing your primary melee\n\t\tweapon generally leaves you unarmed and ineffective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">Deity&#8217;s Favored Weapon<\/span>: Compare your deity&#8217;s favored\n\t\tweapon to the other options available. Most choices will be on par with a\n\t\tlongsword, which is a fine choice if you prefer to use a one-handed\n\t\tweapon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hide<\/span>: Starting gear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Breastplate<\/span>: The heaviest armor with which\n\t\tyou are proficient. If you plan to be in melee, this is the way to go. If\n\t\tyou plan to be an archer, Mithral Breastplate may still be viable, but you\n\t\tmay need to use lighter armor as your dexterity increases.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Buckler<\/span>: If you want to use a two-handed\n\t\tweapon, cast spells during combat, or use a ranged weapon, the buckler is\n\t\tthe way to go. It only provides one less AC than a heavy shield, and\n\t\tprovides a lot of versatility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Light Shield<\/span>: Unless you plan on shield\n\t\tbashing (and you shouldn&#8217;t), the buckler is strictly better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heavy Shield<\/span>: If you need AC and don&#8217;t\n\t\tmind giving up some damage output, take a heavy shield. You will need to\n\t\tdrop your weapon to cast spells, so plan to use your spells outside of\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section won&#8217;t address every spell on your spell list, but it will point out some especially notable options.

Because Judgment can do so\n\t\tmuch, it makes Lend Judgment an extremely versatile spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wrath<\/span>: Divine Favor is typically\n\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blistering Invective<\/span>: Demoralizing an\n\t\tentire encounter with one spell is a huge advantage. The fire damage is a\n\t\tnice bonus, but that&#8217;s not what you want fromm this spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Honeyed Tongue<\/span>: Amazing if you&#8217;re the\n\t\tparty&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Interrogation<\/span>: Torture is a touchy\n\t\tsubject in many games. But hey, if you&#8217;re comfortable torturing captives for\n\t\tinformation, this can really help things along. Combined with Zone of Truth\n\t\tyou can achieve some truly impressive results.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invisibility<\/span>: Always a good option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knock<\/span>: Replaces half of Disable\n\t\tDevice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">See Invisibility<\/span>: Good duration and\n\t\tabsolutely essential if you don&#8217;t have other options in the party for\n\t\thandling invisibile creatures. A great candidate for permanency.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deadly Juggernaut<\/span>: Inquisitors don&#8217;t get\n\t\tmuch from their class to make them murder machines. You&#8217;ll have better luck\n\t\twith Divine Favor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic<\/span>: Essential in any party. You\n\t\tstill get full caster level, so you&#8217;re just as good at this as a Cleric.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Vestment<\/span>: One of my favorite buffs.\n\t\tYou get the spell later than clerics, but you still get full caster level\n\t\tprogression so the bonus is just as good. However, Inquisitors frequently go\n\t\tfor two-handed weapons instead of shields, and without a shield you won&#8217;t\n\t\tenjoy this spell as much as a cleric would.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Weapon, Greater<\/span>: One of my favorite\n\t\tbuffs. You get the spell later than clerics, but you still get full caster\n\t\tlevel progression so the bonus is just as good. This will save you a\n\t\tfortune, but you&#8217;ll still need to spend gold if you want interesting weapon\n\t\tabilities.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stunning Bearier, Greater<\/span>: An excellent\n\t\tdefensive option, but the defensive bonuses won&#8217;t stack with Judgement and\n\t\tcommon defensive items. RAW you can stun the same creature repeatedly (&#8220;It\n\t\tis not discharged until it has stunned a number of creatures&#8230;&#8221;), but the\n\t\tintent is clearly that you can stun things a number of times equal to your\n\t\tcaster level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Interrogation, greater<\/span>: The improved damage\n\t\tis pointless, and using a 4th-level spell slot in place of two 1st-level\n\t\tspell slots if probably a poor choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Power<\/span>: Divine Favor and the best\n\t\tpart of Haste at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lend Judgement, Greater<\/span>: By this level you\n\t\thave two judgements and you&#8217;re close to getting a third.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span>: Ideally, the only in-combat healing\n\t\tthat you will ever need.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Jurist<\/span> (+1): Awful. Fortunately, only\n\t\tInquisitors get to use it, so no one else will be disappointed by it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Menacing<\/span> (+1): If you&#8217;re built for\n\t\tflanking, this can be really worthwhile. Outflank is an easy and reliable\n\t\toption for your bonus Teamwork Feats, and a combined +6 to hit while\n\t\tflanking is fantastic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ominous<\/span> (+1): A bonus to Intimidate, and if\n\t\tyou score a critical hit the target is Shaken. This sounds tempting, but the\n\t\tskill bonus is tiny and the DC 13 Will save to resist the Shaken effect is\n\t\tworthless..<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clawhand Shield<\/span> (8,158 gp): This is a\n\t\tweird item. It&#8217;s a bit more expensive than your typical +2 shield, so it may\n\t\tnot be worth the cost compared to a mithral buckler. However, it allows you\n\t\tto perform somatic components with the hand holding the shield, which means\n\t\tthat you can hold a weapon in your other hand without issue, and because it\n\t\thas no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure anyone can use it without\n\t\tissue. The ability to automatically damage enemies while in a grapple is a\n\t\thelpful deterrent for small or physical weak characters, but ion&#8217;t go\n\t\tlooking for excuses to use it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection<\/span>: You have a lot of spells\n\t\twhich provide defelction bonuses to AC.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boots of Speed<\/span>: At just 12,000gp these are\n\t\ta steal.
