It has some tools to improve the Monk\u2019s core competencies as a Striker, but also gives it some battlefield control and, iconically, healing and Support capabilities. Way of Mercy does still suffer from the MADness that goes with most Monk subclasses, but what you get for being willing to invest in those abilities is pretty great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The flavor of Way of Mercy is definitely strange. They \u201c&#8230;[present] themselves as the faceless bringers of life and death,\u201d which feels really out of place with what a monastic tradition is supposed to be. This I can quote more broadly because it\u2019s from the basic rules, and I really want to because it\u2019s a hilarious moment showing how WOTC really shot themselves in the foot:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>So, clearly they didn\u2019t futureproof this section.

Unfortunately, Medicine is borderline useless (although check out some of our \n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-s2-e6\/\">suggestions<\/a>\nto fix that), as its sole written function is made\n\t\tobsolete by the Healer&#8217;s Kit. Herbalism Kit does allow you to craft Potions\n\t\tof Healing, though, which is nice.\n\t\t<p>You also get a neat mask as a class feature. It doesn&#8217;t do anything. You\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t need it to do anything and technically you don&#8217;t even need to wear\n\t\t\tit.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hand of Healing<\/span>: Your Martial Arts die\n\t\tplus your Wisdom modifier is roughly equivalent to a 1st-level Cure Wounds.\n\t\tThat&#8217;s not a ton of healing all at once, but you get a ton of Ki Points per\n\t\tshort rest as you gain levels, and the action economy around this is\n\t\tfantastic. This is also a great way to expend your remaining Ki Points\n\t\twhenever you reach a Short Rest.\n\t\t<p>Cure Wounds is normally a hard choice in combat because you&#8217;re spending\n\t\t\tyour Action to not damage your enemies when Healing Word is available, so\n\t\t\tthe Action Economy makes it hard to justify. But, while you\n\t\t\t<em>can<\/em> use Hand of Healing as an Action, there&#8217;s almost no reason to\n\t\t\tdo so in combat.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Generally you&#8217;ll use Hand of Healing during combat as part of a Flurry of\n\t\t\tBlows. When you do this, you spend the Ki Point to use Flurry of Blows,\n\t\t\tthen you can decide to replace one of the unarmed strikes with Hand of\n\t\t\tHealing. As far as I can tell, you can make this decision at any point so\n\t\t\tyou could make one attack and see the results before deciding if you want\n\t\t\tto make another attack or heal something.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Since you can move between attacks, I believe that you can also move\n\t\t\tbetween attacking and using Hand of Healing, so you could Attack, use\n\t\t\tFlurry of Blows to heal an ally, then run over to an enemy and attack\n\t\t\tthem some more.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>In many ways, this is like Healing Word, and until your Ki Pool is fairly\n\t\t\tlarge, that&#8217;s how you should consider Hand of Healing: a tiny amount of\n\t\t\thealing, but enough to bring a dying ally back into a fight. As you gain\n\t\t\tmore levels you can afford to use this more often, and Physician&#8217;s Touch\n\t\t\tallows you to quickly remove some problematic status conditions.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hand of Harm<\/span>: One Ki point to\n\t\tautomatically deal as much damage as an unarmed strike is more efficient\n\t\tthan spending a Ki Point to perform a Flurry of Blows which has a chance to\n\t\tmiss. This is also necrotic damage, which is much less-commonly resisted\n\t\tthan bludgeoning damage (or whatever type your weapon deals).\n\t\t<p>Since the damage is &#8220;extra damage&#8221; added to the attack, the extra damage\n\t\t\tdie is multiplied, much like Divine Smite or Sneak Attack, so the most\n\t\t\teffective time to use Hand of Harm is when you score a critical hit.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>However, this only works after you hit with an unarmed strike so if\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re using a weapon (spears are my go-to, and I recommend them for\n\t\t\tnearly every monk) there&#8217;s an incentive to fight unarmed even if your\n\t\t\tMartial Arts die would deal less damage than a weapon. Of course, Flurry\n\t\t\tof Blows and Martial Arts&#8217; Bonus Action attack only allow unarmed strikes,\n\t\t\tso there&#8217;s always going to be some portion of your attacks where you can\n\t\t\tapply this.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Physician&#8217;s Touch later improves Hand of Harm to add the Poisoned\n\t\t\tcondition, making it an amazing way to briefly debuff martial enemies\n\t\t\twithout a save.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Physician&#8217;s Touch<\/span>: Hand of Healing adds\n\t\tthe effect of Lesser Restoration and can also remove the Stunned condition.\n\t\tIf this was an either\/or it would be fantastic, but you get to both remove\n\t\tconditions <em>and<\/em> heal the target.\n\t\t<p>Hand of Harm adds the ability to make the target Poisoned with no save.\n\t\t\tPoisoned is an absolutely fantastic debuff against most enemies (though\n\t\t\tspellcasters who don&#8217;t rely on attack rolls can largely ignore it). If you\n\t\t\thit an enemy with an unarmed strike, you can activate Hand of Harm to deal\n\t\t\tbonus damage and make the target poisoned, then, while they&#8217;re at\n\t\t\tDisadvantage on Ability Checks due to being Poisoned, you can Shove them\n\t\t\tprone and\/or grapple them, then make any remaining attacks at Advantage.\n\t\t\tIf they&#8217;re Grappled, they&#8217;ll have a hard time escaping (Disadvantage\n\t\t\tthanks to Poisoned), so you&#8217;re likely to keep them on the ground until\n\t\t\tyour next turn when you can drop a full Flurry of Blows on them at\n\t\t\tAdvantage and if they don&#8217;t die you can always hit them with Hand of Harm\n\t\t\tagain to keep them Poisoned.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Healing and Harm<\/span>: This\n\t\tdramatically reduces the rate at which you spend Ki to activate Hand of Harm\n\t\tand Hand of Healing. You still need to spend 1 Ki Point to use Flurry of\n\t\tBlows, but after that you can use Hand of Harm\/Healing for free. You could\n\t\theal twice in one turn, heal once and attack (and hopefully use Hand of\n\t\tHarm), or attack once to see what happens, then decide to either heal or\n\t\tattempt another attack.\n\t\t<p>The wording around how Hand of Healing works here is somewhat clumsy. It\n\t\t\tspecifies that you can use Hand of Healing with Flurry of Blows and\n\t\t\treplace both attacks without spending Ki. You could already replace one,\n\t\t\tbut the text is trying to say that you can now replace both attacks, but\n\t\t\tyou still don&#8217;t need to spend additional Ki to do so.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Using Hand of Healing twice during a Flurry of Blows doubles your ability\n\t\t\tto output healing. Weirdly, this also means that rather than spending an\n\t\t\tAction to use Hand of Healing outside of combat it&#8217;s more efficient to\n\t\t\tpunch the air or attack the darkness, then follow with a Flurry of Blows\n\t\t\tand punch yourself and your party until everyone feels better. You get\n\t\t\ttwice as much healing per Ki Point by doing this.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hand of Ultimate Mercy<\/span>: Have a dead party\n\t\tmember? Take a Short Rest to get your Ki Points back if you need to, then\n\t\tpunch them back to life. You only need 5 Ki Points to use this and you get\n\t\t17 per Short or Long Rest at this level so if someone goes down you likely\n\t\tstill have a bunch to spend.\n\t\t<p>The fact that this only takes an Action is pretty astounding. It&#8217;s\n\t\t\tsimilar to Revivify, but lacks an expensive cost. You could absolutely use\n\t\t\tthis in combat, and in many cases that&#8217;s a good idea. This doesn&#8217;t have\n\t\t\tthe specific text around how mortal wounds or missing limbs are handled,\n\t\t\tbut I assume it works like Raise Dead in most respects. The target notably\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t need to be willing to return to life, either, which raises some interesting ethical questions.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The one serious limitation on this is that you can only use it once per\n\t\t\tLong Rest. But, with a 24-hour window in which it will function after the target\u2019s death, if you\n\t\t\tneed to raise two people you can raise one, take a long rest, and raise\n\t\t\tthe other and still have a ton of time to mess around before you get\n\t\t\tanywhere near the 24-hour timer. Of course, if you have three dead allies\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll want to go find a cleric.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"way-of-mercy-ability-scores\">Way of Mercy Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: A dump stat unless you plan on using some form of Grapple\/Shove <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Controls attacks and AC since you can\u2019t wear armor if you want most features to work.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Con<\/span>: We\u2019d love more, but we\u2019re too MAD as it is.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: This powers some class and subclass features<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Standard Array<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"way-of-mercy-races\">Way of Mercy Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>MMoM Bugbear has a fascinating interaction. Ordinarily, you would need to be adjacent to both your target and a party member at some point to be able to attack and flurry Hands of Healing in the same turn.

Then, on future turns (especially once you hit level 11), you bonk something twice with your Wisdom and heal someone (eventually twice) with Flurry, also using Wisdom. It means if you do ever have to spend a turn not healing someone, your Martial Arts and Hand of Harm will suffer because your unarmed attack is always going to be Dex-based.

If you don\u2019t have an easy way to get advantage, take <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/crusher-piercer-slasher\/\">Slasher<\/a> instead, shift the dex increase down to level 8 and everything else one step later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This example build will assume you don\u2019t have an easy source of advantage because flanking is an optional rule (though more of my groups have used it than not).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Unarmored Defense<br><br>Martial Arts<\/td><td>At this level we\u2019re basically just a monk, but one that can use a longbow. Seeing as longbow DPR is 5 whereas a quarterstaff bonk and martial arts bonus action is only 8, and seeing as we only have 11 hitpoints and an AC of 16, we should stay away from melee for now.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Ki<br><br>Dedicated Weapon<br><br>Unarmored Movement<\/td><td>We now pick our whip as a dedicated weapon, allowing us to attack with it and trigger Flurry of Blows if we want to do a bunch of damage in a turn. We only get 2 ki per short rest at this level, so think carefully about where you want to spend them. Remember that we have reach if we\u2019re only attacking with the whip in a turn, so we don\u2019t need to get into range unless we want the burst damage. With this also being the level you get faster, we\u2019ll be able to kite most enemies if you want to go that route.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Implements of Mercy<br><br>Hand of Healing<br><br>Hand of Harm<br><br>Deflect Missiles<\/td><td>Implements of Mercy is nice to make healing potions in downtime and give us some extra skills to use our high wisdom.<br><br>Hand of Healing is the big thing here though. Getting to spend a ki point to Healing Word and punch somebody is really good. Like I said above, we should never do this as an Action and just always use it as part of Flurry.<br><br>If you instead really want something to die <em>right now<\/em>, you could attack, flurry, and drop a Hand of Harm for an average of 22 damage. That burns through 2 of our 3 ki per rest in one turn, but it\u2019s a lot of damage at this level.<br><br>Deflect Missiles is also present.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/crusher-piercer-slasher\/\">Slasher <\/a>(Dex)<br><br>Slow Fall<\/td><td>Slasher is the rude present we deliver when we whip something scary from 10 feet away and then run 30 more feet to something much less scary that you can Flurry down in one turn. We\u2019re still no Defender by any means, but we can absolutely help our battlefield controller by making something less mobile.<br><br>If you\u2019re instead taking Elven Accuracy at this level, absolutely heal when needed, but try to save a ki point or two for when you crit. At next level we get Extra Attack which, combined with Flurry and Elven Accuracy, gives us a 46% chance to crit on a given turn. When you do, apply Hand of Harm for double damage dice.<br><br>Slow Fall is also present.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br><br>Stunning Strike<br><br>Martial Arts die d4 -&gt; d6<\/td><td>This is a big level for us, bigger even than most martials. Not only do we get Extra Attack, but our damage die goes up a step, which we can conceivably roll <em>five times<\/em> in a turn.<br><br>Stunning Strike is incredible in a fight against something you don\u2019t expect to have great Con saves. The fact that Stunned provides Advantage to attackers is almost good enough for me to recommend Elven Accuracy anyway, but, since Con saves are statistically the highest starting at CR 2 and continuing for the rest of the game, it\u2019s a hard sell to base an entire build off of it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Ki-Empowered Strikes<br><br>Physician\u2019s Touch<\/td><td>Our hands will enjoy being magical weapons going forward.<br><br>The real boon here is Physician\u2019s Touch. We talked about it at length above and covered it pretty well, so I\u2019ll just remind you that we can whip the big scary thing at range to apply the Slasher debuff, walk 30 feet, whip something once and Flurry it once for damage, then walk another 15 feet to our wounded party member and heal them and remove Stunned on them all in one turn. Physician\u2019s Touch is notably one of the only ways in 5e to remove the Stunned condition.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Evasion<br><br>Stillness of Mind<\/td><td>Neither of these contribute to our tactics, but they\u2019re nice defenses.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Dex 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>Cap Dex for the best possible attack rolls and an AC matching full plate.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Unarmored Movement Improvement<\/td><td>Remember <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CuiCkfddORU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prince of Persia: Two Thrones<\/a> where you could wall run for 20 feet before jumping off and grabbing a crossbar with your whipsword and flying forward? Yeah. We can do that now.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Purity of Body<\/td><td>Now we\u2019re immune to the disease we\u2019ve been able to cure ourselves of with an action since 6th level anyway.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Flurry of Healing and Harm<br><br>Martial Arts die d6 -&gt; d8<\/td><td>Whew what another great level. Spend one ki point to unstun\/stand up from dying two people in one turn. Or be more efficient with your Ki when you\u2019re doing Hand of Harm for damage. We can still only do that ability once per turn, but now we can afford to be a little more liberal in our usage of Stunning Strike to aim to give ourselves advantage before we do.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Wisdom 16 -&gt; 18<\/td><td>Up that AC. Also the DC of our Stunning Strike and our bonus for Hands of Healing and Harm.<br><br>Those put together let us stay safe and put out the hurt when we\u2019re spoilin for a fight.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/td><td>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PEZWYXPvmS8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all important question<\/a> when we hit level 13 as a Monk.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Diamond Soul<\/td><td>This is one of the best defensive features in the game. Remember that both halves of the ability don\u2019t specify what kinds of saves, which means they apply to Death Saves too. Hang out near a Paladin with a Charisma of 18 and we can\u2019t fail on anything but a 1.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Timeless Body<\/td><td>Similarly to level 13, this doesn\u2019t affect a character at all except in rare cases when someone is trying to siege us all by ourselves.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Wisdom 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>We cap our Wisdom. We now match a character in full plate with a shield and your Stunning Strike DC is as high as a full caster\u2019s spells are without magic items. You also have 16 ki points per rest by now so you should probably just try to stun things every round.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Hand of Ultimate Mercy<br><br>Martial Arts die d8 -&gt; d10<\/td><td>This is like that scene from Dr. Strange except in reverse where we punch the soul back into people.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Empty Body<\/td><td>Since this isn\u2019t the spell Invisibility but the condition, it won\u2019t break on attacks. We can\u2019t use this every fight with it costing 4 ki, but we can probably use it every other fight and still have all the ki we need to do the rest of our tricks.&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Gift of the Metallic Dragon<\/td><td>Finally, a reaction that helps our party instead of just us. It can also help us, but that\u2019s not really the point of the build. We also get a free Cure Wounds in case you\u2019ve lost all your d4s but have a d8 laying around.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Perfect Self<\/td><td>Say, you know what costs 4 ki? Empty Body. If a fight starts you weren\u2019t prepared for, just go invisible and be a d10-damage and move-speed-penalty dispensing annoyance.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Way of Mercy Monk Handbook Introduction Coming to the game from Tasha\u2019s as something of an unarmored DPS paladin, Way of Mercy is one of only two blue-rated Monk subclasses on the site for its incredible utility and versatility.
