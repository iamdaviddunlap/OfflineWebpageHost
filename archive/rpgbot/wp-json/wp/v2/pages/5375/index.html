Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Wizard Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: d6 hit points leaves you pretty\n\tsquishy, but you have a laundry list of defensive options to put in front of\n\tyour hit points. Because Transmuters spend a lot of time in melee while\n\tpolymorphed, you will need to spend some resources to address this issue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Your lack of base attack\n\tbonus hurts when you polymorph, so you become very dependent on your\n\tStrength\/Dexterity. You won&#8217;t lose additional attacks because BAB does not\n\tprovide extra attacks with natural weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Your only good save is Will, but\n\tbecause Wizards only &#8220;need&#8221; one ability, you can afford to invest some of your\n\tability score points in Dexterity and Constitution.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Wizards get very little in the\n\tway of proficiencies, but beyond very early levels you won&#8217;t need them. A\n\tlight crossbow is an excellent backup weapon for a Wizard, but stay away from\n\tBows unless you put points into Strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Wizards only get 2+ skills, but you\n\tget <em>every<\/em> knowledge skill as a class skill, and your high\n\tintelligence will give you plenty of skill points to throw around. Remember\n\tthat permanently increasing your intelligence will give you additional skill\n\tpoints retroactively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Bond<\/span> (Ex or Sp): You have the option\n\tof a familiar or a bonded item, and both options have their merits. Keep in\n\tmind that you can&#8217;t use hand-held items while polymorphed because they meld\n\tinto your form, but your other items continue to function normally while\n\tpolymorphed.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Familiar<\/span>: Always a solid choice, the\n\t\tfamiliar is an ever-present and ever-useful companion. Familiars can serve\n\t\tas scouts, assassins, couriers, assistants, and even meat shields in a\n\t\tpinch. Their passive bonuses to the wizard are roughly equal to a feat, and\n\t\tthe provide the benefits of Alertness when they are adjacent. Effectively, a\n\t\tfamiliar gives you two feats and a cool pet. Remember that you can use\n\t\tspells with a target of &#8220;You&#8221; on your familiar, which includes Polymorph\n\t\tspells. Polymorph your familiar into something useful and throw it around in\n\t\tcombat. Don&#8217;t forget that your familiar probably gets Weapon Finesse for\n\t\tfree, which they can continue to use while polymorphed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">amulet<\/span>: Jewelry is nice an safe. It\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t take up a hand, it&#8217;s hard to take from you in combat, and it&#8217;s a\n\t\tgood option for enchanting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">ring<\/span>: The ring is really the gold standard\n\t\tof bonded items. It&#8217;s incredibly small, it&#8217;s easy to hide under a glove or\n\t\ton your person, it&#8217;s a very difficult target for sundering, and you can\n\t\tenchant is as per Enchant Ring without the feat. Magic rings have a lot of\n\t\tgreat options, but Enchant Ring is rarely worth the feat, so this gives you\n\t\tsome options to save some money.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">staff<\/span>: You generally can&#8217;t use it while\n\t\tpolymorphed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">wand<\/span>: You generally can&#8217;t use it while\n\t\tpolymorphed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">weapon<\/span>: You generally can&#8217;t use it while\n\t\tpolymorphed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane School<\/span>: You picked Transmutation. For\n\tinformation on other schools, see the\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/schools\">Wizard School Breakdown<\/a>\n\tFor information on the Transmutation school specifically, see below.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cantrips<\/span>: Cantrips are amazing at every\n\tlevel. Prestidigitation is often called &#8220;minor wish&#8221;, and Detect Magic will\n\tnever stop being helpful. At low levels, Acid Splash provides easy, realiable\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Scribe Scroll<\/span>: Scrolls are great for\n\twizards, and giving you the feat for free is nice. Use it to prepare scrolls\n\tof spells that you need infrequently so that you can cover all of your\n\tbases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: 4 extra feats over the course\n\tof 20 levels isn&#8217;t game-breaking, but the Wizard would still be king if he\n\tdidn&#8217;t get any of these. The addition of\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateMagic\/spellcastingClassOptions\/wizard.html#_arcane-discoveries\">Arcane Discoveries<\/a>\n\tgives wizards a handful of unique and incredibly powerful options in place of\n\tmetamagic and item crafting feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: You have the best spell list in the\n\tgame, and every new book makes it better. Spells are why you play a wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transmutation-school\">Transmutation School<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Physical Enhancement<\/span> (Su): The bonus is\n\tcertainly nice, and it greatly reduces the amount of money you need to spend\n\ton a belt. I would recommend constitution since your hit points are terrible,\n\tand transmuters spend a lot of time pretending to be a melee monster.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Telekinetic Fist<\/span> (Sp): Not spectacular\n\tcompared to similar school powers, but it&#8217;s bludgeoning damage so you don&#8217;t\n\thave to worry about energy resistance. It also provides you with a combat\n\toption at low levels before you can Polymorph.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Change Shape<\/span> (Sp): Some extra free\n\tshapeshifting. The duration is pretty short, so you&#8217;ll probably want to save\n\tthis for moving about as something with a special movement type, like flying\n\tacross a chasm or digging through the wall of a tunnel.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enhancement School<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The Enhancement subschool suffers from duration issues. The buffs are too\n\tmediocre to justify their unbearably short durations.<\/p>\n<p>Replacement Powers: Telekinetic Fist and Change Shape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Augment<\/span> (Sp): The duration is pretty short\n\tuntil very high levels, but it can be nice to buff the fighter before you jump\n\tinto combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Perfection of Self<\/span> (Su): Sometimes you need\n\tto do a shit load of damage in one round. At those times, buff your strength a\n\twhole bunch and stomp on someone. This couples well with Polymorphing into\n\tsomething with Pounce.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"rating-green\">Shapechange School<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The Shapechange subschool trades your low level attack option for the ability\n\tto gain additional natural attacks. This can be fantastic at high levels when\n\tyou can Polymorph, but it leaves you with very limited options until level\n\t5.<\/p>\n<p>Replaced Power: Telekinetic Fist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Battleshaping (Su)<\/span>: The real benefit here\n\tis using it while shapeshifted. Turn into a Dire Tiger and get a gore attack.\n\tLosing telekinetic fist hurts at low levels, especially due to your limited\n\tcombat options at low level, but this can do some great things for you once\n\tyou can Polymorph.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"opposing-schools\">Opposing Schools<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Abjuration<\/span>: You will need the Abjuration\n\t\tschool&#8217;s defensive buffs.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Conjuration<\/span>: Conjuration is one of the best\n\t\tschools. In addition to summoning effects, it includes teleportation\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divination<\/span>: Divination includes a huge\n\t\tnumber of utility spells like Detect Magic and Scry.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enchantment<\/span>: In addition to some of the\n\t\tbest save-or-suck spells in the game, the Enchantment school provides lots\n\t\tof good utility and buff spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evocation<\/span>: When you need damage, turn into\n\t\ta tiger and go crazy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Illusion<\/span>: Illusions are fun and can do a\n\t\tlot of creative things, but they don&#8217;t really provide a lot of utility.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Necromancy<\/span>: Necromancy has very little\n\t\tthat we need. You don&#8217;t need corpses to make minions, and it doesn&#8217;t provide\n\t\ta lot of useful buffs, with the exception of False Life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because Polymorph augments your existing abilities instead of replacing them, it is very important to strike a balance between Intelligence and your physical ability scores. Your scores don&#8217;t need to be insanely high like a Fighter or a Rogue because they will be augmented, but every point helps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: Most Polymorph forms depend on\n\t\tStrength for attacks, damage, and combat maneuvers.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Important for saves, and for AC.\n\t\tBecause you will be a big scary target while Polymorphed, you need as much\n\t\tAC as you can get.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Your hit points are garbage, and\n\t\tfortitude saves will be a problem for you. Being Polymorphed gives you\n\t\tadditional constitution, but if you fall out of Polymorph and your\n\t\tconstitution drops, you may die due to the sudden loss of maximum hit\n\t\tpoints, much in the same way raging Barbarians do.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: You get magic, skills, and a bonus to\n\t\tknowledge skills (which you will have a ton of). Because you need physical\n\t\tability scores you don&#8217;t need to maximize this, but it should probably still\n\t\tbe your highest ability score at start so that you can get all of your new\n\t\tspell levels as soon as possible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: You get high will saves, and more\n\t\tis nice, but you have too many other important abilities to heavily invest\n\t\tin Wisdom.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: dump to 7 and keep your mouth shut\n\t\tuntil its time to throw some spells around.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike most Wizards, Transmuters lose quite a bit by being middle-aged. Polymorph is a young person&#8217;s game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Intelligence are nice, but not strictly necessary. Improved saves, bonus physical stats, and defensive abilities are helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Dwarves are a surprisingly good\n\tchoice for Transmuters. Bonus Constitution and Wisdom make them very durable,\n\tand a +2 on saves against spells is fantastic. Darkvision is always helpful,\n\tbut you lose it when you Polymorph.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: Bonus intelligence is great, and the\n\tbonus to dexterity and penalty to constitution are roughly equal for our\n\tpurposes. The +2 bonus to penetrate spell resistance won&#8217;t come up much since\n\tPolymorph doesn&#8217;t deal with Spell Resistance. The other benefits are highly\n\tsituational, but certainly welcome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: The bonus to Constitution is nice, but\n\tthe penalty to strength will hurt your damage. The other racial bonuses do\n\tbasically nothing for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus goes\n\tright into Intelligence, but that&#8217;s really all you get. You won&#8217;t be\n\tmulticlassing, and skill focus won&#8217;t really matter to you. Some of the\n\tHalf-Elf&#8217;s alternate racial traits help a bit, but they don&#8217;t offer anything\n\tparticularly helpful for a Wizard. Humans are strictly better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The only thing you really get is\n\tthe flexible ability bonus. Half-Elves are better, and Humans are better than\n\tHalf-Elves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Bonus to dexterity helps with a\n\tbad save, and the +1 racial bonus to all saves is nice, but the strength\n\tpenalty hurts your damage. You don&#8217;t get anything from the other racial\n\tabilities, but Halfling isn&#8217;t totally awful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: The flexible ability bonus can go in\n\tany of your physical ability scores, but I recommend Strength. Your bonus feat\n\tcan be used for a lot, but I would recommend Toughness so that you have lots\n\tof hit points even at first level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (Combat): Trait bonuses to\n\t\tattacks are hard to find, and stack with basically everything else. You may\n\t\tspend a lot of time by yourself Polymorphed in melee, which will get you a\n\t\tlot of use out of this. It also helps while charging, which makes Pounce\n\t\tforms very scary.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): Your saves need the\n\t\thelp, and many large forms will penalize your dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dirty Fighter<\/span> (Combat): One point of\n\t\textra damage isn&#8217;t going to get you anything special, and you can&#8217;t gurantee\n\t\tto bring this into play.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): Going first is\n\t\talways an advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reckless<\/span> (Combat): Because you are going\n\t\tto be in melee, Acrobatics can be very useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient<\/span> (Combat): Your saves need the\n\t\thelp.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tactician<\/span> (Combat): A small bonus to\n\t\tinitiative, but you won&#8217;t be making a lot of attacks of opportunity in a\n\t\tday.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blessed<\/span> (Faith): Too hard to time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">History of Heresy<\/span> (Faith): Divine spells\n\t\tare half of all spells, but a +1 situational bonus isn&#8217;t great.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indomitable Faith<\/span> (Faith): Will saves\n\t\tare your best save, but better saves never hurt.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Temper<\/span> (Magic): Initiative bonuses\n\t\tare great, and bonuses to Concentration are hard to find. If you need to\n\t\tcast spells while you&#8217;re in combat, this can be very helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Desperate Resolve<\/span> (Magic): Only better\n\t\tthan Arcane Temper in very rare situations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Focused Mind<\/span> (Magic): Bonuses to\n\t\tConcentration checks are hard to find, and a +2 bonus is a big\n\t\tdifference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magical Lineage<\/span> (Magic): You don&#8217;t have any\n\t\tone spell which you will be depending on, which makes this difficult to\n\t\tuse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pragmatic Activator<\/span> (Magic): UMD is\n\t\tgreat, but your Intelligence isn&#8217;t as high as it is for a typical Wizard, so\n\t\tthis won&#8217;t help you very much.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shrouded Casting<\/span> (Magic): Pick\n\t\tTransmutation and save yourself a feat. Or you can just buy a spell\n\t\tcomponent pouch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tenacious Shifting<\/span> (Magic): 2 additional\n\t\trounds may not seem like a lot, but this is a significant increase for\n\t\tspells with duration measured in rounds per caster level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Life of Toil<\/span> (Social): Your saves need\n\t\tthe help.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Seeker<\/span> (Social): Perception is always\n\t\tgood.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warrior of Old<\/span> (Elf Racial): +2\n\t\tinitiative, and doesn&#8217;t take up a more versatile trait category.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elven Reflexes<\/span> (Half-Elf Racial): +2\n\t\tinitiative, and doesn&#8217;t take up a more versatile trait category.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Between traits and our 2+int skill ranks, we have lots of fantastic options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Appraise<\/span> (Int): Potentially worth a rank\n\t\tto appraise gems, but anything really worth appraising will require\n\t\tSpellcraft.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): You will want a few ranks here\n\t\tfor when you are flying constantly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Arcana)<\/span> (Int): Identify\n\t\tconstructs, dragons, and magical beats.

Keep in mind that any armor you wear will be absorbed when you\n\t\tpolymorph, and you lose the armor bonus to AC.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Craft Rod<\/span>: There are several excellent\n\t\toptions for rods, but since you can&#8217;t pull them out while polymorphed, they\n\t\tare hard for you to use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Craft Staff<\/span>: While staves are very\n\t\tpowerful, they are also limited in utility. You also can&#8217;t use them while\n\t\tpolymorphed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Craft Wand<\/span>: Wands are cheap enough that\n\t\tspending a feat on them is rarely worth the expense. You also can&#8217;t use them\n\t\twhile polymorphed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Craft Wondrous Item<\/span>: Wondrous Items are\n\t\tmost of the items in the game, and literally everyone uses them. Save the\n\t\tparty a huge chunk of gold.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Forge Ring<\/span>: Rings are very powerful and\n\t\tvery exoensive. Everyone can have two, which stretches this feats\n\t\tusefulness. It&#8217;s still not as good as Craft Wondrous Items, but it&#8217;s a close\n\t\tsecond.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scribe Scroll<\/span>: You get it for free, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s fantastic.

The +4 spell level hurts, but it gets you a second spell per\n\t\tturn. It is also hard to find spells which you can cast while polymorphed\n\t\twithout also using Silent and\/or Still spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Reach Spell<\/span>: You are not an Evoker.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rime Spell<\/span>: You are not an Evoker.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Selective Spell<\/span>: None of your spells are\n\t\tAOEs.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sickening Spell<\/span>: You are not an Evoker.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Silent Spell<\/span>: When you are Polymorphed,\n\t\tyou typically can&#8217;t speak to cast spells. Until high levels when you can use\n\t\tForm of the Dragon, this is key for casting spells while polymorphed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Still Spell<\/span>: Some Polymorph forms may\n\t\thave the body parts needed to perform Somatic components (Apes, etc.), but\n\t\tthese are generally not the best forms available.

If you really need a spell from an opposition school, two spell slots\n\t\tis likely worth less than a feat slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Split Slot<\/span>: Since so many of enchantment\n\t\tspells are going to be save-or suck, your high level spell slots are likely\n\t\tmore productive.

Time to go to work! Beast Shape I lets you turn into a Deinonychus and murder things. Without the Beast Shape bonuses, you should have a total of around 41 hit points (not bad at all), which is enough to keep you in the fight for a while. Mage Armor should still work while Polymorphed, and coupled with dodge your dino form should have 19 AC (not counting items or other spells like Shield and Protection from Evil), and your saves are fortitude +5, Reflex +6, and Will +6 (before items and racial bonus against spells). Aside from your low AC, you&#8217;re fairly durable. Your damage is respectable, and Power Attack adds a couple points.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you don&#8217;t get pounce yet, but once you&#8217;re in reach you get 5 attacks. If you have someone handy to cast Magic Fang, you will get a ton of extra damage out of it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Multimorph is difficult to use at this level because the duration of our spells is so short, but it&#8217;s great for changing into a bird and flying away when combat takes a turn for the worse.
