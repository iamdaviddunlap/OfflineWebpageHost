Sorcerers and warlocks are most likely to benefit from the skills, while other spellcasters (except the wizard) will benefit more from the spell list. Paladins might benefit from both, but get access to new spells slow enough that they&#8217;re not especially helpful.

Counterspell can be very powerful, but very few classes have it on their spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Divination is a great divination spell, provided that your DM is willing to predict the future a little bit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 5<\/span>: Only situationally useful because humanoids make up a relatively small portion of the enemies you will face at this level.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"rating-green\">Boros Legionnaire<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Boros caters to martial casters, offering both defensive buffs and attack options. The skill proficiencies strongly resemble the Soldier background, which fits the theme well. Thematically this is all great, but there is no character who will enjoy every benefit of the background. Instead, you&#8217;ll likely pick Boros Legionnaire for a subset of the options offered. Even with only partial options, you may still find a lot to enjoy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificers will enjoy the spell list, which includes mostly new options for them. Bards will enjoy the meaningful attack options and the buffs from the Cleric spell list. Clerics will enjoy new offensive options, including tings like Blinding Smite which offer a passable reason for clerics to own a weapon. Druids will enjoy the whole spell list since it&#8217;s almost entirely new options, but will find the skills largely useless. Sorcerers and Warlocks will enjoy proficiency in Intimidate and many of the spells, though many of Boros&#8217;s spells are already on their spell list. Wizards get a handful of cleric spells and two skills that they can&#8217;t use effectively, making Boros a difficult choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For arcane tricksters, eldritch knights, paladins, and rangers, the spells offer some interesting options that may be difficult to use. Because so many of the spells are attack options, getting them slower than full casters will frequently mean that they&#8217;re obsolete by the time that you can cast them, which is a shame because those classes feel the most thematically appropriate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Thematically this makes a lot of sense, but in optimization terms it really only works for paladins and purple dragon knight fighters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spell List:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"0\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrips<\/span>: Two of the best offensive cantrips in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1<\/span>: Excellent options, especially at low level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Aid is a spectacular but easily-overlooked spell.

In a typical dungeon fantasy game that means a Scout. Dimir gives you skills and spells to sneak in and out of places undetected, ideally intending to collect information, but sometimes things get stabby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious beneficiaries are spellcasters than can manage to invest in both Dexterity and Charisma to support Stealth and Charisma-based skill like Deception. Bards, sorcerers, and warlocks make natural choices. Trickery clerics might also find some useful things here, but it&#8217;s a difficult build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rogues, especially arcane tricksters, make sense here, but they already get most of the spells on the Dimir spell list, and Dimir Operative doesn&#8217;t change the school restrictions on which spells the Arcane Trickster can learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Perfect skills for a spy, but you&#8217;ll need to invest in both Dexterity and Charisma to make them both work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spell List:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"0\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Cantrips<\/span>: Encode Thoughts is a hard spell to use most of the time, but in a game where you&#8217;re actually spying on people it may be useful.

The proficiencies include good options like Nature and a language, but also Survival (notoriously difficult to use) and Poisoner&#8217;s Kit (poison is weak for players). The spells are almost exactly half options that we rate <span class=\"rating-red\">red<\/span> and half that we rate <span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The skills and spells are drawn primarily from the druid and ranger spell lists, offering some of that flavor for other spellcaster classes. Bards, sorcerers, and warlocks will struggle to make any of the skill proficiencies useful, but artificers, clerics, and wizards should find some use from the skills and will certainly enjoy the spell list. Partial casters like arcane tricksters will likely find that their spells are obsolete or difficult to use by the time that they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Nature is a good knowledge skill, but Survival is notoriously very difficult to use. Poisoner&#8217;s Kits are also difficult because poison is such a weak option for players, and a language won&#8217;t be much use to a background clearly catering to Int\/Wis builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spell List:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"0\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Cantrips<\/span>: Dancing lights is a decent utility, but Spare the Dying is borderline useless since Healer&#8217;s Kits can do the same thing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 1<\/span>: Entangle is good area control, but Ray of Sickness is horrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 2<\/span>: Protection from Poison is a useful defense at any level, and Spider Climb is a good cheep alternative to flight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 3<\/span>: Both spells are good, but they&#8217;re also great ways to get yourself into trouble, so use them responsibly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Giant Insect is basically a summon spell, and a really good one at that, but you may need to keep a collection of bugs on your person to make it viable, and I just can&#8217;t bring myself to do that.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 5<\/span>: A weird combination.
