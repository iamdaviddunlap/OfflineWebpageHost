The improvements allow you to <em>dramatically <\/em>lean into the role of a Defender using magic that isn\u2019t just a Paladin while still also doing huge piles of damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This will still feel very much like a Fighter with spells bolted on as compared to a Bladesinger but a) Bladesinger isn\u2019t in this book\/edition and b) the spells feel like a core design principle rather than just being an afterthought. The changes to the base Fighter class interact with it in great ways to open up a lot of opportunity for tactical brilliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>There are many interesting ways those abilities interact that allow you to take this subclass in wildly different directions. I&#8217;m going to call them out in the Features section, but don&#8217;t be surprised when the example build sticks to something a little more normal. I&#8217;m just a sucker for the classics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also enjoy our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/fighter\/fighter-subclasses\/eldritch-knight\/spells\/\">2024 Eldritch Knight Fighter Spells Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

You&#8217;ll\n\t\tknow very few spells and have very few spell slots, so you need to be\n\t\tabsolutely certain that any given spell is worth the space.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Be sure to pick up an offensive cantrip like Booming Blade which you can\n\t\t\tuse alongside weapon attacks with War Magic. True Strike looks appealing\n\t\t\ton its face, but Intelligence-based attacks are a harder prospect since\n\t\t\tyour Intelligence will lag behind your Strength or Dexterity.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The text explicitly calls of the Eldritch Knight&#8217;s spells &#8220;Wizard\n\t\t\tSpells&#8221;, which means that Wizard features and Eldritch Knight features work\n\t\t\twell together when multiclassing.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Bond<\/span>: Very cool, but it rarely\n\t\thas any mechanical impact unless you plan to throw your weapon(s) or want to\n\t\tappear unarmed somewhere. Casting spells like Light or Darkness on your\n\t\tbonded weapon before throwing it means that you can place the spell effect\n\t\tat greater range and recall the weapon in order to throw it again. But this\n\t\tcombo is both more work and less effective than most methods for abusing\n\t\tmagical darkness.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can accomplish some odd shenanigans like bonding to oversized weapons\n\t\t\tor even siege weapons in order to freely teleport a massive object to\n\t\t\tyourself, but be cautious about how much your DM will tolerate before they\n\t\t\thave your bonded trebuchet appear in your hand and summarily crush it.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">War Magic<\/span>: A fantastic way to use weapons\n\t\tand spells at the same time. Most spells will rely on your Intelligence to\n\t\tattack, so your best options are Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade because\n\t\tthey rely on weapon attacks.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If Booming Blade and Green-Flame Blade aren&#8217;t available, your next best\n\t\t\tbet may be True Strike to add an on-hit damage boost to a hit with your\n\t\t\tweapon. Your Intelligence is probably going to lag behind your Strength\/Dexterity,\n\t\t\tso try to get Advantage before you attack to make up for the relative loss\n\t\t\tof attack bonus. Using a Vex weapon or knocking your target prone are\n\t\t\tgreat options.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Once you pick up Eldritch Strike, you might switch to a cantrip which\n\t\t\tcalls for a saving throw like Toll the Dead. Whether Toll the Dead will\n\t\t\tdeal more damage than a weapon cantrip will depend on your other build\n\t\t\tchoices.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that this works each time that you take the Attack action. If\n\t\t\tyou use Action Surge, you can use War Magic again. Unfortunately, this\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t work with Haste because Haste places additional limits on the\n\t\t\tadditional Action which it provides.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Strike<\/span>: Since your Intelligence\n\t\tprobably won&#8217;t be as high as that of a real Wizard, save DCs can be a real problem.\n\t\tImposing disadvantage will make your spells considerably more effective.\n\t\tThis can enable some interesting combinations like attacking a bunch of\n\t\tadjacent enemies, then using War Magic to hit them with Acid Splash or Sword\n\t\tBurst, or shooting a bunch of enemies with a bow then hitting them with a\n\t\tfireball on the next turn.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Charge<\/span>: This is as much movement as\n\t\tusing the Dash action for most characters, so, combined with Action Surge,\n\t\tyou get to do almost as much as you could in a complete additional turn (you\n\t\tstill don&#8217;t get a second Bonus Action).<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"18\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved War Magic<\/span>: Level 1 and 2 spells\n\t\twon&#8217;t be great for damage at this level compared to an entire Action worth\n\t\tof attacks, but you can easily use this for buffs like Enlarge\/Reduce,\n\t\tdebuffs like Ray of Sickness, save-or-suck spells like Tasha&#8217;s Hideous\n\t\tLaughter, and area control options like Web.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you&#8217;re making a spell attack, I strongly recommend a Vex weapon to\n\t\t\tmake up for your Intelligence likely not being at 20. If you&#8217;re relying on\n\t\t\ta saving throw, you still want to attack your target(s) first to trigger\n\t\t\tEldritch Strike to debuff their saves.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This doesn&#8217;t conflict with War Magic, so you could trade three attacks to\n\t\t\tcast a Cantrip and a level 1 or level 2 spell in one Action. Once you get\n\t\t\tto level 20 and get your 4th attack, you can make a weapon attack and\n\t\t\tstill cast spells twice in a single Action. Literally no one else gets to\n\t\t\tdo that.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that you&#8217;re still limited to casting one spell with a spell slot\n\t\t\tper turn, so even if you use Action Surge, you won&#8217;t be able to cast\n\t\t\tanother level 1 or level 2 spell with Improved War Magic.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Eldritch Knight Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We must take Artisan, Guard, or Noble for the correct ability score increases.

History, plus three skills from Skilled mean that you can get all of the knowledge skills. If you&#8217;re building around Dexterity, you might take a mix of Intelligence-based skills and Dexterity-based skills.

The section below is in addition to the regular Fighter Handbook section on Feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Fey-Touched: Misty Step is consistently one of the best spells in the game, and grabbing Hex is an easy way to up your damage if you don\u2019t have anything else to Concentrate on. Also, in social situations, you can Hex a random rat from your bag of rats and kill it so you can move the Hex onto a creature at a later time without performing spell components in front of them. This will let you give someone disadvantage on, for instance, Perception (Wisdom) checks to spot you or Wisdom (Insight) to spot the lies your Face is telling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telekinetic: Oh no. If you didn\u2019t pick up a Species like Goliath or Orc that has good uses for your Bonus Action, well\u2026 here we are again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>War Caster: Every piece of this feat is tailor-made for Eldritch Knights. Get it as soon as you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polearm Master: While the Bonus Action bonk is still good, the change to the wording of the attack you get when something enters your reach is <em>devastating<\/em> for the interaction with War Caster. Because it\u2019s not an Opportunity Attack, you can\u2019t replace it with a spell, leaving you dealing a measly 12 damage instead of a ludicrous 53 (at level 17).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Eldritch Knight Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The only thing different from regular Fighters is if you decide to be a Human and abuse access to Magic Initiate, you will need a club or quarterstaff for Shillelagh.

Incidentally, this means you should always save the Booming Blade for the second attack (once we hit level 7 and can do that) in case you can Prone them first and get a better chance to crit with the extra dice. Longbows with Mastery are a good way to kite something you\u2019re afraid of getting into melee with.<br><br>Our other Cantrip is the immediate reaction of everyone who played Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 when asked for a skill check.<br><br>We only get one Healing Word a day right now, so save it for when your real healer drops and needs to be stood back up.<br><br>For gear, choose package B and sell the Scimitar and Shortsword to pick up a Quarterstaff and Shield. We walk out with only 16 AC, but that\u2019s the same as Chainmail.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Action Surge<br><br>Tactical Mind<\/td><td>Remember how I said we were a decent Scout? Now we can push rolls as necessary. This is mathematically better than Expertise until proficiency caps at +6, though of course it comes with a limited resource pool.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Fighter Subclass: <br>Eldritch Knight<br><br>Cantrips:<br>&#8211; Booming Blade<br>&#8211; Sword Burst<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Find Familiar<br>&#8211; Mage Armor<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/practical-guide-to-illusions\/#silent-image\">Silent Image<\/a><br><br>War Bond<\/td><td>Because we\u2019re not strength-based, Mage Armor is actually +1 AC for our entire career. Find Familiar is an incredible spell that you should learn more about using well by checking the Wizard Spell Breakdown. Meanwhile, Silent Image can be used to drop a stone wall with arrow slits in it that will give you Advantage on shooting things that can\u2019t see you through it and not immediately be obvious because, again, arrow slits. It has a bunch of other great uses you should read up on too.<br><br>Booming Blade will be our bread and butter. A quarterstaff works just fine despite the name of the cantrip. Sword Burst is present in case we can hit three or more targets.<br><br>War Bond remains nearly useless, but is nice to have on the rare occasions it matters.<br><br>With our new spell slots we cast Find Familiar once, Mage Armor at the start of the day, and now we have one slot left per day to honestly probably be another Healing Word. You\u2019ll notice I haven\u2019t taken any Reaction spells. This is because we currently don\u2019t have a hand free to cast them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Feat: War Caster<br>(Int 17 -&gt; 18)<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Absorb Elements<br><br>Second Wind Uses 2 -&gt; 3<\/td><td>Conveniently, the quarterstaff we\u2019re always holding is also an arcane focus, so we can now cast anything without an expensive material component even with both hands full. Additionally, Booming Blade is now a viable Reaction when something tries to walk away from you.<br><br>Just in case something tries to target <em>us<\/em>, though, we take the spell that also gets us something when we attack back.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br><br>Tactical Shift<\/td><td>Whack, whack.<br><br>Tactical Shift is a great rider on a feature that got a huge buff in this rules update. Having three per short rest already means we can use this every expected turn in combat if we want to, letting you feasibly Booming Blade someone, hit them again, and then heal up and walk away without provoking an Opportunity Attack, daring them to follow you.<br><br>If you don\u2019t want or need to do that, this is also the level Cantrips improve, so we should check some math.<br><br>Just attacking twice is over 15 DPR. Using Booming Blade instead is roughly 11 if they don\u2019t move, but almost 17 if they do. Against anything that\u2019s melee only, Booming Blade and Tactical Shift away is definitely the way to go.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Feat: Polearm Master<br>(Dex 15 -&gt; 16)<\/td><td><br><br>This gets our AC up to 18, equal to Plate. It also means that any turn we don\u2019t need to reposition and heal we can spend bonking the thing next to us.<br>Unfortunately, while we have enchanted our whole quarterstaff, the wording of PAM means it will still only have a d4 base damage. It will still use our Intelligence and deal Force damage though.<br>You\u2019ll now see another reason I haven\u2019t taken many Reaction spells: we have many ways to use our Reaction already and don\u2019t need more.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211;&nbsp; Earthen Grasp<br><br>Retrain Spell:<br>Absorb Elements &#8211; &gt;See Invisibility<br><br>War Magic<\/td><td>Grasp something tight and lay into it with Advantage on your attack rolls.<br><br>Did you know that Hide grants the Invisible condition in this version of the rules? Did you know that See Invisibility negates the benefits of the Invisible condition? I have no idea if this was intended, but now nothing can ever Hide from you if you have a spell slot to spare.<br><br>War Magic, on the other hand, represents a very nice immediate boost to our DPR. We can now get in a regular swing <em>and<\/em> a Booming Blade, putting our DPR to 18.5 or 22 if they move. Throw in a bonk from PAM and that\u2019s up over 27, approaching High DPR while still being very durable.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>ASI: Int 18 -&gt; 20<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Suggestion<\/td><td>We have full caster save DC to help Suggestion land, and it\u2019s going to get way better in two levels when the target has to roll the save with Disadvantage if you slapped them recently.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Indomitable<br><br>Tactical Master<\/td><td>Rerolling a save with a +9 is already a nearly-guaranteed success and it will only get better as we keep leveling.<br><br>So, quarterstaff has topple. This has been a fun thing we sometimes get to enjoy. But now, our quarterstaff has Push, Sap, and Slow, and we can choose which to use <em>per attack<\/em>. Not per Attack Action. Sap someone with the initial hit, then Booming Blade them and Push them 10 feet away. Now we use Polearm Master&#8217;s Reactive Strike to hit them again when they walk back up, having just taken the secondary Booming Blade damage for doing so, and laugh as they attack with Disadvantage into our Fighter AC.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Eldritch Strike<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>\u2013 Enhance Ability<br><br>Second Wind Uses 3 -&gt; 4<\/td><td>We finally have enough room in our <s>spellbook<\/s> brain for something to help us perform our Scout role better. The extra Second Wind can help salvage something even if you manage to roll poorly twice, and remember it\u2019s not used if you still somehow fail even with Guidance, Advantage, and a d10 on top.<br><br>Also, this is the level we get to start doing things like actually weaving non-cantrip spells into our combat tactics, using things like Suggestion as mentioned earlier or Earthen Grasp to lock down single foes.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Two Extra Attacks<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Darkvision<\/td><td>Darkvision just in case you somehow haven\u2019t solved this human deficit magically by now.<br><br>With four total attacks (including the PAM bonk), we can now apply Topple, Sap, Slow, <em>and <\/em>Push, making things Prone, wrapped in thunder, over there and having a bad day if they do try to attack even if they stand up. DPR assuming the Topple succeeds and they move after standing (optimal conditions) is roughly 62, more than 50% over High DPR. Even under more normal conditions (topple doesn\u2019t work), we\u2019re still at 48.7, solidly over High DPR while being an exceptionally effective Defender.<br><br>This tactic remains High DPR or higher forever.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feats: Sentinel<br>(Dex 16 -&gt; 17)<\/td><td>Did something try to Disengage to get past our thunder Shenanigans? Start up a Multiattack on the Rogue next to us? Poor choice. Hit it with an Earthen Grasp, presumably with Disadvantage on the save thanks to Eldritch Strike. Now they can\u2019t leave and any attacks they were making are at Disadvantage too. Hopefully they already used their action for the turn allowing you to spend your entire next turn (with Action Surge, presumably) dumping half a dozen attacks into them with Advantage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Studied Attacks<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Fireball<br><br>Retrain Spells:<br>&#8211; Darkvision -&gt; Fly<br><br>Indomitable (2 uses)<\/td><td>Fortunately the order we\u2019re applying our Mastery effects in has meant we\u2019re used to not doing Booming Blade as the first attack in a round, despite it being the most exciting. This is good, because we should always save it for either last if we haven\u2019t missed any attacks or for immediately after we miss to take advantage of the\u2026 Advantage from Studied Attacks.<br><br>Then we pick up two third-level spells we\u2019ve been drooling at for since the Wizard could cast them at 5.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Feat: Resilient<br>(Dex 17 -&gt; 18)<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Enemies Abound<\/td><td>With an AC now of 19, suddenly getting +5 on saves against a significant method of dealing damage to us is very nice. It also bumps up all those Scout skills we\u2019re using.<br><br>For spells, smack something and then ask it for an Intelligence save with Disadvantage next round. Enjoy as it starts murdering its allies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Arcane Charge<\/td><td>This doesn\u2019t meaningfully change our tactics, but it\u2019s fun to have. You can now perform the ridiculous topple\/sap\/slow\/push Booming Blade combo on two people and then teleport far enough away that they can\u2019t make it to you even if they stand up.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>ASI: Dexterity 18 -&gt; 20<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Haste<\/td><td>Cap AC at 20, equivalent to +1 Plate and a shield. Scout better while you\u2019re at it.<br><br>Haste, on the other hand, is an incredible boon. AC goes up to 23 and we still get to Boomstick something away from us on the same turn thanks to War Magic.<br><br>On following turns we can Booming Blade a second target because War Magic\u2019s restriction of one Cantrip is per Attack, not per turn. If we can get a second target to avoid stacking Booming Blades (because the rider can only apply once per target), that brings our DPR up right around 85. Tack on an Action Surge to do that to a third target and we end up at 134, well over Dude Stop DPR.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Action Surge (2 uses)<br><br>Indomitable (3 uses)<\/td><td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uNy_MLr8mXA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">More<\/a>.<br><br>Cantrips also improve at this level, though that hardly matters. It\u2019s a 10% DPR boost, but that\u2019s practically irrelevant with how much damage we\u2019re already doing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Improved War Magic<\/td><td>It\u2019s unfortunate that this only works with Level 1 or 2 spells, but means you can hit someone and then Earthen Grasp them as part of the same action (which they save against with Disadvantage) and Action Surge to attack again into a Restrained opponent for automatic Advantage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Epic Boon: Spell Recall<br><br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Greater Invisibility<br><br>Retrain Spell:<br>Earthen Grasp -&gt; Banishment<\/td><td>Our Int improves to 21, not that it does us any good, but every spell we cast now has a 25% chance of not costing a slot.<br><br>We also get a huge upgrade to our single-target save-or-suck.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Three Extra Attacks<\/td><td>Ten total attacks possible in one round including an Opportunity Attack.
