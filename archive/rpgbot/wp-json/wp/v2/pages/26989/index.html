Sneak Attack allows them to do a huge\n\tpile of damage in a single attack, and their pile of skills allows them to\n\teasily handle locks, traps, guards, and many other challenges. While a party\n\tcan function just fine without a Rogue, it&#8217;s hard to compete with the sheer\n\tnumber of important skill and tool proficiencies offered by the Rogue. In a\n\tparty they serve as some combination of Face, Scout, and Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Rogues typically split into melee or ranged builds, though the universal\n\tefficacy of Dexterity makes it easy for many rogues to switch between the two.\n\tMelee Rogues frequently go for two-weapon fighting because it provides a\n\tsecond chance to score Sneak Attack, and hit-and-run tactics enabled by\n\tCunning Action are great way to get into melee to attack before retreating out\n\tof reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#changes-from-5e\">Changes from 5e<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Rogue Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Rogue Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Rogue Lineages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritages\">Rogue Heritages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Rogue Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Rogue Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#talents\">Rogue Talents<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-talents\">Magic and Martial Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Rogue Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Rogue Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Rogue Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Rogue Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-rare\">Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-very-rare\">Very Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-legendary\">Legendary Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Rogue Example Build &#8211; Elaizon Hailsigh, Valiant Six Enforcer Rogue<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineage\">Lineage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#heritage\">Heritage<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#improvements-and-talents\">Improvements and Talents<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

You score criticals hits on a 19 or 20 with the same weapons which can deal Sneak Attack, plus you add an additional weapon damage die on crit. At level 17 you add another extra weapon damage die on crit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keensense. Replaces Blindsense, but it\u2019s only because ToV renames Blindsense to Keensense.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slippery Mind: Gone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Epic Boon: Stroke of Luck.
