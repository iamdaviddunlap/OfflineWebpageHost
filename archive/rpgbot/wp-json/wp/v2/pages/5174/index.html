The Witch&#8217;s core features are very close to the Wizard, and their spellcasting works very similarly, but your choice of Patron Theme allows you to select the spell list of your choice similar to the Sorcerer, and the theme of the class&#8217;s features have a distinctly less scholarly bent. DnD 5e players might justifiably see thematic similarities to 5e&#8217;s warlocks, but the similarities end there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the Wizard, the Witch&#8217;s ability to learn any number of spells from their spell list makes them a magical tool box with a tool for every specific problem one might encounter. Beyond that excellent foundation, the Witch&#8217;s ability to select their own spell list allows them to fill nearly any role in the party by selecting your Patron Theme and spells. Like the Wizard, the Witch&#8217;s high Intelligence gives you a lot of trained skills at 1st level, making it easy to play your party&#8217;s Librarian or to pick up skills to support other skill-based capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond their spellcasting, the Witch is the uncontested master of familiars, and their Focus Spells (called &#8220;Hexes&#8221;) are truly fantastic, and include powerful Hex Cantrips which can often define your character&#8217;s best tactical options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Witch Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Patron Themes<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lessons\">Witch Lessons<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#lessons-basic\">Basic Lessons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lessons-greater\">Greater Lessons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lessons-major\">Major Lessons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores-conventional\">Conventional<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores-melee\">Melee-Friendly<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-skill-feats\">General Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Witch-feats\">Witch Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Witch-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#Witch-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells\">Witch Focus Spells &#8211; Hexes<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#focus-spells-0\">Hex Cantrips<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Witch Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Intelligence is the Witch&#8217;s Key Ability Score, and like any spellcaster it&#8217;s used for your Spell Attacks and for your Spell DCs. Those are two of your most important stats, so keep your Intelligence as high as you can get it. Intelligence also grants you additional Trained skills at 1st level, allowing you to easily invest in numerous skills, including Lore options which other classes often need to ignore in favor of more important skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hit Points<\/span>: 6+Con hit points. Fortunately you\n\thave plenty of room to boost your ability scores so your Constitution bonus\n\tcan compensate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Witch&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are terrible. Your saving throw progression is very slightly\n\tworse than the Wizard&#8217;s, which you make up for by having better weapon\n\tproficiencies which you&#8217;ll almost certainly never use. Like the Wizard, your\n\thigh Intelligence will give you an abundance of Trained skills at first level,\n\tbut that&#8217;s the best part of your proficiencies beyond spellcasting.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perception<\/span>: Trained at 1st level, and it\n\t\tmaxes out at Expert at 11th level. Expect to rely on allies for Perception\n\t\tchecks, and strongly consider Incredible Initiative if you don&#8217;t want to go\n\t\tlate in the turn order in every fight. You might also consider Canny Acumen\n\t\tto boost your Perception proficiency, especially if you take it well before\n\t\t11th level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Only one good saving throw.\n\t\tWill is a great option, but only one good saving throw is still a serious\n\t\thandicap, and it never improves past Master. Your other saving throws will\n\t\tincrease to expert, but no further. You can take the Canny Acumen feat,\n\t\tbut that won&#8217;t get you past Expert until 17th level, so you&#8217;ll spend most of\n\t\tyour career with absolutely dismal saving throws compared to your\n\t\tallies.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: One skill from your Patron, then\n\t\t3+Int additional Trained skills for a total of 4+Int. 4+ is standard, and thanks to\n\t\thigh Intelligence you&#8217;ll start with numerous skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attacks<\/span>: Simple weapons and unarmed\n\t\tattacks. You might make Unarmed Attacks if you take certain Witch Class\n\t\tFeats, but mostly you&#8217;ll rely on spells instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Defenses<\/span>: No armor proficiencies, and your\n\t\tproficiency in Unarmored Defense never increases past Expert. Expect to rely\n\t\ton spells like Mage Armor, and be sure that you have nice sturdy friends to\n\t\thide behind.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spells<\/strong>: Standard progression for every spellcaster with\n\t\tthe exception of the Warpriest Cleric.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Patron<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Patron&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<li>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Familiar<\/span>: Your familiar is a powerful asset\n\tcentral to the Witch&#8217;s class features, and you get plenty of options to make\n\tyour familiar powerful and unique. Witches gain more Familiar Abilities than\n\tmost characters, and you gain a new one for free every few levels. For help\n\twith your familiar, see our\n\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Witch Spellcasting<\/strong>: The Witch&#8217;s spell list is determined by your choice of Patron. Since spellcasting is the Witch&#8217;s primary feature, that&#8217;s a major choice that impacts your character very heavily. Witches also have Focus Spells called Hexes, including Hex Cantrips. The Witch is a prepared caster, so you need to prepare a spell in each of your spell slots during your Daily Preparations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Hexes<\/span>: Hexes are the Witch&#8217;s Focus Spells.\n\t\tThey have a variety of interesting effects, many of which are really\n\t\tpowerful. Notably, many Hexes (including Hex Cantrips) have a 1-minute\n\t\tduration and must be Sustained, making the Cackle Hex a powerful option\n\t\t(though expensive since it is itself a Hex and therefore consumes a Focus\n\t\tPoint) until you can get Effortless Concentration at 16th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Cantrips<\/span>: Hex Cantrips are a Hex so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re still limited to one Hex per round, but they&#8217;re Cantrips so you can\n\t\tuse them without other limitations. Many Hex Cantrips have a 1-Action\n\t\tcasting time, making them a great way to spend an Action before casting a\n\t\t2-Action spell. Hex Cantrips also notably don&#8217;t count against your limit of\n\t\t5 Cantrips prepared or against the 10 Cantrips which your Familiar knows at\n\t\t1st level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Patron Themes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of Patron Theme gives you your spell list, a skill, a Hex Cantrip, and a free 1st-level spell that your familiar knows (remember that you get 5 more of your choice at 1st level). Every one of the skills is taken from Arcana, Nature, Occultism, and Religion, and while Nature and Religion are harder choices because they&#8217;re Wisdom-based, all four skills are still good choices for the Witch since you&#8217;re likely your party&#8217;s Librarian, and unless someone else in the party has better Wisdom you&#8217;re likely to pick up several or all of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spell List is likely your most mechanically impactful decision, because while the Witch is more than just spellcasting your spellcasting is still your defining function in the party. Different spell lists have different strengths, but they&#8217;re all roughly equivalent in power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-curse\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Patrons.aspx?ID=2\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curse<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the closest thing to a &#8220;vanilla&#8221; witch, the Curse Patron Theme grants Evil Eye, a powerful single-target debuff which you can rely on for your whole career. Ray of Enfeeblement isn&#8217;t a great spell, but you also don&#8217;t have to cast it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell List<\/span>: Occult<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Patron Skill<\/span>: Occultism<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Cantrip<\/span>: Evil Eye. See &#8220;Hex Cantrips&#8221;,\n\t\tbelow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Granted Spell<\/span>: Ray of Enfeeblement. This is\n\t\tnot a great spell. The effects are minor, only some enemies will care about\n\t\tthem, and you have to make an attack <em>and<\/em> the target gets a save, so it\n\t\thas a high probability of failure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-fate\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Patrons.aspx?ID=3\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fate<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nudge Fate is basically a better version of Guidance. You should use it as often as possible outside of combat. True Strike is situational, and you likely won&#8217;t use it until you&#8217;ve gained several levels and amassed several more spell slots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell List<\/span>: Occult<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Patron Skill<\/span>: Occultism<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Cantrip<\/span>: Nudge Fate. See &#8220;Hex\n\t\tCantrips&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Granted Spell<\/span>: True Strike. You&#8217;re only\n\t\tgoing to use this with important spells that require attack rolls, and even\n\t\tthen at low levels you can&#8217;t justify spending one of your spell slots on\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-fervor\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Patrons.aspx?ID=4\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fervor<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stoke the Heart is great on a blaster or if you have martial allies who like to make large numbers of attacks, allowing you to be an effective Support character with little further effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell List<\/span>: Divine<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Patron Skill<\/span>: Religion<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hex Cantrip<\/span>: Stoke the Heart. See &#8220;Hex\n\t\tCantrips&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Spell<\/span>: Command. Tactically\n\t\tversatile and easy to use in a variety of situations, and it works on\n\t\ttargets of any level. However, it has the Auditory and Linguistic traits so\n\t\tthe target needs to be able to hear you and understand the language you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing, so you can&#8217;t use it on unintelligent creatures like animals or\n\t\tzombies. Forcing an enemy to move can provoke Reactions from your allies, or\n\t\tcould force enemies who avoid close quarters to move close to you and your\n\t\tallies. Forcing an enemy to drop an item or a weapon can handicap them in\n\t\tcombat, and retrieving it may provoke Reactions or your allies might prepare\n\t\tan action to snatch up the item when it falls. Stand in Place just tells the\n\t\tcreature to spend an action doing nothing, so skip that one in favor of\n\t\tcommanding them to drop prone because they must spend a second Action to\n\t\tstand again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-night\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Patrons.aspx?ID=5\" class=\"rating-orange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Night<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There two other Occult options that both have better Hex Cantrips. Sleep is already on the Occult spell list, and if you like Sleep enough to put a major decision point into it you should look at Lesson of Sleep instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell List<\/span>: Occult<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Patron Skill<\/span>: Occultism<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hex Cantrip<\/span>: Shroud of Night. See &#8220;Hex\n\t\tCantrips&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Spell<\/span>: Sleep.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-rune\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Patrons.aspx?ID=6\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rune<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Witch&#8217;s only Arcane option, this brings you closest to the Wizard of any other Patron Theme, and starts you with some excellent support options. Discern Secrets will boost Recall Knowledge checks which you&#8217;ll likely be making frequently, and Magic Weapon is a spectacular buff if you have martial allies in the party who can benefit from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble deciding between the Witch and the Wizard, this is a great option. If you want to play a witch but don&#8217;t want to deal with using Hex Cantrips in combat, this is a good option too since Discern Secrets is so frequently useful outside out combat. But that&#8217;s not to say that you won&#8217;t be able to use Hexes in combat: you absolutely can. You just aren&#8217;t locked into a Hex Cantrip which is primarily useful in combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell List<\/span>: Arcane<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Patron Skill<\/span>: Arcana<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex Cantrip<\/span>: Discern Secrets. See &#8220;Hex\n\t\tCantrips&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Granted Spell<\/span>: Magic Weapon. A staple\n\t\tbuff for martial characters, the effects will provide a massive damage boost\n\t\tat low levels. However, it doesn&#8217;t scale with spell level so once your\n\t\tallies pick up magic weapons this will stop being useful permanently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-wild\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Patrons.aspx?ID=7\" class=\"rating-orange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wild<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Primal spell list and a thematically-appropriate leveled spell, the Wild Patron Theme closely resembles the Druid. Unfortunately, unless you&#8217;re facing animals and plants almost exclusively, Wilding Word is awful. Winter is a better choice for the same spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell List<\/span>: Primal<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Patron Skill<\/span>: Nature<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hex Cantrip<\/span>: Wilding Word. See &#8220;Hex\n\t\tCantrips&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Granted Spell<\/span>: Your choice of summon\n\t\tanimal or summon plant or fungus. I recommend Summon Animal because it has a\n\t\tmuch larger list of options, but both spells offer options at every spell\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-winter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Patrons.aspx?ID=8\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter offers two useful offensive crowd control effects in Clinging Ice and Gust of Wind, and with the Primal spell list you&#8217;ll resemble the Druid in many ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Spell List<\/span>: Primal<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Patron Skill<\/span>: Nature<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hex Cantrip<\/span>: Clinging Ice. See &#8220;Hex\n\t\tCantrips&#8221;, below.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Granted Spell<\/span>: Gust of Wind. While it&#8217;s\n\t\tnot a great spell at low levels, it&#8217;s a spectacular counter to flying\n\t\tenemies even as a 1st-level spell, so you&#8217;ll get tons of use out of it once\n\t\tflight becomes common.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lessons\">Witch Lessons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Lessons are a collection of benefits which you can get from Class Feats and from &#8220;other effects&#8221;. Generally they give you a Hex and teach your familiar one spell.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lessons-basic\">Basic Lessons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lesson of Dreams<\/span>: Sleep has limited\n\t\tutility in combat until you can cast it at 4th level, but Lesson of Dreams\n\t\tgives you the Veil of Dreams Hex Cantrip which imposes a -2 penalty on saves\n\t\tagainst Sleep effects. That makes sleep a bit more reliable, which makes it\n\t\ta good save-or-suck option. However, it has the Incapacitation tag, so\n\t\trather than using it on single high-level targets, try to use it on groups\n\t\tof low-level targets. If you plan to use this, strongly consider Widen Spell\n\t\tto boost Sleep&#8217;s tiny area of effect, though you&#8217;ll have trouble using Widen\n\t\tSpell and Veil of Dreams with the same casting of Sleep.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lesson of the Elements<\/span>: Elemental\n\t\tBetrayal is a great option for blasters, and the additional spell for your\n\t\tfamiliar offers one of three suitable options and also Air Bubble. I call\n\t\tout Air Bubble because it&#8217;s the only one of the four options which doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tdeal damage, so while it&#8217;s the right element it doesn&#8217;t make any sense to\n\t\tcombine with Elemental Betrayal. Your choice of the other three spell\n\t\toptions largely comes down to personal preference.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lesson of Life<\/span>: This is a hard choice.\n\t\tLife Boost can save a creature&#8217;s life, but it&#8217;s not enough hit points to be\n\t\ta go-to source of healing. Spirit Link is neat, but it consumes your hit\n\t\tpoints to heal the target, and witches only get 6+ hit points per level so\n\t\tyou have very few to spare. This is more appealing if your spell list offers\n\t\tspells to restore your own hit points or if you have some other means of\n\t\teasy hit point restoration, but even then it&#8217;s typically more efficient to\n\t\theal your ally directly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lesson of Protection<\/span>: Blood Ward is easy\n\t\tto use and provides a small but reliable defensive boost, and Mage Armor is\n\t\ta staple defensive option for unarmored spellcasters like the Witch and the\n\t\tWizard.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lesson of Vengeance<\/span>: Needle of Vengeance\n\t\tis really good, and Phantom Pain is decent single-target damage and scales\n\t\twell with spell level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lessons-greater\">Greater Lessons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lesson of Mischief<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\tamusing but situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lesson of Shadow<\/span>: Malicious Shadow is an\n\t\texcellent single-target offensive option and scales very well with level.\n\t\tChilling Darkness is neat, but very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lesson of Snow<\/span>: Personal Blizzard is bad\n\t\tand Wall of Wind is very situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lessons-major\">Major Lessons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lesson of Death<\/span>: Curse of Death is a good\n\t\toffensive option, and while Raise Dead is situational by nature it&#8217;s a\n\t\tstaple spellcasting option and it&#8217;s exclusive to the Divine spell list, so\n\t\tthis makes it accessible to other witches.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lesson of Renewal<\/span>: Restorative Moment is\n\t\ttoo situational and Field of Life is slow, expensive, inefficient\n\t\thealing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Witch&#8217;s ability scores are mostly simple: You need Intelligence for your spells, and you need Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom for your defenses. However, the Witch has some interesting melee options like Living Hair and Eldritch Nails which place more reliance on ability scores to support melee combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores-conventional\">Conventional<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most witches just need Intelligence for spells and enough in other Ability Scores to keep them alive. You might adjust these based on which skills you select, but the suggestions below are a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump. You&#8217;re not carrying heavy\n\tequipment, you&#8217;re not wearing armor, and you shouldn&#8217;t be using weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: AC and Reflex saves. You&#8217;ll eventually\n\twant at least 16, but don&#8217;t bother getting more than 20.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points and Fortitude saving\n\tthrows.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Your Key Ability Score.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wis<\/span>: Perception and Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Probably a dump stat unless you want\n\tto use your numerous skills to play the party&#8217;s Face. Unlike the Wizard, using\n\tyour third Action every turn to Demoralize foes isn&#8217;t a great choice for the\n\tWitch because so many Hex Cantrips have a 1-Action casting time.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores-melee\">Melee-Friendly<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Witch&#8217;s proficiency in simple weapons and Class Feats like Living Hair and Eldritch Claws make melee combat a possibility. However, with no armor proficiencies this is still a very dangerous option that you&#8217;ll need to approach very cautiously. If you go this route, look for ways to boost your AC and your hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you go any further with this option: Strongly reconsider. Give this a real good think. The options built into the Witch <em>do not<\/em> make melee a good idea. If you go this route, it will be hard and you will need to build your witch very carefully in order to be successful. You will likely need a level of insight into the game which goes beyond what I can cram into a single article. You will almost certainly need to consider a number of archetypes and feats not covered in this document. If you do it and it goes well, please <a href=\"mailto:RPGBOT@RPGBOT.net\">email me<\/a> to brag about it because honestly it looks really hard and I would be very impressed. If you try it and it goes poorly, email me anyway because sometimes failure is a good learning opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: While Living Hair has the Finesse\n\ttrait, Eldritch Claws does not, and if you&#8217;re going for a melee build you&#8217;ll\n\tprobably be using Eldritch Claws rather than a Finesse weapon or Living Hair.\n\tHowever, having a higher AC is more important than a good attack bonus, so I\n\tstrongly recommend investing more in Dexterity than in Strength unless you can\n\tmake armor viable and can de-emphasize Dexterity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: AC and Reflex saves. This is\n\tespecially important if you plan to be in melee, but if you can make armor a\n\tviable option you may be able to put less into Dexterity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points and Fortitude saving\n\tthrows.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Your Key Ability Score.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Since you need good stats in every\n\tphysical ability score plus Intelligence, Wisdom will need to be largely\n\tdisregarded.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Unfortunately there&#8217;s no room to make\n\tCharisma a priority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestries\">Ancestries<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>An Intelligence boost is crucial, but since Free Ability Boosts are part of every Ancestry that&#8217;s easy to accomplish. Bonuses to other important ability scores are helpful, but not crucial, so Ancestry Feats are often as important as an Intelligence Increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Catfolk<\/span>: Put the Free ability Boost into\n\tIntelligence and you have all that you need, but none of the Catfolk&#8217;s feats\n\tdirectly support the Witch&#8217;s capabilities. The Cat&#8217;s Luck feat chain will help\n\tyou with saving throws, but that&#8217;s no more applicable to the Witch than to any\n\tother character. Interesting but unhelpful: you could take the Clawed Catfolk\n\tHeritage and the Eldritch Nails Witch Class Feat and have two totally\n\tindependent sets of claws\/nails with mostly identical stats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: The Dwarf&#8217;s Ability Boosts work\n\tgreat if you put the Free Ability Boost into Intelligence, but Dwarf Ancestry\n\tFeats offer very little for the Witch. Strongly consider Adopted Ancestry.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: The Elf&#8217;s Ability Boosts are great,\n\tbut a Constitution Flaw is really problematic, so you may want to use the\n\tAlternate Ability Boosts rule to get two Free Boosts. Seer Elf gets you\n\tDetect Magic for free, and Otherwordly Magic gets you an extra Arcane cantrip\n\t(though it&#8217;s an innate spell so it&#8217;s still Charisma-based), so you can expand\n\tyour cantrip options, but the Gnome can get cantrips from other spell lists,\n\twhich dramatically expands your options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gnome<\/span>: Despite the lack of a fixed\n\tIntelligence increase, the Gnome works surprisingly well if you put your Free\n\tAbility Boost into Intelligence. Gnome Ancestry Feats can get you\n\tautomatically-scaling Lore skills, extra cantrips, and a few other excellent\n\toptions. Two of the Gnome&#8217;s Heritages give you additional cantrips, but since\n\tthey&#8217;re innate spells they&#8217;ll be Charisma-based, so look for utility options\n\trather than offensive ones, especially from spellcasting traditions other than\n\tthe one provided by your Patron Theme.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Goblin<\/span>: With your Free Ability Boost in\n\tIntelligence, the Goblin&#8217;s ability increases look similar to the Gnome&#8217;s. Burn\n\tIt! is a great option for blasters, and you could make good use of Very Sneaky\n\tand Very Very Sneaky, but those don&#8217;t specifically supplement your\n\tcapabilities as a witch so I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re better than what you could\n\tget from Adopted Ancestry.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Kobold<\/span>: Put the Free ability Boost into\n\tIntelligence and you have all that you need, but a Constitution Flaw is always\n\thard, especially on a race with 6 hit points (Elfs and Kobolds share this\n\tdrawback). Strongly consider the\n\t\tAlternate Attribute Boosts rule. The Kobold Breath feat chain offers a fun option for AOE damage\n\tthat works great with the Stoke the Heart Hex Cantrip, but one novel build\n\tpossibility doesn&#8217;t make this a good go-to option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Workable ability boosts, and\n\tHalfling Luck is good on literally every character. Cultural Adaptability can\n\tget you Burn It! from the Goblin Ancestry Feats, too. Unfortunately, none of\n\tthe heritages look especially helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Take the Voluntary Flaws to dump\n\tStrength and Charisma, and you can do +2 to Dex, Con, and Int (or switch Dex\n\tor Con to Wis if you&#8217;d like). There isn&#8217;t anything you need from Versatile\n\tHeritage, so consider other options. If you take Half-Elf you can easily take\n\tmulticlass archetype feats for other spellcasting classes. Adapted Cantrip\n\tlooks tempting, but it&#8217;s only useful for offensive options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orc<\/span>: Strength and Intelligence is a really\n\thard combination for the Witch, but if you use the Optional Flaws rules you\n\tcould dump some stats to get an additional Boost to put into Dexterity or\n\tConstitution. Nearly all of the Orc&#8217;s racial feats are about being strong and\n\thitting stuff, but you could consider the Orc Ferocity feat chain, especially\n\tif you have the Divine spell list and you&#8217;re serving as your party&#8217;s\n\thealer.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ratfolk<\/span>: The ability boosts are perfect,\n\tand while you still only get 6 racial hit points, you don&#8217;t get a Constitution\n\tFlaw like the Elf and the Kobold. Unfortunately, none of the Ratfolk&#8217;s\n\tAncestry Feats cater to the Witch&#8217;s capabilities. Consider Adopted\n\tAncestry or a Versatile Heritage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tengu<\/span>: Two Boosts, 6 hit points, and none of the\n\tfeats cater to the Witch&#8217;s capabilities. There are a few spellcasting options\n\tlike Storm&#8217;s Lash and some limited flight options, but you can solve those\n\tproblems magically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>All that you need from your background is Intelligence, and since every background includes a Free Ability Boost, you can always get the Intelligence boost.

That means that you can maximize at most three skills, and the rest of your skills might not advance beyond Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get Skill Feats at even-numbered levels, giving you a total of 10 Skill Feats (and maybe another from your Background) by 20th level. Generally, you want to invest these feats in the same skills which you are choosing to maximize, though in some cases you may want to grab feats from skills which don&#8217;t require that you be more than Trained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Surprisingly important\n\t\tbecause it&#8217;s used for maneuvering while flying.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cat Fall<\/span>: Being knocked prone while\n\t\t\t\tflying is an easy way to counter flying creatures, and enemies can do it\n\t\t\t\tjust as easily to you as you can do it to them. Cat Fall will reduce the\n\t\t\t\teffective distance you&#8217;ve fallen, allowing you to take less damage from\n\t\t\t\ta fall. However, the effects of Cat Fall scale based on your Proficiency\n\t\t\t\tlevel, so it may not be worth the skill feat unless you plan to increase\n\t\t\t\tyour proficiency in Acrobatics.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcana<\/span> (Int): A crucial knowledge skill.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Sense<\/span>: If you can make Detect\n\t\t\t\tMagic free, you should cast it frequently any time that there&#8217;s even a\n\t\t\t\tremote chance that you&#8217;ll encounter magic. You&#8217;re going to maximize\n\t\t\t\tArcana anyway, so this will get better as you gain levels. Of course,\n\t\t\t\tDetect Magic is a Cantrip which you could get by several means, and\n\t\t\t\tnormal Cantrip scaling will be faster than waiting to become Legendary\n\t\t\t\tin Arcana.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unified Theory<\/span>: Your Intelligence will\n\t\t\t\talways exceed your Wisdom, so your Arcana will always exceed your Nature\n\t\t\t\tand Religion, so at the very least this is a numeric boost to those\n\t\t\t\tskills. More importantly, you don&#8217;t need to spend Skill Increases on\n\t\t\t\tNature, Occultism, or Religion.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Athletics<\/span> (Str): Strength is your dump\n\t\tstat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crafting<\/span> (Int): You&#8217;re probably the\n\t\tsmartest person in the party, and <em>someone<\/em> in the party needs it to\n\t\thandle magic runes.

In those situations, Demoralize is\n\t\ta great use of an Action. However, that spare action may also be important\n\t\tfor the Sustain a Spell action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Lore<\/span> (Int): You have the Intelligence to\n\t\tback up Lore, so pick up a variety of different Lore skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Medicine<\/span> (Wis): You&#8217;ll have enough\n\t\tWisdom to make Medicine viable, but hopefully you&#8217;ll be in a party with\n\t\tsomeone else who can cover it so that you can focus on Intelligence-based\n\t\tskills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nature<\/span> (Wis): Despite being Wisdom-based,\n\t\tNature may be an important skill for the Witch so that you can identify\n\t\tspells being cast by other spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Occultism<\/span> (Int): On par with Arcana, and\n\t\tyou have plenty of Intelligence to make it work.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bizarre Magic<\/span>: Most enemies won&#8217;t be\n\t\t\t\table to identify your magic, and the few that can will rarely care.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Performance<\/span> (Cha): There is no way for the\n\t\tWitch to make use of this short of things like the Goblin Song feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Religion<\/span> (Wis): Despite being\n\t\tWisdom-based, Religion may be an important skill for the Witch so that you\n\t\tcan identify spells being cast by other spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Society<\/span> (Int): The closest thing you&#8217;ll\n\t\tget to a Face skill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): With poor Perception, Stealth\ncan be a good way to improve your Initiative rolls..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thievery<\/span> (Dex): Solve these problems with\n\t\tmagic if you can, but you likely have enough Dexterity to make this workable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-skill-feats\">General Skill Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magical Crafting<\/span>: Depending on your\n\t\tcampaign, crafting during downtime can be a huge asset. But if your campaign\n\t\trarely includes downtime in somewhere suitable to crafting, you&#8217;ll be fine\n\t\twithout this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Recognize Spell<\/span>: With high Intelligence,\n\t\tpassable Wisdom, and easy access to spellcasting-related skills, the Witch\n\t\tis perhaps the best-suited character to identifying enemy spells. You also\n\t\thave access to Counterspell and other means to counteract magic, so being\n\t\table to identify spells as a Reaction can be a powerful tool against enemy\n\t\tspellcasters.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Quick Recognition<\/span>: Using a Free\n\t\t\t\tAction means that you can identify spells multiple time between turns,\n\t\t\t\twhich is crucial against multiple enemy spellcasters or if you need your\n\t\t\t\tReaction for something else.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Witch-feats\">Witch Feats<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Witch-feats-1\">1st Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cackle<\/span>: If you have no plans to use your\n\t\tFocus Points for hexes, get Cackle. Otherwise, Cackle will feel much less\n\t\timpactful than spending the Focus Point to cast a different Focus Spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cauldron<\/span>: Item crafting is expensive at\n\t\tfirst level, but this could be a great option to pick up later. You do gain\n\t\tadditional formulas as you gain levels so there is a small incentive to get\n\t\tthis early, but the cost to learn formulas later is small, and at low levels\n\t\tyou really can&#8217;t afford a feat that you&#8217;re not actively using.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Counterspell<\/span>: Countering enemy spells is\n\t\tgreat, but you need to have that same spell prepared just to have the\n\t\topportunity. It&#8217;s hard enough when you have a spell repertoire and can burn\n\t\tan appropriate spell slot, but when you&#8217;re a prepared caster your ability to\n\t\tcounter spells drops precipitously as you go through the day casting\n\t\tspells. This problems get larger every time Paizo publishes a new source book\nbecause your odds of having the right spell get smaller as more spells are introduced.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reach Spell<\/span>: Many low-level spells have\n\t\tpoor range, and most Hexes have a range of either Touch or 30 ft., so you\n\t\tcan get a lot of use out of this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Widen Spell<\/span>: Great for Blasters. If this\n\t\tadds one more target to an AOE spell it&#8217;s worth the Action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wortwitch<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Witch-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Basic Lesson<\/span>: Most of the Basic Lessons\n\t\tare good, and they frequently include excellent Hex Cantrips that can become\n\t\ta go-to option in many situations. You also get a Focus Point, which is\n\t\tgreat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cantrip Expansion<\/span>: Consider Multiclass\n\t\tArchetype feats instead. For example: you can take Wizard Dedication and get\n\t\ttwo cantrips from the Arcane spell list plus proficiency in Arcana. Similar\n\t\toptions exist for other spellcaster classes so you can get whatever spell\n\t\tlist you want, and if you stick to the same spell list you can get extra\n\t\tspell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Conceal Spell<\/span>: Situational. Most of the\n\t\ttime it won&#8217;t matter if other creatures notice you casting a spell. But if\n\t\tyou want to remain undetected while casting spells, this is absolutely\n\t\tnecessary. You&#8217;ll also need to invest in the Deception and Stealth\n\t\tskills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhanced Familiar<\/span>: Familiars are really\n\t\tgood, and expanding their limited number of abilities can make them even\n\t\tbetter. The Witch gets more abilities for their familiar than any other\n\t\tclass, and this further expands that advantage. However, if you plan to\n\t\treally heavily emphasize your familiar, you should consider Familiar Master\n\t\tDedication instead because it will give you Enhanced Familiar for free. I\n\t\tthink that the Witch&#8217;s additional Familiar Abilities are intended to stack\n\t\twith other sources even if they&#8217;re not part of the Witch class, but check\n\t\twith your GM to be sure. For advice on what to do with the extra abilities,\n\t\tsee our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Familiar&#8217;s Language<\/span>: Without this feat,\n\t\tyou&#8217;re free to pick something interesting as your familiar like a frog or a\n\t\tnewt, both of which feel very witchy. But since you get the ability to speak\n\t\tto creatures of the same type, you want to pick something common with a lot\n\t\tof relatives. Rats are great in urban campaigns, and birds are great if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re outdoors and above ground frequently.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Living Hair<\/span>: An amusing option for other\n\t\tclasses taking multiclass feats, but for the Witch it&#8217;s basically useless.\n\t\tCast a cantrip instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Witch-feats-4\">4th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Eldritch Nails<\/span>: There are so many things\n\t\twrong with this feat. First, the nails don&#8217;t have the Finesse trait, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re forced to attack using Strength. Second, despite being an unarmed\n\t\tattack, the feat grants the ability to apply weapon runes to the nails even\n\t\tthough Handwraps of Mighty Blows already solves that issue. Third, you can\n\t\tonly use non-cantrip Hexes, so you&#8217;re using a Focus Point every time you try\n\t\tto deliver a spell with the nails. Fourth, you can&#8217;t use Hexes that require\n\t\tattack rolls (none exist, of course), so you&#8217;re likely using ones which allow saves but you need to\n\t\thit with the nails Strike in order to deliver the spell. Fifth, the creature\n\t\tneeds to be within your reach, so you&#8217;re taking the Cast a Spell activity in\n\t\tmelee, which usually provokes Reactions. Finally, if you miss that attack (which you\n\t\twill because your unarmed attack bonus is likely terrible), the spell (and\n\t\tyour Focus Point) is wasted.\n\t\t<p>This feat is <em>awful<\/em>. You take a feat to force yourself to wander\n\t\t\tinto melee with no armor and 6+ hit points to then cast a spell (which\n\t\t\tstill provokes Reactions), then you add a totally unnecessary gamble to\n\t\t\tthe whole farce where you <em>might<\/em> get a little damage out of your\n\t\t\tnails that you have almost certainly wasted a mountain of gold upon (runes\n\t\t\tare expensive), and if you miss (which again: you probably will) you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tstuck in melee, probably gave your target a free attack, and you&#8217;ve wasted\n\t\t\ta Focus Point, two Actions, plus whatever it took to get you into\n\t\t\tmelee.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Do not take this feat unless you have some very specific and impressive\n\t\t\tbuild in which you have found a way to make it useful.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Familiar<\/span>: You get 3 familiar abilities\n for being a Witch at 1st level, then another\n\t\tfor free at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels, and you can get two more from\n\t\tEnhanced Familiar. So at 4th level you can have either 3 or 5 abilities. You\n\t\tcan get to 4 or 6 at 6th level when you get another one from the Witch class\n\t\t, and you can reach 8 at 8th level with\n\t\tIncredible Familiar. If you&#8217;re dead set on getting an Imp or whatever, this gets you\n\t\tthere earlier and you can spend your 8th-level feat on something other than\n\t\tIncredible Familiar.

Witches\n\t\thave lots of 1-Action Hex spells to choose from, so it&#8217;s easy to fill three\n\t\tActions with nothing but spellcasting. You can still use this to cast two\n\t\tregular spells, and the once per day limitation may not be a problem since\n\t\tyou can fall back on Hexes the rest of the time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Temporary Potions<\/span>: Not a lot of items,\n\t\tbut free single-use items can often be very powerful.

This only allows you to\n\t\trecharge 2, so your 3rd Focus Point is still a once-per-day resource, but a\n\t\tsecond rechargeable Focus Point means that you can afford to use Hexes much\n\t\tmore frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Witch-feats-14\">14th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reflect Spell<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to counter\n\t\tspells, you&#8217;re probably countering something offensive and dangerous enough\n\t\tto justify spending a spell slot to counter it. If that&#8217;s the case, turning\n\t\tit back on the caster is really great. This doesn&#8217;t fix any of the problems\n\t\twith Counterspell, but it makes it considerably more exciting to use.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rites of Transfiguration<\/span>: Baleful Polymorph\n\t\tis a decent spell, but it&#8217;s on two spell lists already and it&#8217;s not good\n\t\tenough to justify such a high-level feat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Witch-feats-16\">16th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Effortless Concentration<\/span>: Spectacular.\n\t\tMany spells, including many Hexes, are Sustained so this will frequently\n\t\tmean an extra Action every turn.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Siphon Power<\/span>: This is a nice way to get\n\t\tsome extra versatility out of your spellcasting, but the benefits improve\n\t\tbased on how many Lessons you&#8217;ve learned, so you&#8217;re expected to have taken\n\t\tseveral Lessons feats. Most players will likely only take 2, then stop once\n\t\tthey&#8217;ve maxed out their Focus Pool, so you&#8217;re likely picking between two\n\t\tspells.

If you then\n\t\tuse Cackle on the following turn you can Sustain all three of them without\n\t\tspending an Action.

Still, at low levels having\na loaded crossbow at the beginning of combat lets you use any spare Actions to attack if your Hex Cantrips\ndon&#8217;t offer anything useful at the moment.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dagger<\/span>: Your best melee weapon option, but do\n\t\tyour best to never actually use it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Explorer&#8217;s Clothing<\/span>: Basically just a\n\t\tfancy outfit that you can apply magic runes to.

Otherwise,\nexpect to abandon the spell and spend that Action on something else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clinging Ice<\/span>: A great option for\n\t\tsqueezing a little bit of damage out of a single Action. If the target fails\n\t\tthe saving throw, you can Sustain the Spell for up to a minute to maintain\n\t\tthe speed penalty. However, the target is immune for one minute once this\n\t\tspell ends so you can&#8217;t repeatedly hit the same target.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Discern Secrets<\/span>: A +1 bonus isn&#8217;t huge,\n\t\tbut it&#8217;s consistently useful at every level and since checks to Recall\n\t\tKnowledge, Seek, and Sense Motive are all very common out of combat you can\n\t\tget a lot of mileage out of this even if you never use it in combat\n\t\tonce.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evil Eye<\/span>: Similar in function to\n\t\tDemoralize, but you can Sustain the effect rather than being forced to apply\n\t\tthe effect again once the Frightened effect wears off. Frightened is an\n\t\texcellent debuff, penalizing all of the target&#8217;s checks and DCs. This is\n\t\tgood enough that in many encounters this will be your first Action,\n\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re facing a single foe.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nudge Fate<\/span>: Basically a better version of\n\t\tGuidance, which is already good. The target only becomes immune if they use\n\t\tthe effect, and they only use the effect if the +1 actually makes a\n\t\tdifference. Even then, the immunity is only for one minute rather than an\n\t\thour. The only disappointing part is that you can&#8217;t turn a Success into a\n\t\tCritical Success.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pact Broker<\/span> (rare): This will either diffuse\na hostile situation or debuff your target. Because the result of the target&#8217;s save is reduced\nby one step, they&#8217;re very likely to take the debuff. Against powerful single enemies which\nrely on attacks, the attack and damage penalty can be massively impactful, but I probably\nwouldn&#8217;t use this against spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shroud of Night<\/span>: A lot of things have\n\t\tDarkvision, so they&#8217;re immune to this. For things that don&#8217;t they still get\n\t\ta Saving Throw and even if they fail Concealed is only a 20% miss chance.\n\t\tThere are simply too many points of failure for this to be effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Object<\/span> (rare): Decent damage, and the utility\nof picking a heavy object and making it walk around for you can solve some interesting problems.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stoke the Heart<\/span>: A nice, reliable buff.\n\t\tAt low levels where you might be doing 1d8+4 damage with attacks, +2 damage\n\t\tis a nice boost. At high levels you&#8217;ll want to use this for brief periods\n\t\twhen you need a big spike of damage, but you likely won&#8217;t have it running\n\t\tall the time. As far as I can tell, this applies to spell damage rolls so\n\t\tthis is a great option to cast right before casting a big AOE spell against\n\t\tnumerous targets.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wilding Word<\/span>: Too situational and the\n\t\teffect isn&#8217;t good enough to be a significant deterrant if you&#8217;re still the\n\t\teasiest target for their attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blood Ward<\/span>: +1 or +2 to saving throws and\n\t\tAC. It&#8217;s against a single creature type, but typically you can pick the most\n\t\tproblematic creature type in the encounter and slap this on your party&#8217;s\n\t\tDefender. The Action cost of this spell may seem steep, but compare it to\n\t\tthe Raise a Shield action, which doesn&#8217;t boost your saving throws, can&#8217;t be\n\t\tapplied to an ally, and provides a more common Circumstance bonus.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cackle<\/span>: Sustain a Spell as a Free\n\t\tAction. This is a powerful capability that most casters can&#8217;t get until very\n\t\thigh levels, but you get to do it with a 1st-level spell at the cost of a\n\t\tFocus Point. The biggest problem with Cackle is managing your Focus Points.\n\t\tEvery Witch starts with 1 and you can have 3 by 2nd level, but there are no\n\t\toptions built into the Witch to recharge more than one Focus Point until you\n\t\tcan get Hex Focus at 12th level. That makes Cackle an expensive prospect\n\t\tsince your 2nd and 3rd Focus Points are essentially usable once per day\n\t\tuntil levels 12 and 18. In most cases, using Cackle will either be a rarity\n\t\tor it will be your only usage of your Focus Points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Betrayal<\/span>: A small but notable\n\t\tamount of additional damage, especially if multiple people in your party can\n\t\tdeal additional damage of the right type. Look for sources of ongoing damage\n\t\tand pile on as many small sources of damage as you can find, especially if\n\t\tthe target is already Vulnerable to that damage type. Unfortunately, Air and\n\t\tEarth damage are uncommon, and cold and fire damage are commonly resisted.\n\t\tYou are also likely to be the person in your party most capable of dealing\n\t\telemental damage of various types, so your allies may have difficulty\n\t\tcontributing to make Elemental Betrayal worthwhile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Life Boost<\/span>: Not a lot of healing, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s a single Action and any amount of healing will save an ally who is\n\t\tDying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Needle of Vengeance<\/span>: This triggers any\n\t\ttime the target takes a &#8220;hostile action&#8221; against the target, so it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\tsneak around this by doing things likes grappling instead of attacking. The\n\t\tsave is notably a &#8220;basic save&#8221;, so like with many Reflex saves the target\n\t\tmight take double damage, regular damage, half damage, or none at all, and\n\t\tit appears to be based on a single save made when you cast the spell.\n\t\tTargets don&#8217;t get temporary immunity after the spell ends like they would\n\t\twith many Hex Cantrips, so if the target succeeds on the save, you can try\n\t\tagain the next round and Sustain the spell once you&#8217;re happy with the\n\t\tresult. The damage scales well with spell level, allowing you to continue\n\t\trelying on this for your whole career.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Phase Familiar<\/span>: You get this for free,\n\t\tand considering how much the Witch relies on their familiar it&#8217;s nice that\n\t\tyou have a way to protect it even if you&#8217;re caught by surprise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stumbling Curse<\/span>: A good way to make it difficult for enemies to move around in combat. If your party likes to stand still and trade blows, this won&#8217;t do much. If your party likes to move around a lot, this will put you at a major advantage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Veil of Dreams<\/span>: There are many Actions\n\t\twith the Concentrate trait, but unfortunately most of them are used by\n\t\thumanoids with class levels. Sure, you&#8217;ll face humanoid enemies but they&#8217;re\n\t\tthe minority compared to various dragons and trolls of the world. The\n\t\tpenalty against Sleep effects is neat, especially since it still applies\n\t\teven if the target rolls a Success on the save, but Sleep effects are rare.\n\t\tThe most accessible is the spell Sleep, and since you get both from the\n\t\tLesson of Dreams you get a ready-made combo from one feat. Unfortunately,\n\t\tbeyond that combo you&#8217;ll get very little use out of Veil of Dreams.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deceiver&#8217;s Cloak<\/span>: Illusory Disguise is\n\t\ton both the Arcane and Occult spell lists, so if you took either there is\n\t\tlittle reason to learn this. If you did take a different spell list, this is\n\t\tstill a situational option at best.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Malicious Shadow<\/span>: A great offensive\n\t\toption, and the damage scales well. If you&#8217;re not already making attacks on\n\t\tyour turn (rely on saving throw spells instead), the Multiple Attack Penalty\n\t\tisn&#8217;t a big problem for you. Sustain this once or twice per turn and use\n\t\tyour remaining Actions to cast other spells which don&#8217;t require attacks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Personal Blizzard<\/span>: Not much damage, and\n\t\twhile it&#8217;s good that other creatures are Concealed to the target, the target\n\t\tis also Concealed to other creatures so the storm offers them a small amount\n\t\tof protection against attacks. The spell level scaling is terrible, too.\n\t\tSince this makes it hard for your allies to target the creature, expect your\n\t\tparty to focus on attacking other creatures instead, and try to rely on AOE\n\t\teffects when target creatures affected by Personal Blizzard because AOE\n\t\teffects don&#8217;t care about the Concealed condition.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Return the Favor<\/span> (rare): An excellent amount of\ntemporary hp with good scaling, and the 1-minute duration is easily enough to get through a fight.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Curse of Death<\/span>: A bit slow perhaps since\n\t\tit takes 3 rounds to kill the target in your best case scenario, but the\n\t\tdamage is good and scales reasonably well with spell level. If you just need\n\t\tto kill someone and not worry about it too much, you could do a lot\n\t\tworse.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glacial Heart<\/span> (rare): Two Actions to deal decent single-target damage and Slow 1 your target even if they succeed on the save. The ongoing save has the Incapacitation trait, but the initial effect doesn&#8217;t, so even against tough enemies this is still good. Against enemies that aren&#8217;t above your level you can use this one on a target and leave them to gradually freeze while you deal with the rest of the encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Over the Coals<\/span> (rare): The effect when the save triggers is good. The Persistent Damage is large even on a Success, so if you can force the save you can rack up quite a bit of damage over the course of an extended fight. The difficulty is in the subjective portions of the spell. You&#8217;re required to make a demand that&#8217;s not &#8220;obviously self-destructive&#8221;, and the target can either comply or take Persistent Damage. That makes this very difficult to use in combat because things that you care about in combat which would give you an advantage are obviously self-destructive (disarm yourself, give me your magic items, lie on the floor, etc.), and just asking your target to give you their wallet won&#8217;t help you win a fight. Your best bet may be to tell the target to flee, and then either they leave the encounter or they suffer damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Restorative Movement<\/span>: Too situational. This\n\t\tcan help with some nasty effects, but they&#8217;re uncommon in most\n\t\tcampaigns. Spending\n\t\tfeats to lock yourself into this doesn&#8217;t make sense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction This article covers the legacy version of the Witch. For help with the remastered Witch, see our Remastered Witch Handbook. The Witch is a spellcaster granted power by a mysterious Patron. The Witch&#8217;s core features are very close to the Wizard, and their spellcasting works very similarly, but your choice of Patron Theme allows you to select the spell list of your choice similar to the Sorcerer, and the theme of the class&#8217;s features have a distinctly less scholarly bent.
