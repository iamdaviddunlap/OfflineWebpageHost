You get 2 at level 1, then 2 more at level 6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span>: The Rogue&#8217;s signature damage boost, Sneak Attack dominates the Rogue&#8217;s tactics in combat. If you&#8217;re not able to deal Sneak Attack in a given turn as a rogue, you might as well not attack. The damage adds another 1d6 at every odd-numbered level, so as you gain levels Sneak Attack will become a larger and larger portion of your damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cunning Action (Dash\/Disengage\/Hide)<\/span>: Spend a Bonus Action to do some things which normall take an Action. This is crucial part of the Rogue&#8217;s tactics. When fighting at range, you can attack from stealth, move back out of line of sight, and hide again. This gets you Advantage on your attacks, allowing you to use Sneak Attack reliably. In melee, you can use Disengage to move past enemies to reach desired targets or you can use it to get out of melee and leave enemies to engage your party&#8217;s Defender, who is almost certainly more durable than you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: So long as your rogue isn&#8217;t drawing a huge number of attacks, this is a fantastic defense. Coupled with decent AC, you can be very durable unless you&#8217;re drawing a large number of attacks each round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Are damage effects are very common. Couple with proficiency and the Rogue&#8217;s high Dexterity, you&#8217;ll be able to pass these <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Rogue Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"arcane-trickster\">Arcane Trickster<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Arcane Trickster is, in theory, defined by its spellcasting. However, the spellcasting is lackluster compared to the tabletop rules. Instead, focus on Mage Hand Legerdemain, which among the most incredible tools for shenanigans in the entire game. The ability to scout remotely, move items about without being detected, and otherwise mess with the environment is stunningly powerful, especially since to few enemies can see invisible creatures. The spellcasting does provide access to some nice buffs, but it&#8217;s easy to forget to use your spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Hand Legerdemain<\/span>: Mage Hand Legerdemain buffs Mage Hand in two massively important ways. First, the hand lasts indefinitely rather than just for 1 minute like it does for everyone else. This means you can use hand to scout, retrieve items, open doors, pull levels, venture into small holes, and all other manner of shenanigans without much trouble. If you plan ahead, you can camp the hand at the edge of combat, drop items on the ground, and have the hand throw items like alchemist&#8217;s fire. If you forget to set it up ahead of time, you can still drop items during combat without spendin an action, though your hand&#8217;s positioning may not be as convenient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the hand is semi-permanently invisible. If you don&#8217;t attack or shove with it, the hand remains invisible and you can use it to do most of your scouting. As long as it remains invisible, it doesn&#8217;t roll for initiative, so you&#8217;re free to have it float around in the middle of combat moving items around and pulling levers and whatever else you need done. If you&#8217;re patient, you can have your hand drag explosives all over the place, move it to a safe distance, then ignite the explosives to blow up entire encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Arcane Trickster&#8217;s spellcasting is extremely limited, and the options available in BG3 omit many of the best options for rogues in the tabletop rules. Among the conspicuously missing options is <a href=\"https:\/\/bg3.wiki\/wiki\/Shadow_Blade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shadow Blade<\/a>, which is only available from an item for some reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are a few standouts. Find Familiar (Raven) gives you a way to blind enemies, allowing you to deliver Sneak Attack easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9: <span class=\"rating-green\">Magical Ambush<\/span>: Enough to offset your poor spell save DC compared to full spellcasters, but your available offensive spell options don&#8217;t give you much to work with.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"assassin\">Assassin<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Assassin makes it essential that you deliver the first blow in combat, and often requires that your whole party is either stealthy or that they&#8217;re far enough behind you that they won&#8217;t accidentally trigger initiative rolls. The initial subclass features are excellent, allowing you to potentially eliminate an enemy before they get a turn, shifting the odds in your party&#8217;s favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assassin Rogue\/Gloom Stalker Ranger is a fantastic multiclass combination, combining both subclasses&#8217; powerful first-turn features to make you exceptionally dangerous during the first round of combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Assassin&#8217;s Alacrity<\/span>: Excellent incentive to attack before initiative is rolled. If you&#8217;re using two-weapon fighting and have the toggle turned on, your character should attack with both weapons, consuming both your Action and your Bonus Action. This would normally mean that those are spent for your first turn, but thanks to Assaassin&#8217;s Alacrity you&#8217;ll get them both back. You effectively get a full turn worth of attacks if you start combat on your own terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-green\">Assassinate: Ambush<\/span>: Surprising enemies can be difficult, but if you&#8217;re paying attention and sneaking you&#8217;ll be able to do it with reasonable frequency. Your best bet is to have your whole party sneak and have your assassin rogue make an attack at range to start combat. Thanks to Assassin&#8217;s Alacrity, you&#8217;ll get your actions back and you won&#8217;t be effectively takin your firts Action before you actually get a turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Assassinate: Initiative<\/span>: Consistently useful even if you can&#8217;t surprise your enemies. With the Rogue&#8217;s high Dexterity, you&#8217;re likely to go before most enemies, so your first turn should be very effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Infiltration Expertise<\/span>: This is a low-level spell, you can get it from consumables, and if you have the Digital Deluxe version of the game you have a head item which lets you do this for free.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"thief\">Thief<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Thief is a popular class dip because Fast Hands is so good. Monks in particular get a lot out of it. However, on its own, Thief isn&#8217;t especially impressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-blue>Fast Hands<\/span>: A second Bonus Action is massive. If nothing else, you can attack twice with your off-hand weapon and spend your Action to do other stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Second-Story Work<\/span>: Even with Shove being available to enemies, falling damage is really rare and you can often mitigate it with Feather Fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9: <span class=\"rating-green\">Supreme Sneak<\/span>: Effectively the Invisibility spell once per Short Rest. Helpful, but easily replaced by potions which are expensive by this level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Rogue Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of appealing feats which provide a +1 increase to Dexterity means that we don&#8217;t have a good reason to start with 17 Dexterity, leaving points open to invest elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not building an Arcane Trickster, you have a few points to balance between Intelligence and Charisma depending on your rogue&#8217;s role in the party. If your rogue is your party&#8217;s Face, put them into Charisma.

I recommend focusing your permanent proficiencies on Dextiery-based and Wisdom-based skills, then use Astral Knowlede to pick up Intelligence-based or Charisma-based skills depending on your role in the party.

Remember that the Proficiency and Expertise in Deception and Performance don&#8217;t give you anything extra if they&#8217;re redundant, so build yourself without either skill prior to taking this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alert<\/span>: Being surprised is rare and you can usually prevent it by exploring with a pet of some kind<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Savage Attacks<\/span>: Reroll all of those Sneak Attack damage dice. Decent for melee-focused rogues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sharpshooter<\/span>: With at most two attacks per turn via two-weapon fighting, you get much less out of this than most martial characters. Still, it&#8217;s a nice damage boost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skilled<\/span>: Works great with Reliable Talent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Rogue Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Rogues depend entirely on Dexterity-based weapons. In melee, this means daggers, short swords, and rapiers. Your choice of weapons frequently comes down to what is the best magic weapon available to you, though rapiers don&#8217;t work with two-weapon fighting, so short swords and daggers are nearly always the better choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At range, you can use a crossbow, a bow, dual wield hand crossbows, or throw daggers. Throwing daggers is frustrating and no more effective than hand crossbows, so there&#8217;s no reason to do it. Rogues are proficient in hand crossbows, light crossbows, and heavy crossbows, but upgrading to longbows and heavy crossbows doesn&#8217;t add much beyond expanding your item options since the damage dice aren&#8217;t significantly better and the range differents aren&#8217;t very big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-weapon fighting is the preferred option for rogues in the majority of cases. The ability to attack a second time dramatically improves your chances to deliver a Sneak Attack in any given turn. Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 also allows you to attack with your off-hand weapon as a Bonus Action regardless of what you do with your Action on that turn, so you can often use items or special abilities and still your Bonus Action to deliver a Sneak Attack. In addition, when you make an Opportunity Attack you will attack with both weapons, improving the damage you deal when enemies attempt to move away from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Rogue Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Rogues are proficient in light armor, which includes padded armor, leather armor, and studded leather armor. Studded leather providers the highest AC at just 12 + Dex, and Studded Leather is weirdly difficult to find in the early portion of the game where that&#8217;s actually useful. If it&#8217;s an option, have someone cast Mage Armor on you, which gives you an AC of 13 + Dex, though you can&#8217;t be wearing armor (which includes many boots\/glove\/helmets). There are many excellent magic armors for characters who lear light armor or no armor, so you&#8217;ll likely have magic armor before you see your first stuit of mundane studded leather.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Rogue Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Barbarian<\/span>: Bard and Barbarian don&#8217;t combine well. Rage and Reckless Attack depend on Strength-based attacks, and the Rogue needs to be built around Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/span>: Three levels for more Expertise, but that&#8217;s a big class dip.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: Trickery Cleric has some useful options, but being unable to use Trickster&#8217;s Blessing on yourself is incredibly annoying. Two levels for Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity is decent, and three levels for Pass Without Trace makes stealth really easy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid<\/span>: No ability overlap and the Druid&#8217;s spellcasting does very little to help the Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: One level for a fighting style and access to medium\/heavy armor (purely for the magic items) offers some exciting options. Two levels for Action Surge is tempting, but remember that you can only Sneak Attack once per turn, so Action Surge doesn&#8217;t do much for you that two-weapon fighting couldn&#8217;t.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk<\/span>: You can&#8217;t Sneak Attack with unarmed strikes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Paladin<\/span>: Everything you could want from a class dip is easier to get from the Fighter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranger<\/span>: Two levels for some extra skills, a fighting style, and Natural Explorer (Beast Tamer) to get a familiar does a lot for the Rogue. Assassin Rogue\/Gloomstalker Ranger is a powerful and popular multiclass build.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sorcerer<\/span>: If you want spellcasting, bard or wizard will be a better fit. 1st-level subclass features are tempting, but don&#8217;t do much for the Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warlock<\/span>: Two levels for Devil&#8217;s Sight is tempting, but the spellcasting isn&#8217;t especially useful. Three levels so that you can cast Darkness twice per short rest means that you have an easy way to fight while enemies are completely unable to see you, and allies can duck in and out of the area during their turns if they can&#8217;t see from inside the area.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wizard<\/span>: One level for Mage Armor, Find Familiar, and ritual casting. It&#8217;s even better if you&#8217;re an Arcane Trickster because you can learn wizard spells from scrolls to go beyond the Arcane Trickster&#8217;s limited spellcasting options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Rogue Example Build &#8211; Astarion, Arcane Trickster Rogue<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/BG3_Astarion-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Baldur's Gate 3 Astarion Screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-22036\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Likes include stabbing, biting, being romanced by players, and revenge.

Once you get beyond that speed bump, he&#8217;s actually pretty great. Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 makes ample use of traps and locks and makes stealth both viable and rewarding, so a rogue is a powerful asset in any party. Astarion&#8217;s default build will support any variety of rogue reasonably well, and he&#8217;s set up with Expertise in his most important skills to serve as a rogue in a party by someone else. On top of that, Astarion&#8217;s unique abilities make him even more effective than a comparable custom character built as a rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s room for improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this build, we&#8217;ll be building Astarion as an Arcane Trickster becuase that&#8217;s what the game defaults to when he hits level 3. The subclass is a ton of fun and has some very powerful options. We&#8217;ll assume that Astarion is not your party&#8217;s Face, which allows us to dump Charisma in favor of more important ability scores and to rearrange his skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your party lacks another high-Charisma character, Astarion&#8217;s default skills include all of the Face skills, so he&#8217;s a good substitute. I used Astarion as my party&#8217;s Face for the first few levels until I could respec, and with Guidance he did fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>RPGBOT Recommended<\/th><th>+2\/+1 Increases<\/th><th>Final<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>+2<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>+1<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>14<\/td><td><\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>12<\/td><td><\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>High Elf.

First, the hand lasts indefinitely rather than just for 1 minute like it does for everyone else. This means you can use hand to scout, retrieve items, open doors, pull levels, venture into small holes, and all other manner of shenanigans without much trouble. If you plan ahead, you can camp the hand at the edge of combat, drop items on the ground, and have the hand throw items like alchemist&#8217;s fire.<br><br>Second, the hand is semi-permanently invisible. If you don&#8217;t attack or shove with it, the hand remains invisible and you can use it to do most of your scouting. As long as it remains invisible, it doesn&#8217;t roll for initiative, so you&#8217;re free to have it float around in the middle of combat moving items around and pulling levers and whatever else you need done.

If you&#8217;re always two-weapon fighting, this will only help you when you first cast a spell. Plan to use a weapon with longer range like a longbow and spend your Bonus Action to hide on any turn where you have a spell in effect that allows ongoing saves.<br><br>Look at your spell list, pick the spell that you&#8217;re getting the least use out of, and replace it. Go for Blindness or Hold Person if you&#8217;re fighting in melee or either Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter or Hold Person if you&#8217;re fighting at range. <br><br>For Blindness, you want to hide before you cast it. For Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter and for Hold Person you want to make sure that you end every turn hidden so that Magical Ambush continues to apply.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Feat: Savage Attacker OR Sharpshooter<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Savage Attacker is a minor mathematical boost <em>unless you&#8217;re rolling a pile of dice<\/em>. Sharpshooter is a nice damage boost, but you definitely want to use two-weapon fighting to get the most value out of it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Reliable Talent<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>No big tactical changes. This is also our last Sneak Attack improvement. Reliable Talent makes all of our skills much more reliable. By now you&#8217;re likely so good at Sleight of Hand that you can usually only fail on a natural 1, which conveniently becomes impossible thanks to Reliable Talent.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Lucky<\/td><td>We don&#8217;t really need another feat, but Lucky fits into any character well.

An asset in any party due to their easy damage output via Sneak Attack and their powerful skills thanks to Expertise, the Rogue thrives as a Scout and Striker, but can also serve as your party&#8217;s Face without much trouble. Mastering the Rogue nearly requires that you master the mechanics of sneaking. Pay attention to light levels, watch for vision cones, and look for ways to break line of sight.
