Their unique mix\n\t\tof buffs, support, and area control options is difficult for other classes\n\t\tto match, and many of their buffs have durations measured in 10\n\t\tminutes\/level, hours\/level, or even days\/level so you can easily stretch\n\t\tspell slots throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spontaneous Casting<\/span>: Summoning spells\n\t\taren&#8217;t always useful, and it&#8217;s nice to not need to prepare them, but Summon\n\t\tNature&#8217;s Ally is extremely limited.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells<\/span>:\n\t\tLimiting your spells by alignment can annoying, but rarely causes issues. I\n\t\tthink the most annoying example is prohibiting good-aligned casters from\n\t\tcasting\n\t\t<a href=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/magic\/all-spells\/i\/infernal-healing\">Infernal Healing<\/a>, which is the Pathfinder equivalent of 3.5&#8217;s Lesser Vigor, which quickly\n\t\tbecame the basis for all out of combat healing in 3.5.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Orisons<\/span>: Fantastic and versatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Languages<\/span>: Druidic for free is\n\t\tnice, but I have never seen it come up in a game. The Druid doesn&#8217;t get\n\t\taccess to Comprehend Languages or Tongues, so access to additonal languages\n\t\tat start might be useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature Bond<\/span> (Ex): The Druid&#8217;s Animal\n\t\tCompanion is likely the first or second thing which comes to mind when you\n\t\tthink of a Druid. Animal Companions are powerful, versatile, and can fill\n\t\tmajor holes in the party&#8217;s abilities. If you don&#8217;t need an Animal Companion,\n\t\tor if your party is already over-crowded, you might consider a Domain in\n\t\torder to boost your spellcasting abilities.

Be sure to read my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a>\n\t\tif you plan to make use of Wild Shape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Venom Immunity<\/span> (Ex): Useful at high\n\t\tlevels when poison becomes more common.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">A Thousand Faces <\/span> (Su): Too little, too\n\t\tlate.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-\">Timeless Body<\/span> (Ex): Very rarely has an effect\n\t\tin a campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your abilities are greatly influenced by whether or not you plan to use Wild Shape. Wisdom is always your primary concern, but your focus on Strength and Dexterity change depending on Wild Shape..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">St<\/span><span class=\"rating-orange\">r<\/span>: A\n\t\tbit of strength is essential if you plan to use Wild Shape, and a little bit\n\t\tcan help if you plan to use thrown weapons or a bow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Essential for your AC and bad Reflex\n\t\tsaves, and helpful if you plan to use Wild Shape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are always important,\n\t\tespecially if you plan to use Wild Shape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: The Druid skill list is sparse, and\n\t\tunless you particularly need some of the Druid&#8217;s skill you can usually\n\t\tafford to dump Intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: The Druid is primarily a spellcaster,\n\t\tso Wisdom is key. However, because they&#8217;re not a save or suck caster, they\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need go all-out on their spellcasting ability like a Wizard does.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump to 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 9<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 9<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 13<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 7<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 18<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 17<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 17<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 10<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 13<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wisdom bonuses are fantastic, but bonuses to physical ability scores are great for Wild Shape users. Because polymorph effects normalize to small or medium before applying ability modifiers, small races&#8217; strength penalties won&#8217;t go away when you use Wild Shape. As such, small races tend to work better for high-dexterity forms like snakes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Bonuses to Constitution and Wisdom\n\t\tmake the Dwarf a fantastic choice for the Druid, and the Dwarf&#8217;s other\n\t\tracial traits offer some useful bonuses in other areas. The Dwarf favored\n\t\tclass bonus offers extra uses of first-level domain powers, but don&#8217;t let\n\t\tthis influence your decision regarding Nature Bond; first level domain\n\t\tpowers taper off very quickly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: Useful as spellcasters, but their\n\t\tability modifiers don&#8217;t work especially well for the Druid. The Elf favored\n\t\tclass bonus provides bonus natural armor during Wild Shape, which is\n\t\tcertainly tempting, but not enough to make the Elf a particularly good\n\t\tchoice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: The Gnome has nothing but a\n\t\tConstitution bonus to offer the Druid.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Versatile, but nothing\n\t\tspecifically great for the Druid. The Half-Elf favored class bonus is\n\t\tterrible, so take the Elf bonus if you want to use wildshape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Excellent for Wild Shape builds.\n\t\tThe Sacred Tattoo alternate racial trait combined with the Fate&#8217;s Favored\n\t\ttrait helps with the Druid&#8217;s saving throws (especially Dexterity), and the\n\t\tHalf-Orc favored class bonus grants bonus natural armor while using Wild\n\t\tShape.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Your best bet for small, sneaky\n\t\tDruids. With a bonus to Dexterity and a Penalty to Strength, dexterity-heavy\n\t\tWild Shape forms like snakes work best for Halflings, but being small also\n\t\tmakes it easy to stay safe in the back and focus on casting spells or using\n\t\ta bow. The Halfling&#8217;s favored class bonus adds to your Animal Companion&#8217;s\n\t\tsaving throws, which can help protect it from effects which target its\n\t\trelatively weak saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Fantastic for any build, and you\n\t\tmight consider the alternate human traits which give you +2 to two ability\n\t\tscores if you want to use Wild Shape and don&#8217;t need an extra feat. The Human\n\t\tfavored class bonus is garbage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): One rank is plenty.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): Helpful for\n\t\t\ttraining and handling your animal companion, but you likely won&#8217;t need to\n\t\t\tmaximize it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): A fantastic supplement to\n\t\t\tmagical healing, and with the Druid&#8217;s Wisdom you can reliably hit the DC\n\t\t\t25 to treat serious wounds and heal bonus damage with only a few skill\n\t\t\tranks and some cheap items.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (geography)<\/span> (Int): Very\n\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (nature)<\/span> (Int): One of the\n\t\t\tmost important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The most rolled skill\n\t\t\tin the game, and with high Wisdom the Druid is fantastic at\n\t\t\tPerception.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Useful if you plan to ride\n\t\t\tyour mount, but Druids aren&#8217;t built for Mounted Combat, so you don&#8217;t need\n\t\t\tmore than a few ranks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Situational, and\n\t\t\tIntelligence isn&#8217;t an important ability for Druids.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Survival<\/span> (Wis): Situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swim<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section does not cover feats related to Animal Companions or Polymorph.

The reroll is\n\t\t\tmuch more important than the penalty, especially if the attack is a\n\t\t\tcritical hit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Initiative<\/span>: Going first is very\n\t\t\thelpful for spellcasters so that you can cast buffs or area control spells\n\t\t\twhen they&#8217;ll be the most impactful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Natural Spell<\/span>: A common choice for Wild\n\t\t\tShape users, and for good reason. Dropping out of Wild Shape to heal\n\t\t\tyourself can spell your death, so this lets you remain in your nice safe\n\t\t\tanimal form while still casting spells.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Planar Wild Shape<\/span>: The\n\t\t\tCelestial\/Fiendish templates add DR and energy resistance, both of which\n\t\t\tcan dramatically improve your durability. You don&#8217;t get a ton of wild\n\t\t\tshape uses per day, but they last for hours per Druid level, so you can\n\t\t\tgenerally go a whole day on one use of Wild Shape, especially if you have\n\t\t\tNatural Spell so that you can heal without reverting.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Powerful Shape<\/span>: Fantastic if you like\n\t\t\tforms which use abilities like Grab, Swallow Whole, and Trample.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quick Wild Shape<\/span>: Wild Shape out of\n\t\t\tcombat if you can. It lasts for hours per level.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shaping Focus<\/span>: Tempting if you want to\n\t\t\tmulticlass into something like Natural Weapon style Ranger to improve your\n\t\t\tcombat abilities, but you can probably get a lot more from spells than\n\t\t\tfrom multiclass levels.<\/li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Focus (Conjuration)<\/span>: Very few of\n\t\t\tthe Druid&#8217;s Conjuration spells call for saving throws.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Augment Summoning<\/span>: Druids can\n\t\t\t\t\tspontaneously cast Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally, which is a good fallback\n\t\t\t\t\toption when you&#8217;re not sure what else to do with your turn.

Combine this with spells like\n\t\t\tCharm Animal, and you can easily turn the called animal into what amounts\n\t\t\tto a summoned creature, though Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally can&#8217;t match the CR you\n\t\t\tcould get out of a called animal until animals max out in CR somewhere\n\t\t\taround CR 10. If you aren&#8217;t happy with the rounds\/level duration on\n\t\t\tDominate Animal, you could use Charm Animal, Speak With Animals, and\n\t\t\tHandle Animal checks to convince the called animal to help you out. Or,\n\t\t\tyou can just use Call Animal to call some grumpy local predator and let\n\t\t\tthe animal stumble into whatever problem you&#8217;re trying to avoid handling\n\t\t\ton your own.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Calm Animals<\/span>: Situational. Only affects\n\t\t\tone creature type, and the Hit Dice cap won&#8217;t keep up with animals&#8217; hit\n\t\t\tdice as CR increases.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Charm Animal<\/span>: Reasonably useful, a long\n\t\t\tduration, and no Hit Dice cap like Calm Animals. Arguably the best way to\n\t\t\thandle animals, and you get it at level 1. However, if there are multiple\n\t\t\tanimals in an encounter it may not be enough on its own.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cloak of Shade<\/span>: Very situational. Endure\n\t\t\tElements is a better option.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cure Light Wounds<\/span>: Among the most\n\t\t\teffective healing in the game. Buy a wand as soon as your party can afford\n\t\t\tit so that you don&#8217;t need to devote spell slots to this every day.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Damp Powder<\/span>: Trade one spell slot and\n\t\t\tyour Standard Action for some of the target&#8217;s actions on their next turn.\n\t\t\tIt&#8217;s not clear where the Will save comes into effect, but I belive the\n\t\t\tintent is that magic items get to make a save.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deadeye&#8217;s Lore<\/span>: Situational, but it\n\t\t\tsolves a big problem with tracking: you move at half speed, but whatever\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re tracking moves at full speed. The duration is long, and the sacred\n\t\t\tbonuses are exceptionally rare so it will stack with just about\n\t\t\tanything.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Decompose Corpse<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Aberration<\/span>: Very situational. Get\n\t\t\ta scroll if you think it will be a problem.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Animals or Plants<\/span>: Very\n\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Snares and Pits<\/span>: Only works on\n\t\t\tnatural and primitive hazards. Won&#8217;t detect most traps in a dungeon.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Diagnose Disease<\/span>: Very situational and\n\t\t\tnot very helpful. Put ranks into Heal.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Endure Elements<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\t\tcrucial if you&#8217;re in unpleasant climates.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Entangle<\/span>: Excellent area control. If you\n\t\t\tcan keep foes in the area, they will eventually become entangled, so this\n\t\t\tremains useful well into high levels.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Expeditious Excavation<\/span>: Very\n\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Faerie Fire<\/span>: The lowest-level option for\n\t\t\tdealing with invisible enemies. Unfortunately it allows spell resistance,\n\t\t\twhich can be a problem against some foes, but it will get you through low\n\t\t\tlevels easily.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Feather Step<\/span>: A great buff with a good\n\t\t\tduration if you (or your GM) like to use difficult terrain in combat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Flare Burst<\/span>: A -1 penalty is not\n\t\t\tenough.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Frostbite<\/span>: Surprisingly good once\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ve gained a few levels, but admittedly awful at first level. As you\n\t\t\tgain levels, the damage per touch increases and you gain additional\n\t\t\ttouches, so the damage output improves exponentially rather than linearly\n\t\t\tlike most spells. As you add Base Attack Bonus and gain additional\n\t\t\tattacks, you can make touches more than once per turn. The damage is\n\t\t\tnonlethal, so it doesn&#8217;t work on some creature types, but knocking an\n\t\t\tenemy unconscious is as good as killing them in many cases. If you don&#8217;t\n\t\t\twant to take them captive, coupe de grace. This is similar in many ways to\n\t\t\tProduce Flame, but Frostbite is melee-only and deals nonlethal damage, and\n\t\t\tProduce Flame caps the level bonus to damage at +5.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gentle Breeze<\/span>: Cast Endure Elements to\n\t\t\thandle temperature issues. Against cloud effects, get a scroll of Gust of\n\t\t\tWind.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Goodberry<\/span>: At days\/level duration, you\n\t\t\tshould be pre-casting this on any day on which you&#8217;re not actively\n\t\t\tadventuring. Extend the spell with a rod. Use your higher-level spell\n\t\t\tslots. If you&#8217;re not planning to use a slot, put it into Goodberry.\n\t\t\tOrganize the berries into labeled bags or jars, and eat the oldest ones\n\t\t\tfirst. Creatures can get up to 8 points of healing per day, which is\n\t\t\tbetter than a charge off of your wand of cure light wounds, and it removes\n\t\t\tthe need for pesky things like trail rations. If your DM starts\n\t\t\tcomplaining about where you&#8217;re getting all of these berries, plant some\n\t\t\tberries and cast plant growth. Put a bunch of berry bushes in boths and\n\t\t\tcart them around in wagons. Buy a farm. You&#8217;re a druid, do some\n\t\t\tbotany.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heightened Awareness<\/span>: The skill bonuses\n\t\t\tare minor but helpful, and the duration is good. The ability to dismiss\n\t\t\tthe spell for a +4 bonus to initiative means that a 1st-level spell\n\t\t\tprovides the benefit of Improved Initiative, which is widely considered\n\t\t\tone of the best feats in the game for spellcasters.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hide from Animals<\/span>: Situational, but if\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re going to face multiple animals in the same day this is more\n\t\t\tefficient than Charm Animal.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hydraulic Push<\/span>: Bull rush is only\n\t\t\tsituationally useful, but this is much easier than doing it normally and\n\t\t\tthis remains an effective replacement for Bull Rush throughout your\n\t\t\tcareer.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Jump<\/span>: Attrocious and it becomes onsolete\n\t\t\tthe moment flight or levitation or anything of the sort becomes\n\t\t\tavailable.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Keen Senses<\/span>: Good effect, but the\n\t\t\tduration is too short for it to be meaningful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Liberating Command<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\t\tgreat if you&#8217;re worried about your allies (especially wizards and the\n\t\t\tlike) being trapped in a grapple.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longstrider<\/span>: The speed increase will\n\t\t\toffset the speed lost to medium armor, and at hours\/level duration it will\n\t\t\tlast all day. The effect still works while in Wild Shape, which can be\n\t\t\thelpful for slow forms or for when you need to quickly cover a lot of\n\t\t\tground.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Fang<\/span>: At minutes\/level duration\n\t\t\tthis remains an important buff for your animal companion at least until\n\t\t\tyou get Greater Magic Fang. The +1 to attacks and damage is great, but\n\t\t\tbypassing DR\/magic is the biggest draw. Unfortunately, the minutes\/level\n\t\t\tduration isn&#8217;t great so try to reserve this for when you&#8217;re facing enemies\n\t\t\twith DR\/magic.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Stone<\/span>: Bad damage, and that&#8217;s all\n\t\t\tthat it does. You cold argue that it&#8217;s an effective response to undead at\n\t\t\tlow levels, but at low levels it&#8217;s difficult to commit a spell to a single\n\t\t\tcreature type.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monkey Fish<\/span>: A great way to get\n\t\t\thelpful movement types, but it doesn&#8217;t work in medium or heavy armor.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Nauseating Dart<\/span>: Nauseated limits the\n\t\t\ttarget to a move action, which is almost as good as taking away their\n\t\t\twhole turn. At low levels many creatures have poor Fortitude saves and a\n\t\t\tsingle turn can irrevocably determine the outcome of an encounter.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Negate Aroma<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Obscuring Mist<\/span>: A helpful escape\n\t\t\toption, but it doesn&#8217;t benefit much from a high caster level or a high\n\t\t\tsave DC, so it&#8217;s fine to get a cheap scroll for emergencies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pass without Trace<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Produce Flame<\/span>: Decent damage for a\n\t\t\t1st-level spell, and a very efficient use of a spell slot if you have\n\t\t\tplenty of time but very few spells.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ray of Sickening<\/span>: Cast Summon Minor Ally\n\t\t\tand summon skunks. They&#8217;re a better option to sicken targets.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Sickness<\/span>: Very situational.\n\t\t\tSickened and nauseated are uncommon, and diseases typically take days to\n\t\t\ttake effect.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Restore Corpse<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shillelagh<\/span>: A decent low-level option\n\t\t\tif you want to wade into melee combat. The duration is long enough to last\n\t\t\tthrough a fight, even at low levels.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Speak with Animals<\/span>: Situational.\n\t\t\tAnimals can percieve a lot, but they&#8217;re rarely smart enough to offer a lot\n\t\t\tof details. Rats are great option in cities.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stone Fist<\/span>: Use Shillelagh.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Minor Ally<\/span>: Summon skunks. Their\n\t\t\tMusk ability will likely fail due to the low DC, but the failure effect is\n\t\t\tstill to make the target sickened for 1d4 rounds which is pretty great on\n\t\t\tits own.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally I<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons. Unfortunately, the low duration can be really\n\t\t\tproblematic at low levels.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Thorn Javelin<\/span>: An attempt to take Produce\n\t\t\tFlame and add the Sickened condition to it. Making this a regular attack\n\t\t\tmakes it much less reliable, and now you&#8217;re reliant on Strength for the\n\t\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderstomp<\/span>: Spend your standard action\n\t\t\tto maybe trip a target so that they need to spend their move action to\n\t\t\tstand. Typically that&#8217;s an awful trade.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch of the Sea<\/span>: Situational.\n\t\t\tMonkeyfish is much more versatile,<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wave Shield<\/span>: Preventing damage is better\n\t\t\tthan healing it. This will admittedly prevent less damage than Cure Light\n\t\t\tWounds will heal on average until you hit 20th level, but you can use this\n\t\t\tin combat much more easily than Cure Light Wounds. As you gain levels and\n\t\t\tyour 1st-level spells become less effective, this is a great use for your\n\t\t\tspell slots.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Weaken Powder<\/span>: I wouldn&#8217;t take this as a\n\t\t\tcantrip.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Accelerate Poison<\/span>: Solves the problem\n\t\t\tof how slow poison is to work, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s enough. If your\n\t\t\tparty really likes poison you might consider this, but for most parties\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s not worth the spell slot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aggressive Thundercloud<\/span>: Basically\n\t\t\tFlaming Sphere, but it flies. The big problem is the pitifully low 20-foot\n\t\t\tspeed, which is low enough that nearly any creature can escape it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Air Step<\/span>: Situational and the duration\n\t\t\tis short.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Aspect<\/span>: Briefly useful as a way\n\t\t\tto get either a climb speed or a swim speed, but dump this the second you\n\t\t\tcan use Wild Shape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Messenger<\/span>: A decent low-level\n\t\t\tway to communicate at long distances, but the recipient has no way to\n\t\t\trespond within the effects of the spell so you don&#8217;t know if the message\n\t\t\twas recieved or understood.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Purpose Training<\/span>: Almost never\n\t\t\tuseful. Maybe helpful if you befriended a wild animal, but even then\n\t\t\thardly worth the spell slot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Trance<\/span>: Awful. Just awful. The Hit\n\t\t\tDie cap is insultingly low, and the effect is bad. Compare this to Hold\n\t\t\tAnimal which is the same level, uses the same save, has no Hit Die cap,\n\t\t\tand was published in the same book.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ant Haul, Communal<\/span>: Too situational. But\n\t\t\ta mule.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aspect of the Bear<\/span>: Interesting, but\n\t\t\tthe AC won&#8217;t stack with Barkskin and the Enhancement Bonus won&#8217;t stack\n\t\t\twith things like Magic Fang, so there&#8217;s a tiny window of character levels\n\t\t\twhere this might be worthwhile, but for the same spell slot I&#8217;d still\n\t\t\tprefer Barkskin because the duration is so much better.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Barkskin<\/span>: One of the best AC buffs in\n\t\t\tthe game for several reasons. First, it&#8217;s an &#8220;Enhancement Bonus to Natural\n\t\t\tArmor&#8221;. &#8220;Natural Armor&#8221; bonuses and &#8220;Enhancement Bonuses to Natural Armor&#8221;\n\t\t\tare two totally separate types of AC bonus that stack with each other\n\t\t\tdespite the confusing names. This is why both Barkskin and Amulets of\n\t\t\tNatural Armor stack with normal natural armor, but don&#8217;t stack with each\n\t\t\tother. Think of it like an enhancement bonus to your manufactured armor.\n\t\t\tTwo chain shirts won&#8217;t stack, and making your chain shirt +1 twice won&#8217;t\n\t\t\tstack either. For most recipients, Barkskin is an uncommon bonus type, so\n\t\t\tadding Barkskin presents an easy AC boost. With 10 minutes\/level duration\n\t\t\tyou can usually get through an adventuring day on one or two castings per\n\t\t\trecipient, especially if you extend the spell (I recommend a lesser\n\t\t\tmetamagic rod).<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Beastspeak<\/span>: Being able to speak while\n\t\t\tin Wild Shape may save you the trouble of dropping in and out of Wild\n\t\t\tShape just to communicate with your party members, but you can also get a\n\t\t\tRing of Eloquence to solve the same problem without eating a spell\n\t\t\tslot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Burning Gaze<\/span>: The duration is too short\n\t\t\tto expect to do other things while this runs, and the damage is too small\n\t\t\tfor this to have a serious effect on its own. On top of that, targets get\n\t\t\ttwo saves to resist the effects.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Campfire Wall<\/span>: This is an odd spell. It\n\t\t\thas a Standard Action casting time, so you can use it in combat or while\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re being ambushed, but it also has a 2 hours\/level duration so you can\n\t\t\tcast it before resting and it&#8217;ll last through the night (mostly; a\n\t\t\t3rd-level druid will go without the effect for two hours) so long as\n\t\t\tsomeone tends the fire at the center of the effect. The effect outlines\n\t\t\tcreatures that pass through its barrior in light so that they can&#8217;t\n\t\t\tbenefit from invisibility or effects like Blur or Displacement, which is\n\t\t\tespecially great protection against ambushes by invisible foes. You could,\n\t\t\tin theory, use this in combat but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to light a\n\t\t\tcamp fire during a fight and usually Faerie Fire and Glitterdust are\n\t\t\tbetter options.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Certain Grip<\/span>: Situational. The bonus\n\t\t\tis big and the duration is great, but unless your GM really likes to use\n\t\t\tthe applicable combat maneuvers I don&#8217;t think this is a great choice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chill Metal<\/span>: See Heat Metal, below. Chill\n\t\t\tMetal is basically identical, but resistance to cold damage is less\n\t\t\tcommon.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climbing Beanstalk<\/span>: Very situational. I\n\t\t\tmight use this to create a permanent shortcut up a cliff face or\n\t\t\tsomething, but you&#8217;ll have access to convenient flight in two levels, and\n\t\t\tyou can typically solve climbing problems with rope or with Spider\n\t\t\tClimb.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Companion Life Link<\/span>: The effect is\n\t\t\tborderline pointless, and the duration is nowhere near long enough to make\n\t\t\tup for that. If this was hours\/level I would rate it\n\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>, which is an indication of how\n\t\t\tweak this spell is.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Delay Poison<\/span>: Situational, but the\n\t\t\tduration is really good. If you expect to run into poisonous enemies, this\n\t\t\tis worth a spell slot to put on your party&#8217;s Defender. But keep in mind\n\t\t\tthat the poison all takes effect immediately when the spell wears off, so\n\t\t\twatch the duration and be sure to help your target when the effect ends.\n\t\t\tAntitoxins, Guidance, Heal checks, and Neutralize Poison are all good\n\t\t\tideas.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eagle Eye<\/span>: Neat, but in two levels you\n\t\t\tcan turn yourself into a bird.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elemental Speech<\/span>: Very situational, and\n\t\t\tdruids are very rarely equipped to be a Face.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Endure Elements, Communal<\/span>:\n\t\t\tSituational, but if you need Endure Elements your whole party likely needs\n\t\t\tit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Euphoric Cloud<\/span>: AOE save-or-suck, but\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s only rounds\/level duration and if you take any hostile actions\n\t\t\tFascinated effects end so you&#8217;ll need to be cautious about how you follow\n\t\t\tup. Creatures stuck in the area are forced to repeat the save, so throwing\n\t\t\tthis into a room and waiting a couple rounds can be a helpful way to start\n\t\t\tan encounter with an advantage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Feast of Ashes<\/span>: This is something that an\n\t\t\tNPC would use on a player, not the other way around.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fire Trap<\/span>: Hard to use in any\n\t\t\tmeaningful way, and the damage is miniscule.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flame Blade<\/span>: Fighting in melee without\n\t\t\tWild Shape is hard for most druids, but this spell can do a lot to help.\n\t\t\tGrab a decent shield and the best armor your can find, and go to work.\n\t\t\tYour Strength bonus doesn&#8217;t apply and the attacks are touch attacks, so\n\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t need much Strength or Dexterity to hit reliably. You can\n\t\t\tprobably use Power Attack, but check with your GM.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flaming Sphere<\/span>: A very efficient use\n\t\t\tof a spell slot, and a great way to spend your move action, but the damage\n\t\t\tis small so unless combat is going to take a long time it&#8217;s unlikely to do\n\t\t\ta lot of damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fog Cloud<\/span>: A great way to cover your\n\t\t\tretreat, and if your party has Blind Fighting or other ways to mitigate\n\t\t\tthe miss chance it can put your at a significant tactical advantage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Forest Friend<\/span>: Situational, but you\n\t\t\ttypically know ahead of time if you&#8217;ll be adventuring in a forest. The\n\t\t\tduration is short, so rather than casting this ahead of time you&#8217;ll want\n\t\t\tto cast it right before going into a fight.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frigid Touch<\/span>: No save, but it does\n\t\t\tallow spell resistance. The damage is minor, but you&#8217;re mostly here for\n\t\t\tthe Staggered effect. Staggered prevents full attacks, which is useful\n\t\t\tagainst some enemies, but it&#8217;s for one round each time you cas the spell\n\t\t\tso I&#8217;m not sure if this is worth the spell slot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Frost Fall<\/span>: Tiny AOE and very little\n\t\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Glide<\/span>: Too situational. Try to get\n\t\t\tFeather Fall if you can.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gust of Wind<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Heat Metal<\/span>: Too slow, too little damage,\n\t\t\tand as you advance in levels you&#8217;ll encounter very few enemies using\n\t\t\tnon-magical metal equipment.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hold Animal<\/span>: An efficient solution to\n\t\t\thostile animals. Animals typically have terrible Will saves, so this is an\n\t\t\teasy save-or-suck, and as you gain levels it will be easier to reserve one\n\t\t\tspell slot to neutralize an entire creature type. However, Charm Animal is\n\t\t\tjust one spell level lower, doesn&#8217;t allow additional saves, and lasts\n\t\t\thours per caster level which is typically enough to negate an animal as a\n\t\t\tthreat without needing to kill it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lockjaw<\/span>: If you want a creature to have\n\t\t\tGrab, pick an Animal Companion with Grab or use Wild Shape to turn into\n\t\t\tsomething with Grab. This is a very situational spell, and the\n\t\t\trounds\/level duration is pitiful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Masterwork Transformation<\/span>: With rare\n\t\t\texception, you can just buy a new item.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Natural Rhythm<\/span>: I absolutely hate this\n\t\t\tspell. It requires a bunch of tracking, especially if you change targets\n\t\t\tbefore you kill something that you&#8217;ve attacked previously. Unless you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tfacing a single enemy with lots of hit points and the spell&#8217;s target has\n\t\t\tnumerous natural weapons (anything with Pounce is a good choice), expect\n\t\t\tthis spell to disappoint you.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pernicious Poison<\/span>: Only useful if your\n\t\t\tparty really likes to use poison, but if they do this is great. The target\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t get a saving throw, and extending the duration of poisons\n\t\t\tdramatically improves their effectiveness.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pox Pustules<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to force a\n\t\t\tFortitude saving throw, it needs to be for something more impactful than\n\t\t\tthe Sickened condition on a single target.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Reduce Animal<\/span>: The only reason that I can\n\t\t\tthink to use this is to squeeze your animal companion into a small\n\t\t\tspace.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resist Energy<\/span>: An extremely important\n\t\t\tdefensive option, though not always necessary.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Restoration, Lesser<\/span>: You will cast this\n\t\t\ta lot. Maybe not every day, but a lot. Temporary ability damage is common\n\t\t\tand annoying, and Lesser Restoration is the most efficient way to address\n\t\t\tit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scent Trail<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Share Language<\/span>: If you spent one of\n\t\t\tyour Animal Companion&#8217;s ability score increases on Intelligence to bring\n\t\t\tit to 3 Intelligence, it&#8217;s just barely smart enough to understand speech\n\t\t\t(Anthropomorphic Animal grants the ability to understand speech and only 3\n\t\t\tIntelligence), so if you cast this on your Animal Companion they will be\n\t\t\table to understand complex verbal commands rather than relying on Tricks\n\t\t\tand Handle Animal checks. They may even be able to speak a little.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sickening Entanglement<\/span>: Sickening a\n\t\t\ttarget makes it generally less effective, and also less resistant to other\n\t\t\tspells. However, Fortitude saves generally tend to be high, so unless you\n\t\t\thave time to let the effects takes hold over several rounds you may be\n\t\t\tbetter skipping this.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Slipstream<\/span>: Amusing, but usually\n\t\t\tLongstrider will suffice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Soften Earth and Stone<\/span>: Very situational.\n\t\t\tThis won&#8217;t work on worked stone like buildings or dungeon walls.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spider Climb<\/span>: The next best thing to\n\t\t\tflight.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Call<\/span>: Ice Storm but less damage\n\t\t\tand a lower-level spell, and notably no saving throw or spell resistance.\n\t\t\tIf you just need difficult terrain during a fight, this is a surprisingly\n\t\t\tgood option, remaining an inexpensive way to produce difficult terrain in\n\t\t\ta large area well into high levels.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Discus<\/span>: The easiest comparison is\n\t\t\tto Scorching Ray. Stone Discus does similar damage and scales at the same\n\t\t\trate, but you make some trades. Instead of dealing fire damage you can\n\t\t\tdeal either bludgeoning or slashing, and Stone Discus makes a normal\n\t\t\tattack instead of a touch attack. So you avoid the problem of fire damage\n\t\t\tbeing commonly resisted but in exchange your attacks are less reliable.\n\t\t\tYou do get to make each attack at max Base Attack Bonus, which could have\n\t\t\tsome fun interactions with Deadly Aim. This is the most single-target\n\t\t\tdamage that a druid can get from a 2nd-level damage spell, but remember\n\t\t\tthat your Dexterity will need to be good enough to make the attacks\n\t\t\treliable.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally II<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Summon Swarm<\/span>: Swarms are great, but you\n\t\t\tneed to Concentrate on the spell (which eats your Standard Action each\n\t\t\tturn) and the you have no control over the swarm once you create it. Your\n\t\t\tbest bet is to conjure the swarm then run away and hope that the swam wins\n\t\t\twhatever fight you just put it into.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tar Ball<\/span>: Regular attack, bad damage,\n\t\t\ttiny penalty.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tree Shape<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unshakeable Chill<\/span>: This is something that\n\t\t\tan NPC does to a player.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warp Wood<\/span>: This only affects &#8220;small&#8221;\n\t\t\twooden objects, and can only warp or unwarp them. Unless you specifically\n\t\t\tneed to warp numerous objects, Wood Shape is strictly better. You can use\n\t\t\tthis to warp things like wooden shields, bows, and wood-hafted weapons\n\t\t\tlike spears, and there&#8217;s nothing requiring the objects to be unattended or\n\t\t\tnonmagical so you can disarm enemies using any sort of wooden equipment.\n\t\t\tStill, all of those situations are relatively infrequent unless you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tdoing most of your adventuring in population centers like cities.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wartrain Mount<\/span>: Very situational. The\n\t\t\tonly use case I can think of is to turn an unusual mount into a combat\n\t\t\tmount.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Web Shelter<\/span>: Surprisingly, this is the\n\t\t\tDruid&#8217;s best option for creating a safe magical resting place without\n\t\t\tputting themselves into a pocket dimension (see Fairy Ring Retreat). Be\n\t\t\tsure to cover the exterior in local foliage to conceal it before you go to\n\t\t\tsleep.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whip of Spiders<\/span>: You&#8217;re probably not very\n\t\t\tgood with whips, and a single swarm isn&#8217;t worth the spell.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wilderness Soldiers<\/span>: Not very effective,\n\t\t\tand it only works if your in an area with abundant plants.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wood Shape<\/span>: Useful for all the same\n\t\t\treasons as Stoneshape, but wood is considerably more portable. Shape\n\t\t\twooden doors to bypass locks. Shape wooden scraps to improvise tools.\n\t\t\tSabotage wooden weapons. Get creative.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Air Geyser<\/span>: Amusing, but weak damage.\n\t\t\tOnly useful if there&#8217;s something above the target which you want to launch\n\t\t\tthem into.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Anchored Step<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animal Aspect, Greater<\/span>: Druids can\n\t\t\tsolve most of the problems solved by Animal Aspect by using Wild\n\t\t\tShape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anthropomorphic Animal<\/span>: Why is this a\n\t\t\tspell? With hours\/level duration you can give an animal just enough\n\t\t\tintelligence to be considered &#8220;Intelligent&#8221; and the ability to speak, then\n\t\t\ttake it away when the spell ends. That alone is a horrific thing to do to\n\t\t\ta creature. This isn&#8217;t even a buff. It&#8217;s just body horror and mental\n\t\t\tanguish for animals.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Apport Animal<\/span>: I can&#8217;t think of any\n\t\t\tcircumstance in which this would be useful except as a joke.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Aqueous Orb<\/span>: I&#8217;m not sure if this spell\n\t\t\tworks as intended. Entangled halves a creature&#8217;s speed, but nothing about\n\t\t\tthe spell specifies that the creature is unable to simply walk (or swim)\n\t\t\tout of it. It also doesn&#8217;t specify what action it takes for a creature to\n\t\t\tmake an additional saving throw to escape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ash Storm<\/span>: Good area control. Even\n\t\t\tbetter if you have scent or something (Wild Shape) and can keep enemies\n\t\t\twithin the area so you&#8217;re at an advantage. If you can&#8217;t, throw an ongoing\n\t\t\tAOE damage spell into the area like Thorny Entanglement or Tar Pool and\n\t\t\twait to finish off anything that manages to escape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aversion<\/span>: The intended effect is too\n\t\t\tsituational to be useful, but the effect if the target passes their will\n\t\t\tsave is unintentionally good. Against a powerful enemy, you can make\n\t\t\tsomething you wear or carry the subject of their aversion (a hat works\n\t\t\tgreat), and when they pass the Will save they&#8217;re Sickened while within 60\n\t\t\tfeet of that object for days per caster level. A 3rd-level spell to make a\n\t\t\ttarget Sickened is admittedly a dubious benefit, so this isn&#8217;t good enough\n\t\t\tfor the spell level, but it&#8217;s an interesting rules interaction.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Badger&#8217;s Ferocity<\/span>: Duration:\n\t\t\tConcentration. You&#8217;re giving up your ability to do useful things on your\n\t\t\tturn to make some weapons Keen. Under no circumstance is this even\n\t\t\tremotely worth using.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Burrow<\/span>: Burrow speeds are a fantastic\n\t\t\tway to get around undetected, but unless you have a way to know what&#8217;s\n\t\t\tgoing on above ground you&#8217;ll need to be careful not to pop up somewhere\n\t\t\tdangerous.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Burst of Nettles<\/span>: Attrocious damage in a\n\t\t\tsmall AOE.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Call Lightning<\/span>: While the damage per\n\t\t\tbolt is unremarkable, the appeal is the ability to continue the effect\n\t\t\twith no action for minutes per level, meaning that you can cast it before\n\t\t\tgoing into a fight and use it as a good fallback option if you&#8217;re short on\n\t\t\tother resources. The range is good enough that you can remain at a safe\n\t\t\tdistance and wear foes down before they can get close to you.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cloak of Winds<\/span>: Too situational, the\n\t\t\tbenefits are too small, and the duration is too short.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Companion Mind Link<\/span>: Very few GMs\n\t\t\tadhere strictly to the Handle Animal rules because they slow down the game\n\t\t\tfor nearly no benefit, so in most games this is largely useless. Even if\n\t\t\tyour GM does make you do all the checks and actions, the duration on this\n\t\t\tis still frustratingly short.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Contagion<\/span>: A variety of options to\n\t\t\tdeal ability score damage, but the secondary effects use the (typically\n\t\t\tpitiful) save DC of the normal version of the disease, so causing targets\n\t\t\tto be blinded by Blinding Sickness is difficult.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Treasure Map<\/span>: Kill something,\n\t\t\tthen prepare and cast this the next day when you&#8217;re hopefully done\n\t\t\tadventuring, and you can collect maps from a bunch of creatures to find a\n\t\t\tbunch of valuables, especially if you might have missed something like a\n\t\t\tsecret room or a hidden chest. Keep in mind that the 100gp material\n\t\t\tcomponent may be a problem at low levels, so don&#8217;t overuse this if it&#8217;s\n\t\t\tnot going to yield more treasure than you spend to get the map.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cup of Dust<\/span>: Not useful for players. This\n\t\t\tis the kind of thing that enemies do to PCs.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cure Moderate Wounds<\/span>: In-combat\n\t\t\thealing is rarely a good idea, and you get this a level later than the\n\t\t\tCleric.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Daylight<\/span>: You have numerous ways to get\n\t\t\tDarkvision, but your allies may not. The 10 minutes\/level duration lasts a\n\t\t\tlong time, and you can hide the targeted object if you need it to be\n\t\t\tdark.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Delay Poison, Communal<\/span>: Situational,\n\t\t\tbut if you&#8217;re facing enemies that use poison (which is a lot of enemies),\n\t\t\tthe temporary immunity can make many encounters much less dangerous. Since\n\t\t\tthe duration is so long, you can easily share it between the party and\n\t\t\tstill cover a lot of ground on a single spell slot. Keep in mind, however,\n\t\t\tthat the poisons will all take effect at the end of the spell, so if your\n\t\t\tallies are being repeatedly poisoned they might deterioriate rapidly once\n\t\t\tthe spell ends. Consider hitting them with Neutralize Poison before Delay\n\t\t\tPoison wears off.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Diminish Plants<\/span>: Too situational, but if\n\t\t\tyou really need to hurt some farms or something this is the way to do\n\t\t\tit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dominate Animal<\/span>: Too situational. Animals\n\t\t\ttend to have terrible will saves, so Charm Animal will usually\n\t\t\tsuffice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feather Step, Mass<\/span>: If you like to use\n\t\t\tdifficult terrain (and many druids do), this is a great way to do it\n\t\t\twithout bothering your allies. The duration is sufficiently long that a\n\t\t\tsingle casting will last through several combats, especially as your\n\t\t\tcaster level improves.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fungal Infestation<\/span>: Conceptually\n\t\t\thorrifying, but not worth the spell slot. Using Bloody Claws instead.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hide Campsite<\/span>: Most of the Druid&#8217;s\n\t\t\tspells for creating places to rest create that area out in the open (Grove\n\t\t\tof Respite, etc.). This attempts to hide you while resting. However, the\n\t\t\t20-foot cube area isn&#8217;t large enough to comfortably house parties larger\n\t\t\tthan 4 medium creatures unless you really squeeze in tight. If you have an\n\t\t\tanimal companion, or if you have wagons, tents, a campfire, etc. you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tgoing need to get really creative. Consider turning yourself into a really\n\t\t\tsmall animal before going to sleep. Wild Shape&#8217;s duration is hours\/level,\n\t\t\tso and 8th-level druid can get a full night&#8217;s sleep on one usage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hydraulic Torrent<\/span>: Bull rush at range for\n\t\t\tthe cost of a 3rd-level spell slot. Absolutely not worth it. Use Hydraulic\n\t\t\tPush instead.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Lily Pad Stride<\/span>: Really neat and\n\t\t\tthematic, but very situational. Turn into something large that can swim\n\t\t\tand have your party ride on your back. The Acrobatics checks are going to\n\t\t\tbe hard for many allies, especially those in armor.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longstrider, Greater<\/span>: Lasts all day and\n\t\t\tapplies to all of your speeds, including those granted by Wild Shape. I\n\t\t\twould run this all day every day. Tragically, it has a range of &#8220;You&#8221; so\n\t\t\tyou can&#8217;t cast it on your allies (though you can cast it on your Animal\n\t\t\tCompanion).<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mad Monkeys<\/span>: If your enemy relies on a\n\t\t\tweapon, a wand, a staff, or if they&#8217;re just holding items that you want\n\t\t\tthem to not run away with, throw this on them and try to keep them from\n\t\t\trunning away.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Fang, Greater<\/span>: All of the appeal\n\t\t\tof Magic Fang, but with the option for a larger enhancement bonus or to\n\t\t\taffect all of a creature&#8217;s natural weapons. If you like to Wild Shape into\n\t\t\tmultiple forms, getting +1 to all of your natural weapons means that\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re covered all day and don&#8217;t need to worry about picking a form with\n\t\t\tthe right natural weapons. If you prefer forms with single attacks, it\n\t\t\tmight be best to stick to normal Magic Fang until the additional bonus is\n\t\t\tworth the higher-level spell slot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Meld into Stone<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nature&#8217;s Exile<\/span>: This is the sort of thing\n\t\t\tthat NPCs us on players.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nauseating Trail<\/span>: Stinking Cloud&#8217;s\n\t\t\teffect is really good, and this allows you to precisely place it\n\t\t\tthroughout an area. However, it requires you to move through potentially\n\t\t\tdangerous spaces and you may have trouble placing the effect in a way that\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t hinder your allies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Neutralize Poison<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plant Growth<\/span>: Welcome to 5th-level. Time\n\t\t\tto upset the agricultural economy.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison<\/span>: Constitution damage is very\n\t\t\teffective, but the target gets a save every round to end the effect\n\t\t\tentirely so it&#8217;s not very unreliable. Use Spit Venom instead.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Energy<\/span>: Similar to\n\t\t\tResist Energy, and which to use is a complicated question.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pup Shape<\/span>: Amusing, but not very\n\t\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quench<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rain of Frogs<\/span>: Doesn&#8217;t solve the problem\n\t\t\tof the poison&#8217;s low DC.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Disease<\/span>: Situational, and most\n\t\t\tdiseases take long enough to take effect that you can afford to address\n\t\t\tthem when you&#8217;re not adventuring.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resinous Skin<\/span>: DR 5\/piercing for 10\n\t\t\tminutes\/level. A good companion to Barkskin, but piercing damage is fairly\n\t\t\tcommon. The bonus to grapple is a great bonus for Wild Shape, and enemies\n\t\t\tweapons sticking to you when you&#8217;re attacked means that you can easily\n\t\t\tdisarm enemies and run off with their weapons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resist Energy, Communal<\/span>: A crucial\n\t\t\tdefensive option.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Share Language, Communal<\/span>: Very\n\t\t\tsituational, and few druids are built to know a bunch of languages.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shifting Sand<\/span>: The effect is good and\n\t\t\tstays effective as you gain levels, and the ability to move the area of\n\t\t\teffect is a great improvement over many similar spells. Unfortunately, it\n\t\t\tonly works on earthen or sandy surfaces, so stone, wood, metal, etc.\n\t\t\tsurfaces won&#8217;t work.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleet Storm<\/span>: Similar in effect to Ash\n\t\t\tStorm. Most creatures don&#8217;t have ranks in Acrobatics, so many creatures\n\t\t\twill struggle to pass even a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Which spell is better\n\t\t\tis honestly hard to say.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Snare<\/span>: Hard to use in combat due to the\n\t\t\tcasting time, but there&#8217;s no initial save against the effect. The DCs to\n\t\t\tescape will be hard for most creatures, but dealing 5 points of damage is\n\t\t\tpretty easy so your best outcome is either the creature stumbles around\n\t\t\tentangled or they waste an attack on the rope instead of on attack your\n\t\t\tand your party. If you like this spell, consider a wand or some scrolls\n\t\t\tsince it&#8217;s only a 2nd-level Ranger spell and the circumstances where you\n\t\t\tcan use it are fairly rare.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Speak with Plants<\/span>: I don&#8217;t trust this to\n\t\t\tbe useful. The spell doesn&#8217;t describe what mundane plants are capable of\n\t\t\tobserving and therefore telling you, and since plants lack eyes and ears\n\t\t\tmost of what they can can percieve won&#8217;t be useful. Plant creatures are\n\t\t\tgenerally jerks and not very smart, so you&#8217;re unlikely to get any useful\n\t\t\tinformation out of them either.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spider Climb, Communal<\/span>: Climb speeds are\n\t\t\tthe next best thing to fly speeds, and Air Walk isn&#8217;t available for\n\t\t\tanother spell level. Sharing this among your party is especially helpful\n\t\t\tand the duration is really good.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spike Growth<\/span>: Only works in outdoor\n\t\t\tsettings. Aside from that limitations, it&#8217;s really good. Spike Stones only\n\t\t\tworks on stony surfaces, so between the two you can produce the same\n\t\t\teffect anywhere that you need it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spit Venom<\/span>: Black Adder Venom deals 1d2\n\t\t\tConstitution damage every round for 6 rounds, and the poison continues to\n\t\t\tuse your spell save DC rather than the poison&#8217;s comparably weak DC.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stench of Prey<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Shape<\/span>: Fantastically useful as a\n\t\t\tutility option, but remember that it doesn&#8217;t work on worked stone like\n\t\t\tdungeons or castles.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally III<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thorny Entanglement<\/span>: Basically a blender\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s lethal out to a 55-foot radius. Cast this into an enclosed space,\n\t\t\tclose the door, wait for the duration to wear off, and go clean up\n\t\t\twhatever survived. However, be warned that anything with decent DR may be\n\t\t\table to shrug off the damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderstomp, Greater<\/span>: Thunderstomp is\n\t\t\tbad, and lines are a very difficult AOE to use on more than two\n\t\t\ttargets.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vermin Shape I<\/span>: Bad, even if you&#8217;re built\n\t\t\tfor Wild Shape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Water Breathing<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\t\tcrucial when you need to adventure underwater.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wind Wall<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Absorb Toxicity<\/span>: Poison is typically\n\t\t\treally difficult, but this solve two of the biggest problems: save DC and\n\t\t\tdelivery mechanism. Look for poisons that deal Constitution damage on a\n\t\t\tduration measured in rounds, especially those which must be ingested or\n\t\t\tinhaled because they&#8217;ll often be cheaper than comparable contact\/injury\n\t\t\tpoisons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Aggressive Thundercloud, Greater<\/span>: The\n\t\t\tStunned effect is tempting, but he 20-foot move speed is crippling. Ball\n\t\t\tLightning will be more effective of only because you can scatter the balls\n\t\t\taround the area and increase the likelihood that an enemy will be close\n\t\t\tenough that you can hit them with at least one.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air Walk<\/span>: Druids can&#8217;t cast Fly, so this\n\t\t\tis the next best thing. You conveniently don&#8217;t need to make Fly checks\n\t\t\tlike you do when you&#8217;re actually flying, and walking around in the air\n\t\t\twhile using Wild Shape to turn into flightless creatures is both\n\t\t\thillarious and very effective.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Antiplant Shell<\/span>: Too situational unless\n\t\t\tyou know for certain that you&#8217;re going to fight plant creatures.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arboreal Hammer<\/span>: Useless unless you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tfighting beneath a suitable tree.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Aspect of the Stag<\/span>: Hit-and-run melee\n\t\t\ttactics aren&#8217;t common, especially for druids. You could fish for attacks\n\t\t\tof opportunity to try to get extra attacks, but druids generally aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\tdurable enough to make that a good idea.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Atavism<\/span>: Need your Animal Companion to\n\t\t\tbe a combat monster for minutes\/level? Here you go. The bonuses are all\n\t\t\tuntyped so you don&#8217;t need to worry about stacking. This won&#8217;t take a weak\n\t\t\tcompanion and make them effective on its own, unfortunately, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tinvesting in your companion to keep it effective these bonuses will be\n\t\t\tvery impactful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ball Lightning<\/span>: Two or more balls means\n\t\t\tthat you can split this up between multiple enemies or focus on single\n\t\t\tenemies to quickly wear them down. Separating the damage also means that\n\t\t\tenemies are more likely to fail at least some of the saving throws to\n\t\t\tavoid the damage. However, the balls&#8217; slow speed means that enemies not\n\t\t\trelying on full attacks can easily avoid this by walking away.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blight<\/span>: Too little damage, and plants\n\t\t\tfrequently have high Fortitude saves. If the best you can do is d6\/level\n\t\t\tsingle-target damage, consider Flame Strike instead. It&#8217;s the same amount\n\t\t\tof damage, it&#8217;s an AOE, and many plant creatures are vulnerable to fire\n\t\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloody Claws<\/span>: Bleed effects normally\n\t\t\taren&#8217;t great, but dealing half your caster level in bleed damage means\n\t\t\tthat you&#8217;re doing a huge amount of damage compared to most bleed effects.\n\t\t\tOngoing damage will force Concentration checks, and enemies without the\n\t\t\tability to heal magically can&#8217;t do much except struggle to perform Heal\n\t\t\tcheck to stop the damage. However, bleed damage is<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cape of Wasps<\/span>: This is not nearly good\n\t\t\tenough to justify casting with a rounds\/level duration. It&#8217;s an amusing\n\t\t\tconcept, but it&#8217;s just not good enough at this spell level. Consider\n\t\t\tThorny Body instead.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Command Plants<\/span>: A fine way to handle\n\t\t\tplant creatures, but plant creatures are very rare and unlike undead you\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t create permanent plant creatures using easily-accessible spells. You\n\t\t\talso need to make Charisma checks to convince plants to do anything which\n\t\t\tthey wouldn&#8217;t normally do, so unlike zombies or whatever it&#8217;s hard to turn\n\t\t\tyour horde of plant creatures into an army. Oh, and the creatures aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\tcompelled to not attack your friends, so you still need to convince them\n\t\t\tnot to do so.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Control Water<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Creeping Ice<\/span>: I think you&#8217;re intended to\n\t\t\tuse this to cross bodies of water, but unless you have a group of NPCs in\n\t\t\ttow you can just turn into a bird and fly across.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cure Serious Wounds<\/span>: Avoid in-combat\n\t\t\thealing as much as possible, and use a wand of Cure Light Wounds outside\n\t\t\tof combat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic<\/span>: Essential in every party,\n\t\t\tbut upgrade to Greater Dispel Magic as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Echolocation<\/span>: Blindsight for 10\n\t\t\tminutes\/level. A spectacular counter to invisiboe enemies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flame Strike<\/span>: Decent AOE damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flaming Sphere, Greater<\/span>: A solid way\n\t\t\tto spend your move action every turn, and the ongoing damage will help\n\t\t\teven if you miss. However, it&#8217;s totally useless against flying enemies and\n\t\t\tthe 1d6 ongoing damage won&#8217;t be significant.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Freedom of Movement<\/span>: Technically\n\t\t\tsituational, but a very powerful defense against common save-or-suck\n\t\t\tspells like Hold Person and against enemies that rely on grappling.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Geyser<\/span>: Hillarious, but the damage is\n\t\t\tpoor compared to something like Flame Strike, and it required\n\t\t\tConcentration.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Giant Vermin<\/span>: The CR of the creatures\n\t\t\tis too low to be a significant threat in combat, but with a minutes\/level\n\t\t\tduration it&#8217;s easier to cast this ahead of time than Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Grove of Respite<\/span>: A decent place to\n\t\t\trest, but it provides no cover of any kind so you&#8217;re still vulnerable to\n\t\t\tweather and to attack.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ice Storm<\/span>: Bad damage and the secondary\n\t\t\teffects are only mildly annoying. Compare this to Obsidian Flow which has\n\t\t\tsimilar effects and does much more damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Life Bubble<\/span>: Situational, but with a 2\n\t\t\thours\/level duration that you can split among targets it&#8217;s long enough\n\t\t\tthat you can cast this well ahead of time if you suspect that it might be\n\t\t\thelpful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Moonstruck<\/span>: Save-or-suck on enemy\n\t\t\tspellcasters, but they tend to have high Will saves so this may be\n\t\t\tunreliable.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Obsidian Flow<\/span>: Less damage than Flame\n\t\t\tStrike, but you might entangle targets and you create a 20-foot burst of\n\t\t\tpermanent difficult terrain so you&#8217;re giving up some damage for some are\n\t\t\tcontrol.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Plague Carrier<\/span>: Too slow. Use\n\t\t\tContagion.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection from Energy, Communal<\/span>: A\n\t\t\tstaple defensive buff.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Reincarnate<\/span>: Budget Raise Dead. Be\n\t\t\tcareful about using this; bringing a creature back as a different race can\n\t\t\truin their build entirely.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Repel Vermin<\/span>: Too situational, and\n\t\t\tcreatures can still penetrate the barrier.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ride the Waves<\/span>: Great if your party\n\t\t\tneeds to so some adventuring underwater, but save this for your allies.\n\t\t\tYou can turn into a shark.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">River of Wind<\/span>: Very situational and\n\t\t\treally weak.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rusting Grasp<\/span>: Situational, and if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tusing it against enemy weapons or armor you&#8217;re destroying your own\n\t\t\tloot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scrying<\/span>: An excellent divination option,\n\t\t\tand at this level it&#8217;s less likely that enemies will be running Detect\n\t\t\tScrying than at higher levels when you get Greater Scrying.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slowing Mud<\/span>: Amusing, but the enemies\n\t\t\tmost significantly impacted by this will have high Fortituded saves. It&#8217;s\n\t\t\teasier to use this on enemies like spellcasters who will have comparably\n\t\t\tpoor Fortitude saves, but Slow is less impactful on them because most\n\t\t\tspells take only a Standard Action to cast. The blindness effect is still\n\t\t\timpactful, though, which may be enough.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spike Stones<\/span>: Hours\/level duration and\n\t\t\tit applies damage per square with no save. This is an absolutely fantastic\n\t\t\tway to impede foes which can&#8217;t fly, and RAW only rogues can detect it\n\t\t\t(though I think that text was duplicated from 3.5 so anyone with\n\t\t\tTrapfinding should be able to detect it). Between the insane duration and\n\t\t\tthe incredibly large AOE, this is an incomparably good area control spell.\n\t\t\tLiterally the only problem is that it doesn&#8217;t affect flying enemies in any\n\t\t\tway. However, it only works on rocky ground and stone floors, so oyu can\n\t\t\tonly use it in caves, dungeons, and stone structures. Everywhere else, use\n\t\t\tSpike Growth.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Strong Jaw<\/span>: I would only consider this\n\t\t\tif the target is built to use Vital Strike. Otherwise, consider Atavism or\n\t\t\tBloody Claws.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally IV<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thorn Body<\/span>: An interesting defensive\n\t\t\toption, but to benefit from the effects you need to be hit with attacks or\n\t\t\tgrappled successfully.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Touch of Slime<\/span>: 1d3 Consitution damage\n\t\t\tper round until the target dies. However, the target gets an initial\n\t\t\tFortitude saving throw to negate the effect, the spell has the Diseases\n\t\t\tsubtype so it won&#8217;t work on creatures immune to diseases, and exposure to\n\t\t\tsunlight appears to immediately kill the slime. Creatures can scrape off\n\t\t\tthe slime, but that can only be done the round after you apply the spell.\n\t\t\tBe sure to read the effects of Green Slime so you fully grasp how this\n\t\t\tworks. If you can use this inside on a target with poor Fortitude saves,\n\t\t\tthis is a rapid death sentence.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">True Form<\/span>: Too situational, but if a\n\t\t\tparty member is hit with Baleful Polymorph this is a great solution.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vermin Shape II<\/span>: Bad, even if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tbuilt for Wild Shape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Volcanic Storm<\/span>: Ice Storm, but with fire\n\t\t\tdamage. The damage type was not a problem. Ice Storm is just bad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air Walk, Communal<\/span>: Close enough to\n\t\t\tflight to do the job, and the duration is long enough that you can split\n\t\t\tit and still get through multiple fights.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Growth<\/span>: Throw this on your Animal\n\t\t\tCompanion, especially if they&#8217;re built to grapple.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Aspect of the Wolf<\/span>: Too situational, and\n\t\t\tyou can get a belt to provide similar enhancement bonuses.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Awaken<\/span>: Too situational to use in any\n\t\t\tpractical way. You could theoretically use this on a massive tree or some\n\t\t\tanimal that you encounter and it will &#8220;serve you in specific tasks&#8221;, but\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s still an independent creature so it&#8217;s not clear if the creature is\n\t\t\tcompelled to fight alongside you in combat. Awakened animals do get +2 HD\n\t\t\twhich will improve their combat abilities a bit, but even so animals won&#8217;t\n\t\t\tremain a significant threat much longer. Also, the 2,000gp material\n\t\t\tcomponent is very expensive.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Baleful Polymorph<\/span>: Save-or-suck that\n\t\t\tworks on just about anything that fails the initial saving throw. Turn\n\t\t\ttargets into a sloth or something else equally slow and harmless.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessing of the Salamander<\/span>:\n\t\t\tSurprisingly good healing, but I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d use this as a combat\n\t\t\tbuff unless you also needed te fire resistance.\n\t\t<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Call Lightning Storm<\/span>: The additional\n\t\t\tdamage and 5 extra lightning bolts really doesn&#8217;t seem like enough to\n\t\t\tjustify making this 5th-level.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Commune with Nature<\/span>: Oh wow, three facts.\n\t\t\tYou could probably get more useful information by turning into a bird and\n\t\t\tlooking around for a few minutes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Contagion, Greater<\/span>: Only an improvement\n\t\t\tif you plan to face the same target in combat more than once.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Control Winds<\/span>: A great solution to\n\t\t\tflying enemies. Turn the wind up as high as your can with a downdraft, and\n\t\t\tforce them to the ground where your allies can reach them more easily.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cure Critical Wounds<\/span>: A big pile of\n\t\t\thealing if you need it in a pinch, but do your best to avoid healing in\n\t\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Death Ward<\/span>: A crucial defensive option\n\t\t\tagainst many types of undead.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fickle Winds<\/span>: Very situational. This\n\t\t\tonly matters if you&#8217;re facing high-level foes which rely on arrows or\n\t\t\tsimilar projectiles, and that&#8217;s really rare.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire Snake<\/span>: Fireball, but you scribble\n\t\t\tthe AOE rather than just hitting a sphere. Great for precisely targeting\n\t\t\tenemies who are close to your allies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Insect Plague<\/span>: &#8220;The swarms are stationary\n\t\t\tafter being summoned, and won&#8217;t pursue creatures that flee.&#8221; There are\n\t\t\tplenty of better stationary ongoing damage effects which enemies can&#8217;t\n\t\t\tkill with damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Raise Animal Companion<\/span>: Generally you\n\t\t\tcan just replace your Animal Companion, but if you can&#8217;t or if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\temotionally attached to yours, 1,000gp is much cheaper than the 5,000gp to\n\t\t\tcast Raise Dead.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snake Staff<\/span>: Only works if you have a\n\t\t\tbunch of dead wood lying around. You could use quarterstaffs or a bundle\n\t\t\tof tree branches to get a bunch of small snakes, but they&#8217;ll be too weak\n\t\t\tto have any significant effect in combat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stoneskin<\/span>: DR 10\/adamantine is really\n\t\t\tgood, and the duration is long enough to get you through several\n\t\t\tencounters, but the 250gp material component will add up quickly if you\n\t\t\trely on this a lot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally V<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Threefold Aspect<\/span>: Neat, but won&#8217;t stack\n\t\t\twith your magic items.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transmute Mud to Rock<\/span>: Rarely useful\n\t\t\ton its own, but a great follow-up to Transmute Rock to Mud.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transmute Rock to Mud<\/span>: In caves or on\n\t\t\trocky terrain this can be great crowd control, but in structures like\n\t\t\tcastles or dungeons it&#8217;s totally useless. If you manage to cast this and\n\t\t\tcatch some enemies, you can follow up with Transmute Mud to Rock and seal\n\t\t\tthem in stone.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tree Stride<\/span>: Too situational. It&#8217;s a neat\n\t\t\tability, but since you can&#8217;t bring your allies with you this can&#8217;t replace\n\t\t\tlong-distance travel options. Even if you manage to string a perfect chain\n\t\t\tof oak trees in a line to get where you want to go, this will only save\n\t\t\tyou a few miles of travel per spell slot. Using Wild Shape to turn into a\n\t\t\tbird or something will get you much further.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wall of Fire<\/span>: A good crowd control\n\t\t\toption, but the duration require Concentration, which means that you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tstanding around concentrating on your wall of fire rather than casting\n\t\t\tother spells. That may be alright if you just need something to cover your\n\t\t\tescape, but in combat that&#8217;s hard to justify. The damage is pretty minor\n\t\t\tat this level, so enemies may run right through the wall, in which case\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ve spent a 5th-level spell slot to deal 2d6+caster level damage\n\t\t\t(possibly twice is you placed the wall to deal initial damage), and if\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s the best you can do I would recommend Fire Snake instead.<p><\/p>\n<p>The best case scenario is to either place this in a place where enemies\n\t\t\t\tcan&#8217;t get away from it (narrow hallways are great), or find a way to\n\t\t\t\tpush enemies back through the wall, such as having an ally Bull Rush\n\t\t\t\tthem. You can also form the wall into a ring facing either inward or\n\t\t\t\toutward, and if you can combine this with an area control effect like\n\t\t\t\tAsh Storm, Entangle, or Tar Pool, you can set up an extremely lethal\n\t\t\t\tcombination at essentially any character level so long as enemies can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\twithstand the fire damage.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Thorns<\/span>: This spell is easy to\n\t\t\toverlook (I&#8217;ve done it), and it&#8217;s even easier to use it wrong (I&#8217;ve done\n\t\t\tthat, too). The damage minus AC calculation is weird, and big tough\n\t\t\tenemies will walk right through the wall unhindered, so the best you get\n\t\t\tout of it is cover. Instead, use this on smaller enemies with comparably\n\t\t\tpoor Strength. Creatures need to roll 25 or greater on a Strength check to\n\t\t\tmove even one square through the wall, and many creatures are simply\n\t\t\tincapable of doing so. So unless they have a way to teleport which doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\trequire line of sight, you can entrap an enemy in the wall and either\n\t\t\tleave them there for a while or drop an ongoing damage effect on them and\n\t\t\twait. Just be careful to avoid using magic fire, as it will destroy the\n\t\t\twall.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whip of Centipedes<\/span>: You&#8217;re probably not\n\t\t\tvery good with whips, and a single swarm isn&#8217;t worth the spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-6\">6th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Antilife Shell<\/span>: As long as the affected\n\t\t\tcreatures can&#8217;t attack at range and don&#8217;t have enough reach, you can force\n\t\t\tcreatures of the affected types to remain at a safe distance.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, at this level reach is common.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cure Light Wounds, Mass<\/span>: The most\n\t\t\tefficient of the &#8220;Mass Cure&#8221; spells; this is enough to get most\n\t\t\tunconscious allies back on their feet and to stop bleed damage, but\n\t\t\thealing during combat is rarely a good tactical choice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic, Greater<\/span>: Every party needs\n\t\t\tat least one of these available as soon as it becomes available.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dust Form<\/span>: A fantastic defensive buff,\n\t\t\tand between Greater Magic Fang and spellcasting you&#8217;ll have no problem\n\t\t\tmaking your attacks magic so that you don&#8217;t deal half damage. The\n\t\t\trounds\/level duration hurts, though.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eagle Aerie<\/span>: This is intended as a\n\t\t\tlong-distance transport option rather than a combat option. Giant eagles\n\t\t\tare only CR 3, so at this level they&#8217;re basically cannon fodder. You could\n\t\t\tsummon the eagles ahead of time and throw them into combat as a\n\t\t\tdistraction if you need to buy yourself time to cast other spells, but\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t expect them to do much at this level except interpose themselves and\n\t\t\tabsorb damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Epidemic<\/span>: Since the targets encountering\n\t\t\tyour target save against the disease&#8217;s normal DC, basically the only\n\t\t\treliable victims are commoners. So unless you plan to spread this in a\n\t\t\tcity, you&#8217;re not going to get any use out of it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Find the Path<\/span>: Your DM has carefully\n\t\t\thidden the BBEG&#8217;s lair. The BBEG and their minions have warded the\n\t\t\tlocation against scrying, and they&#8217;ve destroyed any evidence of their\n\t\t\tlair&#8217;s existence. Then you cast this spell and muck it all up. It was\n\t\t\theavily changed from the 3.5 version (which navigated you around traps),\n\t\t\tbut it&#8217;s still very powerful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fire Seeds<\/span>: The Acorn Grenades option is\n\t\t\tterrible unless you have effects which add damage to the attacks, such as\n\t\t\tPrecise Shot, Sneak Attack, or some other damage boost, so it&#8217;s often wise\n\t\t\tto pass the acorns to a better-suited ally. Generally you&#8217;re here for the\n\t\t\tHolly Berry Bombs option.<p><\/p>\n<p>If you use the Holly Berry Bombs option, you deal 1d8+Caster Level\n\t\t\t\tdamage once per caster level at the same time. That damage scales\n\t\t\t\texponentially, making it one of the highest damage spells in the game.\n\t\t\t\tYou could argue that the first bomb would destroy the other bombs, but\n\t\t\t\tif they&#8217;re on your body RAW your items aren&#8217;t affected by AOE damage, so\n\t\t\t\tif you have enough fire damage resistance you can set off a bunch of\n\t\t\t\tsmall explosions on yourself and you won&#8217;t take damage, but everything\n\t\t\t\taround you will still take damage. That&#8217;s almost certainly an unintended\n\t\t\t\tabuse case, but Paizo has had over a decade to address it and hasn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tdone so, so either I&#8217;m missing a rules interaction (very possible) or a\n\t\t\t\tFAQ entry (also possible) or they like the spell as-is.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Ironwood<\/span>: How good this is depends on\n\t\t\twhether or not your GM will allow you to further enchant the armor which\n\t\t\tyou convert with this spell. If so, you can craft a wooden breastplate and\n\t\t\tturn it into ironwood. You may need to re-cast the spell every week or\n\t\t\ttwo, but that&#8217;s not a problem for most adventurers.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Liveoak<\/span>: Situational. You can only cast\n\t\t\tthis on one tree at a time, which means that you can&#8217;t turn a whole forest\n\t\t\tinto an army (which I would absolutely recommend otherwise). It&#8217;s unclear\n\t\t\tif you can re-cast the spell on the animated tree before it replants, but\n\t\t\tI would rule that you can&#8217;t. Even so, a days\/level duration is enough for\n\t\t\tyour treant to carry you and your party long distances, to lay siege to a\n\t\t\tstructure, to help you in combat, and whatever else you might need. Since\n\t\t\tthe duration is so long, you should have this running almost\n\t\t<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Move Earth<\/span>: Too situational. You\n\t\t\tbasically only need this if you&#8217;re planning to do construction or planning\n\t\t\tto face an army or something, in which case you&#8217;ll have time to prepare\n\t\t\tit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plague Storm<\/span>: A room full of Blinding\n\t\t\tCurse is excellent crowd control.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Primal Regression<\/span>: Against an enemy\n\t\t\tspellcaster this can be a save-or-suck. However, spellcasters tend to have\n\t\t\tgood Will saves. You could use this against big burly enemies with bad\n\t\t\tWill saves, but in that case it&#8217;s a buff. You could use it on your allies,\n\t\t\tbut they likely won&#8217;t enjoy the Intelligence drain. It&#8217;s hard to use\n\t\t\tthis.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Repel Wood<\/span>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sirocco<\/span>: Good crowd control against\n\t\t\tenemies which rely on weapons. The Fatigued effect applies even if the\n\t\t\ttarget passes their save (though they do need to take damage, so fire\n\t\t\tresistance\/immunity is a problem), so in two rounds you can make every\n\t\t\tenemy in the effect exhausted, significantly handicapping many enemies.\n\t\t\tThe only problems are that the AOE is small, fire resistance is common,\n\t\t\tand this can still knock your allies prone even if they have fire\n\t\t\tresistance.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellstaff<\/span>: Put a spell of your\n\t\t\thighest-level slot into this. It&#8217;s basically a free spell slot if you can\n\t\t\tprepare this on a day where you&#8217;re not adventuring.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone Tell<\/span>: Stone is used in a lot of\n\t\t\tplaces, and can tell you quite a bit for an unintelligent object.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, it&#8217;s filtered through your GM who may not always give you\n\t\t\texactly the answers that you want. Don&#8217;t expect this to reveal every\n\t\t\tsecret in the game, and try not to annoy your GM with it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stoneskin, Communal<\/span>: Stoneskin&#8217;s biggest\n\t\t\tproblem is the expensive material component, and sharing the effect\n\t\t\tmultiplies that problem.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally VI<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swarm Skin<\/span>: This is a great escape\n\t\t\tmechanism which I have personally use to cheat death at least twice. Turn\n\t\t\tyourself into a wasp swarm and whatever else you can afford. Run away as\n\t\t\tthe wasp swarm and leave the other swarms as a distraction. You can live\n\t\t\tas a wasp swarm indefinitely, and while that&#8217;s a profoundly terrible way\n\t\t\tto live it may buy your party enough time to recover your remains.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tar Pool<\/span>: Imagine if Entangle also set\n\t\t\tenemies on fire. The ongoing damage is only 2d6 so it&#8217;s not going to win\n\t\t\tany fights on its own, and even paltry fire resistance will negate it, but\n\t\t\tagainst foes with no fire resistance it&#8217;s free guaranteed damage unless\n\t\t\tthe creature wastes a full round action to remove it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Transport via Plants<\/span>: Inconvenient\n\t\t\tteleportation is still faster than traveling normally, even if you have\n\t\t\tthe ability to fly at great speed. Finding suitable plants can be a pain,\n\t\t\tespecially in certain biomes, but forests of various sorts are still\n\t\t\tcommon throughout most worlds.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Stone<\/span>: Wall of Stone is a bit of\n\t\t\ta misnomer; this spell is considerably more versatile. It&#8217;s not as precise\n\t\t\tas Stone Shape, but the massively larger amount of material means that you\n\t\t\tcan do more with it. Walling off enemies is obvious, but you can also\n\t\t\tcreate bridges, simple structures, stone furniture, and all manner of\n\t\t\tother simple shapes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whip of Ants<\/span>: You&#8217;re probably not very\n\t\t\tgood with whips, and a single swarm isn&#8217;t worth the spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Animate Plants<\/span>: Very situational. The\n\t\t\toption to animate large plants to attack is difficult unless you have\n\t\t\tsuitably gigantic plants around to animate. The option to cause plants to\n\t\t\tentangle stuff for hours per level is hard to use, and the fairly small\n\t\t\trange means that the hours\/level duration will likely be difficult to\n\t\t\tbring into play more than once or twice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Changestaff<\/span>: Summon a CR 8 creature for\n\t\t\thours\/level. The combat stats aren&#8217;t spectacular, but it&#8217;s still a Huge\n\t\t\tcreature with 29 Strength that does double damage to objects and\n\t\t\tstructures. If you need something to block a hall, hold a door closed,\n\t\t\tbreak someting, or if you just stand in front of you to provide cover,\n\t\t\tthis can be really helpful. Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally will be much more\n\t\t\tversatile, but having a pet treant for hours\/level is probably worth the\n\t\t\ttrade. At this level you might even use Extend Spell to extend the\n\t\t\tduration and cast this the night before an adventure, allowing you have a\n\t\t\tpet treant (or several) for most of the next day without spending a\n\t\t\tcrucial spell slot. The Focus is a staff which doesn&#8217;t have a listed cost,\n\t\t\tbut requires 28 days of work to create, which may prove to be annoying if\n\t\t\tyour GM makes you do that yourself. The staff is destroyed if the treant\n\t\t\tis destroyed, which can turn into a huge time sink unless you can pay some\n\t\t\tlocal commoners to craft staves for you (it doesn&#8217;t require any particular\n\t\t\tskill or quality, just time).<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Control Weather<\/span>: Situational, but\n\t\t\tgiven time and an immobile or slow-moving enemy this can prove very\n\t\t\teffective. You can adjust the weather to your liking, and no one is quite\n\t\t\tas well-equipped to handle inclement weather as the Druid. Turn the\n\t\t\tweather stormy, then use Call Lightning Storm to rain lightning bolts on\n\t\t\tyour enemies from afar, or bring up winds, snow, or fog to inconvenience\n\t\t\tyour enemies while you move about unhindered.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Creeping Doom<\/span>: Against enemies which\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t fly, this can be very effective. The save DC for the poison will be\n\t\t\thigh, and 1d4 Dexterity damage can be a problem for many enemies since\n\t\t\tmost enemies don&#8217;t have Dexterity significantly higher than 10. The\n\t\t\tbiggest problem is that the swarms can&#8217;t fly, and flight is common at this\n\t\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cure Moderate Wounds, Mass<\/span>: Very\n\t\t\tlittle healing for such a high-level spell.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fairy Ring Retreat<\/span>: Equivalent to\n\t\t\tMage&#8217;s Magnificent Mansion, the similarities are clear. Even the\n\t\t\tformatting of the spell is mostly copy+pasted, but the authors forgot to\n\t\t\tspecify what the Divine Focus is. In a pinch you could use this to escape\n\t\t\tcombat, but the most likely usage is to give yourself and your allies a\n\t\t\tsafe place to rest. The area is sufficiently large to accomodate large\n\t\t\tparties, but you&#8217;ll need to bring your own bedrolls since Fairy Ring\n\t\t\tRetreat doesn&#8217;t provide such comforts.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire Storm<\/span>: Good AOE damage, and you\n\t\t\tcan apparently place the 10-foot cubes wherever you want within range,\n\t\t\tallowing you to target enemies with surgical precision, though you can\n\t\t\tonly exclude plant creatures if they do fall within one of the cubes, so\n\t\t\tif you cast this in a forest you&#8217;ll spare the trees but kill every animal\n\t\t\tin the effect. On top of the damage, targets that fails the save take an\n\t\t\timpressive 4d6 ongoing damage <em>with no maximum duration<\/em>, and\n\t\t\tcreatures need to spend a Full Round Action to <em>attempt<\/em> to\n\t\t\textinguish the flames, though the DC 20 to do so is likely low compared to\n\t\t\tyour spell DC. Still, that&#8217;s a lot of damage and creatures need to waste a\n\t\t\tturn trying to extinguish themselves instead of doing something harmful to\n\t\t\tyou and your party. This is especially effective against spellcasters\n\t\t\tbecause ongoing damage forces Concentration checks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span>: The best in-combat healing that\n\t\t\tyou can get.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rampart<\/span>: Too situational. Basically the\n\t\t\tonly time that you&#8217;ll need this over something like Wall of Fire is if\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re planning to fortify a city. In those cases you&#8217;ll typically have\n\t\t\tplenty of time to prepare this or even cast it well ahead of time.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scouring Winds<\/span>: This is hillariously\n\t\t\tannoying. The ongoing damage will force concentration checks, the sand\n\t\t\tblock all vision, and the Windstorm speed requires a DC 20 Fly check with\n\t\t\ta -4 penalty to move through the effect. Even if they move, you can spend\n\t\t\ta move action to move the cloud on top of them again, allowing you to\n\t\t\teasily hinder or incapacitate enemy spellcasters at a distance, even if\n\t\t\tthey&#8217;re flying. Enemies who have invested in the Fly skill may be able to\n\t\t\tpass the DC 20 Fly check without too much trouble, unfortunately, but look\n\t\t\tfor other ways to inhibit them like entangling them with a net. If you\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t afford a spell level this high, Control Winds will suffice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scrying, Greater<\/span>: Spying on enemies is a\n\t\t\tgood idea, but watch out for enemy sorcerers and wizards, who will almost\n\t\t\tcertainly have Detect Scrying running specifically to prevent shenanigans\n\t\t\tlike this. If you must spy on a sorcerer\/wizard, dress yourself up in a\n\t\t\tdisguise and spy on them from a different plane so that even if they see\n\t\t\tan image of you and know your location and distance all of that\n\t\t\tinformation is borderline useless.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-\">Siege of Trees<\/span>: <\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally VII<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sunbeam<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t spectacular,\n\t\t\tbut the Blinded effect appears to be permanent, and one-shotting vampires\n\t\t\tand other sunlight-vulnerable undead can be very helpful if you can\n\t\t\tpredict when you might encounter those enemies. Unfortunately, you need to\n\t\t\tcast the spell as a Standard Action, then fire a beam as a separate\n\t\t\tStandard Action so this is a hard option to use in combat unless you can\n\t\t\tcast it before fighting breaks out.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transmute Metal to Wood<\/span>: A great way\n\t\t\tto handicap enemies reliant on manufactured weapons and armor, but also a\n\t\t\tgreat way to turn a bunch of your loot into wooden garbage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Seeing<\/span>: Very powerful, but the\n\t\t\tmaterial component can become expensive very quickly.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vortex<\/span>: Only works in water, and even\n\t\t\tthen if you need that you can summon a water elemental with Summon\n\t\t\tNature&#8217;s Ally.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wind Walk<\/span>: Aside from teleportation and\n\t\t\tinterplanar travel, this is probably the fastest way to get around. As a\n\t\t\tcloud of vapor you can pass through tiny gaps like keyholes or cracks in\n\t\t\twalls, allowing you to infiltrate structures and move through many\n\t\t\tobstacles without relying on things like Etherealism. With an hours\/level\n\t\t\tduration you can switch in and out of your gaseous form several times\n\t\t\tthroughout the day as needed, though the 5 rounds that it takes to do so\n\t\t\tcan be a problem if you&#8217;re somewhere dangerous.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-8\">8th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Shapes<\/span>: Too situational. If you\n\t\t\thave allies built to make this work, they&#8217;ll have their own abilities to\n\t\t\tchange forms or they&#8217;ll prefer to rely on weapons. You could use this on\n\t\t\tyour Animal Companion to turn them into a bigger, better version of\n\t\t\tthemselves, but if you spent money to get them armor they&#8217;ll lose that\n\t\t\tcrucial AC bonus.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Atavism, Mass<\/span>: Too situational. You would\n\t\t\tneed to be something really weird to make this viable.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blood Mist<\/span>: Cast this into a room full\n\t\t\tof enemies and seal the door. You only need a portion of the targets to\n\t\t\tfail their saves, and and encounter can essentiall eat itself.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Control Plants<\/span>: Too situational. Plant\n\t\t\tcreatures are extremely rare.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cure Serious Wounds, Mass<\/span>: It hurts\n\t\t\tthat this is such a high-level spell for the Druid.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earthquake<\/span>: Too situational. You have\n\t\t\ttime to prepare this if you need to topple a building, but in almost any\n\t\t\tother case the fixed DC 15 Reflex saves won&#8217;t be helpful against foes that\n\t\t\tyou care about at this level.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Euphoric Tranquility<\/span>: Against a single\n\t\t\tcreature, this is a way to incapacitate them with no saving throw. You can\n\t\t\tthen spend some time chatting with them (though beware of the rounds\/level\n\t\t\tduration), and if you decide to attack the creature they still need to\n\t\t\tsave every round to act normally. If you want to take a creature out of a\n\t\t\tfight, hit them with this then go eliminate their friends before returning\n\t\t\tyour focus to your euphoric victim. This is Mind-Affecting, so some\n\t\t\tcreatures will be immune, but that still leaves the vast majority of\n\t\t\tcreatures as targets.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Finger of Death<\/span>: Not quite a\n\t\t\tsave-or-suck, but 10 damage\/level is a ton of damage. Against many\n\t\t\tspellcasters and other creatures with poor Fortitude saves that&#8217;s enough\n\t\t\tto kill them instantly.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frightful Aspect<\/span>: The spell isn&#8217;t bad,\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s just hard to think of a druid build that can use this\n\t\t\teffectively.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Repel Metal or Stone<\/span>: Too\n\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reverse Gravity<\/span>: Against enemies that\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t fly, this is a death sentence. Leave them suspended in mid-air and\n\t\t\tshoot them to death.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Seamantle<\/span>: Situational, and maybe not\n\t\t\tgreat for such a high-level spell, but that +8 cover bonus to AC is\n\t\t\ttempting for Wild Shape enthusiasts.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stormbolts<\/span>: Straight damage and\n\t\t\tpotentially stun targets. Not super exciting, but plenty effective.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally VIII<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Sunburst<\/span>: Very hard to interpret.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Lava<\/span>: Absolutely spectacular\n\t\t\tarea control. Similar in many ways to Wall of Fire, but the wall radiates\n\t\t\theat (and deals damage) on either side rather than just one side. The\n\t\t\tdamage for passing through the wall is significant, and unless the\n\t\t\tcreature has a burrow speed the need to pass a DC 25 Strength check, which\n\t\t\tis hard for even exceptionally strong creatures. You can also use the wall\n\t\t\tto attack at range as a move action, allowing you to shoot lava at\n\t\t\tcreatures while still using your standard action to do things like casting\n\t\t\tother spells. On top of all of that, any damage dealt deals have as much\n\t\t\tdamage for another 1d3 rounds after the initial damage, causing a ton of\n\t\t\textra damage and forcing Concentration checks to cast spells. The only\n\t\t\tdisappointing part is that the wall appears to be limited to a straight\n\t\t\tline.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whirlwind<\/span>: Wild Shape into an air\n\t\t\telemental or summon one.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Word of Recall<\/span>: A great way to escape\n\t\t\tcombat if things are going very poorly for you, but hopefully an allied\n\t\t\tspellcaster has something comparable that&#8217;s lower level.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-9\">9th-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Clashing Rocks<\/span>: Up to 20d6 and knock the\n\t\t\ttarget prone, plus possibly 10d6 to other creatures and knock them prone.\n\t\t\tYou can do much better with a 9th-level spell slot. I&#8217;d prefer Wall of\n\t\t\tLava over this almost every time.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cure Critical Wounds, Mass<\/span>: This is an\n\t\t\tinsultingly small amount of damage for a 9th-level spell.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elemental Swarm<\/span>: You get a lot of\n\t\t\tcreatures out of this spell, and guaranteed maximum hit points helps to\n\t\t\tcompensate for their relatively poor hit points. The problem is that this\n\t\t\ttakes 10 minutes to cast and another 20 minutes for every elemental to\n\t\t\tappear, and even then their numbers likely don&#8217;t make up for their low CR.\n\t\t\tFor the same spell slot you can cast Summon Monster IX and get 1d4+1\n\t\t\tGreater Elementals or 1d3 Elder Elementals, either of which will be much\n\t\t\tfaster, though the duration is much shorter. If you have time to prepare,\n\t\t\tthis may be a better options because you can mass your elementals before\n\t\t\tattacking or you can use them for time-consuming tasks like tearing down\n\t\t\tstructures or fighting armies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Foresight<\/span>: Insight bonuses are rare, so\n\t\t\tthis will stack with almost anything. But a 9th-level spell for +2 AC, +2\n\t\t\tto Reflex saves, and inability to be surprised feels underwhelming on a\n\t\t\t9th-level spell, especially with a 10 minutes\/level duration.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Polar Midnight<\/span>: 1d6 Dexterity damage per\n\t\t\tround for rounds\/level is enough to incapacitate basically anything in the\n\t\t\tgame. On top of that, if creatures in the area don&#8217;t move on their turn\n\t\t\tthey become encased in a wall of ice and become helpless. 5-foot steps are\n\t\t\tenough, but if you can force a creature to remain in place (grapple them\n\t\t\tand\/or knock them prone) you can easily eliminate nearly any foe without a\n\t\t\tsaving throw, including creatures which are immune to the cold damage\n\t\t\tand\/or the Dexterity damage. Just be careful not to hit your own allies.\n\t\t\tEven immunity to cold damage doesn&#8217;t negate the Dexterity damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shambler<\/span>: Considering the duration, it&#8217;s\n\t\t\tweird that this only takes a Standard Action to cast. In combat, 1d4+2\n\t\t\tShambling Mounds is just a worse version of Summon Monster IX. The real\n\t\t\tappeal is the 7-day duration. Cast this a few days before going on an\n\t\t\tadventure, and you have a small entourage of pets to follow you around at\n\t\t\tbasically no cost. They&#8217;re only CR 6 so don&#8217;t expect them to win any\n\t\t\tCR-appopriate fights, but at large size with 21 Strength then can carry\n\t\t\tstuff, break things, set off traps, and act as bodyguards for you and your\n\t\t\tparty. However, the wording of the spell doesn&#8217;t allow you to change\n\t\t\torders once they&#8217;re created, so you&#8217;ll need to know what you want to do\n\t\t\twith your shamblers before you summon them. When in doubt &#8220;guard me and my\n\t\t\tparty&#8221; is a perfectly fine choice.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shapechange<\/span>: Shapechange is very\n\t\t\tpowerful, but like any polymorph effect you need to be built to use it\n\t\t\teffectively. If you&#8217;re built to use Wild Shape, you&#8217;re ready for\n\t\t\tShapechange. Be sure to read my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph\">Practical Guide to Polymorph<\/a>\n\t\t\tif you plan to make use of Wild Shape. However, keep in mind that your\n\t\t\tWild armor only applies to Wild Shape so while turning into a dragon will\n\t\t\tfeel really great your AC may be considerably worse. Don&#8217;t forge to pick\n\t\t\tup a 1,500gp circlet as a focus.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Siege of Trees, Greater<\/span>: Too situational.\n\t\t\tBasically the only time that is is useful is when you need to ruin a\n\t\t\tstructure relatively close to a forest.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Storm of Vengeance<\/span>: Most of this spell\n\t\t\tis a mess. I think the area is intended to be a cylindar, but as-written\n\t\t\tthe spell&#8217;s area is a sphere so rain and hailstones fall from the upper\n\t\t\thalf of the sphere and disappear when they hit the bottom edge of the\n\t\t\tsphere. The damage is pitiful and slow. The biggest benefit is that this\n\t\t\tabsolutely ruins Concentration. Your spell DC plus the level of the spell\n\t\t\tbeing cast is a massively high DC that will make high-level spells all but\n\t\t\timpossible to cast. Sure, that affects you and your allies, but can enemy\n\t\t\tspellcasters also turn into a dinosaur? Because that doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\t\tConcentration, so you&#8217;re free to use Wild Shape and go eat enemy\n\t\t\tspellcasters while they struggle to do anything meaningful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Summon Elder Worm<\/span>: At CR 13 and Collossal\n\t\t\tsize, a Giant Purple Worm (don&#8217;t forget that you apply the Giant template)\n\t\t\tis a big problem for your enemies. However, it only gets two attacks and\n\t\t\twith a maximum speed of just 20 feet it&#8217;s not going far in a hurry. The\n\t\t\teasiest comparison is to Summon Froghemoth, which offers a creature of the\n\t\t\tsame CR. Personally I prefer the Froghemoth. Despite smaller size, lower\n\t\t\tattack bonus, and lower CMB, its 6 attacks, better speed, and better reach\n\t\t\tmake it much easier to grapple your enemies.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Summon Froghemoth<\/span>: With 6 attacks and\n\t\t\tdecent attack bonus and CMB the Froghemoth can do a great job grappling\n\t\t\tsmaller foes. However, it can&#8217;t fly and can&#8217;t attack beyond the reach of\n\t\t\tits tongue, so it&#8217;s only useful in situations where it can keep enemies in\n\t\t\treach.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally IX<\/span>: Versatile and\n\t\t\tpowerful, you can nearly always find something useful with Summon Nature&#8217;s\n\t\t\tAlly, and druids can cast it spontaneously. Be sure to see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor help selecting summons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tsunami<\/span>: A passable crowd control\n\t\t\toption, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s worth the spell slot. This can push\n\t\t\tenemies away from you and take them out of a fight for several rounds, but\n\t\t\tat this level it&#8217;s hard to justify the effects. This might carry off a\n\t\t\tportion of the enemies in an encounter for a few rounds, but you can\n\t\t\tisolate enemies for a few rounds with Wall of Ice or something else\n\t\t\tconsiderably lower level.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Winds of Vengeance<\/span>: If you don&#8217;t get hit\n\t\t\twith melee attacks, this grants you a 60-foot (perfect) fly speed for 1\n\t\t\tminute per caster level. Sure, you can fly underwater in an a vacuum, but\n\t\t\tif you want to be fast in the water you can Wild Shape into a fish or\n\t\t\tsomething.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">World Wave<\/span>: Either a weaker version of\n\t\t\tTsunami or a long-distance travel option that deliberately lays waste to\n\t\t\tevery bit of civilization in its path, including roads, dams, bridges,\n\t\t\thomes, farms, and all sorts of things that people need to live in a world\n\t\t\tfull of monsters. If a player used this in one of my games, I would likely\n\t\t\tconsider shifting their alignment to evil because of their clear, callous\n\t\t\tdisregard for the wellbeing of the creatures affected by the spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Beaststrike Club<\/span> (7,300 gp): Just cast\n\t\t\tShillelagh.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-armor\">Armor\/Shields<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wild<\/span> (+3): Extremely expensive, but\n\t\t\tkeeping your armor bonus to AC while you&#8217;re in Wild Shape will give you a\n\t\t\tsignificant defensive boost. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not sure how this\n\t\t\tinteracts with magically shaped wooden armor, so you may need to buy armor\n\t\t\tmade of stone or dragonhide. Your GM might allow you to use Shape Wood and\n\t\t\tIronwood before permanently enchanting a suit of armor, but I can&#8217;t find\n\t\t\tany official rules for doing so.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rings\">Rings<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Counterspells<\/span>: Druids have a lot of\n\t\t\treally good buffs with long durations, and having them dispelled really\n\t\t\thurts.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Eloquence<\/span>: Allows you to speek while\n\t\t\tusing Wild Shape, and adds a small Competence bonus to Charisma-based\n\t\t\tskills to offset your dumped Charisma. Beastspeak can handle the speed\n\t\t\tproblem, but its duration is only 10 minutes\/levels, so it&#8217;ll run out long\n\t\t\tbefore your hours\/level Wild Shape duration does.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Natural Attunement (Kami)<\/span>: Adds a number\n\t\t\tof useful summon options, including high-level healing options to address\n\t\t\tgaps in the Druid&#8217;s spell list. For more information, see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/summon_natures_ally\">Practical Guide to Summon Nature&#8217;s Ally<\/a><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection<\/span>: A helpful AC boost for any\n\t\t\tcharacter, but especially useful for druids because the bonus persists in\n\t\t\tWild Shape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sacred Mistletoe<\/span>: Move through spells\n\t\t\tlike Entangle, Thorny Entanglement, and Wall of Thorns unimpeded and\n\t\t\tunharmed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rods\">Rods<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extend<\/span>: A lesser rod works really well\n\t\t\tfor a lot of your low-level spells like Goodberry, Barkskin, and Magic\n\t\t\tFang.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"staffs\">Staffs<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to recommend specific staffs without knowing your individual character, so instead I want to make a general endorsement of the concept of magic staffs in Pathfinder. If you are a 3.5 native, go read Pathfinder&#8217;s rules for staffs because they have improved dramatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staffs are a reliable, rechargeable source of extra spellcasting that can give spellcasters easy and reliable access to spells from their spell list which they might not want to learn, or which they might like to use so frequently that they can&#8217;t prepare the spell enough times in a given day. On days when you&#8217;re not adventuring (traveling, resting, etc.) you can easily recharge any staff even if you can only cast one of the spells which the staff contains.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wands\">Wands<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cure Light Wounds<\/span>: A crucial source of\n\t\t\thealing for your party.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Armor<\/span>: You can&#8217;t use it on your\n\t\t\town, but if you have a friendly arcane caster they can give you a hefty\n\t\t\tarmor bonus for an hour at a time. This is a crucial defensive option\n\t\t\twhile you&#8217;re using wild shape until you can afford Wild armor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Amulet, Frost Fist<\/span>: At first glance this\n\t\t\tlooks like it could work for Wild Shape, but it only works on attacks made\n\t\t\twith hands, which limits you to primate forms like apes and monkeys.\n\t\t<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Amulet of Mighty Fists<\/span>: Works with\n\t\t\tnatural weapons, which is perfect for Wild Shape. A +1 enhancement bonus\n\t\t\twill save you the trouble of casting Greater Magic Fang constantly, but if\n\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t mind spending that spell slot it&#8217;ll save you gold to spend on\n\t\t\tmore interesting weapon properties.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Amulet of Natural Armor<\/span>: Cast Barkskin.\n\t\t\tThe two don&#8217;t stack because they&#8217;re both enhancement bonuses to natural\n\t\t\tarmor, but they&#8217;ll both stack with the natural armor bonus from Wild\n\t\t\tShape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Beast-bond Brand<\/span>: Too situational. There\n\t\t\tjust aren&#8217;t many spells with range: personal that will be helpful for your\n\t\t\tcompanion.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Belt of (Some Ability Score)<\/span>: Wild\n\t\t\tShape users will want to emphasize this heavily, but druids who don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tfight in Wild Shape can probably forgo this.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bracers, Spellguard<\/span>: Better than Combat\n\t\t\tCasting. If you spend time in melee with any frequency, these are\n\t\t\tessential.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circlet of Wisdom<\/span>: Your casting ability\n\t\t\tis still important, even if you&#8217;re emphasizing Wild Shape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to\n\t\t\tforego.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Polymorphic Pouch<\/span>: Useful for accessing\n\t\t\twands, scrolls, potions, and material components while you&#8217;re\n\t\t\twildshaped.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Eloquence<\/span>: Allows you to speak\n\t\t\twhile using Wild Shape. You can also cast Beastspeak, but this won&#8217;t\n\t\t\tconsume a spell slot. Either option works fine, it&#8217;s just a matter of\n\t\t\twhether you need the spell slot or the gold more.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ring of Protection<\/span>: Essential,\n\t\t\tespecially if you plan to use Wild Shape.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vestment, Druid&#8217;s<\/span>: A single extra use\n\t\t\tof Wild Shape generally isn&#8217;t a big deal, especially by the time you can\n\t\t\teasily afford this, but if Wild Shape is your go-to option in combat it&#8217;s\n\t\t\ta great choice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"permanent-spells\">Permanent Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic Fang, Greater<\/span>: Excellent if you\n\t\t\tplan to use Wild Shape. +1 to all natural weapons is a great choice and\n\t\t\tcosts just 7,500gp. That&#8217;s expensive compared to an Amulet of Mighty Fists\n\t\t\tat 4,000gp, but if you want to use your Amulet of Mighty Fists for more\n\t\t\tinteresting abilities (flaming, Impact, etc.), this will save you\n\t\t\tmoney.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you plan to multiclass, consider the Shaping Focus feat to continue advancing your Wild Shape for up to 4 levels.
