We\u2019ve even gotten two ways to specialize in it in just 5th edition D&amp;D. With the 2024 rules update, the Beast Master has become, in my opinion, the strongest Ranger subclass out there. Bringing enormous damage and roughly twice the hitpoints of a regular Ranger, you end up being the sort of Defender who fills the role by being in the way and unignorable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>You can also play this for the flavor. The Beast companion is mentally on par with your average Barbarian and, while it can\u2019t speak, it understands the languages you know and could theoretically be taught to write or even sign basic concepts. This could be a fabulous way for a DM to feed the party hints from whatever higher power the Ranger serves (or just a neat way to build some roleplaying).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you\u2019re scared because you\u2019ve read my 2014 Beast Master Handbook and didn\u2019t like that the example build was more about making Drizzt than being actually optimized, fear not.

It has a separate pool of hit\n\t\tpoints to draw damage away from you and the rest of your party, and its\n\t\tattacks do as much damage as yours do. Your beast&#8217;s stats are based on your\n\t\tWisdom modifier, so strongly consider building around Wisdom.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unlike summoned pets which other classes might use (Dancing Item,\n\t\t\tWildfire Spirit, etc.), your pet sticks around all the time. You don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tneed to summon it or whatever. However, like any other member of your\n\t\t\tparty, it needs food, healing, rest, etc.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The abilities to easily revive your beast with any spell slot and to\n\t\t\treplace the beast after a Long Rest mean that your beast is functionally\n\t\t\tdisposable. If it dies in combat, or if you need to change beasts to\n\t\t\tchange tactics, doing so is nearly as easy as casting a new summon\n\t\t\tspell.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Commanding your beast monopolizes your Bonus Action. This directly\n\t\t\tconflicts with casting Hunter&#8217;s Mark, which is a significant problem for\n\t\t\tthe Ranger, but your beast&#8217;s damage is good enough to make up the gap.\n\t\t\tThis gets a little messy when you pick up Bestial Fury at level 11 and\n\t\t\tyour beast also benefits from your Hunter&#8217;s Mark damage bonus, but by that\n\t\t\tpoint your beast&#8217;s attacks are more impactful than Hunter&#8217;s Mark. Expect\n\t\t\tto use Hunter&#8217;s Mark only in encounters against big single foes, otherwise\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;ll waste your Bonus Action to move it around when you should be commanding\n\t\t\tyour beast.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Beast of the Land<\/span>: Simple and iconic.\n\t\t\t\tWith 40 ft. land and climb speed, this thing can get around very\n\t\t\t\tquickly. The damage will match or exceed a weapon, and Charge allows\n\t\t\t\tyour companion to knock foes prone if they can get a running start.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Beast of the Sea<\/span>: Only viable in\n\t\t\t\taquatic campaigns. 5-foot land speed is not enough for your sharktopus\n\t\t\t\tto hobble around on land and be effective in combat. If you can somehow\n\t\t\t\tget its speed up to reasonable amount (look for spells like Longstrider\n\t\t\t\twith long durations which don&#8217;t require Concentration), you may be able\n\t\t\t\tto make this work on land. If you can do it, the Beast of the Sea&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tattacks grapple when they hit, which is a powerful option not normally\n\t\t\t\tavailable to players.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast of the Sky<\/span>: 60-foot fly speed\n\t\t\t\tand Flyby. Less hit points than the other options, but with the ability\n\t\t\t\tto remain perpetually out of melee reach that&#8217;s less of a problem. The\n\t\t\t\tdamage is also slightly lower than Beast of the Land, but Beast of the\n\t\t\t\tLand deals 6.5+PB on average and the Beast of the Sky&#8217;s 5.5+PB isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tnoticeably lower. Having a flying companion discourages you from using\n\t\t\t\tyour companion as a Defender by interposing itself between you and your\n\t\t\t\tenemies, but Beast of the Sky&#8217;s AC is just as good as the other options\n\t\t\t\tand if your companion&#8217;s hit points are looking problematic it can use\n\t\t\t\tFlyby to withdraw to safety.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exceptional Training<\/span>: The Bonus Action\n\t\toptions are fantastic. Disengage will let your companion move out of melee\n\t\tsafely, but you want it in melee tanking hits for your less durable party\n\t\tmembers. Help will give you or an ally Advantage on a high-value attack.\n\t\tMost of the time you&#8217;ll default to Dodge, which will significantly improve\n\t\tyour beast&#8217;s durability.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Making your companion&#8217;s attacks deal Force damage lets you bypass nearly\n\t\t\tall damage resistances. Resistance to non-magic weapon attacks is common\n\t\t\tand becomes more common as you gain levels.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestial Fury<\/span>: Double your beast&#8217;s damage\n\t\toutput. The bonus damage from Hunter&#8217;s Mark is mostly a consolation prize\n\t\tfor giving up your beast&#8217;s attacks for a turn in order to cast Hunter&#8217;s\n\t\tMark. Don&#8217;t rush to cast it just to get the 1d6 damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"15\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Share Spells<\/span>: This is a fantastic way to\n\t\tshare buff spells. You can use options like Cure Wounds, but don&#8217;t expect to\n\t\tcast those frequently.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"-can-the-beast-companion-take-the-bestial-strike-action-twice\">Can the Beast Companion Take the Bestial Strike Action Twice?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people may ask how the companion gets two attacks. It\u2019s not perfectly clear, so let\u2019s take a look at the rules, and you and your table can come to an informed agreement about how to handle things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the 2024 Player&#8217;s Handbook:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Beast\u2019s Strike action.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the beast shares your turn, it performs the command you give it immediately. The confusion comes from the word \u201calso\u201d in the second sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can interpret the text to mean that using a Bonus Action is the primary way to command your beast, but you also have the option to command your beast by replacing an attack, but you can only command it to take the Beast\u2019s Strike action rather than commanding to do something else, such as Disengage. This means that you can use your Bonus Action for things like spellcasting, which is helpful if you plan to cast Hunter\u2019s Mark to benefit from the second half of the Bestial Fury feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if that was the intent, the word \u201cinstead\u201d should have been used in place of \u201calso\u201d. \u201cAlso\u201d means that you can do both, and there\u2019s no further text preventing you from doing so. This creates a specific-beats-general situation where, RAW, you can command it as a Bonus Action and also command it to use Beast\u2019s Strike as part of your Attack Action. This creates one of two outcomes when the player spends their Bonus Action and then also replaces an attack to command their beast:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The beast takes one specified Action and then also takes the Beast\u2019s Strike action despite having only one Action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The player has effectively wasted either their Bonus Action or the attack that they\u2019ve traded.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to say that the DnD design team would not leave a rules trap in the text which caused players to needlessly waste a resource for no benefit, but we\u2019ve been running RPGBOT for well over a decade. Yes, they would do exactly that. Not intentionally, but they\u2019re human beings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re mostly certain that the RAI is for this to provide flexibility so that you can make your beast attack once per turn with either your own Attack or your Bonus Action, but the RPGBOT optimization panel has voted and we agree that, RAW, this language makes the most sense interpreted to mean that your beast can attack twice. If they were aiming for flexibility instead, they shouldn&#8217;t have used &#8220;also&#8221; and had the second command option be a separate sentence. But, just like with any unclear rules text, we encourage you to discuss this with your own group and and arrive at a decision that works for your table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Beast Master Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The focus on Wisdom allows for an interesting different choice from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-ranger\/#backgrounds\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"27768\">typical ranger<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sage<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>:Increase Wisdom and Con and pick up a few tools that will help us along the way.\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>For information and advice regarding Origin Feats, including those granted by your Background, see the Beast Master Feats section, below.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Beast Master Species<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Our Bonus Action will be full basically forever once we hit level 3, so avoid any Species that has Bonus-Action-using features.

This means your Shillelagh will have between 1 and 9 rounds left of its duration when a fight starts, which will be good enough for the whole fight an average of 2\/3ds of the time. That matters because we\u2019re going to be up next to targets and need to do something with our extra attack that we can\u2019t donate to our Beast.<br><br>While we could be using our Concentration on Hunter\u2019s Mark now that we\u2019re actually attacking again (and probably will once we run out of spell slots), Summon Beast is much better DPR.<br><br>With Summon Beast up and ideal conditions otherwise (charge attack for Prone and extra damage, etc), DPR is almost 40, rapidly approaching Dude Stop, and we have three bodies in melee blocking space and drawing attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Roving<\/td><td>Our Beast already had a climb speed, but now we do, too.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Exceptional Training<br><br>Spell Prepared:<br>&#8211; Enhance Ability<\/td><td>Normal, sane uses for this ability: taking Disengage as a Bonus Action so the Beast can move 20 ft. backwards and 20 ft. forward again, triggering the second half of Beast of the Land\u2019s Beast Strike. This is very good and probably what you should do most of the time.<br><br>Things Random would do: The timing of when it takes its Bonus Action isn\u2019t specified, so you can have the Beast use its Bonus Action first. Resummon your Beast as a Beast of the Sea. Dash doesn\u2019t give you another pool of movement, it just doubles your movement pool for the turn.
