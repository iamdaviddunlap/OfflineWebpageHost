They excel as a Support character, but make decent Defenders,\n\tHealers, and Strikers, too. With the right infusions and spells, they can fill\n\tnearly any role in the party, making the Artificer&#8217;s versatility rival that of\n\tthe Bard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Artificer has been a popular concept since at least 3rd edition, where\n\tthe Artificer first appeared as a class unique to the Eberron campaign\n\tsetting. Since then, the class has reappeared in 4th edition, and was in high\n\tdemand when 5th edition was released, but didn&#8217;t see a final release until\n\tfully 5 years after 5th edition&#8217;s initial release. The concept of a character\n\twho performs magic by binding it to items and who crafted all sorts of\n\ttechnological or magical gadgets is a fun novelty in a game where magic rarely\n\ttakes those forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Artificer is complicated. This is not a class I would recommend\n\tfor new players or for players who suffer from analysis paralysis. The\n\tArtificer has more decision points than any class to date, including the\n\tWizard. Every time you finish a long rest you can reset your prepared spells,\n\tshuffle where you apply all of your infusions, and pick magic items from a\n\tlist of some 40+ options. While some of these decisions may remain static for\n\tlong periods of time, the intent of the class is that you will tailor your\n\tabilities day-to-day to suit the challenges you expect to face. While that\n\tversatility and adaptability is very powerful, it also requires a great deal\n\tof micromanagement of your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the sort of class that can be rewarding for players who enjoy\n\t&#8220;crunch&#8221; and fiddling with their character&#8217;s build, but which will be\n\tabsolutely punishing for players who don&#8217;t like to spend hours agonizing over\n\tthe differences between individual character options. The need to manage\n\tspells and infusions plus the mental load of trying to make tool proficiencies\n\tuseful is often frustrating for many players, but I have always enjoyed\n\texactly those sorts of challenges, so I&#8217;ve enjoyed artificers every time I&#8217;ve\n\tplayed one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Several of the Artificer&#8217;s features are related to crafting and to magic\n\titems. If your game does not allow item crafting or does not use magic items,\n\tyou&#8217;re going to miss out on those features. Of course, you may also be the\n\tonly source of magic items, which makes you a very popular member of your\n\tparty. Most published games don&#8217;t leave space for downtime and crafting and\n\talso provide pre-determined magic items which might not appeal to your\n\tparty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In those situations I&#8217;ve found that changing your infusions to fill gaps for your party is immensely effective, and your party may be willing to trade permanent magic items among the group if everyone ends up happy with whatever items and infusions they&#8217;re using at any given moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is for the latest version of the Artificer class.

You&#8217;ll probably want to\n\tremain at range, but if you find yourself in melee a lot be sure to pad your\n\thit points with False Life, plenty of Constitution, and as many AC boosts as\n\tyou can manage.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saves<\/span>: Constitution is great, especially\n\tsince many artificers fight on the front lines where you&#8217;ll be repeatedly\n\tmaking saves to maintain Concentration. Intelligence saves are exceptionally\n\trare.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor and shields\n\twill keep you alive in melee, but with only simple weapons your best Finesse\n\toption is a dagger. That&#8217;s fine for most artificers since fighting with ranged\n\tspells is your best option, but the Battlesmith will eventually take up\n\tmartial weapons and use Intelligence for their attacks and damage. The\n\tArtificer&#8217;s skills are mostly Intelligence and Wisdom-based, and most are\n\tknowledge skills, but Sleight of Hand is an option. You also get three tool\n\tproficiencies, which gives you room to tailor your character to the theme\n\tyou&#8217;re going for. Your Artificer Specialist (your subclass) will grant you proficiency in an\n\tadditional set of tools relevant to the subclass at 3rd level.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Tinkering<\/span>: This is very similar to\n\tcantrips like Prestidigitation. The effects are interesting and unique, and if\n\tyou&#8217;re clever you can come up with all kinds of uses for Magical Tinkering.\n\tYou can have multiple objects affected at the same time, so consider carrying\n\taround a few prepared items which you can quickly produce and use.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Artificers are a 2\/3 caster\n\tthat prepares and casts spells like a cleric (prepare daily from the full\n\tclass list). You get ritual casting, which is always great, and the spell list\n\tis a combination of options from the cleric and wizard spell lists, allowing the Artificer\n\tto serve as a Blaster, a Healer, and a Support caster. Notably, the Artificer\n\tcan retrain a cantrip every level. To the best of my knowledge, the Artificer\n\tis the only class with the ability to replace cantrips unless you allow\n\toptional class features.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>The Artificer&#8217;s spellcasting foci are also unique. Rather than a wand or\n\tsomething, you use Thieves&#8217; Tools or a set of Artisan&#8217;s Tools. You can wave a\n\tset of lockpicks around to cast fireball, which I think will inevitably lead\n\tto some laughs at the table and countless goofy characters using weird tools\n\tto perform magic.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>You can also use any item that&#8217;s the subject of one of your infusions, which\n\tmeans that if you have infused a weapon or a shield you can easily have a\n\tfocus in hand without dropping your weapon or shield to pull out a wand or\n\tsomething. Your choice of subclass will add additional focus options, but\n\tthey&#8217;re typically no better than what the Artificer gets by default, though\n\tthey&#8217;ll certainly fit the theme of your subclass.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>It&#8217;s also very important to note that the Artificer must <em>always<\/em> use\n\ta focus when casting spells. Errata and the updated version of the Artificer\n\tclass explain that this adds a Material component to all of the Artificer&#8217;s\n\tspells. Thanks to the core rules for spell components, this means that you can\n\talways use the hand holding your focus to perform somatic components. That\n\tmakes the Artificer the only spellcaster who can perform every one of their\n\tspells with items in both of their hands. (Typically you can&#8217;t perform somatic\n\tcomponents with a focus in your hand unless the spell also requires an\n\tinexpensive material component. I complain about this rule frequently.)<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>Artificers get surprisingly few prepared spells (level\/2+Int), which can be\n\tvery limiting and makes good spell selection crucial. For help selecting\n\tspells, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/spells\"\n\t\t>Artificer Spell List Breakdown<\/a\n\t>.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infuse Item<\/span>: This may be the Artificer&#8217;s\n\tmost iconic ability. You get to start with two infused items chosen from four\n\tInfusion known, which is like getting two magic items at 2nd level. For\n\tadvice on Infusions, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/infusions\"\n\t\t>Artificer Infusions Breakdown<\/a\n\t>.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Artificer Specialist<\/strong>: Artificer subclasses are briefly\n\tsummarized below.

If you&#8217;re short on gold, you might not be\n\table to afford the tools related to your subclass. Instead, you get this. I\n\tthink the expectation is that you can use this to craft the tools for your\n\tsubclass for free, and trade them out for other tools when you need them.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tool Expertise<\/span>: There&#8217;s a reason WotC is\n\tcomfortable granting universal expertise with tools: unless the DM is going\n\tout of their way or you are making a truly impressive effort, most tool\n\tproficiencies rarely matter beyond the flavor of your character. I can&#8217;t think\n\tof an instance where a character made frequent checks with Brewer&#8217;s Tools over\n\tthe course of a campaign, for example. However, the notable exception of\n\tThieves&#8217; Tools means that Tool Expertise has at least one important use case\n\tin a typical campaign.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flash of Genius<\/span>: A bonus of up to +5 on a\n\tsave can easily turn a failed save or check into a successful one, and using\n\tthis up to 5 times a day means that it&#8217;s a powerful and reliable part of your\n\tskillset.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Magic item Adept<\/span>: Attuning one additional\n\titem is typically not a huge difference, but considering many Infusions\n\trequire attunement, this can be very important in campaigns which include\n\tmagic items. The ability to craft your own magic items faster and for less\n\tgold improves this ability further because you can craft items which require\n\tattunement with less concern about the limited number of items you can attune.\n\tIf you don&#8217;t have an All-Purpose Tool yet, build one now. It will take half a\n\tweek and 100 gold. Congratulations, you now have a magical tool that grants\n\tproficiency in all artisan tools. Use that to craft more magic items for\n\teveryone.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spell-Storing Item<\/span>: It may only be a 1st- or\n\t2nd-level spell, but you can cast it up to 10 times per day at 20\n\tIntelligence.

Cantrips will deal similar damage, but 1d6+Int+1 damage (Repeating Shot adds +1 to attack and damage) with Extra Attack will outdo your cantrip damage for a long time. If you have 20 Intelligence, two attacks at 1d6+5+1 (avg. 19 total) will exceed Firebolt (avg. 5.5, 11, 16.5, and 22 depending on your level) until your cantrips improve for the last time at 17th level. If you instead use a pistol, you&#8217;ll average 23 damage instead, and at that point there&#8217;s no reason to learn Fire Bolt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"firearms\">Firearms<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Artificer is the first class to be published with reference to firearms, but firearms canonically do not exist in the Eberron setting from which the Artificer originates.

The ability to borrow a spell from\n\t\tany spell list for a day is more appealing, but since your spells stop at\n\t\t6th level it&#8217;s good but not amazing.

The crossbow is useful when enemies are outside of your cantrip range, but you&#8217;ll have better results if you sell it and use the gold to buy a shield.<br><br>At this level your options are really limited. You&#8217;ll feel more like a weird wizard than like an actual artificer. Keep your shield out, prepare spells that will keep you alive, and just try to make it to 2nd level. Fire Bolt will deal enough damage to make you useful in combat, and you long list of proficiencies, Tinker, and Magical Tinkering give you plenty of utility options outside of combat. Bring Cure Wounds to help your allies in combat, but try to avoid using it until you absolutely need to do so; you only have two spell slots<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Infuse Item<br>Infused Items: 2<br>Infusions Known<br>&#8211; Enhanced Arcane Focus<br>&#8211; Enhanced Defense<br>&#8211; Enhanced Weapon<br>&#8211; Replicate Magic Item (Bag of Holding)<\/td><td>Level 2 is where the Artificer really starts to feel like they\n\t\t\t\t\t\tshould. You don&#8217;t get any more spell slots, but 2 magic items can be\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta massive improvement to your capabilities.<br><br>If you need nothing else, use Enhanced Arcane Focus and Enhanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDefense to boost your spell attacks and your AC. +1 to AC will bring\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou up to 19 AC, giving you nearly as much AC as a fighter in full\n\t\t\t\t\t\tplate. If you have allies to defend you, consider sharing Enhanced\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDefense and\/or Enhanced Weapon.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Artificer Specialist: Alchemist<br>The Right Tool for the Job<br>Tool Proficiency: Any<br>Alchemist Spells<br>Experimental Elixir (1)<\/td><td>Third level brings a lot of good things. You get another 1st-level spell slot just in time to get an expanded spell list, including the absolutely essential Healing Word. You can stop preparing Cure Wounds, and instead rely on Healing Word for emergency healing in combat.<br><br>The Alchemist gains proficiency with Alchemist&#8217;s Supplies, but we got that at first level, so you get to replace it with any other tool proficiency.<br><br>The Right Tool for the Job doesn&#8217;t change much, but it&#8217;s basically a free set of tools.<br><br>This level also brings Experimental Elixir. The free elixir won&#8217;t reliably be something that you can count on, but you can turn spells into elixirs to get a bunch of useful buffs.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Constitution Intelligence 16 -&gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t18)<\/td><td>A bunch of extra hit points, and your spell attacks, DC&#8217;s, and a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbunch of other things improve.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Alchemical Savant<\/td><td>At this level, Alchemical Savant is a +4 bonus to one roll per\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspell. Your cantrips also improve at this spell, so you go from 1d10\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Fire Bolt to 2d10+4, which is a massive increase. Your leveled\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspells benefit too: Healing Word is now 1d4+8 instead of 1d4+4.<br><br>5th level also brings 2nd-level spells. The Alchemist&#8217;s spell list\n\t\t\t\t\t\toffers two offensive options, so be sure to prepare something else\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthat will make good use of your 2nd-level spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Tool Expertise<br>Infused Items: 3<br>New Infusions Known:<br>&#8211; Resistant Armor<br>&#8211; Replicate Magic Item (Lantern of Revealing)<br>Experimental Elixir (2)<\/td><td>Several things improve incrementally at this level. You get access\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto the second group of Infusions and the second group of options for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReplicate Magic Item, and you get a third Infused Item per day.<br><br>You have plenty of options for infusions. Resistant Armor (fire) is\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta great defensive option, but feel free to experiment. You get to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tretrain one option at every level (including this one), so you could\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrade out low-level Infusions for new options as you gain levels if\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou find that you&#8217;re not using older options.<br><br>You also gain Tool Expertise at this level, doubling your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproficiency bonus with all five of your tool proficiencies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Flash of Genius<\/td><td>It&#8217;s hard to understate how good Flash of Genius is. +4 can turn a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfailure into a success very easily. +4 covers 20% of the range over\n\t\t\t\t\t\twhich a d20 can roll, and when your Intelligence improves again at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8th level it gets even better.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Improvement (Intelligence 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>It may not feel exciting, but this improves a lot about your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharacter. The Artificer is massively dependent on Intelligence, so\n\t\t\t\t\t\tany improvement is significant.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Restorative Reagents<\/td><td>By now you get two doses of Experimental Elixir per day, but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfree elixirs are still not reliably useful. This adds some Temporary\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHit points to their effects, so even if you don&#8217;t roll a useful\n\t\t\t\t\t\teffect you can still get some Temporary Hit Points out of the extra\n\t\t\t\t\t\telixirs. You also get to cast Lesser Restoration 5 times per day for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfree, which allows you to use your limited spell slots for anything\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Magic Item Adept<br>Infused Items: 4<br>New Infusions Known<br>&#8211; Replicate Magic Item (Cloak of Protection)<br>&#8211; Replicate Magic Item (Winged Boots)<\/td><td>Allowing you to attune four magic items is very useful at this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoint. Now that you can create four Infused Items per day, you could\n\t\t\t\t\t\teasily make four that require Attunement. That&#8217;s probably not a good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tidea, but it&#8217;s possible.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e Artificer<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":22862,"parent":2618,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"post-templates\/article-page.php","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[24,17],"tags":[12,36,5],"class_list":["post-2619","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-dnd","category-dnd5","tag-characters","tag-dnd","tag-dnd5","has_thumb"],"rankMath":{"parentDomain":"rpgbot.net","noFollowDomains":[],"noFollowExcludeDomains":[],"noFollowExternalLinks":false,"featuredImageNotice":"The featured image should be at least 200 by 200 pixels to be picked up by Facebook and other social media sites.","pluginReviewed":false,"postSettings":{"linkSuggestions":true,"useFocusKeyword":false},"frontEndScore":false,"postName":"artificer","permalinkFormat":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/%pagename%\/","showLockModifiedDate":true,"assessor":{"focusKeywordLink":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-admin\/edit.php?focus_keyword=%focus_keyword%&post_type=%post_type%","hasTOCPlugin":{"simpletoc\/plugin.php":"SimpleTOC"},"primaryTaxonomy":false,"serpData":{"title":"","description":"The Artificer is a class with a tool to solve every problem.
