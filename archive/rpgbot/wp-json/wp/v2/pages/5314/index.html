You trade effectiveness with sneak attacks using other weapons, but with a bit of effort you really won&#8217;t need any other weapons. Because thrown weapons work off of Two-Weapon Fighting instead of Rapid Shot, the Knife Master can easily switch between flanking or throwing daggers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Like any Rogue, the Knife Master is a Striker in combat. Because the archetype doesn&#8217;t change the Rogue&#8217;s fantastic skill list, it is also wise to invest in skills to help the party with traps and other common adventuring hazards. You give up Trapfinding in exchange for additional damage abilities, so you may wish to avoid this archetype in games which involve a lot of traps. However, because you&#8217;re not very good at dealing with traps, this is a good opportunity to play a Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Rogue Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: At d8 hit points, the Rogue is\n\tfairly squishy. Because many rogues work best in melee, hit points are a\n\tserious concern and Rogues need to be sure to keep their AC high.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Rogues get medium BAB\n\tprogression, which causes them some problems. With lower BAB than a fighter,\n\tthey will often have trouble hitting their targets, and must look for\n\tadditional bonuses elsewhere. In addition, lower BAB means that Rogues get\n\titerative attacks later than Fighters, which can hurt the Rogue&#8217;s damage\n\toutput<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Your only good save is Reflex, and\n\tcoupled with typically high Dexterity and Evasion, your reflexes are\n\texcellent. However, you will need to invest in your other saves to protect\n\tagainst other hazards.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Rogue doesn&#8217;t get a lot\n\tof big exciting weapons, but they get everything that they need to get the job\n\tdone.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Rogues get the most skills and have\n\tthe best skill list. However, because the Rogue gets so many skill options, it\n\tcan be very difficult to invest in every rogue skill unless your intelligence\n\tis exceptionally high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span>: A pile of d6&#8217;s to drop on your\n\tfoes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): With your high reflex saves,\n\tEvasion will save you from a lot of damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rogue Talents<\/span>: Basically Rogue-only feats,\n\tRogue Talents offer a huge number of excellent ways to customize and improve\n\tyour Rogue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: The ability to never be\n\tcaught flat-footed is nice, but somewhat situational. If you are expecting to\n\tbe attacked, you can do silly things like using Full Defense every round until\n\tyou get attacked.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: This will basically\n\tnever come up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Talents<\/span>: Add an extra list of\n\tconsiderably better Rogue Talents.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Strike<\/span>: Basically the Assassin&#8217;s\n\tDeath Strike ability.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetype-features\">Archetype Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hidden Blade<\/span>: Hiding weapons on your body\n\tis very rarely important, unless your campaign involves a lot of espionage.\n\tHowever, there are ways to capitalize on hidden weapons, and this reduces your\n\tneed to invest ranks in Sleight of Hand.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Stab<\/span> (Ex): The keystone of the\n\tarchetype, this bumps your sneak attack dice to d8&#8217;s with your primary weapon.\n\tYou can sneak attack with several weapons which are considered &#8220;knives&#8221;, but\n\tthe dagger is the best option.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Blade Sense<\/span> (Ex): Extremely situational.\n\tUnless you challenge someone to a knife fight, you may never get to use this\n\tability. It&#8217;s about as situational as Trap Sense, so no big loss here.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Compatible Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bandit<\/span>: While not stellar on its own,\n\t\tBandit combines well with the Underhanded Rogue Talent and the Quick Draw\n\t\tfeat to let us draw a hidden dagger as a move action and deal maximum sneak\n\t\tattack damage during the surprise round. Combined with the Knife Master&#8217;s d8\n\t\tsneak attack damage, that&#8217;s a very impressive surprise round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Burglar<\/span>: This is awful on its best day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sanctified Rogue<\/span>: This won&#8217;t get you\n\t\tanything really interesting, but it&#8217;s a cool flavor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Scout<\/span>: The Scout is a truly fantastic\n\t\tarchetype for the rogue because it provides an easy way to get Sneak Attack\n\t\twithout hiding or relying on flanking. However, because you generally only\n\t\tget one attack after you move, this can severely limit your damage\n\t\toutput.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Trapsmith<\/span>: You gave up Trapfinding, so you\n\t\twill be a really terrible Trapsmith.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Like many rogues, the Knife Master suffers badly from Multiple Ability Dependency (MAD). You can sacrifice portions of your characters functionality by sacrificing ability scores, but I find that a balanced approach will allow you to cover all of the roles generally expected from a rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Your damage comes from sneak\n\t\tattack, so don&#8217;t put any serious resources into Strength. Don&#8217;t dump it to\n\t\t7, but don&#8217;t feel like you actually need to increase it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity is the rogue&#8217;s first\n\t\tability in almost every build, and this is no exception.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: The Knife Master is a combat build,\n\t\tand you will want hit points on top of your d8 hit die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Int<\/span>: Skill points. You need them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wis<\/span>: The rogue&#8217;s low will save hurts, but\n\t\tWisdom gets us less than any other ability score, and we have to make\n\t\tsacrifices somewhere.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: A bit of Charisma opens up a lot of\n\t\toptions for you, and since the Knife Master doesn&#8217;t get Trapfinding, you are\n\t\ta good choice to serve as a Face for the party.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Arrray<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:12<\/li>\n<li>Dex:18<\/li>\n<li>Con:12<\/li>\n<li>Int:12<\/li>\n<li>Wis:10<\/li>\n<li>Cha:12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:10<\/li>\n<li>Dex:18<\/li>\n<li>Con:12<\/li>\n<li>Int:12<\/li>\n<li>Wis:8<\/li>\n<li>Cha:11<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str:10<\/li>\n<li>Dex:15<\/li>\n<li>Con:14<\/li>\n<li>Int:13<\/li>\n<li>Wis:8<\/li>\n<li>Cha:12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity bonuses are key, but other bonuses can also provide options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: Darkvision is really fantastic on any\n\trogue, but the penalty to Charisma limits our options, and the Dwarf brings\n\tvery little to the Knife Master offensively.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: Bonuses to Dexterity and Intelligence\n\tare fantastic on any Rogue, but that&#8217;s all that the Elf really gets us.\n\tAlternate racial traits can get you a few more options, but they won&#8217;t help\n\tthe Knife Master significantly more than the basic Elf.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: The penalty to strength hurts our\n\tdamage a little bit, but small size doesn&#8217;t hurt rogues much, and provides\n\tnice bonuses to Stealth, attacks, and AC. The bonus Charisma helps a bit,\n\tthough not as much as a bonus to dexterity. The slow speed also hurts a bit,\n\tbut can be overcome with items and careful positioning.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The flexible ability score bonus\n\tgoes into Dexterity, but many of the other racial traits can be swapped out\n\tfor more useful options. The Half-Elf favored class bonus is garbage, so take\n\tthe Elf or Human favored class bonuses instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The flexible ability score bonus\n\tgoes into Dexterity, the bonus to Intimidate is a nice perk, and you get\n\tDarkvision. The favored class bonus is garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: Bonuses to Dexterity and Charisma\n\tmake the Halfling a natural Rogue. The Fleet of Foot alternate racial trait\n\tallows you to overcome the slow speed, and the bonus to Perception is welcome\n\ton any character. The bonus to saves also helps improve the Rogue&#8217;s weak\n\tdefenses. Unfortunately, the favored class bonus is terrible so take the Human\n\tfavored class bonuses instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: As usual, the Human is a great option\n\tfor the Knife Master. A bonus feat and an extra skill rank per level open up a\n\tton of great options, and the flexible ability score bonus can go right into\n\tDexterity. The favored class bonus grants additional Rogue Talents, which adds\n\ta lot of great options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): Your dexterity\n\t\tsaves are already fantastic, but more never hurts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dirty Fighter<\/span> (Combat): 1 point of damage\n\t\tmight not seem like a lot, but for a Knife master built for flanking, flat\n\t\tdamage bonuses add up very quickly.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fencer<\/span> (Combat): Attacks of Opportunity\n\t\treally aren&#8217;t a good thing for Rogues to focus on.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hidden Hand<\/span> (Combat): The bonus to hide\n\t\tweapons is nice, but the real draw is the attack bonus with light weapons\n\t\tduring the surprise round.

Put at least one rank here so that you can hide some daggers,\n\t\tbut don&#8217;t bother focusing on it. Remember that the Knife Master archetype\n\t\talso gives you a class bonus to hiding items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): The Rogue&#8217;s bread and\n\t\tbutter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swim<\/span> (Str): Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Use Magic Device<\/span> (Cha): One of the most\n\t\tpowerful skills in the game.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deadly Aim<\/span>: If you plan to spend most of\n\t\tyour time throwing daggers, this can add some extra damage. However, bonuses\n\t\tto attack are critical to your effectiveness, and the damage payoff for\n\t\tSneak Attack is much better. Be very careful when deciding if you want to\n\t\tuse Deadly Aim.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">Dodge<\/span>: As a Rogue, your AC will be good\n\t\tbecause your dexterity is good.

If you want to throw weapons at all,\n\t\tthis is essential to avoid ending your turn empty-handed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Step Up<\/span>: If they can five-foot step away\n\t\tfrom you, you aren&#8217;t flanking. If you aren&#8217;t flanking, then they have just\n\t\tgiven you a free opportunity to reposition somewhere more advantageous.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Toughness<\/span>: Depending on your ability\n\t\tscores, your hit points are likely low.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Whether throwing or\n\t\tflanking, this is essential.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Double Slice<\/span>: Literally never.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: More\n\t\t\t\tattacks means more damage.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: More\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattacks, more damage.

At first level you can reasonably expect to have 20 dexterity, so start with Studded Leather. When you get a Belt of Incresible Dexterity, upgrade to a Mithral Shirt (equal to +2 Leather, but 3000 gp cheaper). When your dexterity hits 24 (either at 8th level or when you get a +4 belt), switch to Haramaki. Your AC will drop without enhancing the armor, but at this level 4000gp for +2 Haramaki shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.

Sneak Attack from Assassin will stack with your Rogue Sneak Attack,\n\t\tbut it won&#8217;t be d8s, which means you are sacrificing damage.
