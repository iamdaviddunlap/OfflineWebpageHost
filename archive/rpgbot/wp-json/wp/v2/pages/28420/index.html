This can be fun for Warlocks planning to be in melee frequently, where they can use teleportation to move about safely. However, the strict resource constraints mean that, for big chunks of the day, you&#8217;ll be almost completely unable to use your subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dependence on a level 2 spell makes a dip into Sorcerer for Font of Magic a\n\tpowerful option. The ability to melt higher-level spell slots into more level\n\t2 spell slots to fuel Misty Step will make the Archfey Patron&#8217;s features\n\tconsiderably more usable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Archfey Spells<\/span>: Generally good, but few\n\t\ttruly amazing spells.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1<\/span>: Faerie Fire is a great\n\t\t\t\tspell. Sleep is complicated, but can be a very effective save-or-suck\nspell for your entire career. Sadly, it doesn&#8217;t benefit from your spell slot progression.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 2<\/span>: You get three level 2 spells\n\t\t\t\tinstead of the usual 2. Calm Emotions can diffuse combat situations if\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re lucky. Misty Step is fantastic on any character, and it&#8217;s central\n\t\t\t\tto the subclass. Phantasmal Force is an incredibly powerful save-or-suck\n\t\t\t\tspell.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 3<\/span>: Blink is unreliable. Plant\n\t\t\t\tGrowth can be excellent area control if you keep a potted plant handy to\n\t\t\t\ttrigger the effect in places where there aren&#8217;t already plants.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Dominate Beast negates an\n\t\t\t\tentire creature type, but by this level beasts are a rarity. Greater\n\t\t\t\tInvisibility is amazing.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 5<\/span>: Dominate Person is\n\t\t\t\tpowerful, but only situationally useful because humanoid enemies are\n\t\t\t\trare by this level. Seeming is only situationally useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Steps of the Fey<\/span>: Misty Step is a\n\t\tpowerful tactical option for any character, allowing you to quickly get into\n\t\tor out of a dangerous position. A few free castings per day is a nice\n\t\tcomplement to your limited Pact Magic slots, and the added rider effects\n\t\tmake it much more interesting. Remember that you get to use the rider\n\t\teffects whether you cast Misty Step using a spell slot or using Steps of the\n\t\tFey.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because Steps of the Fey allows you to cast Misty Step without a spell\n\t\t\tslot, doing so doesn&#8217;t conflict with the &#8220;one spell with a spell slot per\n\t\t\tturn&#8221; rule, which means that you could cast a spell with a spell slot in\n\t\t\tthe same turn. This doesn&#8217;t apply if you use a Pact Magic spell slot to\n\t\t\tcast Misty Step; it will only work if you use the free castings provided\n\t\t\tby Steps of the Fey.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The biggest problem here is the incredibly tight resource constraints.\n\t\t\tYou&#8217;ll get 3 to 5 free castings of Misty Step plus whatever you&#8217;re willing\n\t\t\tto cast with your limited spell slots. You won&#8217;t be able to use Misty Step\n\t\t\tevery turn unless Misty Step is the only level 1+ spell that you cast, and\n\t\t\teven then, you won&#8217;t get through a full adventuring day without running\n\t\t\tout of resources.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Refreshing Step<\/span>: Not a lot of\n\t\t\t\tTemporary Hit Points, but it&#8217;s consistently useful, and the THP last\n\t\t\t\tuntil the target finishes a Long Rest.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Taunting Step<\/span>: Fantastic if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tteleporting out of melee. If you put yourself out of reach of the\n\t\t\t\tcreatures that were within range, they&#8217;ll spend the next round attacking\n\t\t\t\twith Disadvantage.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Misty Escape<\/span>: Using Misty Step as a\n\t\tReaction means that you don&#8217;t need to use it during your own turn, leaving\n\t\tyour Bonus Action free for things like Hex.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disappearing Step<\/span>: Get somewhere safe\n\t\t\t\tand make yourself untargetable until the beginning of your next turn.\n\t\t\t\tYou might be able to teleport and then walk behind cover, in which case\n\t\t\t\tyou should use Refreshing Step or Taunting Step, but that&#8217;s not always\n\t\t\t\tan option.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dreadful Step<\/span>: The damage doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tscale, which means that it will quickly become obsolete. Unless you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tbeing swarmed or you&#8217;re teleporting into a crowd of weak enemies, this\n\t\t\t\tis a bad idea.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Beguiling Defenses<\/span>: This conflicts with\n\t\tMisty Escape, and one use per day will rarely have a significant impact.\n\t\tYour best bet is to use this when you suffer a critical hit. Even then, I\n\t\tdoubt that this will be worth a spell slot to recharge.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bewitching Magic<\/span>: Fantastically efficient.\n\t\tThis goes a long way to correct the resource constraints of the subclass,\n\t\tallowing you to cast something that isn&#8217;t Misty Step without sacrificing the\n\t\tbulk of the subclass&#8217;s functionality.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"celestial\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Celestial Patron<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Celestial Warlock brings the Healer role to the Warlock, allowing you to fill a niche normally occupied by a Cleric or a Druid. While you won&#8217;t have the deep well of healing that a normall spellcaster will, the Celestial Warlock can still fulfil essential healing needs while enjoying the Warlock&#8217;s other capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Celestial Spells<\/span>: Mostly good. Includes\n\t\tessential options to play your party&#8217;s Healer, though you may struggle to\n\t\tkeep up with a Cleric or a Druid. You don&#8217;t get Healing Word, but Healing\n\t\tLight fills that gap.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cantrips<\/span>: Light is a fine utility,\n\t\t\t\tand Sacred Flame offers one of the Warlock&#8217;s only options for radiant\n\t\t\t\tdamage. It won\u2019t compete with Eldritch Blast for raw damage, though.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 1<\/span>: You don&#8217;t really need either\n\t\t\t\tspell. Cure Wounds is tempting, but you get Healing Light, which will\n\t\t\t\tprovide emergency healing without eating your extremely limited spell\n\t\t\t\tslots. You can still use Cure Wounds right before a short rest to get\n\t\t\t\tsome healing out of any leftover spell slots, but I&#8217;ve never seen a\n\t\t\t\tWarlock make it to a short rest with remaining spell slots. Guiding Bolt\n\t\t\t\tis a fine single-target damage option, but you have Eldritch Blast for\n\t\t\t\tlasering things to death.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 2<\/span>: Aid is fantastic, especially\n\t\t\t\twith the Warlock&#8217;s guaranteed spell slot scaling. You might cast it at\n\t\t\t\tthe beginning of the day, then immediately take a Short Rest. Lesser\n\t\t\t\tRestoration is an essential healing option in any party.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 3<\/span>: Daylight is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful. Revivify is amazing, but presents a problem for\n\t\t\t\tthe Warlock: you only have two spell slots until level 11, and you need\n\t\t\t\tto reserve one to cast Revivify if no one else in the party can cast it.\n\t\t\t\tThis means that fully half of your spell slots may need to go unused\n\t\t\t\tjust in case someone in the party dies.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Guardian of Faith exists\n\t\t\t\tsolely for the 8-hour duration. You can use it to post a guard while\n\t\t\t\tresting, but it&#8217;s otherwise not useful. Wall of Fire is excellent area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol, and synergizes well with Eldritch Blast, Repelling Blast, and\n\t\t\t\tGrasp of Hadar.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5<\/span>: Greater Restoration is a\n\t\t\t\tcrucial healing option, but you&#8217;ll rarely need to actually cast it.\n\t\t\t\tSummon Celestial is fantastic, though you won&#8217;t be able to upcast it\n\t\t\t\tsince the Warlock&#8217;s spell slots stop advancing at level 5.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Healing Light<\/span>: Roughly equivalent to\n\t\tHealing Word, but without eating into your spell slots. This provides enough\n\t\thealing that the Celestial Warlock made a solid showing in the\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/healbot-olympics\">Healbot Olympics<\/a>. However,\n\t\tit doesn&#8217;t solve problems beyond\n\t\thit point restoration, so you still need spells to\n\t\thandle status conditions.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Radiant Soul<\/span>: Most Warlocks deal the vast\n\t\tmajority of their damage with Eldritch Blast and Agonizing Blast. Celestial\n\t\tWarlocks get Sacred Flame, which is probably the best way to make use of\n\t\tthis feature, and you can use Agonizing Blast on Sacred Flame to add double\n\t\tyour Charisma modifier to its damage.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Of course, that makes Sacred Flame roughly equivalent to Eldritch Blast\n\t\t\tfrom levels 6 through 10, at which point Eldritch Blast&#8217;s third ray makes\n\t\t\tit significantly more damaging, and Sacred Flame has no way to catch\n\t\t\tup.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The Celestial&#8217;s expanded spell list offers a tiny handful of extra spells\n\t\t\tthat deal radiant\/fire damage, but many of them aren&#8217;t a great use of your\n\t\t\tWarlock spell slots and the damage still only affects one target on one\n\t\t\tdamage roll (e.g. one target of Wall of Fire one time).<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This also works with True Strike since True Strike can deal radiant\n\t\t\tdamage. This can support a rather unusual Pact of the Blade build which\n\t\t\tfocuses on a big singular attack. With True Strike, Radiant Soul, and\n\t\t\tAgonizing Blast, you can attack with Charisma and apply your Charisma as a\n\t\t\tdamage bonus a total of 3 times. Comparing the math to Eldritch Blast gets\n\t\t\ta little messy, but a musket used with this strategy will be better than or\n\t\t\tcomparable to Eldritch Blast until level 17 when you get your 4th ray.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Celestial Resilience<\/span>: This will save a ton\n\t\tof your party&#8217;s healing resources. It&#8217;s not quite as good as the Inspiring\n\t\tLeader feat since your allies don&#8217;t get as many Temporary Hit Points, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s very close.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Searing Vengeance<\/span>: A good emergency\n\t\toption for your whole party, though you need to be sure to keep everyone\n\t\twithin 60 feet to keep them in range. This also only triggers when they make\n\t\ta Death Saving Throw, so you need to wait for your ally&#8217;s turn to trigger\n\t\tthis (or your turn if you&#8217;re the one dying).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>There is no save to resist the blinding effect, so you can stand up and\n\t\t\tsafely walk yourself to somewhere safe before going back to lasering stuff\n\t\t\tto death. Creatures that you damage are blinded, which gives you Advantage\n\t\t\ton attacks against them, so it&#8217;s a great time for Eldritch Blast.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fiend\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Fiend Patron<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Straightforward and effective, Fiend Patron offers almost nothing but options which improve the Warlock&#8217;s combat capabilities. The Fiend Warlock gets more Blaster options than a typical Warlock, but they&#8217;re also heavily dependent on fire damage. Strongly consider the Elemental Adept feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dark One&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: An excellent amount\n\t\tof Temporary Hit Points. This makes Fiendish Vigor considerably less\n\t\timportant. It also makes it important that you occasionally pick off weak\n\t\tfoes to ensure that your temporary hit points are up before you focus on\n\t\tmore important foes.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Unfortunately, you either need to kill the creature yourself or you need\n\t\t\tto be within 10 feet of the dying creature, which is a very dangerous\n\t\t\tprospect unless you&#8217;re building around Pact of the Blade. Of course, you\n\t\t\tcan also use a bag of rats. Kill a rat, get THP. Easy.<\/p\n\t\t>\n<p>This combines very well with Armor of Agathys. Armor of Agathys ends when you have no Temporary\nHit Points, but it doesn&#8217;t require that the THP come from the spell itself. Using Dark One&#8217;s Blessing\nto maintain a pool of THP allows you to maintain Armor of Agathys for an exceptionally long time.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fiend Spells<\/span>: Warlocks get few\n\t\tinstantaneous AOE blast spells, which means that they may struggle against\n\t\tcrowds of enemies. The Fiend&#8217;s spell list offers several excellent options\n\t\tto address this.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1<\/span>: Burning Hands is passable AOE\n\t\t\t\tdamage at low levels, and, since Warlocks get armor and more hp than\n\t\t\t\tSorcerers and Wizards, you can survive being close enough to melee to\n\t\t\t\tuse it. However, I wouldn&#8217;t use it beyond very low levels despite the\n\t\t\t\tautomatic spell slot scaling. You&#8217;ll get more total damage out of Hex or\n\t\t\t\tother spell options despite Burning Hands&#8217; scaling. Command is a great\n\t\t\t\tcontrol\/debuff effect and scales really well with your spell slots.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Scorching Ray is a bit\n\t\t\t\tredundant with Eldritch Blast, but it scales very well and benefits from\n\t\t\t\tthe same tactics. Suggestion can be a useful save-or-suck, but does have\n\t\t\t\tsome limitations.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 3<\/span>: A good AOE blast and a good\n\t\t\t\tarea control effect. Fireball remains the best instantaneous AOE damage\n\t\t\t\tspell at every spell level until around spell level 8, and, while the\n\t\t\t\tWarlock can&#8217;t cast Fireball past level 5 spell slots, it still remains a\n\t\t\t\tperfect go-to AOE blast option. However, remember that you will often\n\t\t\t\tget better results out of spells with ongoing effects like Hunger of\n\t\t\t\tHadar, and, with so few spell slots, you need to squeeze as much out of\n\t\t\t\tthem as you can. Stinking Cloud is an ongoing AOE save-or-suck effect,\n\t\t\t\tbut creatures within the area are Heavily Obscured, so it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\t\t\tattack them. Hunger of Hadar is likely a better choice in most\n\t\t\t\tcases.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Fire Shield is fine for Pact\n\t\t\t\tof the Blade builds. It does seem redundant with Armor of Agathys, which\n\t\t\t\tnotably lasts longer, provides Temporary Hit Points, deals more damage\n\t\t\t\tto attackers, and scales with spell level. Wall of Fire is one of the\n\t\t\t\tbest area control spells in the game and, with the right invocations,\n\t\t\t\tyou can push and pull enemies through it to repeatedly capitalize on the\n\t\t\t\tguaranteed damage dealt when a creature passes through the wall.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 5<\/span>: Geas is very situational.\n\t\t\t\tInsect Plague fills a very similar niche to Hunger of Hadar, but the\n\t\t\t\tdamage is much better.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck<\/span>: Adds an average of\n\t\t5.5 to your roll, which is mathematically much better than what you get from\n\t\tAdvantage (Advantage is worth slightly more than +3). Unfortunately, you\n\t\tneed to declare that you&#8217;re using it before you roll, so you can&#8217;t use this\n\t\tto rescue failed checks\/saves. Save this for saving throws.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiendish Resilience<\/span>: Powerful and\n\t\tflexible.

The creature is also functionally\n\t\tremoved from the game until the end of your <em>next<\/em> turn, allowing you\n\t\tto place hazards in and around its space like Hunger of Hadar, Wall of Fire,\n\t\tor the rest of your party.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You only get to use this once per Long Rest, but you can recharge it by\n\t\t\tspending a Pact Magic spell slot. At this level all of your slots are\n\t\t\tlevel 5, so we need to compare this to a level 5 spell. This won&#8217;t match\n\t\t\tthe damage or versatility of your spells, so we can&#8217;t look at this as our\n\t\t\tgo-to use for spell slots. Instead, use it for high-priority targets when\n\t\t\tthe benefits will be especially useful, such as hitting an enemy\n\t\t\tspellcaster to break Concentration or a bulky enemy who is blocking your\n\t\t\tparty from attacking their less durable allies.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"great-old-one\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Old One Patron<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Great Old One Warlock is a good generalist, with a good mix of all of the\n\tWarlock&#8217;s capabilities.

The duration is short, so you&#8217;re going to\n\t\tuse it at short range simply because you can&#8217;t get very far before the\n\t\tduration expires. It has almost no mechanical impact until you pick up\n\t\tClairvoyant Combatant.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Old One Spells.<\/span>: An eclectic mix\n\t\twith a good mix of debuffs, save-or-suck, area control, and utility options.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1<\/span>: Two great single-target\n\t\t\t\tcontrol effects, but they will become obsolete beyond low levels since\n\t\t\t\tthey don&#8217;t scale with upcasting.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 2<\/span>: Detect Thoughts is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful.

Hunger of\n\t\t\t\tHadar is absolutely amazing area control.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 4<\/span>: Confusion is unreliable, but\n\t\t\t\tSummon Aberration is great.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5<\/span>: Modify Memory is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but with Eldritch Hex you can cast it without\n\t\t\t\tSomatic\/Verbal components, allowing you to safely use it\n\t\t\t\tmid-conversation, thereby making it much more powerful. Telekinesis is a\n\t\t\t\tgreat utility, and you can use it to hoist melee-only enemies into\n\t\t\t\tmid-air.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Spells<\/span>: Psychic damage is rarely\n\t\tresisted, allowing you to use direct damage spells with much less caution\n\t\tthan many spellcasters. The ability to cast Enchantment\/Illusion components\n\t\tsubtly can be very helpful in social situations where casting spells can be\n\t\tconsidered hostile.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Clairvoyant Combatant<\/span>: Excellent both\n\t\toffensively and defensively. Melee Pact of the Blade builds will enjoy the\n\t\tdefensive benefits more than most Warlocks, but any Warlock will enjoy\n\t\tAdvantage with Eldritch Blast. Of course, you can do the same thing with\n\t\tDarkness and Devil&#8217;s Sight with a better duration and no saving throws.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This competes for your Bonus Action with Hex, so you&#8217;ll need to pick\n\t\t\twhich one you want to use first. You can reapply Hex, but not Clairvoyant\n\t\t\tCombatant, so save Clairvoyant Combatant for powerful single enemies, then\n\t\t\tuse it before applying Hex until you get Eldritch Hex, at which point you\n\t\t\tshould reverse the order so that your target has Disadvantage on the\n\t\t\tWisdom save.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You only get to use this once per Short or Long Rest, so you can&#8217;t afford\n\t\t\tto use it in every fight. You can recharge it with a spell slot, but only\n\t\t\tdo that if you have multiple fights with single powerful foes that justify\n\t\t\tit.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Hex<\/span>: Disadvantage on saves\n\t\tagainst a chosen ability score allows you and your party to easily\n\t\tsave-or-suck your target to death. The only problem is that most\n\t\tsave-or-suck spells require Concentration, and, if you cast a Concentration\n\t\tspell, you stop concentrating on Hex, thereby losing the benefits of Eldritch\n\t\tHex. You&#8217;ll need to rely on your friends or look for spells that don&#8217;t need\n\t\tConcentration.\n\t\t<p>This works very well with Clairvoyant Combatant.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Create Thrall<\/span>: Summon Aberration is a\n\t\tgood spell. The ability to remove the Concentration requirement is great,\n\t\ttoo, allowing you to keep Concentration on Hex so that you and your\n\t\taberration can get a damage bonus. The Temporary Hit Points also mean that\n\t\tyour aberration is unusually durable.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, you&#8217;re casting Summon Aberration at level 5, and it will never\n\t\t\timprove. This means that your aberration will become relatively less\n\t\t\tthreatening as you gain levels, making it less and less impactful over\n\t\t\ttime. It&#8217;s still good, but it won&#8217;t keep pace with regular spellcasters\n\t\t\twho are summoning creatures.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Your choice of Warlock Subclass will offer spells and features that greatly influence your playstyle, frequently pushing you toward one role within the party.
