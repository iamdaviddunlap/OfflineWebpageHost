Remember that your\n\tchoice of Order will add two additional class skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Challenge<\/span> (Ex): Similar to the Paladin&#8217;s\n\tSmite Evil, but the damage doesn&#8217;t double against major foes, and you lose AC\n\tinstead of getting a bonus to AC against the target. Note that your choice of\n\tOrder adds additional effects to your Challenge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mount<\/span> (Ex): The Cavalier&#8217;s combat tactics\n\tare, as you might expect based on the name, centered around mounted combat,\n\tand the Cavalier&#8217;s Mount is an essential part of those tactics. For help with\n\tthe Cavalier&#8217;s Mount, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/animal_companions\">Practical Guide to Animal Companions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Order<\/span> (Ex): Cavalier Orders define the\n\tCavalier as much as a Wizard&#8217;s school defines the Wizard. Orders provide a\n\tcollection of abilities and two additional class skills. For help selecting a\n\tCavalier Order, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/cavalier\/orders\">Cavalier Order Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tactician<\/span> (Ex): Teamwork Feats can be very\n\tgood, but at first level you won&#8217;t qualify for anything particularly\n\tinteresting. For help with Teamwork Feats, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/teamwork_feats\">Practical Guide to Teamwork Feats<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cavalier&#8217;s Charge<\/span> (Ex): Mounted charges are\n\tthe Cavalier&#8217;s first and best option in combat, and this makes them even\n\tbetter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Expert Trainer<\/span> (Ex): The bonus to Handle\n\tAnimal is nice if your GM knows (and follows as written) the mounted combat\n\tand animal rules. Animals usually freak out and run away when wounded, and you\n\tneed to make Handle Animal checks to keep them in combat. This bonus to Handle\n\tAnimal can help make your mount more reliable. The ability to train stuff\n\tfaster is very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Banner<\/span> (Ex): A fairly small and situational\n\tbonus, but charging is big part of the cavalier, and\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/paizo\/faq\/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9nda\">You count as your own ally<\/a>, so you get the bonus to charges too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: You only get 3, but bonus feats\n\tare always welcome, especially for feat-heavy builds like mounted combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Tactician<\/span> (Ex): By this level you\n\tcan qualify for a lot of interesting Teamwork Feats, and granting them as a\n\tSwift Action means that you can do it at the beginning of every combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mighty Charge<\/span> (Ex): Doubling the threat\n\trange on your lance won&#8217;t help you much, but a free combat maneuver on a\n\tsuccessful charge can be very helpful. Even if you haven&#8217;t put any effort into\n\tit, a Trip attempt will give your mount a nice +4 bonus on your mount&#8217;s\n\tattacks (if any), and will make it easier to move away unchallenged. If you\n\tenemy is prone, they will also have more trouble moving out of the way of your\n\tnext charge.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Demanding Challenge<\/span> (Ex): If you have other\n\tweapon-based characters in the party, this is a nice way to bring down major\n\tenemies with big AC&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Banner<\/span> (Ex): The bonuses against\n\tcharm\/compulsion covers nearly every Enchantment spell and effect. The ability\n\tto wave your banner and provide rerolls on saves is huge. You can allow\n\trerolls against domination, poison, disease, or any number of other horrifying\n\teffects. This is especially useful against effects which only allow one save\n\tat the start of the effect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Tactician<\/span> (Ex): Another improvement\n\ton tactician, this time you can grant any two Teamwork Feats which you know,\n\tnot just those granted as bonus feats by Tactician.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Supreme Charge<\/span> (Ex): Remember that\n\tmultipliers always stack additively, so if you have Spirited Charge and a\n\tlance you now deal x4 normal damage. 4x normal damage will match (or likely\n\texceed) the damage of a fighter making a full attack with a two-handed weapon,\n\tand is considerably more reliably because you don&#8217;t depend on iterative\n\tattacks made at -5\/-10\/-15. The ability to stun the target on a crit is nice,\n\tbut with a 19-20 threat range on your lance it&#8217;s hardly reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Cavalier&#8217;s abilities fall somewhere between the Fighter and the Paladin. Melee combat defines the Cavalier, but Charisma helps the Cavalier function as a Face and adds to many Cavalier Order abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: As a primarily melee character,\n\tStrength is your primary ability. You can use a lance one-handed while\n\tmounted, so the difference between 16 and 18 strength isn&#8217;t big enough that\n\tyou need to bend over backwards to hit 18 at level 1.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity adds to Ride and the\n\tCavalier&#8217;s bad Reflex saves, but because the Cavalier is likely in full plate\n\tyou likely won&#8217;t have high Dexterity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: As a front-line martial character, hit\n\tpoints are essential.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Only needed for skill ranks. Dump as low\n\tas you can while still maximizing your essential skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Only needed for Will saves, but the\n\tCavalier is very vulnerable to Will save effects, and needs all the help it\n\tcan get.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cha<\/span>: The Cavalier can serve as a Face, and\n\tmany Order abilities depend on Charisma. You don&#8217;t need nearly as much as a\n\tPaladin, but 14 Charisma will go a long way. If you don&#8217;t play a Face and\n\tavoid Orders which require Charisma, you can dump Charisma to 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 18<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 8<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 16<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 11<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 12<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 15<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 8<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 13<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Cavalier is flexible, and can take benefit from a wide variety of races.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Better suited to the Fighter, but\n\tstill a very durable option. If you don&#8217;t plan to play a Face and don&#8217;t mind\n\tavoiding Cavalier Orders which depend on Charisma, the Dwarf can be perfectly\n\tviable. The Dwarf favored class bonus improves Challenge damage, which can be\n\tvery deadly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: Nothing useful for the Cavalier.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: Small size means that you can use\n\tmedium mounts and ride around in spaces fit for humans without issue. Bonuses\n\tto Constitution and Charisma are helpful, and the penalty to strength is easy\n\tto overcome. The Gnome doesn&#8217;t have any abilities specifically useful to the\n\tCavalier, but the Gnome&#8217;s alternate racial abilities offer some useful\n\toptions. Unfortunately, the Gnome favored class bonus is terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: A flexible ability bonus is\n\talways nice, and the Dual-Minded alternate racial trait really helps with the\n\tSamurai&#8217;s poor Will save. Use Adaptability to get Skill Focus (Ride). The\n\tHalf-Elf favored class bonus is terrible, but you can take the Human favored\n\tclass bonus instead to boost your banner bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: On par with the Half-Elf. The\n\tSacred Tattoo alternate racial trait can go a long way to help with the\n\tCavalier&#8217;s bad saves, especially if you combine it with the Fate&#8217;s Favored\n\ttrait. Darkvision is always welcome. The Half-Orc favored class bonus is\n\tterrible, but you can take the Human favored class bonus instead to boost your\n\tbanner bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Similar to the Gnome, small size\n\tis great for Cavaliers. The Halfling&#8217;s Dexterity bonus is wasted, but\n\trearranging abilities allows you to improve Intelligence or Wisdom. The\n\tOutrider alternate racial trait is also tempting. Unfortunately the Halfling\n\tfavored class bonus is very difficult to use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always a fantastic option, and the\n\tHuman favored class bonus dramatically improves the effectiveness of the\n\tCavalier&#8217;s Banner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Helpful for any face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diplomacy<\/span> (Cha): Essential for any\n\t\tface.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): Helpful for training\n\t\tand handling your mount, but you likely won&#8217;t need to maximize it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Helpful for any\n\t\tface.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Essential for mounted\n\t\tcombat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): Helpful<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Swim<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section does not cover Teamwork Feats, which are a crucial part of the Cavalier.
