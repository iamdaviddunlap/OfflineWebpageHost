We need the ability to retarget attacks to target us and giving our mount Advantage on Dexterity saves is helpful to protect it from one of the easy ways around our strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 4 we take Fighting Initiate to get Fighting Style (Interception). This allows us to let attacks hit our mount and reduce the damage dealt. This sounds insane consider how paper thin horses are, but I promise it will make sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 8 we grab Heavy Armor Master. We want Heavy Armor Master so that we can reduce damage from weapon attacks (I know that there are spells that deal B\/P\/S damage, but monsters generally don&#8217;t use them). We&#8217;re planning to get punched as much as possible, and we want to shave damage off of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to fall far behind the Fundamental Math, but we don&#8217;t really care because attacking and using offensive spells is mostly an afterthought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Level<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Feat(s) and Features<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><th>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Notes and Tactics<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1 &#8211; Paladin 1<\/td><td>Feat: Mounted Combatant<br>Divine Sense<br>Lay on Hands<\/td><td>At this level we&#8217;re objectively terrible. Our attacks are horrendous.<br><br>We have Mounted Combatant, so get a mule to compensate for the speed penalty from your heavy armor. Throw darts in combat and hope that enemies are medium or smaller so that you at least get Advantage on your attacks from Mounted Combatant.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2 &#8211; Paladin 2<\/td><td>Fighting Style (Blessed Warrior)<br>Spellcasting<br>Divine Smite<br>Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Sacred Flame<br>&#8211; Word of Radiance<\/td><td>Now we start to feel like a weird cleric.<br><br>Sacred Flame for single targets, Word of Radiance for crowds. We&#8217;re intentionally taking Sacred Flame over Toll the Dead so that we target different saves. Word of Radiance notably allows you to pick targets in the area, which allows you to omit your mount.<br><br>For your leveled spells, Shield of Faith is a great choice so you can more safely jump into melee and be your party&#8217;s Defender like they expected when you said you were playing a paladin. Compelled Duel is a great way to lock enemies into close range with you so that they can&#8217;t ignore you and chase your allies.<br><br>We will probably never use Divine Smite with this build. Not even once. If you ever make an attack roll for anything except an Opportunity Attack, it would be extremely unusual.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 &#8211; Paladin 3<\/td><td>Divine Health<br>Sacred Oath: Oath of Conquest<br>Channel Divinity:<br>&#8211; Conquering Presence<br>&#8211; Guided Strike<\/td><td>Channel Divinity (Conquering Presence) is our panic button. If things are getting a little too scary and you&#8217;re taking hits too fast, Conquering Presence lets us take the pressure off for a few rounds while our enemies are Frightened.<br><br>You might use Channel Divinity (Guided Strike) for opportunity attacks.<br><br>But that&#8217;s not why we&#8217;re here. We&#8217;re here for the spells.<br><br>Our oath spells at this level are the foundation of this entire build, specifically Armor of Agathys. It&#8217;s a great spell that&#8217;s mostly exclusive to warlocks, but it&#8217;s amazing on any front-line character. We&#8217;re already plenty durable between d10 hit dice, 16 Con, and Lay on Hands, but we also want that automatic on-hit damage. Armor of Agathys is going to monopolize our spell slots for the rest of our career.<br><br>Armor of Agathys notably triggers when you&#8217;re hit by a melee attack, not when you&#8217;re <em>damaged<\/em> by a melee attack. This means that if you can reduce the damage to 0 you get all the benefits of Armor of Agathys without eating into the temporary hp. Therein lies the fundamental nonsense underlying this build.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4 &#8211; Paladin 4<\/td><td>Feat: Fighting Initiate (Interception)<\/td><td>I generally prefer Protection over Interception because I would rather try to negate a hit than just mitigate the damage.<br><br>But this is a weird case. We want attacks to hit, but deal as little damage as possible. Interception doesn&#8217;t protect us, unfortunately, but we&#8217;re planning to turn our horse into a punching bag.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5 &#8211; Paladin 5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br>2nd-Level Paladin Spells<\/td><td>Ignore Extra Attack. This is where our build starts to take shape.<br><br>Our 2nd-level spells get us <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#find-steed\">Find Steed<\/a>, which is central to our strategy. Abandon your old mule by the side of a road and summon something awesome. An Elk or a Warhorse are your go-to options. They also both have hooves, which means that you can give them magic horseshoes.<br><br>Find Steed also gives us the next big piece of our strategy: &#8220;While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.&#8221; So when we cast Armor of Agathys, it affects both us <em>and<\/em> our mount, effectively doubling the spell&#8217;s lifespan.<br><br>We&#8217;re going to take the extremely unusual choice to allow our mount to act as an <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/mounted_combat\/#independent-mounts\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/mounted_combat\/#independent-mounts\">independent mount<\/a> rather than a controlled one. This means that our mount can move and attack on its own, allowing it to attack while still allowing us to ride and protect it. If we&#8217;re out of melee between turns, we don&#8217;t care because we can attack with Sacred Flame.<br><br>However, we do still need to issue verbal commands to our horse to enact the next piece of our strategy: provoking Opportunity Attacks. Command your mount to repeatedly move away from and charge enemies in order to intentionally do so.<br><br>Your mount has an AC of 10 or 11. It&#8217;s going to get hit almost every time it&#8217;s attacked. When it&#8217;s hit, use your Reaction to activate Fighting Style (Interception) to reduce the damage by 1d10+PB. You probably won&#8217;t totally negate the damage, but it still tilts the math in your favor. Your mount, which has Armor of Agathys running, deals automatic cold damage to the attacker and has a nice pad of temporary hit points to absorb the rest.<br><br>After you&#8217;ve burned through your mount&#8217;s copy of Armor of Agathys (or if the remaining temp hp is low enough that your mount might take real hit point damage), start using Mounted Combatant to retarget attacks to hit you instead. Your AC is considerably better, and when an occasional hit sneaks through, you get to deal automatic damage. Nice.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 &#8211; Paladin 6<\/td><td>Aura of Courage<\/td><td>Our last level of paladin. We&#8217;re here for Aura of Protection, which protects us and our mount from saving throws.

We want a Charisma-based caster with regular Spellcasting (so no warlock) to advance our spell slots as fast as possible so that we can get better Armor of Agathys. That leaves the Bard and the Sorcerer. We&#8217;re going to pick bard primarily for its ability to annoy people and make ourselves a target.<br><br>Multiclassing into bard gets us a skill. Pick whatever you want.<br><br>Use Bardic Inspiration to inspire your mount to protect it from saving throws even more. Use Vicious Mockery to annoy enemies that aren&#8217;t attacking you or your mount when you&#8217;re so politely giving them opportunity attacks. You now have cantrips that force saves against Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom, so you can easily pivot to whichever is weak for your target.<br><br>I&#8217;m not going to dig into most of our known bard spells because generally they don&#8217;t matter all that much for this build. We&#8217;re going to be far behind the Fundamental Math for a long time, not to mention that we&#8217;re several spell levels behind a full caster, so focus on buffs and utility options.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 &#8211; Bard 2<\/td><td>Jack of All Trades<br>Song of Rest<br>3rd-Level Spell Slots<\/td><td>3rd-level slots means upgrading Armor of Agathys. 15 temporary hp and 15 damage when we get hit.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 &#8211; Bard 3<\/td><td>Bard College: College of Lore<br>Bonus Proficiencies:<br>&#8211; Any 3<br>Cutting words<br>Expertise:<br>&#8211; Any 2<br><\/td><td>This level brings access to 2nd-level bard spells, notably including Crown of Madness. It&#8217;s not usually a great spell, but in this case we&#8217;re actively trying to force enemies to attack us in order to trigger Armor of Agathys.<br><br>Also, enemies that rely on spellcasting are often terrible at melee attacks, so you can dive into melee and force them via Crown of Madness to flail uselessly against you and your horse while Armor of Agathys freezes them to death.<br><br>If you&#8217;re using the Optional Class Feature which expands everyone&#8217;s spell lists, bards can also get Aid at this level. Adding some more max hp to your mount is great, and even the base 5 from 2nd-level Aid will improve a warhorse&#8217;s hit points by more than 25% so you have more of a pad when Armor of Agathys runs out. Target yourself, your mount, and one other party member.<br><br>At this point you have good enough defenses and enough spell slots to keep up this strategy for a fairly long time. You might intentionally bait more attacks by reducing your AC. Drop your shield and go down to Ring Mail armor.<br><br>That&#8217;s right.

It&#8217;s hard to estimate our DPR with cantrips, so let&#8217;s pretend that our cantrip damage is enough to justify only considering our highest-level slot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Target DPR<\/th><th>On-Hit Damage<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>5<\/td><td>12.1<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>13.3<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>14.6<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>15.8<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>17.1<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>18.3<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>19.6<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>20.8<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>22.1<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>23.3<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>24.6<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>25.8<\/td><td>35 + 2d8 (avg. 9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>27.1<\/td><td>35 + 2d8 (avg. 9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>28.3<\/td><td>40 + 2d8 (avg. 9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>29.6<\/td><td>40 + 2d8 (avg. 9)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>33.3<\/td><td>45 + 2d8 (avg. 9)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re below target DPR until level 8 if we&#8217;re only considering our automatic damage when we&#8217;re hit with an attack, but we&#8217;re not down by much. Even if we resort to a shortbow, the additional 4.4 DPR (2.2 before we get Extra Attack) brings us up to Target DPR, and we&#8217;re more likely to deal damage and will deal more damage with cantrips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, we&#8217;re consistently above Target DPR, but never quite enough to hit High DPR with a single hit. If we can draw more than one attack per turn, we&#8217;re potentially doing a huge amount of damage. Between doubling the total number of hp via Find Steed, damage mitigation via Fighting Style (Interception) and Heavy armor Master, and selectively targeting attacks with Mounted Combatant, if we can make the attacks happen, we can handle the incoming damage without issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can start turn one by running through a horde of opportunity attacks, you might come out the the other side with a trail of dead enemies in your wake without lifting a finger.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bardadin Introduction I previously wrote The Whispering Vengeance as a bardadin smite bot built around fishing for criticals and dropping a mountain of dice when you get one. But that&#8217;s obviously not the only way to build a bardadin. Combining different subclasses can get you wildly different results, often much better than the obvious smite bot build. In this multiclass build, we&#8217;ll look at combining Oath of Conquest with College of Lore to build something of an abomination. The resulting build is most effective when it&#8217;s actively making itself a nuisance and a target, making it a startlingly effective Defender
