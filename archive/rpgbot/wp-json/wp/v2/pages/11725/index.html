If you want\n\t\tto teleport more than once per short rest, Mark of Passage allows it at the\n\t\tcost of spell slots, and you give up the rider effects.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Sentinel<\/span>: The skill bonuses work\n\t\tgreat for the Bard, and Shield as an innate spell is helpful on literally\n\t\tany character. The innate spellcasting offers several excellent defensive\n\t\toptions, many of which are new to the Bard&#8217;s spell list. This works for any\n\t\tbard, but it will be most useful on front-line martial bards like College of\n\t\tValor which can make Compelled Duel worthwhile without dying\n\t\timmediately.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-origin-default\">\n\t<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Default Rules<\/span>: <\/p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-none\">Mark of Finding<\/span>: See Mark of Finding\n\t\t\tunder Dragonmarked Half-Orc, above.

If your DM will let you tame beasts and\n\t\tunintelligent monstrosities beyond what your class features provide this\n\t\tcould be interesting, but that&#8217;s a big assumption to make about your DM.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mark of Making<\/span>: Intelligence isn&#8217;t\n\t\tespecially helpful, but the flexible ability increase can go into Charisma,\n\t\tand there is still some good here. Casting Magic Weapon will offset your\n\t\trelatively low Dexterity if you choose to use a weapon, or you can use many\n\t\tof the dragonmark&#8217;s traits and new spells to buff allies who are using\n\t\tweapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mark of Passage<\/span>: Dexterity and a free\n\t\tability increase are great, more speed never hurts, and the ability to cast\n\t\tMisty Step is great whether or not you like to fight in melee. All 6 of the\n\t\tspells up to 3rd level are not on the Bard&#8217;s spell list.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mark of Sentinel<\/span>: Bad ability spread.<\/li>\n\t<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lineages\">Lineages<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Published in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything and beyond, no Lineage exists prior to the introduction of the Customizing Your Origin rules, and as such each lineage has flexible ability score increases. Every Lineage has the choice of +2\/+1 increases or three +1 increases except for the Custom Lineage which only receives a single +2 increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lineages are applied on top of a base race. While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait. Despite selecting a base race, you do not count as a member of your race for the purposes of any other effect, such as qualifying for feats or using magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"races-custom-lineage\" class=\"rating-blue\">Custom Lineage<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>+2 Cha, a feat, and either a skill or Darkvision.

Hex isn&#8217;t always useful in combat, but remember that it can impose Disadvantage on ability checks with one ability score, so you can impose Disadvantage on Wisdom checks to make it easy to sneak past a creature or on Strength checks to give your allies the upper hand in a grapple. Ancestral Legacy also gives you access to either two extra skills or a movement speed (flight, most likely), so the Hexblood is at least as useful as the Fairy or the Owlin.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"dnd5-race-filter-setting-ravnica\">\n\t<h4 id=\"races-reborn\" class=\"rating-green\">Reborn<sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">VGTR<\/a><\/sup><\/h4>\n\t<p>The resistances aren&#8217;t especially useful for a class that&#8217;s typically a back-line spellcaster, but Ancestral Legacy still offers access to flight or bonus skills, and Knowledge from a Past Life is a helpful boost to your skills.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Charisma is crucial and defining for the Bard, so Charisma increases are your top priority. Like other full casters like the Sorcerer and the Wizard, you can invest remaining resources in Dexterity and Constitution to pad your limited durability. Beyond ability score increases, look for additional skills from your racial traits. Dexterity and Charisma cover numerous crucial skills and tools, and having more skills will make you a better bard. Of course, you won&#8217;t suffer for lack of skill proficiencies thanks to Jack of All Trades. Innate Spellcasting can be very helpful for the Bard, especially post-Tasha&#8217;s races which
