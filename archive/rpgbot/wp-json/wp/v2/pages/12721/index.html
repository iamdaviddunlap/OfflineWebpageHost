It has a few tools that interact with darkness and dim light, but as a whole, even if you spent the entire campaign in well-lit environments, this subclass would do quite well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The main gimmick of the subclass is a shadowy summon at sixth level that imposes Disadvantage on saves vs your spells for the same price as the Heighten spell metamagic, which is excellent value against a single enemy that you continue to hammer with spells, but less so in battles against numerous foes. The real worth however comes from continuing Disadvantage on spells with repeated saves, which Heighten does not do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Shadow Magic Sorcerer, like other Sorcerous Origins, is really defined by the individual\u2019s spell choices more than the subclass itself, which allows for flexible building and flavor. Hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy the humorous twist we\u2019ve put on the features in our example build at the bottom of the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Shadow Magic Origin Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#shadow-magic-origin-ability-scores\">Shadow Magic Origin Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#shadow-magic-origin-races\">Shadow Magic Origin Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#shadow-magic-origin-feats\">Shadow Magic Origin Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#shadow-magic-origin-weapons-and-armor\">Shadow Magic Origin Weapons and Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#shadow-magic-origin-multiclassing\">Shadow Magic Origin Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#shadow-magic-origin-spells\">Shadow Magic Origin Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#1st-level\">1st level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#2nd-level\">2nd level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#3rd-level\">3rd level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#5th-level\">5th level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#9th-level\">9th level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example-shadow-magic-origin-build-goose-goose-revolution\">Example Shadow Magic Origin Build &#8211; Goose Goose Revolution<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Darkvision means that you can safely attack other enemies\n\t\twith Darkvision while remaining outside their vision range. In places that\n\t\tare well lit (like outside, if that&#8217;s somewhere that you go for whatever\n\t\treason), casting Darkness using Sorcery Points means that you&#8217;ve got a fun\n\t\tlittle bubble where you (and often <em>only<\/em> you) can see normally.\n\t\tDarkness is a 2nd-level spell, and converting a 2nd-level spell slot to\n\t\tSorcery Points gives you 2 Sorcery Points, so all that it costs you is the\n\t\tBonus Action to make the conversion.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Strength of the Grave<\/span>: This might keep\n\t\tyou going if you&#8217;re dropped by an attack that doesn&#8217;t deal a lot of damage,\n\t\tbut against abilities which deal lots of damage all at once like breath\n\t\tweapons or spells it&#8217;s going to be very difficult to make the saving\n\t\tthrow.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hound of Ill Omen<\/span>: Even at high levels\n\t\twhen the dire wolf stat block won&#8217;t be threatening, forcing Disadvantage on\n\t\tsaving throws means that you can easily hit the target of your hound with a\n\t\tsave-or-suck spell immediately after summoning the hound.\n\t\t<p>The hound also moves unerringly toward the target, so if they become\n\t\t\tinvisible you have a great way to locate them. The hound can move through\n\t\t\tobjects (though it can&#8217;t fly), so even solid walls won&#8217;t stop this thing\n\t\t\tonce you summon it, and it has enough hit points that it can suffer a few\n\t\t\tattacks before it dies.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>In essence, this is Heightened Spell attached to a very determined set of\n\t\t\tteeth, and unlike Heightened Spell the target suffers Disadvantage on\n\t\t\t<em>all<\/em> saves against your spells rather than the first save for an\n\t\t\taffected spell. As an example: you can target a creature with your hound\n\t\t\tthen hit it with Hold Monster, and it will make every save against Hold\n\t\t\tMonster at Disadvantage. Even better, your wolf will attack it with\n\t\t\tAdvantage and score automatic critical hits (provided that it hits, which\n\t\t\tis still a problem against high-AC foes) since the target it paralyzed.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Curiously, there&#8217;s no limitation on how many hounds you can have beyond\n\t\t\tthe Sorcery Point cost. If you want to summon a hound every turn until you\n\t\t\trun out of sorcery points, you&#8217;re free to do so. If you want to get\n\t\t\tmultiple hounds on the field then upcast Hold Monster to paralyze a bunch\n\t\t\tof things, that&#8217;s a thing you can do. I&#8217;ve done it, and it&#8217;s exactly as\n\t\t\tamazing as it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>Now, your foes might decide to try killing the hound, but any attack against the hound is damage not taken by your less instantly resummonable party members. \nOne more fun little tidbit, even though it&#8217;s called &#8220;Hound&#8221; you can just decide it&#8217;s whatever you want. A black cat bringing bad luck, a totally rad dinosaur, a horrible goose. Flavor is free.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Walk<\/span>: Free teleportation as a Bonus\n\t\tAction! The range is pretty good, and in a pinch you can cast Darkness to\n\t\tcreate an area in which to teleport. You can even use this while travelling,\n\t\tallowing you to move roughly 5 times as fast as normal by combining a\n\t\tcomfortable walking pace and frequent teleportation.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Umbral Form<\/span>: What if Rage let you cast spells and walk through walls instead of hitting things really hard? That&#8217;s kinda how this works. The Sorcery Points are\n\t\tcheaper than casting many spells which let you walk through walls and\n\t\tcreatures like Etherealness. Hopefully you won&#8217;t need the damage resistances\n\t\tbecause you have great defensive options like Improved Invisibility, but you\n\t\tmight be able to use Umbral Form before polymorphing and maintain the damage\n\t\tresistance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shadow-magic-origin-ability-scores\">Shadow Magic Origin Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, we don\u2019t change attribute priority from the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#ability-scores\">class handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump it unless you\u2019re going for some niche Gish.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: We need AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: We need HP.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Knowledge skills maybe.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Perception and Insight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: This is our casting stat: Spell attacks and Save DCs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Standard Array<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shadow-magic-origin-races\">Shadow Magic Origin Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We do alright with the advice from the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/races\/\">Sorcerer Races Breakdown<\/a> but because we gain Darkvision from Shadow Magic we can ignore that when comparing races.

If you started Paladin before jumping to Sorcerer you gain heavy armor, but you lose Constitution proficiency. If the armor is all you wanted, you get better mileage just doing this with <span class=\"rating-orange\">Fighter<\/span> instead.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hexblade Warlock<\/span>: Medium Armor, Hexblade\u2019s Curse, and Charisma weapons. It\u2019s not awful here but Shadow Magic is not the subclass to be trying to build a gish.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/span>: Light Armor and a Skill are things you can get with a single level dip.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shadow-magic-origin-spells\">Shadow Magic Origin Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The notable thing Shadow Magic gives us that interacts directly with spells is the Hound of Ill Omen ability. This ability causes a shadowy monstrosity to follow the target and attack it. When adjacent to the target, the monstrosity imposes Disadvantage to saves vs our spells. This is like Heighten spell, even costing the same spell points, except it has hit points, lasts until it or the target are dead, and affects every spell we cast which targets the target of your hound.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it doesn\u2019t even need to be shaped like a dog. So for this section, let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5OrLdnOUEkY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">horrible goose<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consulting the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/spells\/\">Sorcerer Spell List Breakdown<\/a>, we want to find spells that cause horrible things to people harassed by a horrible goose. If I don\u2019t call a spell out here it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t meaningfully change by adding geese.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1st-level\">1st level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Charm Person<\/span>: The horrible goose will unfortunately keep attacking the target, breaking the charm. Peace was never an option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2nd-level\">2nd level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness\/Deafness<\/span>: Constitution saves might be hard to land, but with Disadvantage it might stick on more things. Blinding the target also means your goose\/hound has Advantage on its attacks against the target. Neither of these things require Concentration so you\u2019re free to set up this combo in one turn, then go do something else with your time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Person<\/span>: So the problem with this spell for normal boring Sorcerers is that Heighten only works on the first saving throw. A horrible goose remains to the end, imposing Disadvantage on all of the creature\u2019s saves to escape the spell\u2019s effects.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3rd-level\">3rd level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sleet Storm<\/span>: The important part here is the way the last effect is worded. This isn&#8217;t a normal save to keep Concentration from damage, this is a save from the spell where the effect of failing is that Concentration ends. You try to keep Concentration while listening to \u201cHonk honk honk honk honk honk~\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5th-level\">5th level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Monster<\/span>: For all the same reasons as Hold Person, this is just that spell but better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9th-level\">9th level<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Scream<\/span>: It\u2019s just so thematic that the target has Disadvantage on their Intelligence saves from all the honking. If Intelligence is the worst save on average then things will remain stunned forever with Disadvantage (or at least for 5 minutes until your goose expires).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-shadow-magic-origin-build-goose-goose-revolution\">Example Shadow Magic Origin Build &#8211; Goose Goose Revolution<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n3DfLpdhXkg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It\u2019s a lovely day, and you are haunted by a horrible goose.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush.

We want to keep up, nothing fancy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirteenth level, Sorcerer 12: Tough. Yeah that\u2019s right, we\u2019re taking Tough on top of being a Hill Dwarf. If you\u2019re not keeping score, that\u2019s like having a d12 hit die instead of our d6. If you instead prefer extra insurance on your Concentration checks, I suggest Warcaster here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seventeenth level, Sorcerer 16: ASI Constitution +2. Better concentration and better HP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1-Fighter 1<\/td><td>Fighting Style (Defense)<br>Second Wind<br>All Armor and Martial Weapons<br><br>Tools<br>-Cook\u2019s Utensils<br>-Disguise Kit<br>-Forgery Kit<br>-Poisoner\u2019s Kit<br>-Horn<br><br>Skills<br>-Deception<br>-Insight<br>-Intimidation<br>-Persuasion<\/td><td>We\u2019re dipping in here to grab Armor proficiency without giving up proficiency in Constitution saves.<br><br>Being a Dwarf, we don\u2019t lose 10 feet of move speed from not being strong enough for heavy armor, so we\u2019re going to abuse that to wear heavy armor.<br><br>The tankier we are, the less our allies have to worry that the squishy caster is going to get stabbed.<br><br>To that end we also take the Defense fighting style since we\u2019re not using weapons.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2-Sorcerer 1<\/td><td>Sorcerous Origin (Shadow Magic)<br>Eyes of the Dark<br>Strength of the Grave<br><br>Spells<br><br>Cantrips<br>-Acid Splash<br>-Mage Hand<br>-Mind Sliver<br>-Minor Illusion<br><br>1st level<br>-Absorb Elements<br>-Sleep<\/td><td>We take our first level of Sorcerer and gain access to Shadow Magic Origin. This improves our Darkvision from the 60 of Dwarves to 120. Strength of the Grave allows us to make a Charisma save if we hit 0 HP to hit 1 HP instead. It might help us sometimes but try not to rely on it.<br><br>For cantrips, we\u2019re taking Acid Splash and Mind Sliver. Acid Splash duo targets that stand too close together, and Mind Sliver <s>gives all Slivers \u201cTap: Target creature takes 2 damage and becomes tapped<\/s> anyone standing alone to ruin their saves.<br><br>After that we have room for some utility so we take Mage Hand and Minor Illusion, but other good options include Mending and Prestidigitation.<br><br>For 1st-level spells, we don\u2019t have a lot of slots at this level nor do we have a horrible goose. So we\u2019ll take Sleep because it\u2019s a death sentence to many creatures at this level. Since we have Heavy Armor, Absorb Elements might be better for us than Shield as a defensive option.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3-Sorcerer 2<\/td><td>Font of Magic<br><br>1st level<br>-Silvery Barbs<br>-Or-<br>-Shield<\/td><td>We get Sorcery Points and this lets us be a bit flexible. Since we don\u2019t have any metamagic yet the only thing this lets us do is have an extra 1st level spell slot every day. I\u2019m not going to list the spell points per level on this table, you\u2019ll have as many as levels in Sorcerer.<br><br>We don\u2019t get a lot of spells so we have to be careful. Silvery Barbs is great, Shield is great. Both serve different purposes, so weigh your options.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4-Sorcerer 3<\/td><td>Metamagic<br>-Quicken Spell<br>-Subtle Spell<br><br>Eyes of the Dark<br><br>2nd level<br>-Darkness<br>-Hold Person<\/td><td>We gain access to metamagic finally, picking up Quicken and Subtle. Quicken is just great for all sorts of reasons. Subtle spell, however, is great for causing mass hysteria and panic about a horrible goose that may or may not exist.<br><br>Also we\u2019re granted Darkness by our Eyes of the Dark and we take Hold Person. Sure this is later overshadowed by Hold Monster but we\u2019ll want to keep it then anyways. If we come across a large group of humanoid foes, upcasting Person to the base level of Monster is far superior.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5-Sorcerer 4<\/td><td>Feat: Skill Expert (+1 Charisma)<br>(17=&gt;18)<br><br>Skill<br>-Acrobatics<br>Expertise<br>-Deception<br><br>Cantrip<br>-Mending<br><br>2nd level<br>-Phantasmal Force<br>-Or-<br>-Mind Whip<\/td><td>We get a feat so we\u2019re taking Skill Expert to learn Acrobatics and gain Expertise in Deception.<br><br>We take Acrobatics because getting grabbed is generally a bad thing while doubling up on Deception helps us to lie our way out of problems. Sure there might be magical ways to handle situations like these, but Sorcerers have a limited number of spells known.<br><br>Phantasmal Force is interesting. A phantasm can make the target do things if you\u2019re clever. A horrible goose phantasm for example can cause a target to drop an item when they believe the goose has pulled it from their hand. But, like many illusion spells, exactly what you can accomplish with the spell is greatly up to DM interpretation.<br><br>On the other hand, Mind Whip hits a commonly weak save and first messes up the target&#8217;s reactions, then ruins the target&#8217;s action economy for the next turn. Sure it only lasts 1 round, but it doesn&#8217;t eat our Concentration like so many other spells on our list.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6-Sorcerer 5<\/td><td>3rd level<br>-Lightning Bolt<br>Retrain Spell<br>-Sleep =&gt; Major Image<\/td><td>You may be wondering why Lightning Bolt and not Fireball?

Well for that we\u2019ll need something to force them into a funnel. While sleep can be useful still, it is starting to fall off and needs to be replaced, which is how we learn Major Image.<br><br>With a bit of clever manipulation we can appear to collapse a bit of the floor or the ceiling and funnel our foes into that satisfying 5-foot wide line we need.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7-Sorcerer 6<\/td><td><s>Hound<\/s> Goose of Ill Omen<br><br>3rd level<br>-Dispel Magic<br>Retrain Spell<br>-Absorb Elements =&gt; Counterspell<\/td><td>For three points, we can call out a goose as a bonus action and ruin someone\u2019s day.
