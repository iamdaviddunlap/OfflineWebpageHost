The subclass has some great pieces to it, but, much like the Sorcerer subclass, there are some very clear problems. The art depicting the Gunslinger shows a character dual-wielding pistols, which the entire sourcebook provides no capacity for, the 11th-level ability is actively counterproductive, and the subclass, as a whole, is generally less effective than many other Ranger options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Gunslinger Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gunslinger-ability-scores\">Gunslinger Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gunslinger-races\">Gunslinger Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gunslinger-feats\">Gunslinger Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gunslinger-weapons\">Gunslinger Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gunslinger-armor\">Gunslinger Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-tetragrammaton-cleric\">Example Build &#8211; Tetragrammaton Cleric<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Not having to spend a spell known on Hunter&#8217;s Mark leaves\n\tyou free to do other things, and, while your save DC probably won&#8217;t be as high\n\tas a full caster, if Hold Person succeeds, you get automatic crits which is\n\tgoofy on a gunpowder class as it doubles your chances for exploding dice.\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Trick Shot<\/span>: Every turn, one attack you\n\t\tmake gets a free rider.\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deafening Shot<\/span>: A hard sell because\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s a Con save, and it&#8217;s far more complicated than anything in\n\t\t\t\t1st-party content because it involves actually tracking the path of your\n\t\t\t\tranged attack projectile, but it could theoretically be used to, for\n\t\t\t\texample, make a spellcaster drop their focus which could then be picked\n\t\t\t\tup by one of your front-line friends.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shifting Shot<\/span>: Probably where you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tget the most use out of this ability as it&#8217;s functionally the\n\t\t\t\tTelekinetic feat but better. You can&#8217;t force them into dangerous\n\t\t\t\tterrain, but the area of a spell isn&#8217;t terrain.

Die Hard will make you functionally immortal unless you&#8217;re getting\n\t\tattacked while down and bleeding out. If that option wasn&#8217;t there, you&#8217;d\n\t\thave an actual choice point between Return Fire&#8217;s DPS boost and Sudden\n\t\tWithdrawal&#8217;s ability to make Multiattacks probably not kill you, but yeah,\n\t\tDie Hard removes that choice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Trick Shot<\/span>: This feature is a\n\t\ttrap.

Now, if you&#8217;re just taking this as a\n\t\tstraight-class Ranger, that doesn&#8217;t actually matter since the Swift Quiver\n\t\tspell doesn&#8217;t actually care if you take the attack action on turns; it will\n\t\tstill happily let you attack twice as a bonus action.

This is likely because there aren\u2019t very many reasons you\u2019d have two different sources of being able to reroll the same die (although Piercer and Great Weapon fighting style on a Pike would do it in the corerules), but I wasn\u2019t able to find anything that says I can\u2019t, including any Crawford rulings. This now lets you fish for bursts rather than fishing for crits.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 &#8211; Fighter 2<\/td><td>Action Surge<\/td><td>For now, the main purpose of this is just going to be shooting even more times on a turn where you need the damage. Eventually, though, it gets a way cooler use.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 &#8211; Fighter 3<\/td><td>Black Powder and Sailcloth<br>Bullet and Blade<\/td><td>Alright, let\u2019s stop being a pansy and get up into melee where the action is. Like Tyler noted in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/races\/thri-kreen\/\">Thri-Kreen Handbook<\/a>, \u201cThe TWF rules require you to take the Attack action and attack with a light weapon to get the Bonus Action attack. Once you\u2019ve met that requirement, you\u2019re free to do what you like with your other attacks, including attacking with a two-handed weapon or even with a ranged weapon.\u201d<br><br>So, now that we have Bullet and Blade, we can stab with a shortsword to activate TWF, use our second attack from Extra Attack to shoot our pistol, then bonus action attack with the same pistol, getting Dex to damage on all 3 attacks and giving us two chances to burst.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 &#8211; Cleric 1<\/td><td>Gunpowder Blessing<br>Cantrips:<br>\u2013 Guidance<br>\u2013 Light<br>\u2013 Thaumaturgy<br>Spells Prepared:<br>&#8211; Healing Word<br>&#8211; Bless<br>&#8211; Shield of Faith<br>&#8211; Fog Cloud<br>&#8211; Thunderwave<\/td><td>Giff love to be loud. So why not be even <em>louder?<\/em>We don\u2019t really need damage cantrips, nor do we want any leveled spells that care that our Wisdom is way behind where it should be.<br>Fog Cloud being always prepared here means you can go replace it from your Ranger list when you next take a Ranger level.<br><br>Gunpowder Blessing is pretty great. It lets you make your short sword a gunpowder weapon, allowing it to benefit both from the chance to burst and also from your Gunfighting fighting style. Since it costs nothing but an action and has no visible effect, there\u2019s very little reason that you should be doing it as your action 100% of the time until you have to roll initiative and start acting in a turn-based manner.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; Fighter 4<\/td><td>ASI: Dex 18 -&gt; 20<\/td><td>Get the attack bonus with the short sword and get our attack\/damage modifier back on track.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11 &#8211; Fighter 5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<\/td><td>Sadly, this instance of it doesn\u2019t stack with the Ranger one we already got so this is a dead level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12 &#8211; Fighter 6<\/td><td>Feat: See Text<\/td><td>There are a handful of options here. If you want your AC to increase, taking Medium Armor Master will give you a +1 AC if you can find half plate. If you\u2019ve found some magic half plate, this is a good idea. If you still want your AC up but you\u2019ve found magic studded leather instead, taking Fighting Initiate for the Defense style accomplishes the same thing. You could probably convince your DM that Dual Wielder would give you the +1 AC and would certainly let you draw both weapons at once but, since Bullet and Blade is the source of the off-hand pistol attack, RAW this won\u2019t let you stop using a light weapon to attack. If you can convince your DM of that too, though, you can switch to a rapier for +2ish DPR.<br><br>If you don\u2019t think you need the help with AC, Eldritch Adept can get you Devil\u2019s Sight which neatly solves your lack of Darkvision and can be a great combo tactic if you have an arcane caster around to put Darkness on a scarf and then pass it off to you.<br><br>If none of those feel right, Fey Touched will give you Misty Step and round your Wisdom up early, but Resilient is still recommended later for the proficiency bonus. If you go this route, take Silvery Barbs for your 1st-level spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13 &#8211; Fighter 7<\/td><td>Deck Fighter<\/td><td>What\u2019s a great way to take out a high-AC front line character? Dex saves. Now you can just choose to succeed. Enjoy a much longer life.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14 &#8211; Ranger 6<\/td><td>Favored Foe d4 -&gt; d6<br>Roving<\/td><td>Roving is a neat ability but, since it\u2019s not spider climb, we would be removing our ability to load our pistol if we tried to use it in combat. Still, it means you\u2019re rarely going to be stopped by terrain and can clamber up to places and drop a rope down.<br><br>Favored Foe\u2019s damage goes up to matching Hunter\u2019s Mark, so now we use that and free up our spell slots. It doesn\u2019t transfer between targets though, so, if you\u2019re in a fight with many small enemies, consider using a Mark instead and saving Favored Foe for things you expect to be attacking for a while.<br><br>While you\u2019re here, remember to trade out that Fog Cloud you\u2019ve had since level 2 or 3.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; Ranger 7<\/td><td>Defensive Tactics:<br>&#8211; Die Hard<\/td><td>I talked about how crazy this ability is in the description above and I stand by it.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16 &#8211; Cleric 2<\/td><td>Channel Divinity: Toggle Explosivity<br>Spell Prepared:<br>\u2013 Detect Magic<\/td><td>Remember that Action Surge we\u2019ve been waffling with? Now you can start a combat by giving your whole party Gunpowder weapons (try and convince other party members to take things that let them reroll like Piercer or the Great Weapon fighting style to take best advantage of this) before going right into your turn of stab-shoot-shoot.<br><br>Free your real casters up to prepare&nbsp;something else since you can ritual cast Detect Magic just as well as they can.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17 &#8211; Fighter 8<\/td><td>Resilient (Wis)<\/td><td>Well, you can pass Dex saves by sheer force of will, and you\u2019re at the level range where a lot of things are going to try to break your mind, so how about you just decide to get a +7 on Wisdom saves compared to last level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18 &#8211; Fighter 9<\/td><td>Indomitable<\/td><td>While you\u2019re really good at Dex and Wis saves, the stray Con, Int, or Charisma fail may well still kill you.

Well, now each of those dice has a 1\/3 chance to burst instead of a 1\/6th chance. Also, with our proficiency bonus this high, we\u2019re far more consistent about exploding things than we should be.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20 &#8211; Fighter 11<\/td><td>Extra Extra Attack<\/td><td>For our capstone, we casually increase our DPR by 33%.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Whereas Tyler was enchanted by the picture of a magic-user telekinetically holding up a brace of pistols when we first got to preview the Tome of Heroes, for me, it was visions of recreating Gun Kata from the wonderfully mediocre but incredibly entertaining movie Equilibrium that my imagination ran with. I wanted to play as a monk dual-wielding pistols, shooting and punching my way through hordes of fascistic government goons goblins. Upon getting a chance to actually read the book, though, it lacks a monk subclass focused on firearms.
