Paladins have Compelled Duel. <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/rune-knight\/\">Rune Knights solve the problem via suplexing enemies<\/a> (even if those enemies are trains).

But that\u2019s secondary to making sure that we\u2019re tough and supportive, protecting our party members while working in some excellent utility and respectable damage. Plus, you get to be one of a vanishingly small number of things that always has a use for your reaction in a round which is pretty neat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestral-guardian-features\">Ancestral Guardian Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestral-guardian-ability-scores\">Ancestral Guardian Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestral-guardian-races\">Ancestral Guardian Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestral-guardian-feats\">Ancestral Guardian Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestral-guardian-weapons\">Ancestral Guardian Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestral-guardian-armor\">Ancestral Guardian Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-furious-about-mediocre-strength\">Example Build &#8211; Furious About Mediocre Strength<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Sure, the target can attack other people, but they do so\n\t\twith Disadvantage and do half damage. At that point, attacking anyone except\n\t\tyou seems pointless. You do need to hit something for this to trigger, so\n\t\tyou should absolutely use Reckless Attack to improve the likelihood that you\n\t\thit as much as possible.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Shield<\/span>: There is no limitation on\n\t\thow often you can use this except that it uses your Reaction. This is a\n\t\t<em>massive<\/em> increase to your party&#8217;s survivability, and even if this\n\t\tnever scaled it would still be fantastic. The only problem is that you can&#8217;t\n\t\tuse it on yourself, but fortunately you get damage resistance from Rage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Consult the Spirits<\/span>: Augury and\n\t\tClairvoyance are two of my favorite divinations because they&#8217;re simple, but\n\t\textremely useful. Use Augury any time you make a major decision with unknown\n\t\trisks. Use Clairvoyance to scout around corners, behind doors, etc. By this\n\t\tlevel actual spellcasters will be able to do this with ease, but you can use\n\t\tthis ability once per short rest without spending spell slots, so doing it\n\t\tyourself may be less costly for the party.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vengeful Ancestors<\/span>: As a Reaction, reflect\n\t\tup to 4d6 damage directed at an ally back to the attacker. Amazing. You\n\t\tmight encourage your allies to draw fire just so you can use this,\n\t\tespecially when facing enemies with multiple low-damage attacks so that you\n\t\tcan reliably reflect all or most of the damage from a single attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestral-guardian-ability-scores\">Ancestral Guardian Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Powers our attacks and, as a reminder, we need to hit with them to apply our tanking debuff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: We only want to fill out medium armor unless you&#8217;re rolling for stats and end up with 3 high rolls.

Radiant Consumption causing you damage every turn will keep your Rage running even if you miss everything and aren&#8217;t attacked, a very rare and useful trait.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hobgoblin<\/span>: Ancestral Guardian is one of the subclasses that doesn&#8217;t have a way to use its bonus action every turn while raging by default, and since we&#8217;re doing the job of tanking we may as well throw some support in there too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestral-guardian-feats\">Ancestral Guardian Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3-5 - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3-5 - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Elven Accuracy<\/span>: So, hear me out. If you have some way of getting reliable advantage (for instance if your table uses the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-episode-season-2-episode-1\/\">flanking variant rule<\/a>), you could actually dump strength, pump Dex primary and Con second, and use a rapier and shield. You obviously drop some damage, but you trade it for never having to use reckless attack (it only works with strength) and being <em>incredibly<\/em> tanky, and with super advantage you&#8217;re way more likely to crit which triggers brutal critical and helps mitigate the smaller damage die and the lack of rage bonus damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestral-guardian-weapons\">Ancestral Guardian Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greataxe<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to be a normal barbarian, this is still the gold standard because of Brutal Critical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rapier<\/span>: If you&#8217;re doing goofy tank things, this is the biggest damage die on a finesse weapon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ancestral-guardian-armor\">Ancestral Guardian Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>As described above, you either want to put your 14 Dex to work in a Breastplate or go naked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: A classic pairing, a couple levels in fighter can do you a lot of good.

If, for some reason, you aren&#8217;t Raging, Booming Blade will do functionally identical DPR to attacking twice at roughly 29. However, if your target then moves that number goes up to 46. Maybe you&#8217;ve run out of Rages. Maybe it&#8217;s the first round and you want to Booming Blade, action surge, Rage, and get in two attacks before walking out of range, confident that your enormous AC and hp won\u2019t mind the opportunity attack.

We often talk about the &#8220;Tank Fallacy&#8221; where monsters stop trying to pry the stringy meat out of the very hard to open tin can and instead walk past you to the delightfully tender wizard. Various classes have different ways to handle this. Paladins have Compelled Duel. Rune Knights solve the problem via suplexing enemies (even if those enemies are trains). Oath of Conquest solves this problem by paralyzing enemies with fear. Barbarians, on the other hand, have a couple options.
