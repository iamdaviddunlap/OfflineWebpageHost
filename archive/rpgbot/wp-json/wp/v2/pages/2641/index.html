It&#8217;s not totally clear what\n\trole Circle of Dreams is intended to take in the party. They have a mix of\n\tutility and healing options, but druids already have plenty of those\n\tcapabilities. I think your best bet is to focus on spellcasting, but Circle of\n\tthe Land does the same job better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balm of the Summer Court allowed the Circle of Dreams Druid to make a good showing in <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/healbot-olympics\">The Healbot Olympics<\/a>, but it didn&#8217;t make the top 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/circle-of-dreams\/\">Circle of Dreams Druid Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Balm of the Summer Court<\/span>: A pool of\n\t\thealing which you can use as a bonus action. It&#8217;s largely redundant with\n\t\tHealing Word, but it does have a few notable advantages. The pool of dice\n\t\twill quickly outpace your number of low-level spell slots, allowing you to\n\t\tquickly and inexpensively rescue dying allies. The ability to use more than\n\t\tone die is helpful if you want your ally past single-digit hit points, and\n\t\tthe temporary hit points can help keep them conscious, though with so few\n\t\ttemporary hit points you shouldn&#8217;t expect a miracle. Finally, since Balm of\n\t\tthe Summer Court isn&#8217;t a spell, you can use it in the same turn as casting a\n\t\tleveled spell.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow<\/span>:\n\t\tSituational, and there are tons of other options available that cost resources to solve the\n\t\tsame issues better, though this feature automatically happens during every Short and Long Rest with no limitations. For example, Rope Trick will allow the party to climb\n\t\tinto an extradimensional space with an invisible entrance for the price of a 2nd-level spell slot and only for the length of a single Short Rest. Still, if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have a wizard in the party this is nice to have while camping in\n\t\tdangerous places like dungeons.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hidden Paths<\/span>: Excellent range, it works as\n\t\ta Bonus Action, and you get a decent number of uses per day. It&#8217;s especially\n\t\tnice because Misty Step isn&#8217;t available to druids and this can target a willing ally. This is a great way to\n\t\tget out of dangerous areas, to escape grapples, or to rescue allies from the\n\t\tsame.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Walker in Dreams<\/span>: Dream and\n\t\tTeleportation Circle aren&#8217;t on the Druid spell list, but Scry is. The unique\n\t\tversion of Teleportation Circle is a nice way to get yourself and your party\n\t\tback to a known safe point. Generally you can do that by other means\n\t\tlike walking or turning into a bird and flying long distances, but don&#8217;t underestimate the utility of what is essentially a Town Portal. This feature could be invaluable for situations where you need to retrieve something or someone and half of the challenge is escaping after securing the target: Turn into a mouse, chill in the target\u2019s cell for an hour, activate escape portal, mission over. If your party\n\t\tincludes a character who can cast Teleport, this is an inexpensive way to\n\t\tget home after teleporting.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-spores\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/druid#CircleofSpores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle of Spores<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">GGtR \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of Spores is strong, and brings a lot of really powerful offensive\n\toptions to the druid, in addition to a splash of undead. The circle features\n\tuse your Reaction and Bonus Action almost exclusively, which means that you&#8217;re\n\tleft to use your Action for normal druid things like casting spells. Symbiotic\n\tEntity, the only circle feature which uses an Action, provides a massive pile\n\tof temporary hit points, allowing even the most frail druids to take several\n\thits before dipping into their normal hit points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that the Circle of Spores is capable of thriving in\n\tmelee without turning into an animal. This is generally how people play the\n\tsubclass, though doing so is complicated and takes a solid build to do\n\tsuccessfully. For detailed guidance, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/circle-of-spores\">Circle of Spores Druid Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of Spores is arguably the most complex druid subclass to build\n\tsuccessfully. I do not recommend this for players who aren&#8217;t ready for the\n\tmechanical complexities required for them to succeed with Circle of Spores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circle Spells<\/span>: Almost everything on the\n\t\tspell is useful frequently, and you get a handful of options which\n\t\taren&#8217;t on the Druid&#8217;s spell list.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrip<\/span>: You get Chill Touch for free\n\t\t\t\tat 2nd level. It&#8217;s buried in the text of Circle Spells rather than in\n\t\t\t\tthe Circle Spells table alongside everything else, so it&#8217;s easy to miss.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3<\/span>: A fantastic debuff and a\n\t\t\t\tvery situational utility option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">5<\/span>: The logic behind why Circle\n\t\t\t\tof Spores druids can raise undead is a <em>huge<\/em> stretch,\n\t\t\t\tbut Animate Dead is great regardless. Having four human skeletons\n\t\t\t\tis useful at any level because they&#8217;re expendable and easy to\n\t\t\t\tuse as bait without feeling sad about killing an innocent person.\n\t\t\t\tGaseous Form is great too for a variety of sneaking and exploratory\n\t\t\t\tpurposes.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">7<\/span>: A decent single-target damage\n\t\t\t\tspell that works really well on plants, and a mediocre, unreliable\n\t\t\t\tdebuff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">9<\/span>: Two excellent offensive options.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circle of Spores<\/span>: When you first get\n\t\tthis, a free 1d4 damage is a really nice boost to your damage output.\n\t\tThe damage scales very slowly, so it won&#8217;t be especially threatening\n\t\tat high levels, but consider how infrequently most druids get to do\n\t\tsomething with their Reaction this is a fantastic improvement to your\n\t\taction economy. Find allies who make numerous attacks (fighters, etc.)\n\t\tto stun-lock enemies for extended periods of time. The range is\n\t\tshort, unfortunately, so make sure you have a tanky ally between you\n\t\tand whatever is trying to kill you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Symbiotic Entity<\/span>: Someone finally wrote\n\t\ta way for druids to thrive in melee without turning into an animal!\n\t\tCast Shillelagh on a club or a quarterstaff, grab your shield, and go\n\t\tclubbing. The 10 minute duration may be enough to get you through\n\t\tseveral fights if you move quickly, and even if you&#8217;re not walking\n\t\taround swinging a weapon, 4 temporary hit points per class level is a\n\t\tmassive pile of hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fungal Infestation<\/span>: You&#8217;re limited to\n\t\tsmall or medium beasts and humanoids, which means your best hope is\n\t\tfor a wolf or something to die right next to you. It&#8217;s cool that you\n\t\tcan activate this as a Reaction, but 1 to 5 CR 1\/4 zombies aren&#8217;t\n\t\tgoing to do a whole lot. Best case scenario: whatever you&#8217;re fighting\n\t\tspends an attack on the zombie instead of you and your\n\t\tallies (remember that your zombies only get 1 hp).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spreading Spores<\/span>: This creates an additional\n\t\tarea in which enemies can take the damage from your Halo of Spores.\n\t\tYou activate this as a Bonus Action, but after that creatures take the\n\t\tdamage without you spending your Reaction, so if you can keep enemies\n\t\tinside the area it&#8217;s a better use of actions and you may even deal\n\t\tmore damage if you can affect multiple targets.\n\t\t<p>You lose the ability to use\n\t\tHalo of Spores as a Reaction, unfortunately, and the ability curiously\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t exclude you from the damage, so be careful not top drop\n\t\tSpreading Spores on yourself. Cast something like\n\t\tEntangle to keep enemies from moving away quickly, then throw your\n\t\tspores on top of them.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This can also monopolize your Bonus Action, which conflicts with\n\t\t\tcommon tactics like Polearm Master. That may be perfectly fine\n\t\t\tdepending on your build and your situation. Not every turn needs\n\t\t\tto involve swinging a shillelagh, and alternating attack turns\n\t\t\twith turns where\n\t\t\tyou move Spreading Spores and cast a spell could be a great\n\t\t\tway to bring all of your options into play consistently.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fungal Body<\/span>: A nice list of condition\n\t\timmunitites. You can still take poison damage, which seems odd, but\n\t\tI&#8217;m never going to complain about condition immunities.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-stars\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/druid#CircleofStars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle of Stars<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of Stars is very powerful, adding a lot of both both damage output and\n\thealing, as well as a support mechanic from Cosmic Omen. Starry Form is the\n\tclass&#8217;s signature mechanic, serving as a sort of combat overdrive mode similar\n\tto Circle of Spore&#8217;s Symbiotic Entity or the Barbarian&#8217;s Rage. Outside of this\n\tform you&#8217;re mostly reduced to core druid features, but at that point you&#8217;re\n\tstill sitting on a full spellcasting arsenal so you&#8217;re not struggling by any\n\tmeans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite adding a mildly stressful tactical decision (do I use Starry Form\n\tnow? What constellation do I use?), Circle of the Stars is very approachable\n\tand I think it&#8217;s a great option for new players. It&#8217;s not quite as simple as\n\tCircle of the Land since it does add some new mechanics, but it&#8217;s considerably\n\tmore effective so it&#8217;s a great option for newer players in a party of\n\tveterans. Despite being reasonably simple to play, this is also a great\n\tsubclass for veteran players, especially if you&#8217;ve passed over the Druid\n\tpreviously because they looked underhwelming compared to other\n\tspellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think Circle of Stars going to be a balance problem since the druid\n\tis both difficult to optimize and arguably the weakest spellcasting class, but\n\tif a Circle of Stars Druid is proving to be a problem at your table there are\n\tsome easy adjustments that you can make to the class to balance them. You\n\tmight choose to use some or all of these changes, but I&#8217;m not totally certain\n\tthat they&#8217;re necessary. Try the subclass, try some of these changes, and\n\t<a href=\"mailto:RPGBOT@RPGBOT.net\">email me<\/a> to let me know how it works\n\tout for your table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Starry Form<\/strong>: Reduce the dice for Archer\/Chalice from d8 to\n\t\td6 or even d4. That&#8217;s a pretty minor numerical change, but sometimes that&#8217;s\n\t\tall that you need.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Twinkling Constellations<\/strong>: Changing constellations requires\n\t\ta Bonus Action.

I&#8217;ve hoped for\n\t\t\t\tmore unique spellcasting focuses for years and this is the first time\n\t\t\t\twe&#8217;ve gotten one (the common magic item focuses in Xanathar&#8217;s barely\n\t\t\t\tcount since they&#8217;re still generic focuses with added stuff). I also love\n\t\t\t\tthe idea of a druid running around with a big heavy stone slab or a\n\t\t\t\tdelicate collection of glass disks, especially since even a tiny amount\n\t\t\t\tof damage to either would jeopardize years of delicate work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guidance<\/span>: The best support cantrip,\n\t\t\t\tand you get it for free so you can enjoy other cantrips without feeling\n\t\t\t\tlike Guidance is a cantrip tax because it&#8217;s too good to skip.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guiding Bolt<\/span>: Very solid at low levels\n\t\t\t\tboth as a support option and for damage output, and radiant damage is a\n\t\t\t\trarity for the Druid.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Free Guiding Bolts<\/span>: Not only can you\n\t\t\t\tcast Guiding Bolt using your spell slots, you get to cast it for free a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of times per day equal to your Proficiency Bonus. This is done as\n\t\t\t\ta 1st-level spell, but 4d6 damage and Advantage on the next attack\n\t\t\t\tagainst that creature is better than any damage cantrip, even at 17th\n\t\t\t\tlevel. (Eldritch Blast+Invocations don&#8217;t count.) You won&#8217;t get enough\n\t\t\t\tfree uses of Guiding Bolt to totally replace attack cantrips,\n\t\t\t\tunfortunately.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Starry Form<\/span>: Turning Wild Shape into a\n\t\tbuff rather than a utility option was first done in Circle of Spores, and\n\t\tit&#8217;s just as cool on Circle of Stars. Starry Form is Arguably even cooler\n\t\tbecause instead of locking you into a combat mode, Starry Form has an attack\n\t\tmode, a healing mode, and a utility\/casting mode. Much like Circle of the\n\t\tMoon and Circle of Spores, expect to use Starry Form in any noteworthy\n\t\tcombat, but remember that you only get two uses per short rest so you&#8217;ll\n\t\tstill need to be functional without it sometimes.\n\t\t<p>Choosing which constellation to use is one of the most important tactical\n\t\t\tdecisions that you can make in an encounter. If you&#8217;re in close quarters\n\t\t\tand need to keep your spells going, go for Dragon. If your party is short\n\t\t\ton hit points going into the encounter, or if there&#8217;s some kind of hit\n\t\t\tpoint attrition issue (enemy has big AOE damage, or you&#8217;re fighting in a\n\t\t\tburning building), go for Chalice.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, go for Archer and pump out\n\t\t\tdamage as fast as you can. This tactical decision goes away at level 10\n\t\t\twhen you get Twinkling Constellations (In a way. Keep reading.), but until\n\t\t\tthen this will be among the hardest and most impactful choices that you\n\t\t\tmake in a fight.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archer<\/span>: 1d8+Wis radiant damage as a\n\t\t\t\tBonus Action. It&#8217;s a spell attack so the attack uses your Wisdom\n\t\t\t\tmodifier and doesn&#8217;t benefit from things like the Sharpshooter feat.\n\t\t\t\tThis is a great offensive option, and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t stop you\n\t\t\t\tfrom casting a leveled spell on the same turn is just spectacular. This\n\t\t\t\tis likely your go-to option in combat because it&#8217;s going to be useful in\n\t\t\t\tevery combat on every turn at any level. The damage improves at level\n\t\t\t\t10, but honestly if it didn&#8217;t this would still be great.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Chalice<\/span>: More than doubles the total\n\t\t\t\tamount healed by Healing Word, and you can target a creature not\n\t\t\t\ttargeted by your spell so you can heal two creatures at once. However,\n\t\t\t\tthis also encourages healing in combat which you should try very hard to\n\t\t\t\tavoid doing. The best use case for this is to use it right before a\n\t\t\t\tShort Rest if you have a Wild Shape usage left over. The healing\n\t\t\t\timproves at level 10.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon<\/span>: Druids have a lot of\n\t\t\t\tConcentration spells, so guaranteeing a minimum roll of 10 on those\n\t\t\t\tchecks is really helpful. Guaranteeing a minimum roll of 10 on\n\t\t\t\tIntelligence and Wisdom checks allows you to use this outside of combat,\n\t\t\t\twhich is a great utility option if you have knowledge skills like Arcana\n\t\t\t\tor Nature. At level 10, this adds a 20-foot fly speed, allowing you to\n\t\t\t\tfly while keeping your Concentration on a spell.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cosmic Omen<\/span>: Tactically similar to the\n\t\tBard&#8217;s Bardic Inspiration and Cuttings Words features. You won&#8217;t be able to\n\t\tuse this as often as a bard can use Bardic Inspiration, but 3 to 6 times per\n\t\tday is still extremely impactful, especially since you can use this as a\n\t\tReaction. The Weal\/Woe options are roughly equivalent, so when you roll to\n\t\tsee which one you get you&#8217;re essentially deciding if you get to use this\n\t\toffensively (weal) or defensively (woe) that day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Twinkling Constellations<\/span>: More damage from\n\t\tArcher, more healing from Chalice, and flight from Dragon (even at just 20\n\t\tft. speed) are all big improvements.

Not what I\n\twas expecting, but it&#8217;s pretty great. The subclass splits its focus between\n\tfire-based blasting, healing, and using the Wildfire Spirit as a combat pet.\n\tBetween those three, you&#8217;ll be very busy any time that combat breaks out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Circle of Wildfire depends almost exclusively on fire damage,\n\twhich is a problem because fire resistance and immunity are among the most\n\tcommon resistances in the game. This has been a persistent issue for the Druid\n\tdating back to at least 3rd edition, and Circle of Wildfire isn&#8217;t doing\n\tanything to correct it. Take the Elemental Adept feat to help your own spells\n\t(your Wildfire Spirit doesn&#8217;t benefit from the feat) or you will face severe\n\tand persisten problems throughout your character&#8217;s career. If immunity ever\n\tcomes up, make sure that you have adequate spell options for dealing other\n\tdamage types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also consider the Elemental Bane spell. It suppresses resistance to\n\tthe type of damage which you select, and with so many reliable ways to deal\n\tfire damage it will be a reliable boost to your damage output. However, it&#8217;s\n\ton a Constitution save and those tend to be high, so it won&#8217;t be as reliable\n\tas Elemental Adept.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the resistance\/immunity issue, Circle of Wildfire is a lot of fun.\n\tWith staple damage and healing options built in, you have a lot of freedom to\n\texplore other parts of the Druid&#8217;s spell list. The great balance between\n\tdamage and healing makes this a great subclass for small parties or for\n\tparties who don&#8217;t have a big blaster caster like a sorcerer, wizard, or\n\twarlock but also need more healing than most druids can provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do wish that they got Fireball, but I&#8217;m still happy with the new spells which Circle of Wildfire gets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/wildfire\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"12459\">Circle of Wildfire Druid Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Circle of Wildfire Spells<\/span>: A nice balance\n\t\tbetween healing and damage options, the spell list adds numerous fire damage\n\t\tspells from the sorcerer and wizard spell lists.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd Level<\/span>: Staple options for both\n\t\t\t\tdamage and healing.\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: More staple damage\n\t\t\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">5th Level<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\t\t\ttechnically situational, but Revivify is such a crucial option that it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tessentially a tax on any class which has access to it, and since it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tonly available to most druids as an Optional Class Feature, this is one\n\t\t\t\tof very few ways for a druid to get guaranteed access to Revivify.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">7th Level<\/span>: Two situational defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuffs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get fireball,\n\t\t\t\tbut Flame Strike is almost as good.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Summon Wildfire Spirit<\/span>: A powerful combat\n\t\tsummon to College of Creation&#8217;s Dancing Item, the Wildfire Spirit is a\n\t\tflying Striker. At just 10 Strength and small size it&#8217;s not strong enough to\n\t\tcarry anything of significant weight, so its function is almost purely\n\t\tcombative. The 30 ft. fly speed allows it to remain safely out of melee\n\t\tcombat, which is good since it has a small pool of hit points and just 13\n\t\tAC. The 1-hour duration and 2 Wild Shape uses per Short Rest will keep your\n\t\tspirit around for a big chunk of the day, but if you&#8217;re on your second use\n\t\tbe cautious about your spirit&#8217;s hit points, and if your spirit goes down try\n\t\tto get a Short Rest as quickly as possible.\n\t\t<p>The Wildfire Spirit also has a short-range teleportation option which\n\t\t\tleaves a small fire damage AOE in its wake. Even though the 15-foot\n\t\t\tteleportation range is very small, it&#8217;s enough to get an ally out of a\n\t\t\tgrapple and out of melee reach, as well as to get the party through many\n\t\t\tbarriers like portcullises, doors, and windows which would normally block\n\t\t\tpassage but you can still see past.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The Wildfire Spirit has two crucial limitations. First, and most obvious,\n\t\t\tis fire damage. Fire resistance and immunity are common, and Elemental\n\t\t\tAdept doesn&#8217;t help your Wildfire Spirit&#8217;s fire damage. Second, it can only\n\t\t\tattack targets which you can see and teleport to places that you can see.\n\t\t\tIf you&#8217;re blind or just can&#8217;t make line of sight, your spirit is mostly\n\t\t\tuseless.<\/p>\n<p>Even with those limitations, for an hour the Druid more or less has the damage of an extra cantrip as a bonus action on every round, and that adds up.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhanced Bond<\/span>: The bonus to damage and\n\t\thealing is fantastic on its own, applying not just to cantrips but also to\n\t\tyour leveled spells. 1d8 damage\/healing doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but that&#8217;s\n\t\tequivalent to adding a spell level for many spells like Burning Hands, Cure\n\t\tWounds. Just remember that your spirit needs to be summoned, so if you&#8217;re\n\t\tout of Wild Shape uses and your spirit is down, consider a Short Rest as\n\t\tsoon as possible.\n\t\t<p>The second portion of this feature allows you to originate spells from\n\t\t\tyour spirit instead of from yourself. Druids are notoriously frail (medium\n\t\t\tarmor, no metal, d8 hit dice), so allowing you to cast short-range spells\n\t\t\tlike Burning Hands while remaining at a safe distance is a huge benefit.\n\t\t\tThe spirit&#8217;s ability to fly makes this especially useful because you can\n\t\t\ttarget cones straight down and effectively get a circular AOE against\n\t\t\ttargets on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>However, remember that the spirit takes its turn immediately after yours, so positioning for this tactic can be difficult. Be aware that using the Ready action on a spell takes your Concentration so whatever else you were already Concentrating on will end if you try to Ready a spell for when the Wildfire Spirit is in position to deliver a spell.<\/p>\n<p>Also do note that this is not limited to your Druid spells. A good little combo if you for example dipped a level into Cleric is to fly the spirit up to a surrounded ally, use a readied Word of Radiance excluding the ally from the AoE, then using Fiery Teleport to evacuate the ally while adding even more damage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Cauterizing Flames<\/span>: 2d10+Wisdom is a\n\t\tdecent amount of healing or damage, especially as a Reaction. Provided that\n\t\tthere are multiple foes in an encounter, picking off the weak ones and\n\t\tstrategically applying this healing or dragging enemies through a spectral\n\t\tflame to damage them can have a significant impact. However, to make that\n\t\twork your party will need mechanisms to push, pull, drag, or otherwise\n\t\treposition your enemies.\n\t\t<p>Limiting this to your Reaction and proficiency bonus times per long rest prevents you and your allies from running\n\t\t\tthrough a series of these spectral flames in one turn to rapidly heal, and\n\t\t\tlimiting the whole effect to small or larger creatures prevents\n\t\t\tshenanigans like murdering a bag of rats and rolling your party through\n\t\t\tthe spectral flames to produce bottomless healing. WotC really nailed the\n\t\t\tlimitations on this one, so go-to abuse cases don&#8217;t apply. However, if you\n\t\t\twalk into a room full of goblins or kobolds, it starts to look like a room\n\t\t\tfull of health potions.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blazing Revival<\/span>: Half hit points is enough\n\t\tto get you back up and fighting without going back down immediately, and\n\t\tsacrificing your wildfire spirit to make this happen is absolutely worth the\n\t\tcost since you can just resummon it, provided that you still have a Wild\n\t\tShape use to do so. You only get to use this once per day, but hopefully\n\t\tthat&#8217;s enough, and if you&#8217;re ever unsure you can always retreat and live to\n\t\tfight another day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-land\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/druid#CircleoftheLand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle of the Land<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to emphasize the Druid&#8217;s spellcasting, this is the way to do it.

Unfortunately, beasts stopped being\n\t\tthreatening a long time ago (especially if you prepare Animal Friendship)\n\t\tand plant creatures are rare, so this will rarely matter.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-moon\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/druid#CircleoftheMoon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle of the Moon<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Moon allows the Druid to use Wild Shape as a combat form.\n\t\tDepending on the composition of your party, this may allow you to take the\n\t\tplace of your party&#8217;s Fighter-equivalent, filling space as a Defender and\n\t\tStriker. However, in most parties the Druid is taking the place of the\n\t\tCleric-equivalent, so you may need to drop out of Wild Shape in order to\n\t\tcast spells from time to time. You also may not have enough Wild Shape uses\n\t\tto be in Wild Shape in every encounter of a full adventuring day (the\n\t\tadventuring day guidelines recommend 6-8 encounters per day) if your hit\n\t\tpoints don&#8217;t hold up or if you need to drop out of Wild Shape to cast spels.\n\t\tFortunately, you can still use leveled spells in encounters where you&#8217;re not\n\t\tusing Wild Shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Wild Shape adds a second pool of hit points on top of your regular hit points, Circle of the Moon is arguably the most durable druid, and at level 2 the Circle of the Moon Druid is arguably the strongest character in the game. However, mastering Wild Shape is difficult, so I encourage you to read our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wildshape\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/moon\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14878\">Circle of the Moon Druid Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Wild Shape<\/span>: Moving into Wild Shape\n\t\tas a bonus action means that you can transform, move, and attack in the same\n\t\tturn. This makes it much easier to pick the right form for a combat since\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t need to guess before the fight starts. It also means that when you\n\t\tget knocked out of Wild Shape you can quickly get back into Wild Shape,\n\t\toften without taking significant damage to your real hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Circle Forms<\/span>: This allows you to take some\n\t\tdecent combat forms. See our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wildshape\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>\n\t\tfor a compilation and analysis of possible forms.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Primal Strike<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to run into a\n\t\tlot of things which resist non-magical weapon damage types, so this is very\n\t\timportant.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Wild Shape<\/span>: Fire Elemental is a\n\t\tflaming murder machine that you can use from now until you hit level 18 and\n\t\tcan turn into a Mammoth. It does take both of your Wild Shape uses, but if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re successful at setting everything on fire quickly, you may be able to\n\t\tavoid enough damage to stretch this through several fights.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Thousand Forms<\/span>: This is a 2nd-level spell,\n\t\tand the problems it solves can be solved better by Wild Shape.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-shepherd\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/druid#CircleoftheShepherd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle of the Shepherd<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Shepherd offers excellent options for the Druid to support their party and to summon creatures. And while it&#8217;s certainly the best summoning subclass in the game, Circle of the Shepherd&#8217;s Spirit Totem feature also offers a ton of support for your party. Together, the Druid can serve as Controller, Defender, Striker, and Support and move between those roles fluidly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/circle-of-the-shepherd\/\" data-type=\"page\">Circle of the Shepherd Druid Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Speech of the Woods<\/span>: A free language and\n\t\tconstant Speak with Animals. Not always useful, but wonderful for a Druid to\n\t\thave, and helpful if you&#8217;re summoning beasts because you can talk to them to\n\t\tgain information about things that they may have seen, allowing you to use\n\t\tbeasts as effective disposable scouts. As an example, you might summon a\n\t\tbunch of low-CR breasts with Conjure Animals (hope for things like rats,\n\t\tcrows, or other small, common animals) and send them to scout an area and\n\t\treport back to you.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spirit Totem<\/span>: Powerful and versatile, and\n\t\tas a bonus action it&#8217;s usable without cutting into your spellcasting.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bear Spirit<\/span>: If your party is on the\n\t\t\t\tdefensive, this is a good way to get some temporary hit points onto your\n\t\t\t\tallies. If you have a grappler in the party or if you&#8217;re facing an enemy\n\t\t\t\tthat grapples your party, Advantage on Strength checks is fantastic.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, the temporary hit points only apply when you first create the\n\t\t\t\tspirit, so its effectiveness diminishes quickly in most cases.\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is also very helpful if you summon numerous low-CR creatures.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe temporary hit points apply to all allies in the area, so if you\n\t\t\t\t\thave 8 summoned hyenas or something, they&#8217;re suddenly much more\n\t\t\t\t\tdurable and can soak considerably more damage which might otherwise be\n\t\t\t\t\tdirected at party members. Your summons get the benefits of Advantage\n\t\t\t\t\ton Strength checks, too, but most creatures that grapple have an\n\t\t\t\t\tattack that grapples automatically.<\/p>\n<p>Still, you may be able to command\n\t\t\t\t\tthem to grapple by normal means, which may be more effective since\n\t\t\t\t\tthey have Advantage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hawk Spirit<\/span>: Your go-to option in most\n\t\t\t\tcases, especially if you don&#8217;t plan to flood combat with summoned\n\t\t\t\tcreatures. As a back-line spellcaster, you can use your largely ignored\n\t\t\t\tReaction to grant Advantage on an attack roll. If you have a rogue in the\n\t\t\t\tparty, this is an easy way to get Sneak Attack. For other party\n\t\t\t\tmembers it&#8217;s just a nice buff that you can grant once per round,\nbut as Extra Attack comes online it will feel less impactful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Unicorn Spirit<\/span>: If you&#8217;re taking a\n\t\t\t\tshort rest and haven&#8217;t already expended Spirit Totem, use this before\n\t\t\t\tyour rest to get some extra healing. The spell you cast doesn&#8217;t need to\n\t\t\t\tbe anything fancy: It just needs to be a leveled spell that restores hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints. Healing Word works, for example, and it&#8217;s a great way to trigger\n\t\t\t\tthis repeatedly.\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear if spells like Goodberry or Healing Spirit\n\t\t\t\tare intended to work since they don&#8217;t immediately heal a targeted creature when you\n\t\t\t\tcast the spell, but they do restore hit points, so RAW I think it works.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is an exciting option when you have numerous summoned creatures\n\t\t\t\t\tbecause the additional healing doesn&#8217;t have a cap on the number of\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets. If you have a small army of summoned creatures, you can heal\n\t\t\t\t\tthem for free, stretching the benefits of your spell slot.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mighty Summoner<\/span>: One of the biggest\n\t\tproblems with summoned creatures is that most can&#8217;t overcome damage\n\t\tresistance or immunity to non-magical attacks. This solves that issue, and\n\t\talso makes your summoned creatures slightly more durable so that you get\n\t\tsome more mileage from your spell slots.\n\t\t<p>However, the new summon spells introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of\n\t\t\tEverything don&#8217;t appear to have hit dice, so they don&#8217;t appear to benefit\n\t\t\tfrom the additional hp. All creatures should have hit dice, and you might\n\t\t\targue that they have a number of hit dice equal to the spell level used to\n\t\t\tsummon them, but we haven&#8217;t gotten an official answer on the subject so\n\t\t\tdiscuss it with your DM before making any assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>Summon Draconic Spirit, which follows the same mechanics as other Tasha&#8217;s-era Summon X spells, specifies that the spirit has one hit die per spell level, which seems like a very reasonable way to handle that.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guardian Spirit<\/span>: With this and Mighty\n\t\tSummoner, you can make Conjure X spells last for an exceptionally long time\n\t\teven while in combat, even if you don&#8217;t plan to use Unicorn Spirit to get\n\t\tfree healing for your summons.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Faithful Summons<\/span>: At this level CR 2\n\t\tcreatures aren&#8217;t likely to win a fight for you (even with the benefits of\n\t\tMighty Summoner), but they might keep enemies at bay long enough for your\n\t\tparty to come to your rescue.\n\t\t<p>The language is fairly clear that you can&#8217;t trigger this willingly, so\n\t\t\tunfortunately you can&#8217;t tell your allies to beat you unconscious to get\n\t\t\tfree summons (though they could technically decide to do so on their own\n\t\t\tso long as you weren&#8217;t willingly going along with their plan).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This also uniquely allows you to select the beasts which you summon,\n\t\t\twhich is weird since Conjure Animals doesn&#8217;t normally allow that. I\n\t\t\trecommend the Giant Constrictor Snake because its attacks can grapple your\n\t\t\tfoes and buy you more time for your allies to rescue you. But the Giant\n\t\t\tBoar is hard to kill thanks to Relentless, and the Polar Bear&#8217;s attacks\n\t\t\tare really good without needing to run around and leave your unconscious\n\t\t\tbody defenseless.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-pale\">3rd-Party Publishers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT has covered some 3rd-party content from our favorite creators.
