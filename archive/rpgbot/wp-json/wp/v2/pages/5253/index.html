This offers plenty of options for a variety of\n\tbuilds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: 6+ skills and some excellent skill\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Spells<\/span>: Hunters are divine spontaneous\n\tspellcasters, and get access to both the Ranger spell list and the Druid spell\n\tlist. Ranger spells, especially 4th-level Ranger spells, are absolutely\n\tfantastic, and the Hunter gets them earlier and in greater quantity than\n\tanyone else in the game. The Hunter&#8217;s spells are dependent on Wisdom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Orisons<\/span>: Fantastic and versatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Companion<\/span> (Ex): The Hunter gets the\n\tbest version of Animal Companion in the game. On top of the Druid&#8217;s version\n\t(the previous gold standard), the Hunter can teach their companion tricks from\n\tthe Skirmisher Ranger&#8217;s list of &#8220;Hunter&#8217;s Tricks&#8221;. Some of these tricks don&#8217;t\n\tquite make sense for an Animal Companion, but a few of them are very helpful.\n\tIn addition, if the Hunter loses of foregos their animal companion, Summon\n\tNature&#8217;s Ally spells extend their duration from rounds to minutes per\n\tlevel.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Focus<\/span> (Su): This is a fantastic way\n\tto quickly buff yourself and your Animal Companion, and the bonuses can be\n\tused to address a variety of challenges. Remember that the bonus to your\n\tcompanion doesn&#8217;t consume your minutes per day duration, so you can leave it\n\tin place permanently.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bat<\/span>: Not always important, but fantastic\n\t\tto have available when you do need it. At high levels the blindsense is\n\t\tgreat for detecting invisible foes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bear<\/span>: Temporary bonuses to Constitution\n\t\tare difficult to justify because they can kill you when they expire.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bull<\/span>: This can largely replace your belt&#8217;s\n\t\tbonus to Strength.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Falcon<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Frog<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monkey<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mouse<\/span>: Evasion is fantastic on any\n\t\tcharacter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Owl<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Snake<\/span>: Situational, but this can be\n\t\tfantastic if you or your companion are built as a Defender.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stag<\/span>: The bonus is tiny.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tiger<\/span>: This can largely replace your\n\t\tbelt&#8217;s bonus to Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wolf<\/span>: Situational, and the range is\n\t\tgarbage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Nature Training<\/span> (Ex): There are very few\n\tfeats where Druid or Ranger levels matter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wild Empathy<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Companion<\/span> (Ex): If you plan to be an\n\tarcher, you need Precise Shot. If you plan for your Hunter to be in melee,\n\tOutflank can be a great way to team up with your Animal Companion, especially\n\tbecause your companion gets Outflank for free. If you plan to ride your\n\tcompanion but use melee weapons, consider the Pack Flanking feat; once you get\n\tHunter Tactics, it will be granted to your Animal Companion for free.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Track<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hunter Tactics<\/span> (Ex): Teamwork Feats are very\n\tpowerful, but requiring multiple characters to select them can often be\n\tproblematic. Granting the Hunter a guaranteed ally for teamwork makes them\n\tmuch more viable. This also allows the Animal Companion to get very difficult\n\tteamwork feats without meeting prerequisites which are already difficult for a\n\tplayer character.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Teamwork Feat<\/span>: Free Teamwork Feats, and the\n\tHunter can change their most recent choice as a standard action any number of\n\ttimes. Remember that with Hunter Tactics the Hunter&#8217;s feat choice is\n\tautomatically shared with their Animal Companion, which makes this even\n\tbetter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Empathic Link<\/span> (Su): Once your\n\tfamiliar becomes intelligent, you can give them complex instructions to scout\n\tfor you. Allowing the Hunter to see through their companion&#8217;s eyes allows the\n\thunter to see things first-hand without putting themselves in danger.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Woodland Stride<\/span> (Ex): Very Situational<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Tricks<\/span> (Ex): Most characters probably\n\tcan&#8217;t make use of a lot of extra tricks, but remember that Hunters can teach\n\ttheir companion Hunter&#8217;s Tricks from the Skirmisher Ranger ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Second Animal Focus<\/span> (Su): In addition to the\n\tscaling bonuses from Animal Focus, 8th level allows the Hunter to gain two\n\tbonuses (three if the Hunter&#8217;s companion is dead), and grant two to their\n\tAnimal Companion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Swift Tracker<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Raise Animal Companion<\/span> (Sp): A &#8220;permanent&#8221;\n\tnegative level to raise the Hunter&#8217;s Animal Companion is a cheap price to pay\n\tconsidering that the negative level goes away after 24 hours. Because this is\n\ta spell-like ability it takes a Standard Action to use, and has no material\n\tcomponent. Raise your companion in combat if you need to.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Speak with Master<\/span> (Ex): This makes it\n\tconsiderably easier to share information and instructions with your\n\tcompanion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Empathic Link<\/span> (Su): Even better than\n\tspeaking, now you can exchange information and commands silently. Combined\n\twith the ability to see through the companion&#8217;s eyes, the Hunter can now\n\tessentially remote-control their Animal Companion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">One with the Wild<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Master Hunter<\/span> (Ex): The tracking bit is\n\tworthless, but adding a third animal focus which lasts all day is absolutely\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wisdom is the Hunter&#8217;s spellcasting ability, but other abilities are largely\n\tdependent on your build. Since they roll in medium armor and have a big\n\tdurable pet to stand behind, I recommend opting for archery over melee\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Str<\/span>: If you plan to use melee weapons,\n\tStrength is essential. If you plan to use a bow, pick up a bit for damage, but\n\tI wouldn&#8217;t go with more than 14 at level 1.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: In only medium armor, a bit of\n\tDexterity will be a good supplement to the Hunter&#8217;s AC, and it&#8217;s obviously\n\tcrucial if you plan to use a bow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points and Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Only needed for skill ranks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: The Hunter&#8217;s spellcasting ability, and\n\tcompensates for the Hunter&#8217;s &#8220;bad&#8221; will save. However, the Hunter is only a\n\t2\/3 caster, so don&#8217;t think that you need to compete with a Cleric or a\n\tDruid.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Only useful for Handle Animal and Wild\n\tEmpathy, and you can improve your modifier easily enough that dumping Charisma\n\twon&#8217;t hurt much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 14<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 12<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 12<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 15<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of race depends heavily on your build. Hunters aren&#8217;t terribly feat-starved so Humans don&#8217;t absolutely beat out all other options, and because the Hunter isn&#8217;t a full caster it&#8217;s not particularly important to get a Wisdom bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: Bonuses to two important abilities\n\tand a penalty to the Hunter&#8217;s biggest dump stat. On top of that, the Dwarf\n\tprovides a pile of great defensive bonuses. Unfortunately, the Dwarf favored\n\tclass bonus is garbade.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: Nothing really helpful for the Hunter,\n\tand the favored class bonus is garbage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gnome<\/span>: The bonus to Charisma is totally\n\twasted, but a bonus to Constitution is nice, and the Gnome favored class bonus\n\tis fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Elf<\/span>: With some alternate racial\n\tfeatures the Half-Elf is a decent choice, but it doesn&#8217;t offer anything\n\tspecifically good for the Hunter. The Half-Elf favored class bonus is garbage,\n\tand the Elf and Human favored class bonuses don&#8217;t help either.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: The Half-Orc offers a flexible\n\tability bonus and Darkvision. The Half-Orc favored class bonus adds HP to your\n\tAnimal Companion, which is great if you plan to let your companion tank for\n\tyou.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: The Charisma bonus is wasted, but\n\tthe bonus to Dexterity can be nice for an archer Hunter, and the Halflings\n\tother racial bonuses make for a good sneaky hunter. The Halfling favored class\n\tbonus gives your Animal Companion a very rare luck bonus to saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always good at everything, Humans\n\thave a lot to offer. The Human favored class bonus is unfortunately\n\tdisappointing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Climb<\/span> (Str): Too situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Handle Animal<\/span> (Cha): Required to train\n\t\tyour Animal Companion, and if your GM is handling your compaion RAW\n\t\tessential to keep your Animal Companion under control in combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span> (Wis): The Hunter needs Wisdom for\n\t\tspells, which makes the Hunter a good option for your party&#8217;s Heal user.\n\t\tWith some cheap items and a few skill ranks, Heal is a fantastic supplement\n\t\tto the party&#8217;s magical healing capacity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): The Hunter is not a\n\t\tFace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (dungeoneering)<\/span> (Int): One of\n\t\tthe most important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (geography)<\/span> (Int):\n\t\tSituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (nature)<\/span> (Int): One of the most\n\t\timportant Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): One of the most rolled\n\t\tskills in the game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): Even if you plan to ride your\n\t\tAnimal Companion, you only need a few ranks unless you intend to depend on\n\t\tMounted Combat to defend your companion. You may need a few more to offset\n\t\tan Armor Check Penalty, especially if you pick up heavy armor\n\t\tproficiency.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcraft<\/span> (Int): Hunters don&#8217;t need a\n\t\tlot of Intelligence, so Spellcraft is a hard skill for Hunters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Essential if you plan to\n\t\tbe your party&#8217;s scout.

Even with only 2\/3 BAB, thanks to options like Outflank your attack\n\t\tbonus often unusually high, allowing you to reliably hit on your charge.\n\t\tLances also have reach and can be used one-handed while mounted, allowing\n\t\tyou to fight from the back of a flying mount and attack enemies on the\n\t\tground, and to benefit from reach without giving up a shield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Longbow<\/span>: If you&#8217;re fighting at range, the\n\t\tLongbow is your best option. You&#8217;ll want a bit of Strength for the extra\n\t\tdamage, and you might consider the Adaptive enhancement so that you can use\n\t\tAnimal Focus to temporarily buff your Strength.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapier<\/span>: If you&#8217;re fighting in melee, a\n\t\trapier and shield are a perfectly fine option.
