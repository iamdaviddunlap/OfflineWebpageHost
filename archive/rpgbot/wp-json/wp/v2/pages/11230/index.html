Because it turns out that hitting 0 hp as your new form will always end the spell on you, even if it&#8217;s been 1000 years of living as a dragon. It&#8217;s unclear what happens when you revert: has time passed for your body? Has your original stat block gained the benefits of any rests you may have had in the interim? Fully open to DM interpretation and therefore argument. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of, what happens if I turn someone into something with a naturally very short lifespan like a housefly?

What does \u201cany kind you choose\u201d mean? Does that mean any printed creature? Does that include NPCs with levels? Does it mean you can make up creatures from whole cloth and, as long as the calculated CR is less than that of your target, you can turn someone into a weredracopyre lich? There&#8217;s no right answer here. In discussing this with Tyler, his answer was to lean heavily on the word \u201ckind.\u201d To him, \u201ckind\u201d meant \u201cspecies as defined by taxonomical classification,\u201d so I could choose to make you a human or a pit fiend, but not the Diviner stat block from Volo&#8217;s. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gets weird when we have multiple stat blocks, a la dragons. So I could choose \u201cbrass dragon,\u201d but then what age category am I? If I choose \u201cskeleton,\u201d what kind of skeleton am I? Are animated things like Golems and Strangling Rugs creatures since they have stat blocks and therefore fair game, or are they magic items and therefore verboten? If I can be a golem, they don&#8217;t have species so what happens there? On the other hand, if you go for \u201cany printed stat block of appropriate CR,\u201d suddenly I can turn myself into named beings like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/17462-ogremoch\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/17462-ogremoch\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ogremoch<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I would personally try to fall between the two but closer to the lax end (because this is a 9th level spell and the game left the rails behind long ago at that point). Let&#8217;s say, at my table, you can use any stat block that isn&#8217;t for a unique creature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I brought up a problematic point a moment ago with golems when dealing with created\/animated creatures. What happens if I choose, for example, a golem with text in its stat block \u201cA golem can&#8217;t think or act for itself?\u201d I don&#8217;t have a good answer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>One fortunate piece of clarity comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EWOsPhKNyPk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this episode of Dragon Talk <\/a>where Crawford clarifies that \u201cretain[ing] its personality and alignment\u201d means that it&#8217;s intended that you still understand who your friends are, even if your intelligence is now lower than the average bear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next paragraph: \u201cThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&#8217;t reduce the creature&#8217;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&#8217;t knocked <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/compendium\/rules\/basic-rules\/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unconscious<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing particularly noteworthy here. Next paragraph: \u201cThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&#8217;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing really surprising here, although one thing can be a bit confusing. Just because a form you take is capable of casting spells does not mean you can inherently cast any spells that aren&#8217;t part of that stat block. Just because your character knows the hand wiggles and latin necessary for casting Wish does not mean that your assumed form has the wellspring of power within to be able to make it happen, any more than if you taught the components to a random farmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Next paragraph: \u201cThe target&#8217;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can&#8217;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\u201d This one is a little disappointing because Shapechange is way more generous about what you can do with your gear if you cast it on yourself, but given that this is also supposed to function as Uber Baleful Polymorph I guess it makes sense that you wouldn&#8217;t want to let the person you&#8217;re turning into a standard turtle continue wearing their Robe of the Archmagi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to list a few great options for Undead and Constructs here since I cover everything else down in the Shapechange section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Boreworm<\/span>: Straight up immunity to B\/P\/S unless the damage comes from magic or adamantine weapons and a handful of other good brute stats make this a fun way to mix it up in melee.

It doesn&#8217;t fix what happens when you choose \u201cBrass Dragon\u201d though. Can you choose an age category?

You don&#8217;t gain any <strong>Spellcasting<\/strong> traits, but you <em>do<\/em> gain <strong>Innate Spellcasting <\/strong>traits. This is to represent that you&#8217;re turning into a normal creature of that type, not one with additional training. You need to look carefully at what you choose, but most high-level things have Innate and not regular so expect to be able to use everything unless you are, for instance, looking at the Diviner stat block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of seeing the thing you intend to turn into, from the same Dragon Talk mentioned above, there&#8217;s some vagueness about what \u201cseeing\u201d one actually means. Crawford calls out that, RAI, a depiction of one (like a drawing) would not work, but then goes on to say that using a Crystal Ball on one would. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s just basically a movie screen that a Scrying is playing on. So what level of authenticity is required? Can I have my friend True Polymorph into a pit fiend, let me see it, not concentrate for an hour so they turn back, and then I can do it? If I use magic to see a pit fiend in a dream (with the Dream spell), does that count?
