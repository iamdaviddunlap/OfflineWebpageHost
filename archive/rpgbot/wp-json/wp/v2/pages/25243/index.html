It&#8217;s hard enough when you have a spell repertoire and\n\t\tcan burn an appropriate spell slot, but when you&#8217;re a prepared caster your\n\t\tability to counter spells drops precipitously as you go through the day\n\t\tcasting spells. This problems get larger every time Paizo publishes a new\n\t\tsource book because your odds of having the right spell get smaller as more\n\t\tspells are introduced.\n<p>If you take this, Recognize Spell, Quick Recognition, and Clever Counterspell, then cram every single Common spell into your spellbook, this gets\nmuch more effective. But that&#8217;s two Class Feats, two Skill Feats, and won&#8217;t work until level 12. If you do want\nto go that route, pick a different 1st-level feat and retrain into Counterspell later in your career because\nit&#8217;s going to be almost completely useless until then. But even after all of that, remember that you spend a spell slot and make a Counteract check which you still might fail.<\/p>\n<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Familiars are really good, but this only gets you two abilities. If you&#8217;re not taking Improved Familiar Attunement, you get a better deal from Familiar Master Dedication or Witch Dedication, though you&#8217;ll need to wait for level 2 for either. For help with your familiar, see\n\t\tour\n\t\t<a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\">Reach Spell<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Many\n\t\tlow-level spells have poor range, and most Hexes have a range of either\n\t\tTouch or 30 ft., so you can get a lot of use out of this. Your familiar may\n\t\tbe able to deliver touch spells for you, which may be sufficient.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\">Spellbook Prodigy<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you like to compulsively\ncollect spells like I do, Spellbook Prodigy can be a huge quality of life improvement. It makes doing so\ncheaper, more reliable, and massively faster. If you&#8217;re fine with the spells that you get for free at every level, or if learning additional spells isn&#8217;t going to be an option for some reason, skip this.\n<p>It normally takes one hour per Spell Rank to learn a spell. Spellbook Prodigy reduces this to 10 minutes. At low levels this might not feel significant, but as you gain levels you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;re spending days at a time to learn a few extra spells, and the problem only gets worse as you gain levels.<\/p>\n<p>Ater spending whatever amount of time to Learn a Spell, you make a skill check (Arcana in this case). On a Success, you learn the spell and spend some money. On a Critical Success, the cost is halved. On a failure you can&#8217;t try again until you gain a level, and on a Critical Failure you also spend half of the cost. Spellbook Prodigy upgrades your Success rolls to Critical Success, effectively halving the cost to learn new spells. It also upgrades Critical Failure to Failure, so you never spend half the cost when things go very badly. Finally, it changes the retry calldown when you fail so that you can retry after a week.<\/p>\n<p>The final portion of the feat allows you to work down the cost to learn a spell using the Earn an Income rules. This seems straightforward, but it doesn&#8217;t specify the level for the task. Earn an Income requires the GM to set a level for available jobs, which then determines how much income players can earn. With no guidance on what level to make the job for Spellbook Prodigy, you can&#8217;t predict the benefit. I recommend using the minimum level to learn the spell. This will mean that spells which are near the top of the player&#8217;s limits will justify the work, while lower-rank spells may not be worth the time.<\/p>\n<p><em>Remaster Changes<\/em>: The time to learn spells was changed from half of the normal time to a fixed 10 minutes regardless of Spell Rank, you now upgrade a Success to a Critical Success, and you can now spend Downtime to work down the cost to learn a spell. Overall, it&#8217;s a huge improvement.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\">Widen Spell<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>: Great for\n\t\tBlasters.

You won&#8217;t always\n\t\tneed this, but it works consistently when you do.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, the feat doesn&#8217;t remove the Manipulate trait. This means that\n\t\t\tyou do still need to move and that you still trigger Reactions.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t><em>Remaster Changes:<\/em>: This no longer requires skill checks to hide\n\t\t\tyour spell components.

You&#8217;ll also run into situations\n\t\twhere enemies have resistance or immunity to whatever type of damage they\n\t\tdeal (such as red dragons being immune to fire) so casting a spell to get\n\t\ttemporary resistance to that damage type may not affect your enemies. In\n\t\tother situations enemies may simply change the type of damage that they&#8217;re\n\t\tdealing (spellcasters, etc.). The best use case for this is enemies dealing\n\t\tdamage of one type multiple times in small amounts, but of a type which\n\t\tthey&#8217;re not resistant to. Enemies using weapons with runes that add\n\t\telemental damage are a good example, but situations like that are not\n\t\tcommon.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\">Enhanced Familiar<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">PC1<\/a>)<\/sup>:\n\tFamiliars are really good, and expanding their limited number of\n\t\tabilities can make them even better.
