While this dichotomy is still sort of present in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3, the change to how prepared casters change their prepared spells takes away a lot of the primary difference and benefits of the version of adaptability the Sorcerer brings. What they are still very good for, however, is being the party Face while still being an arcane caster, allowing you to have your Tav cast most of the Wizard spell list while still optimizing for those persuasion checks that are heavily littered throughout the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also the case that Sorcerers don&#8217;t have access to Ritual Casting, making several choices that are excellent on a Wizard much less interesting as described below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#cantrips\">Sorcerer Cantrips<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#1st-level\">1st-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#2nd-level\">2nd-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#3rd-level\">3rd-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#4th-level\">4th-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#5th-level\">5th-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#6th-level\">6th-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses a color coding scheme to rate individual character options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Sorcerers learn 4 cantrips at level 1, then another at levels 4 and 10. You generally cannot replace cantrips except by respeccing your entire build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Acid Splash<\/span>: This is the only AoE\n\t\tcantrip in the game, which becomes important if you&#8217;re dealing with one of\n\t\tthe surprisingly many situations where someone is casting sanctuary. Other\n\t\tthan that, it&#8217;s on a small die that won&#8217;t often catch more than one creature\n\t\tand doesn&#8217;t interact with the Wet condition, making it worse than either\n\t\tother main damage cantrip. If you&#8217;re going for Evocation School, this one of\n\t\tthe only two cantrips that work with Potent Cantrip.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Blade Ward<\/span>: We are not a cleric needing to\n\t\tprotect ourselves while blending.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bone Chill<\/span>: Necrotic is a decent damage\n\t\ttype in this game, but it&#8217;s a smaller die than Firebolt and the rider isn&#8217;t\n\t\timpactful nearly as frequently as Ray of Frost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dancing Lights<\/span>: The appeal of Dancing\n\t\tLights is that you can place the light at a distance to handle enemies who\n\t\tare in Darkness so that your party doesn&#8217;t suffer Disadvantage to attack\n\t\tthem. But Darkvision is widely available, actual darkness is rare (at least\n\t\tuntil Darkvision is accessible via spells), and this requires Concentration\n\t\twhich is much better spent on almost anything else.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Firebolt<\/span>: So good it&#8217;s on every origin\n\t\telf. D10s are great, doors usually take double damage from fire, and the\n\t\tability to inspect targets means you&#8217;re never going to use it on someone\n\t\tresistant to fire (without making that intentional choice).<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Friends<\/span>: Basically easy mode for social\n\t\tsituations, giving you Advantage on Persuasion checks in most conversations.\n\t\tThis is good, but on high difficulties some creatures will accuse you of\n\t\tmagically charming them (only after the duration runs out though, so you have a minute to flee the scene), which can cause problems. When it becomes\n\t\tavailable at level 3 (when you get 2nd-level spells), Enhance Ability makes\n\t\tthis obsolete, although spending a whole spell known on that is a consideration for Sorcerers which bumps this rating up to green.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Light<\/span>: Environmental light sources are\n\t\tabundant, actual darkness is rare, and Darkvision is easily accessible. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re really that desperate, have someone carry a torch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mage Hand<\/span>: Look how they massacred my\n\t\tboy. For being so good I wrote an\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/mage-hand\/\">entire article<\/a>\n\t\ton its uses in the tabletop game, it is crushingly bad here. It can throw\n\t\tthings like alchemist&#8217;s fire or healing potions if you drop those on the\n\t\tground, effectively freeing up people&#8217;s bonus actions to do other things\n\t\tthan drink, but even with that and the ability to shove it&#8217;s not nearly the\n\t\tutility powerhouse people may be used to in the tabletop rules. You can send\n\t\tit through burrow holes though, which may facilitate opening doors through\n\t\tlevers. Only allowing it once per rest is still punishing, however.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Minor Illusion<\/span>: Fantastic in a party\n\t\twhich is relying on Stealth in any meaningful way, but otherwise skip it.\n\t\tSee our\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/spells\/minor-illusion\/\">Practical Guide to Minor Illusion<\/a>\n\t\tfor more specific advice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Poison Spray<\/span>: It targets the worst save\n\t\tand does the worst damage type in the game. The only reason to use this\n\t\twould be if you get the Poisoner&#8217;s Gloves from the middle of act two and\n\t\tboost your spell save sky-high with items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ray of Frost<\/span>: While Cold is a commonly\n\t\tresisted damage type, nothing I encountered in the game was immune to it.\n\t\tBottles of water are found in many places humanoids keep food throughout the\n\t\tgame, and can be thrown by your Cleric after they turn on Spirit Guardians.\n\t\tThe Wet condition overrides innate resistances, setting the target&#8217;s value\n\t\tto vulnerable to Cold and Lightning damage. With a couple magic items\n\t\tboosting elemental damage at the end of the game, my Gale was routinely\n\t\thitting for ~50 damage per turn with Ray of Frost.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shocking Grasp<\/span>: If your Sorcerer finds\n\t\tthemselves in melee, this is a great way to escape. Many enemies in the game\n\t\twear or are made of metal and offer advantage on the attack roll to let you\n\t\tscoot away in peace.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">True Strike<\/span>: This allows you to spend your\n\t\tAction to get Advantage on one attack, which will typically come from your\n\t\tAction on the following turn. In nearly every case, it makes more sense to\n\t\tspend both of those actions attacking because you&#8217;re rolling just as many\n\t\tattack rolls, plus you might hit with both attacks. The appeal here is for\n\t\tspellcasters planning to make a single attack with a high resource cost,\n\t\tsuch as Chromatic Orb or Melf&#8217;s Acid Arrow, but you should just be using Ray\n\t\tof Frost twice instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1st-level\">1st-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Burning Hands<\/span>: At low levels, this is\n\t\tyour go-to option for AoE damage as it has a better average damage and\n\t\ttargets a better save than Thunderwave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Charm Person<\/span>: Charming people is awful in\n\t\tcombat, and out of combat you should just use Friends or Enhance Ability if\n\t\tyou want the skill benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chromatic Orb<\/span>: You can choose your damage\n\t\ttype every time you cast it and all but one of those creates a possibly\n\t\tuseful surface even when you miss. Cold and Lightning will both benefit from\n\t\tyour target being Wet. If you just want straight damage and no fun surfaces,\n\t\tThunder gets an extra damage die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Colour Spray<\/span>: While this has the massive\n\t\tquality of life buff compared to the tabletop rules of being able to see\n\t\teverything&#8217;s hitpoints and therefore know exactly what to expect, you&#8217;re\n\t\tonly blinding them for a single round.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Disguise Self<\/span>: This spell is incredibly\n\t\tpowerful in unexpected ways. Rather than simply creating an illusion like\n\t\tthe tabletop version, it actually gives you all the appropriate tags for\n\t\twherever you turn into, allowing things like turning into a Small race which\n\t\tcan then be augmented with Reduce to move through the burrow hole tunnels\n\t\tplaced strategically throughout the game, or even using equipment with stats\n\t\ttied to race like the Githyanki Silver Sword. It&#8217;s a harder sell on a Sorcerer who can&#8217;t just prepare it when needed and then drop it for combat though.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Expeditious Retreat<\/span>: There are\n\t\tvanishingly few times when the only thing you&#8217;ll care to do with your\n\t\tconcentration is make yourself move faster, but I can think of a couple, so\n\t\tthis comes in at orange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Evil and Good<\/span>:\n\t\tSpectacular protection against the affected creature types. Note that this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t actually care about things being evil or good; it&#8217;s just the\n\t\tcreature type that matters. Why is it named \u201cProtection from Evil and Good\u201d?\n\t\tTradition dating back to the 70&#8217;s.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">False Life<\/span>: Early on, it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\tjustify spending a spell slot on 7 temp hp because they&#8217;re a precious\n\t\tresource. Later on, it&#8217;s hard to justify spending a spell slot on 7 temp hp\n\t\tbecause you&#8217;re probably getting temp hp from your cleric whenever they heal\n\t\tyou thanks to items.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Feather Fall<\/span>: While, on paper, this\n\t\tsounds like a great buff in a game where people love pushing you off of\n\t\tthings, most often you will simply die to chasm rather than take damage for\n\t\tfalling, and any time you would want to jump down a cliff there&#8217;s usually a\n\t\tway around that doesn&#8217;t spend spell slots. Once again though, I can think of\n\t\ta situation where this would be useful, so yellow it is. It&#8217;s also a ritual,\n\t\tso outside of combat you can prepare it, cast it for free, leap off a cliff,\n\t\tand then immediately unprepare it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fog Cloud<\/span>: Low-budget Darkness. There are\n\t\ta couple magic items in the game that provide immunity to Blindness, and\n\t\tBlindness is how both this and Darkness apply their \u201ccan&#8217;t see in here\u201d\n\t\teffect, making anyone standing in a cloud while wearing such an item capable\n\t\tof attacking freely out of it while being untargetable. This can be cheesed\n\t\tas the AI will simply forget about things they can&#8217;t see, meaning you can\n\t\tget in 10 turns worth of attacking with minimal retaliation. You can also\n\t\tdip in and out, taking your action to do something in the middle, but some\n\t\tthings to keep in mind:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>While blind, all terrain is difficult terrain, halving your move\n\t\t\t\tspeed.<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t<li>If things are hanging out right at the edge, they won&#8217;t be blind and\n\t\t\t\tmay take an attack of opportunity as you walk back into the spell&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tarea.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grease<\/span>: Prone is an incredibly powerful\n\t\tcondition in this game as it immediately breaks concentration and limits\n\t\tpeople standing back up to a bonus action on their next turn. Most enemies\n\t\twill jump out of it once they stand up, so try to combo it with some fire\n\t\tdamage after knocking people over to light them on fire.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ice Knife<\/span>: With the existence of Chromatic\n\t\tOrb and Magic Missile, there&#8217;s better single target damage options for\n\t\t1st-level slots on your Sorcerer.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enhance Leap<\/span>: Much exploration can happen with\n\t\tjumping, and this makes it so no one will get left behind as you&#8217;re doing\n\t\tit. It&#8217;s a much harder sell on a Sorcerer than a Wizard though as Sorcerer&#8217;s aren&#8217;t ritual casters and would have to spend a spell slot on it per target.&gt;\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mage Armour<\/span>: The primary tool to prevent\n\t\tlow-level Sorcerers from dying. Because this lasts until your next Long Rest\n\t\tbut doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, it&#8217;s a candidate for\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Missile<\/span>: This spell is already great\n\t\tin tabletop, and its ludicrously good in a system where you can see that\n\t\tyour other spells are likely to miss\/fail <em>and<\/em> see what hp things\n\t\tare at, letting you determine exactly how many missiles are required to\n\t\tprobably or guaranteeably kill them.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Evil and Good<\/span>:\n\t\tSpectacular protection against the affected creature types. Note that this\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t actually care about things being evil or good; it&#8217;s just the\n\t\tcreature type that matters. Why is it named \u201cProtection from Evil and Good\u201d?\n\t\tTradition dating back to the 70&#8217;s.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ray of Sickness<\/span>: Bad save, bad damage type.\n\t\tTake Poison Spray if you want to put on Poisoner&#8217;s Gloves and do that sort\n\t\tof thing.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shield<\/span>: This will take your reaction and\n\t\tmany of your first level spell slots through most of the game.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sleep<\/span>: This spell didn&#8217;t need a buff, but\n\t\tbuff it they did (with one huge drawback). The hitpoint total is now\n\t\tdeterministically set to the average of 5d8 so no awful rolls messing up\n\t\tyour plans. Also, as mentioned in Magic Missile, seeing exactly how much hp\n\t\tthings have makes targeting this spell a dream. The problem is, Larian\n\t\tthinks that AoE crowd control lasting for its intended duration is too\n\t\tstrong (they&#8217;re probably right) so this, like Hypnotic Pattern, got nerfed\n\t\tfrom a minute duration down to just two rounds. Still, if you can kill the\n\t\trest of the encounter while those two rounds are going (or just use this to\n\t\tdeliver a huge sneak attack\/spell crit), you&#8217;ve made your life much easier\n\t\twith a single spell slot.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter<\/span>: Low-budget,\n\t\tsingle-target save-or-suck. If you&#8217;re not planning for your party to pile in\n\t\ton your target to quickly kill them, this is as good at taking a target out\n\t\tof combat as Hold Person.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Thunderwave<\/span>: Not much damage, and\n\t\tConstitution saves are often high for many enemies, but you can launch\n\t\tenemies off ledges or into pits, which can often win a fight for you. While\n\t\thigh-Strength characters can rely on Shove, most spellcasters don&#8217;t have the\n\t\tStrength or Athletics to make that work. You can also launch objects,\n\t\tallowing you to launch a bunch of objects at your enemies if you set up\n\t\tbeforehand.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Witch Bolt<\/span>: Still bad. Just use Chromatic\n\t\tOrb.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2nd-level\">2nd-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness<\/span>: A fantastic debuff with no\n\t\tConcentration, especially against enemies that rely on fighting at range.\n\t\tHowever, Constitution saves tend to be high, so this may prove to be\n\t\tunreliable. If available to your party, the rat familiar&#8217;s Infectious Bite\n\t\tcan impose Disadvantage on Constitution saves, making this spell much more\n\t\treliable.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blur<\/span>: With a (likely) low AC and the\n\t\tfact that this takes your Concentration, it&#8217;s not going to provide much\n\t\tvalue to Sorcerers. It can be stacked with Mirror Image to get the most out of\n\t\tthat last duplicate, but that&#8217;s a lot of resources going into defending\n\t\tyourself.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cloud of Daggers<\/span>: Creates a small area of\n\t\tongoing damage. Ideally you can force enemies to stay within the area and\n\t\tquickly grind them down, but if they do escape, have your party Shove them\n\t\tback in. The upcasting scales at a decent rate, too, so this can remain an\n\t\teffective tactic through the whole game.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crown of Madness<\/span>: In a fight against\n\t\tmultiple enemies, this is a great way to tip things in your favor. The\n\t\ttarget is forced to move toward the nearest creature and make a melee\n\t\tattack, consuming the vast majority of their action economy. Melee enemies\n\t\twill deal more damage, but you can also target enemy spellcasters which\n\t\tforces them to waste their Actions making melee attacks instead of casting\n\t\tspells.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Darkness<\/span>: Do you have a Warlock with\n\t\tDevil&#8217;s Sight in your party? Would you like them to solo the encounter? Drop\n\t\tthis at a place with good sightlines and walk away, letting them\n\t\tHex+Eldritch Blast+Agonizing Blast everything to death while taking no\n\t\tretaliation. Works on everything except Devils, permanently blind enemies,\n\t\tand some boss fights. Even without that, it&#8217;s still good for all the same\n\t\tthings Fog Cloud is described for above.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Darkvision<\/span>: Many playable races get\n\t\tDarkvision, and 3 of the 4 companions you&#8217;re likely to get first have it\n\t\tinnately, including the one that serves as a tailor-made scout. It won&#8217;t\n\t\thurt to learn off a scroll and keep around in case you need to prepare it,\n\t\tbut I never cast this once in a 150-hour tactician run. Because this lasts\n\t\tuntil your next Long Rest but doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, it&#8217;s a\n\t\tcandidate for\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Detect Thoughts<\/span>: Sorcerers make natural faces anyway. They shouldn&#8217;t need the help this spell would provide and it&#8217;s not worth spending a spell known on.<\/li>\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enhance Ability<\/span>: Make conversations easymode or let your Scout be the best sneak\/pockpocket\/lockpicker for as long as you can maintain concentration. Disappointingly, if you twincast this spell you need to choose the same mode for both targets, so no putting Eagle&#8217;s Splendor on yourself and Cat&#8217;s Grace on your Scout forever.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Enlarge\/Reduce<\/span>: Reduce is of mediocre\n\t\tutility as it targets Con saves, requires concentration, and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tactually do anything by itself except minorly reduce incoming damage.\n\t\tEnlarge is incredible though, as it gives Fighters a way to have advantage\n\t\ton shoves to yeet people off cliffs, adds extra damage for all of the many\n\t\tattacks they make, and allows them to throw larger creatures. It&#8217;s also a\n\t\tcore component of\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UET0KFCrkXk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Owlbear from the Top Rope<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flaming Sphere<\/span>: It&#8217;s a summon, meaning\n\t\tthat it acts on its own initiative rather than consuming your bonus action\n\t\tto move, it deals persistent damage, it&#8217;s immune to damage, and it blocks\n\t\tmovement. If you can find a chokepoint to drop this in and fling spells\n\t\tover, you&#8217;ll have a great time. It does take Concentration, though, and does\n\t\tthe second-most-resisted damage type (and not a ton of it at that), so Cloud\n\t\tof Daggers is still going to be a better bet if you just want damage and\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need it to move.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gust of Wind<\/span>: Many enemies are going to\n\t\tbe able to pass a Strength save (it&#8217;s the second best behind Con), but if\n\t\tused strategically near cliffs this can just kill things outright on a fail\n\t\tat the cost of a 2nd-level spell slot. It can also clear things like\n\t\tCloudkill, but those effects are rare in combat, and when you encounter\n\t\tclouds of stuff outside of combat they typically reappear almost\n\t\timmediately, requiring you to clear them by throwing detritus (I often use\n\t\tskulls) on top of a vent.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hold Person<\/span>: Humanoid enemies are abundant\n\t\tin Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3, making Hold Person a spectacularly powerful save-or-suck\n\t\tspell. Paralyze something, then have your party pile in on it until it&#8217;s\n\t\tdead. Upcasting this spell to add more targets keeps it powerful for a very\n\t\tlong time. However, since enemies get to repeat their saves, you need to\n\t\twork quickly.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Invisibility<\/span>: Invisibility requires\n\t\tconcentration, which means you should really only be using it out of combat,\n\t\tand it only lasts 10 turns instead of the pen and paper version&#8217;s hour, so\n\t\tit&#8217;s not useful for long-term scouting. This renders the number of things\n\t\tyou can usefully do with it very minimal, especially since they explicitly\n\t\tbroke one of the most important things. Interacting with items breaks\n\t\tinvisibility, thus removing the remaining primary purpose of theft. It&#8217;s\n\t\talso readily available on scrolls and potions. Learn it off a scroll just in\n\t\tcase, but don&#8217;t expect to use it much.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knock<\/span>: It&#8217;s stupidly easy to get past locks\n\t\tin this game, and locks are too frequent to waste a spell slot on them.\n\t\tThrow Enhance Ability (Dexterity) on whoever in your party is good at\n\t\tSleight of Hand and make it their problem.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Magic Weapon<\/span>: This game hands out magic\n\t\tweapons like candy, but if you&#8217;re in the very early game and run into\n\t\tsomething with resistance before you find one, this can help your martial.\n\t\tOf course, at that point you&#8217;re only attacking once with the weapon per turn\n\t\tunless you&#8217;re a frenzied berserker, so all this is doing is adding up to\n\t\t1d6+3 damage per turn at the cost of your concentration, which is worse than\n\t\tFlaming Sphere&#8217;s DPR. Make a Cleric prepare this if you&#8217;re in that situation and save your spell known for something better.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Melf&#8217;s Acid Arrow<\/span>: Even if some things\n\t\tare resistant to most other damage, just upcast Chromatic Orb.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mirror Image<\/span>: The change to the spell&#8217;s\n\t\teffect means that you&#8217;re much less likely to use the last image unless you\n\t\thave a bunch of AC from other sources, and if you have a bunch of AC from\n\t\tother sources this isn&#8217;t worth the action to cast.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Misty Step<\/span>: Everything that has access to\n\t\tMisty Step should take Misty Step. Bonus Action teleportation is the best\n\t\tmovement in the game. Misty Step allows you to teleport beyond the limited\n\t\ttargeting range imposed by being blinded, so it&#8217;s a great way to get out of\n\t\tDarkness spells and similar effects, or if you&#8217;re hit by Blindness.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantasmal Force<\/span>: Even if you manage to\n\t\tget this turned to a damage type the enemy is vulnerable to, 2d6 damage per\n\t\tturn is not worth concentration.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">See Invisibility<\/span>: A great counter to\n\t\tinvisible enemies, but you can keep elixirs around or spam Faerie Fire until\n\t\tthe target fails a save. You can also usually cheese figuring out where\n\t\tinvisible enemies are because they make sound while moving and many won&#8217;t\n\t\tmove at all after turning invisible, allowing you to hit them with AoEs or\n\t\teven ranged attacks if you have a good eye for lines of sight. This only\n\t\taffects the caster, so unfortunately you can&#8217;t get it from\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scorching Ray<\/span>: The king of single-target\n\t\tdamage until level 11, 6d6 damage with chances for rays to hit multiple\n\t\ttimes meaning partial damage will happen even if one ray misses and gives\n\t\tyou extra opportunities for crits. Can be combined with the Assassin\n\t\tsubclass to begin dangerously approaching being the\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/bugbear-y-me-in-damage\/#example-build-1-ambush-caster\">Ambush Caster<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shatter<\/span>: Low-budget fireball. The damage\n\t\tand AOE are decent, but Constitution saves tend to be high, so enemies will\n\t\toften pass the save. Just use Cloud of Daggers instead unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tconcentrating on something very important.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Web<\/span>: The direct upgrade (generally) from\n\t\tGrease. It won&#8217;t break concentration, but other than that it&#8217;s a more\n\t\tpowerful area denial effect. It also has the (perhaps unintended) effect of\n\t\tnegating any fall damage when jumped into, allowing you to mimic the effects\n\t\tof Feather Fall without having to learn another spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3rd-level\">3rd-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3rd-level spells are a major power jump for full spellcasters, bringing\n\theavy-hitting spells like Fireball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blink<\/span>: Blink&#8217;s main problem is that\n\t\tspending an action doing anything other than ending the fight is usually the\n\t\twrong course of action. If you&#8217;re worried about being attacked, you have\n\t\tShield.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Counterspell<\/span>: There aren&#8217;t a ton of\n\t\tcaster enemies in the game, meaning that spending a spell known on this is hardly ever worth it.<\/li>\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Daylight<\/span>: Surprisingly useful in the right context. It will overpower Darkness if you cast it afterwards, potentially fixing problems from enemy spellcasters. It protects you from the Shadow Curse. Best of all, it counts as actual Sunlight and so will harm vampires (except your companion) every turn. Because this lasts until your next Long Rest\n\t\tbut doesn&#8217;t require Concentration, it&#8217;s a candidate for\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/camp-casting\/\">Camp Casting<\/a>. <\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fear<\/span>: Make enemies Frightened in a cone\n\t\tand force them to drop their weapons. Most humanoid enemies rely on a\n\t\tweapon, and grabbing them off the ground while they&#8217;re still frightened\n\t\tmakes them nearly harmless. Only lasts two rounds, though, and requires\n\t\tclose range.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fireball<\/span>: Even with a nerfed radius for\n\t\tthe videogame, it&#8217;s still the undisputed king of AoE damage.\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/GducoU8ivyo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Just Fireball<\/a>.\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gmAub3iRWaU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Just Fireball<\/a>.\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2MgAhJvmc3s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Just Fireball<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fly<\/span>: This spell single-handedly fixes\n\t\tnearly every movement problem. While dashing doesn&#8217;t allow you to fly one\n\t\tuninterrupted distance in combat (which would be nice), it will get you\n\t\tplaces your strength won&#8217;t let you jump, it&#8217;ll get you around some walls and\n\t\tup others (I flew over the gate to get to the Shar idol and flew my entire\n\t\tparty up the walls of Moonrise Castle to avoid walking in through the prison\n\t\tor the front door). It doesn&#8217;t also get you defense through hovering like\n\t\tthe tabletop version, but it&#8217;s still plenty incredible.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gaseous Form<\/span>: I wouldn&#8217;t use this in\n\t\tcombat, but it&#8217;s another way to explore burrow holes. Harder sell on a sorcerer, but if that&#8217;s your only way to do so, it&#8217;s worth having.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Haste<\/span>: Welcome back 3.0 Haste. I\n\t\tcertainly never expected to see you again. This just gets your target an\n\t\textra action every turn (including yourself on the turn you cast it if you\n\t\tself-cast) which can be used to do anything an action can do, including cast\n\t\tspells. Two spells per turn is so good they completely removed it from the\n\t\tOneD&amp;D playtest by saying Action Surge can do anything but cast spells,\n\t\tso letting it happen here is well worth the cost. The only issue is that, if\n\t\tyour concentration is broken early, you lose a turn. Twincasting Haste on yourself and your martial DPS is one of the single most satisfying things in the entire game.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hypnotic Pattern<\/span>: It&#8217;s so exceedingly good\n\t\tthat they had to nerf the duration to a paltry two rounds. Even so, it&#8217;s\n\t\tstill one of the better openers for a fight as it covers a large area and\n\t\tmagic items can stack your save DC very high, essentially shutting down a\n\t\tlarge fraction of an encounter while you deal with the rest of it.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Bolt<\/span>: The required competitor\n\t\tto Fireball. If you have too many melee party members to routinely aim a\n\t\tFireball, having a nice safe line might be your preference. Also, it\n\t\tinteracts with Wet, which is nice, but it&#8217;s still a hard sell in\n\t\tcomparison.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Protection from Energy<\/span>: A fantastic\n\t\tdefensive buff to throw on your party&#8217;s Defender, but, since this only\n\t\taffects one target (unless you twincast it) and requires Concentration, it&#8217;s often hard to justify\n\t\tover other options. If you can, get resistance from consumables or magic\n\t\titems.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sleet Storm<\/span>: Truly terrible.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Slow<\/span>: It&#8217;s a fantastic debuff. This can\n\t\toften win fights by itself if you get it to land.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stinking Cloud<\/span>: Like Slow but targeting\n\t\ta worse save and stuck in one place. Can be useful area denial, but you can\n\t\tjust use Grease for that.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4th-level\">4th-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Banishment<\/span>: Things will hardly ever pass Charisma saves and this will just get them gone for two turns. On the other hand, Hypnotic Pattern does the same thing but to a whole area, so it&#8217;s hard to justify this over that.<\/li>\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blight<\/span>: If you&#8217;re worried about things resisting your fire damage, this is a viable alternative to fireball. Empowered will be useful for overcoming the higher save bonus they&#8217;re likely to have in Con.\n<p>If you acquire the <a href=\"https:\/\/bg3.wiki\/wiki\/Staff_of_Cherished_Necromancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Staff of Cherished Necromancy<\/a>, this spell and Circle of Death suddenly get very good.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Confusion<\/span>: It&#8217;s no better than it is in the\n\t\ttabletop version. Optimization usually relies on consistency, and something\n\t\tinherently inconsistent is a hard sell when you could spend that\n\t\tconcentration on Hypnotic Pattern instead.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dimension Door<\/span>: Line of sight teleportation\n\t\tfor you and one ally, though it does have a maximum distance. A good way to\n\t\tget into or out of places that are hard to reach by other methods like\n\t\tjumping or flying, or by shorter-range teleportation like Misty Step, and it\n\t\tcan also get you out of bad places in a flight.<\/li>\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dominate Beast<\/span>: By the time you can take this, you&#8217;re long past the majority of beasts in the game. Even if you weren&#8217;t, concentration for just getting to hold onto said beast for a minute is not worth a 4th-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Greater Invisibility<\/span>: Once you&#8217;re done\n\t\tconcentrating on your opening Hypnotic Pattern, this can be a great way to\n\t\tgive someone permanent advantage on attacks for a fight. It&#8217;s melee range,\n\t\tthough, so your primary targets will usually be people in a backline who\n\t\tlike attacking; make sure you have a ranged dps around to get the best value\n\t\tfrom this.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ice Storm<\/span>: Worse damage than upcasting\n\t\tfireball unless your targets are Wet or otherwise vulnerable to Cold\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Polymorph<\/span>: Not at all what tabletop players\n\t\tare familiar with, Polymorph turns the target into a sheep for 5 turns. The\n\t\tsheep is harmless, and your party&#8217;s stronger characters can do things like\n\t\tShove or throw it great distances, allowing you to toss the target into a\n\t\tpit. But for the same Wisdom save, other spells like Hold Person or Crown of\n\t\tMadness may be just as effective at taking a target out of a fight without\n\t\tcosting such a high-level spell slot.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stoneskin<\/span>: By the time you get access to this\n\t\tspell, most things that deal a relevant amount of damage will be dealing\n\t\tmagical damage.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wall of Fire<\/span>: An incredible area control and\n\t\tdamage spell. It lasts a long time, does a decent chunk of damage per turn,\n\t\tand you can shove or throw people back into it if they escape.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5th-level\">5th-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cloudkill<\/span>: Like a moveable wall of fire if the\n\t\tdamage type was worse and the spell targeted a worse save. Not worth the\n\t\tConcentration 99% of the time.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cone of Cold<\/span>: Worse damage than upcasting\n\t\tfireball unless your target is Wet or otherwise vulnerable to Cold\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dominate Person<\/span>: In a game where the majority\n\t\tof enemies are humanoids, Dominate person is very powerful. You don&#8217;t get to\n\t\tcontrol the target&#8217;s turns, but it still becomes fully allied to you for the\n\t\tduration.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Hold Monster<\/span>: An upgrade to Hold Person, this\n\t\tcan take any creature out of a fight and let your party get automatic\n\t\tcritical hits while they rush to bring your target down before they get\n\t\tanother save.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Planar Binding<\/span>: Basically Dominate Person for\n\t\tCelestials, Elementals, Fey, and Fiends. Fiends are a decent percentage of higher-level enemies, making this a tempting choice.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Seeming<\/span>: Basically Disguise Self, but for your\n\t\twhole party. If you&#8217;re getting a lot of use out of Disguise Self, this lets\n\t\tyou drag your party of non-casters along with you. Not nearly as good for\n\t\tcomboing with other things since it takes a much higher spell slot and you&#8217;d\n\t\thave to do other things to the rest of your party individually.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telekinesis<\/span>: I kept wanting this to be good\n\t\tand it kept not being. Throwing heavy things into people feels like it\n\t\tshould do more damage than it does.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wall of Stone<\/span>: Good for sectioning off a fight\n\t\tif you can find a narrow place where this will block something. Doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tbecome permanent, though, to prevent things like breaking pathing\n\t\tforever.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6th-level\">6th-Level Sorcerer Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>With a level cap of 12, 6th-level spells are the highest that we see in\n\tBaldur&#8217;s Gate 3, making them the most powerful spells that you can get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Arcane Gate<\/span>: This is not even remotely worth the resources.<\/li>\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Chain Lightning<\/span>: If you&#8217;re tailored to lightning damage, this is your biggest stick for AoE. It&#8217;s still not strictly better than upcast fireball, but it does interact with Wet and won&#8217;t endanger your allies.<\/li>\n\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Circle of Death<\/span>: Targets the worst save, does\n\t\tthe same base amount of damage as 3rd-level Fireball, must be centered on a\n\t\tcreature rather than picking a space as the center. Just upcast Fireball if you can&#8217;t find something better to do with this spell slot.\n<p>If you acquire the <a href=\"https:\/\/bg3.wiki\/wiki\/Staff_of_Cherished_Necromancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Staff of Cherished Necromancy<\/a>, this spell and Blight suddenly get very good.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disintegrate<\/span>: The last word in single-target\n\t\tspell damage. Try to make your target prone or restrained first to make it\n\t\tharder for them to pass the Dex save. I dropped three of these on the final\n\t\tboss (two were scrolls) and it made things much, much easier.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eyebite<\/span>: Exceptionally powerful, especially for adding versatility to a Sorcerer. Turn it on\n\t\tand get a free save-or-suck every turn for a full minute. Extend it if you think you&#8217;re going to be in a long fight and don&#8217;t want to concentrate on anything else.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panicked<\/span>: The target drops their weapons, has Disadvantage on attacks\n\t\t\t\tand checks, flees, and can&#8217;t take Actions. This will provoke Opportunity\n\t\t\t\tAttacks from your allies, plus you can grab your target&#8217;s weapon(s) off\n\t\t\t\tthe ground. The target does get to make additional saves to end the\n\t\t\t\teffect, but if they come back you can hit them with this again.<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sickened<\/span>: A gamble with a good payoff. Constitution saves tend to be\n\t\t\t\thigh, but if this works your target is debuffed for a full minute.<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Asleep<\/span>: Asleep for 10 rounds means that the target is done fighting\n\t\t\t\tuntil you decide to wake them up, usually with a big critical hit or by\n\t\t\t\tShoving them off a cliff. If your target still isn&#8217;t dead, hit them with\n\t\t\t\tthis again and put them back to sleep.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Globe of Invulnerability<\/span>: This is an\n\t\tincredible spell. It&#8217;s nothing like the tabletop version, instead granting\n\t\tdamage immunity to anything standing in it. The AI isn&#8217;t smart enough to\n\t\tunderstand this, and will happily continue targeting you with attacks even\n\t\tthough you&#8217;ll suffer no ill effect. Easily cheese several fights including\n\t\tboss mechanics with this.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sunbeam<\/span>: If you need to consistently Blind\n\t\ttargets while dealing decent damage, this is your go-to. It also does a\n\t\tdamage type that basically nothing resists, although there are a few places\n\t\twhere dealing large Radiant damage hits might kill you, so be aware of\n\t\tthat.<\/li>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Where Wizards traditionally bring daily versatility to the arcane world with their ability to prepare new spells in the morning, Sorcerers traditionally instead bring a fun list of modifications that are applicable in the moment to their hammer, attempting to create a Swiss Army knife in real time.
