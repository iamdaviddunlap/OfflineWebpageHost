The Scout&#8217;s abilities fall somewhere between the Rogue and Ranger, making the Scout an excellent Scout and Striker. When considering the Scout, ask yourself: Would a rogue be better for what I&#8217;m trying to do? In many cases, the answer is yes. Skirmish is fantastic because it&#8217;s easy to use. If you&#8217;re playing a game where everyone is single-class and no one min-maxes (does anyone do that in 3.5 anymore?), the Scout is great because it&#8217;s so much easier to play effectively than the Rogue. If you&#8217;re playing a game with people who read these sorts of guides, Rogue will often be better. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Scouts spend all of their time trying to move 20 feet then make a full attack, while Rogues spend all of their time trying to make things flatfooted (typically with invisibility) before making a full attack. There&#8217;s a lot of overlap in those two tactics, and if you&#8217;re going to go to all that work you probably want the considerably better damage output that the Rogue provides since Sneak Attack scales much faster than Skirmish. This guide is written with the &#8220;Volley&#8221; rule in mind.

Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata.

You get concealement against\n\t\tattacks of opportunity while making this movement, which makes this\n\t\tparticularly nice for melee Scouts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Quiver of Energy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Extremely expensive, but at high levels this can be cheaper than adding\n\t\tan energy type to your bow. On top of a +1 Splitting bow, this is 1000gp\n\t\tcheaper than adding a +1 enhancement.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Skirmisher Boots<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: +2 Skirmish damage, and two extra skirmish attacks per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transporter Cloak<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Transposition 1\/day as a Swift Action. Effective, but too expensive for a\n\t\tsingle use per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Barbarian<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: One level of Barbarian can get you Pounce with an ACF, making the\n\t\tBarbarian an essential dip for many melee Scouts.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ranger<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: With Swift Hunter the Ranger is a fantastic choice. The Ranger&#8217;s combat\n\t\tstyle bonus feats work great for both melee and ranged Scout builds, and\n\t\tRanger spells are startlingly good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swordsage<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">ToB<\/a><\/sup>: One level gets you access to some stances and maneuvers that can go a\n\t\tlong way for the Scout. Child of Shadow stance grants you a near-perpetual\n\t\t20% miss chance since you&#8217;re going to be moving around for skirmish anyway.\n\t\tSeveral swift action boosts can be very helpful for you, too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 3.5
