Spell selection is limited, but it\u2019s limited to two schools that neatly tie into what a Fighter is trying to do. With the option to pick up one spell per level outside the restrictions, and given that the class features don\u2019t really cater to any one particular playstyle, you end up with a subclass that brings a surprising amount of utility to the Fighter while also increasing damage by a respectable amount.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few things that go into optimizing an Eldritch Knight. Spell selection is critical, especially if you\u2019re planning on using offensive magic beyond melee cantrips. Eldritch Strike is an excellent feature, but it doesn\u2019t come online until level 7. Before then, you\u2019ll struggle with trying to make save-or-suck staples stick on targets, so the best way to think of this subclass is as a way to shore up the capacities of a Fighter with magical capacities no other subclass has access to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2645\">Fighter Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

You&#8217;re limited almost entirely to Abjuration and\n\t\tEvocation spells, but those offer plenty of options which work for a\n\t\tFighter. Be sure to pick up an offensive cantrip like Booming Blade which\n\t\tyou can use alongside weapon attacks with War Magic.\n\t\t<p>You&#8217;ll get just one spell of each spell level which isn&#8217;t restricted to\n\t\t\tAbjuration\/Evocation, so be <em>very<\/em> careful when picking those\n\t\t\tspells.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>For help selecting spells, see our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/spells\">Fighter Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Bond<\/span>: Very cool, but it rarely\n\t\thas any mechanical impact unless you plan to throw your weapon(s)\n or want to appear unarmed somewhere. Casting spells like light or darkness on your bonded weapon\nbefore throwing it means that you can place the spell effect at greater range and recall the weapon\nin order to throw it again. But this combo is both more work and less effective than most methods\nfor abusing magical darkness.\n<p>You can accomplish some odd shenanigans like bonding to oversized weapons or even siege weapons\nin order to freely teleport a massive object to yourself, but be cautious about how much your DM\nwill tolerate before they have your bonded trebuchet appear over your head.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">War Magic<\/span>: With the addition of new\n\t\tcantrips in Sword Coast Adventurer&#8217;s Guide, War Magic is better than ever.\n\t\tUsing either Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade in conjunction with the\n\t\tBonus Action attack from War Magic deals more total damage than a fighter making\n\t\tnormal attacks at any level (provided that you can trigger the secondary\n\t\tdamage from either cantrip) and offers tactical options that you simply\n\t\tcan&#8217;t replicate by just swinging a weapon. See our article on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Eldritch Strike<\/span>: Since your Intelligence\n\t\twon&#8217;t be as high as that of a real Wizards, DCs can be a real problem.\n\t\tImposing disadvantage will make your spells considerably more effective.\n\t\tThis can enable some interesting combinations like hitting a bunch of\n\t\tadjacent enemies, then hitting them with Sword Burst on your next turn, or\n\t\tshooting a bunch of enemies with a bow then hitting them with a fireball on\n\t\tthe next turn. If you&#8217;re facing single targets you can hit them every round\n\t\twith a Toll the Dead and a weapon attack thanks to War Magic. Look for\n\t\topportunities to put this to use, but remember that War Magic is still your\n\t\tdefining tactic.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Charge<\/span>: This is as much movement\n\t\tas using the Dash action, so, combined with Action Surge, you get to do almost\n\t\tas much as you could in a complete additional turn (you still don&#8217;t get a\n\t\tsecond Bonus Action).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved War Magic<\/span>: Drop a huge spell,\n\t\tthen stab\/shoot someone.

If you push something out of your safety donut, it can break the Booming Blade and then just walk around you so it won\u2019t trigger an opportunity attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eldritch-knight-weapons\">Eldritch Knight Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because Booming Blade will be a go-to combat option for us, using reach weapons isn\u2019t a viable tactic.

For more on multiclassing, see our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever play a straight-class Eldritch Knight. I\u2019d take it to 10 for Eldritch Strike and then take Wizard to 10 with the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/war-magic\/\">War Magic<\/a> subclass, having your capstone be Durable Magic. Is that an overall optimized character? No. But it feels pretty good while maintaining the Eldritch Knight flavor and it\u2019s probably more effective than the last 10 levels of Eldritch Knight. If you want more fighter levels, levels 11 (Extra Extra Attack), 12 (ASI), 17 (Action Surge x2), and 18 (Improved War Magic) are great points to stop and multiclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019d prefer to be Dex-based, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/bladesinging\/\">Bladesinger<\/a> also works well. With a single weapon you can get the same DPR as dual-wielding because you can use the Bladesinger\u2019s version of Extra Attack and combine that with War Magic (the feature, not the subclass) to get two attacks and a cantrip per turn a hand free to hold a shield. It requires Dex-based fighters because Bladesong only works in light armor with no shield. I\u2019d probably do this as EK 7\/Bladesinger X.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If neither Wizard version is your speed, picking up 3 levels of Artificer for either <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/subclasses\/battle-smith\/\">Battle Smith<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/armorer\/\">Armorer<\/a> will let you not care about Strength by using Intelligence to attack instead, meaning your spells are also much more likely to succeed. Doing either of those is just going to make you feel like an Artificer more than an Eldritch Knight though, so that\u2019s very much another case of optimization vs. character identity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-a-good-scottish-name\">Example Build &#8211; A good Scottish name<\/h2>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Hey, it&#8217;s a kind of magic!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">-Connor MacLeod<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a broadsword and thunder damage is going to result in some pretty great DPR using the combination mentioned above.

You only lose 3 DPR if the target doesn\u2019t move, and you gain quite a bit if it does. By this level you should have full plate, so you can even Booming Blade something and then just walk away and force it to take the extra damage if it wants to follow you in order to retaliate.<br><br>Darkness is the only spell within the school limitations which I can think of that would do any good. You can\u2019t see through it, but your theoretical warlock friend probably can, and Sword Burst doesn\u2019t require you to see.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>New Spell:<br>&#8211; See Invisibility<br><br>Ability Score Increase: Str 18 -&gt;20<\/td><td>Not much to say about either of these, but they\u2019re both great to have.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Indomitable<\/td><td>You get to pretend to be a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/legendary-creatures\/\">Legendary Creature.<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Eldritch Strike<br><br>New Cantrip:<br>&#8211; Toll the Dead<br><br>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Rime\u2019s Binding Ice<\/td><td>This is already pretty good for throwing a javelin at something and then next turn asking it for a Wisdom save with disadvantage to avoid taking d12\u2019s of damage. It gets even better at next level when you can further push the multi-target math described in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\/\">melee vs. cantrip article<\/a>. At level 11 you can attack three targets with one action, then sword burst the next turn and have everyone you hit making saves with disadvantage.<br><br>While Binding Ice targets the worst save, its damage matches Shatter and it wastes an action per target that fails the save. If you can combine it with Eldritch Strike to impose Disadvantage, you may be able to make it work somewhat reliably.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Extra Extra Attack<br><br>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Warding Wind<\/td><td>Warding Wind\u2019s primary feature will be creating difficult terrain.

Perhaps try a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/hexblade\/\">Hexblade<\/a> or a College of Valor Bard to bring some Face capabilities to the group.

With the option to pick up one spell per level outside the restrictions, and given that the class features don\u2019t really cater to any one particular playstyle, you end up with a subclass that brings a surprising amount of utility to the Fighter while also increasing damage by a respectable amount.
