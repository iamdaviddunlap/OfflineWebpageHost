Heavily customizable and capable of supporting a huge number of builds and play styles, the Fighter is a lot of fun while still being gentle on complexity. While the iconic fighter is a heavily-armored front-line Defender, the class support a hugely diverse set of builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Your specific build choices will heavily define how your fighter functions. Two-handed weapons emphasize damage output over durability. Two-weapon fighting emphasizes multiple small attacks, and can move between targets more easily to quickly cut down small foes. Ranged weapons can do a lot of damage at range, but move the Fighter&#8217;s high AC and large hit points out of melee, meaning that your party needs another front-line character to fill the role of Defender (which is fine, but needs to be planned for).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Fighters can generally function for extended periods without a rest, provided that they can keep their hit points high. The Fighter&#8217;s only features which require rest are Second Wind (easily replaced with potions), Action Surge, and Indomitable. The core of the class continues to function at great length, often making them an excellent choice in parties which like to go long periods between rests. The Battle Master subclass&#8217;s Superiority Dice recharge on a Short Rest, making them a better fit alongside other classes dependent on short rests, such as warlocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Fighter Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Fighter Subclasses<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#battle-master\">Battle Master<\/a>\n\n\n<li><a href=\"#champion\">Champion<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rating-green\">Eldritch Knight<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Fighter Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#strengthbased\">Strength-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dexteritybased\">Dexterity-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Fighter Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dwarf\">Dwarf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dragonborn\">Dragonborn<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#drow\">Drow<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#elf\">Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gnome\">Gnome<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#githyanki\">Githyanki<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfelf\">Half-Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halforc\">Half-Orc<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfling\">Halfling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#human\">Human<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tiefling\">Tiefling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Fighter Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Fighter Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Fighter Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Fighter Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Fighter Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Fighter Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Fighter Example Build &#8211; Lae&#8217;zel, Githyanki Champion<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skill-proficiencies\">Skill Proficiencies<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses a color coding scheme to rate individual character options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Since it doesn&#8217;t require specific weapons or tactics, this\n\t\tis a great choice if you want the ability to change weapons.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dueling<\/span>: With the abundance of\n\t\tmagic items available, the damage boost isn&#8217;t especially impressive beyond\n\t\tlow levels. This is the go-to option for sword-and-board builds, but you may\n\t\tforget that it&#8217;s there when measured against other sources of additional\n\t\tdamage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Great Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Mathematically\n\t\tawful. This adds roughly 1 damage to each attack at best.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection<\/span>: Helpful for protecting less\n\t\tdurable allies, but the positioning requirements present a huge challenge in\n\t\ta game where mobility and positioning are so valuable.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: Two-weapon fighting\n\t\tin Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 is more impactful than in the tabletop 5e rules if only\n\t\tbecause you attack with both weapons when you make an opportunity attack.\n\t\tThat said, two-weapon fighting still starts to lose impact when you get\n\t\tExtra Attack and when you add things like Potions of Speed and Action Surge,\n\t\tnone of which will let you repeat your off-hand attack, so the damage boost\n\t\tfrom this Fighting Style becomes less impactful as you gain levels. If you\n\t\tplan to use two weapons, consider Defence instead.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Action Surge<\/span>: Powerful to the point that\n\ttaking a 2-level dip into Fighter just for Action Surge is among the most\n\tpopular multiclass options. Note that this extra Action stacks with the extra\n\tActions granted by effects like the Haste spell. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t\n\tgive you an additional Bonus Action so you can&#8217;t repeat an off-hand weapon\n\tattack.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Two attacks per action is\n\thuge, often doubling your damage output. If you use Action Surge, you can\n\tattack four times in a single turn.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Feat<\/span>: Every class gets feats, but the\n\tFighter gets an extra at level 6.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Indomitable<\/span>: Once per long rest isn&#8217;t\n\tespecially impactful, and you&#8217;ll frequently be prompted to reroll saves which\n\tyou have almost no chance to pass. Be sure to set this to not trigger\n\tautomatically (Press K on your keyboard to open the Reactions menu, then check\n\t&#8220;Ask&#8221; to be prompted), and check the DC on the save before you decide to\n\treroll.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Extra Attack<\/span>: Another huge boost\n\tto your damage output.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Fighter Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"battle-master\">Battle Master<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Battle Master&#8217;s maneuvers offer a unique tactical option which allows you\n\tto control the battlefield, buff your allies, and debuff your enemies in ways\n\tthat other fighters can&#8217;t match. These options can be very powerful, but\n\tyou&#8217;re limited to a small number of maneuvers known and you have a limited\n\tresource pool (Superiority Dice) to draw from between rests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because resting is so easy in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3, I strong recommend taking a\n\tShort Rest after each fight (Long Rest if you must). This allows you to freely\n\tspend your Superiority Dice and really enjoy the subclass without worrying\n\tabout another fight right around the corner. Parties with bards for Song of\n\tRest and with other Short Rest-dependent characters like monks and warlocks\n\twill be happy with this arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Martial Initiate feat gets you an additional die and two additional\n\tmaneuvers. This doesn&#8217;t feel especially impressive, but it&#8217;s a a 25% increase\n\tto your number of Superirity Dice and a 50% increase to your number of\n\tmaneuvers (those percentages get smaller as you level, but it doesn&#8217;t change\n\tmy point).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Superiority Dice<\/span>: Start with 4, up to 5 at\n\tlevel 7. You can get one more from the Martial Initiate feat. These recharge\n\ton a Short Rest, so they&#8217;re easy to get back, but they do present a resource\n\tconstraint which can be frustrating.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Manoeuvers<\/span>: The heart of the subclass. You\n\tget just 4 manoeuvers known at level 3, but advance to a total of 8 by level\n\t10 plus poentially two more with Martial Initiatie.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manoeuvers can be used per attack during the Attack action, meaning that once\n\tyou get Extra Attack you can use two manoeuvers per turn. Unfortunately, you\n\tcan&#8217;t use manoeuvers with the Bonus Action attack for two-weapon fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See below for advice on selecting manoeuvers.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-master-manoeuvers\">Battle Master Manoeuvers<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Commander&#8217;s Strike<\/span>: Far too costly.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disarming Attack<\/span>: Most enemies are\n\t\tweapon-using humanoids, and disarming them then stealing their weapon\n\t\ttrivializes many enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Distracting Strike<\/span>: Helpful if your\n\t\tallies can follow this with a single high-damage attack, such as the Rogue&#8217;s\n\t\tSneak Attack or a damaging attack spell like Chromatic Orb which puts all of\n\t\tthe damage behind a single attack.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Evasive Footwork<\/span>: Helpful when you&#8217;re\n\t\tbeing swarmed by numerous enemies or when your hit points are running\n\t\tlow.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Feinting Attack<\/span>: Beyond low levels you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t justify the action econom here.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Goading Attack<\/span>: A good way to protect\n\t\tyour allies from major enemies, especially if that enemy is repeatedly\n\t\tmoving away from you to attack, which is surprisingly common.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Manoeuvring Attack<\/span>: Shove the enemy\n\t\taway.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Menacing Attack<\/span>: Good, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing to debuff an enemy with a manoeuvre, Trip Attack is better. Menacing\n\t\tAttack&#8217;s advantage is that it targets a Wisdom save, which is often low for\n\t\tmelee-focused enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Precision Attack<\/span>: With the abundance of\n\t\toptions to improve your attack rolls via various buffs and magic items,\n\t\tthere&#8217;s little reason to spend Superiority Dice on this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pushing Attack<\/span>: Just use Shove.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rally<\/span>: Nice, but the temporary hit points\n\t\texpire after a minute. Beyond low levels, this won&#8217;t be impactful unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re willing to repeatedly burn resources to use it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Riposte<\/span>: Potentially a huge boost to your\n\t\tdamage output, but it can also eat through your Superiority Dice without you\n\t\tnoticing. I recommend setting this to &#8220;Ask&#8221; in the Reactions menu.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sweeping Attack<\/span>: Great for clearing\n\t\tgroups of weak enemies, but the damage isn&#8217;t huge so it&#8217;s not worth the cost\n\t\tunless you can hit three enemies.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trip Attack<\/span>: Standing from Prone consumes\n\t\ta creature&#8217;s Action, robbing them of most of their turn. I have repeatedly\n\t\ttrivialized boss fights by repeatedly hitting the boss with Trip Attack.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"champion\">Champion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Not very exciting, but very low stress. A great option for players intimidated by managing a full party unassisted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Critical Hit<\/span>: Very exciting, but mathematically it&#8217;s not a huge boost to your damage output. This gives you a 10% chance to crit per attack, or roughly 19% with Advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Remarkable Athlete<\/span>: More jump distance is the most obvious benefit here. Adding half of your Proficiency Bonus to Str\/Dex\/Con checks includes rolling for initiative and Stealth checks, but generally the effect here is minor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10: <span class=\"rating-green\">Additional Fighting Style<\/span>: Nice, but generally a second Fighting Style won&#8217;t impact your tactics in an meaningful way. Expect to take Defense.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rating-green\">Eldritch Knight<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>All the martial power of the Fighter with a splash of wizard spellcasting. Eldritch Knights get access to some great buffs which can make them very effective. They&#8217;re also the only version of the Fighter that particularly cares about long rests, so they&#8217;re a good fit in parties with full casters like clerics and wizards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 includes numerous items that provide buffs which apply while you&#8217;re concentrating on a spell. These items often work well for the Eldritch Knight since they depend heavily on concentration buffs. You also want to look for items which provide Arcane Synergy for a damage boost and Arcane Attunement to boost your spell attacks and save DCs so that they can keep pace with your weapon attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite those items and buffs, the Eldritch Knight does suffer some setbacks compared to the tabletop rules. With a much narrower set of available spells, powerful options like Booming Blade don&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Bond<\/span>: Allowing your weapon to return to your hand when thrown is very useful for Strength-based builds because you can throw your +X sword of dude stabbing rather than throwing pots or javelins or whatever else, allowing melee-focused builds to perform effectively even while they&#8217;re stuck fighting at range. Throw in Tavern Brawler and you&#8217;re going to do really well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcasting<\/span>: Much slower spellcasting than a full caster like the Wizard or a half-caster like the Paladin. Most of your spells known are restricted to abjuration and evocation spells, further limiting your options. Strongly consider a level of wizard to open up the rest of the Wizard&#8217;s spell list via scrolls. Unfortunately, you never get above 2nd-level spell slots due to Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3&#8217;s level cap, so your options are strictly limited even with the wizard dip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7: <span class=\"rating-green\">War Magic<\/span>: The Eldritch Knight&#8217;s signature combat tactic. Depending on your choice of weaponry, a cantrip may deal more damage than a weapon attack, and until your hit level 11 you&#8217;re only giving up one weapon attack to use this. There are also many magic items which give you Arcane Acuity or Arcane Synergy for alternating between weapon attacks and cantrips, allowing you buff both your weapon damage and your spell attacks\/DCs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Strike<\/span>: Since you don&#8217;t have a spellcasting DC as high as a wizard, this is a major buff to your spells. Combined with Arcane Acuity you can quickly make your spells difficult to resist, then hit enemies with a low-level save-or-suck spell like Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Fighter Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Fighters can be built around either Strength or Dexterity.

Githyanki Psionics is a great set of innate spells for a martial character. Martial Prodigy is redundant.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"halfelf\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/races\/half-elf\/\">Half-Elf<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Darkvision (which is replaceable with a spell), Fey Ancestry, and a subrace. Civil Militia is redundant. Overall it&#8217;s fine, but Elf is outright better because you get a skill instead of Civil Militia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">High Half-Elf<\/span>: A nice way to get an early taste of Eldritch Knight, but otherwise not fantastic. Blade Ward and Mage Hand are your best choices.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wood Half-Elf<\/span>: Additional speed and yet another skill proficiency. A great choice on a Dexterity-based build looking to fill in for a rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Drow Half-Elf<\/span>: Decent innate spellcasting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"halforc\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/races\/half-orc\/\">Half-Orc<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A half-orc champion fighter is a simple, straightforward build. Proficiency\n\tin Intimidation gives you a useful option in social situations, though\n\tfighters typically dump Charisma so it won&#8217;t always work.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"halfling\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/races\/halfling\/\">Halfling<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 makes a natural 1 a critical failure, meaning that you automatically fail whatever attack\/check\/save. This makes Halfling Luck extremely useful, especialy since fighters make so many attacks and therefore suffer natural 1&#8217;s more frequently than other characters. Brave is also nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightfoot<\/span>: Advantage on Stealth is great on a Dexterity-based build.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Strongheart<\/span>: Poison Resistance is available as a 2nd-level spell which lasts until your next long rest, so getting it from your race is pointless beyond low levels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"human\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/races\/human\/\">Human<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Since fighters already get proficiency in all weapons, all armor, and\n\tshields, the Fighter&#8217;s traits are reduced to a single skill proficiency. You\n\tcan get that from several other races including elves and githyanki.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tiefling\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/races\/tiefling\/\">Tiefling<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Resistance to fire is a great start since Fire damage is common. Unfortunately, only Zariel Tiefling is worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Asmodeus Tiefling<\/span>: You&#8217;re basically only here for Hellish Rebuke once per day, and that&#8217;s just not enough.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mephistopheles Tiefling<\/span>: Mage Hand is great, but Burning Hands and Flame Blade won&#8217;t be effective since they&#8217;re Charisma-based.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Zariel Tiefling<\/span>: The smite spells aren&#8217;t amazing, but they&#8217;ll still be decent damage boosts. Thaumaturgy gets you Advantage on Intimidation checks, which is enough to make Intimidation a decent choice for the Fighter even if your Charisma is poor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Fighter Skills<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Acrobatics<\/span> (Dex): Dexterity-based builds\n\t\tmight use this to resist being Shoved, but even then it&#8217;s not very\n\t\timpactful.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Animal Handling<\/span> (Wis): Largely replaced by\n\t\tSpeak with Animals or an equivalent potion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Athletics<\/span> (Str): Essential for\n\t\tStrength-based builds.

A +1 ability score increase makes this easy to fit into your build.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Charger<\/span>: Bad feat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crossbow Expert<\/span>: Allows you to build for ranged combat but still stand in melee to be your party&#8217;s Defender. A heavy crossbow does nearly as much damage as a greataxe, and BG3 doesn&#8217;t care about reloading like the TTRPG does.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Duellist<\/span>: A decent defensive option, but wait until at least level 5 so that your Proficiency Bonus is large enough that the feat will feel impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dual Wielder<\/span>: The abundance of magic weapons makes it easy to find weapons that you like, but limiting yourself to light weapons may prove frustrating. That said, two-weapon fighting is typically a worse strategy than sword-and-board.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Durable<\/span>: Buy potions or use camp casting to get a bunch of goodberries.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Great Weapon Master<\/span>: A huge boost to damage output.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heavy Armour Master<\/span>: In a game where most enemies use weapons and almost all encounters involve multiple foes, reducing weapon damage by a small amount per attack stacks up quickly. The +1 ability score increase makes this an easy choice for Strength-based builds. You can also find other items that will provide additional damage reduction, making your incredible durable. Items which provide the Force Conduit condition are especially useful with this strategy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lucky<\/span>: An easy choice if you&#8217;re unsure what to take.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mage Slayer<\/span>: Look for a sussur weapon or cast Silence if you&#8217;re worried about enemy spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Martial Adept<\/span>: Fantastic for Battle Master fighters, but otherwise avoid it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Polearm Master<\/span>: Battle Master and Champion fighters have few uses for their Bonus Action, so this can add a lot to your effectiveness. Combine with Sentinel for best results.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Savage Attacker<\/span>: A modest damage boost without any real effort, but remember that most of your damage is going to be flat numerical bonuses rather than a big stack of dice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sentinel<\/span>: A great way to get additional attacks outside of your turn and to prevent enemies from getting away from you, especially with a reach weapon (polearms). Works very well with Polearm Master.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sharpshooter<\/span>: A huge boost to damage output, and using a crossbow gets much more convenient.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Master<\/span>: A nice defensive boost for shield users.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tavern Brawler<\/span>: Despite not being a monk, Tavern Brawler can make fighting unarmed massively effective for the Fighter. Items which boost unarmed strikes don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re actually a monk, and double-dipping on Strength for attack and damage bonuses means that your attacks will hit consistently and deal good damage. This also applies to throwing things, which includes weapons like spears and daggers and such, so if you have a returning weapon this suddenly becomes very powerful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tough<\/span>: If you need more hp, have someone cast Aid.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">War Caster<\/span>: A great choice for Eldritch Knights, who depend heavily on Concentration buffs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Fighter Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Because fighters are proficient with all weapons, your choice of weapon\n\tlargely comes down to how your individual fighter is built and what weapons\n\tare available to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early game, collect weapons of different types. Each weapon type has a\n\tspecial attack which functions once per short rest, and you can switch weapon\n\ttypes (drop your greatsword, grab a maul, etc.) to get a fresh set of special\n\tattacks. This offers some excellent options before your exciting class\n\tfeatures start to come online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you accumulate magic items, remember that some weapons will provide passive benefits or let you cast spells. Even if you&#8217;re not using one of your equipped weapons, it can still be very beneficial. I got a lot of use out of a bow that allowed the wielder to cast Hunter&#8217;s Mark once per day despite never using the bow once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Fighter Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Unlike the tabletop rules, your choice of armor frequently comes down to &#8220;what is the best magic item I have right now?&#8221; Access to mundane versions of studded leather armor for Dexterity-based builds and Full Plate for Strength-based builds is annoying limited in the early game, but you&#8217;ll frequently find other armors which can match their AC bonus, so it&#8217;s no huge loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re planning to fight at range, don&#8217;t overlook shields. Wearing a shield still boosts your AC and can provide other benefits (spellcasting, stat buffs, etc.) simply by having the shield equipped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Fighter Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Barbarian<\/span>: The Barbarian&#8217;s low-level features are excellent, but the limited number of rages may not be worth the cost unless you&#8217;re taking frequent long rests.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bard<\/span>: The Bard&#8217;s skills and low-level spellcasting are great if you&#8217;re absolutely determined to be your party&#8217;s Face.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cleric<\/span>: An Eldritch Knight might enjoy the spellcasting, but at that point just play a paladin.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Druid<\/span>: No ability overlap, and the Druid&#8217;s capabilities don&#8217;t contribute well to the Fighter&#8217;s martial capabilities.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monk<\/span>: An unarmed combat build can absolutely work thanks to Tavern Brawler, but it is more complicated at low levels before you have a bunch of magic items which support fighting unarmed and unarmored.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Paladin<\/span>: A lot of redundant features and the Paladin&#8217;s noteworthy features are heavily level-dependant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ranger<\/span>: Two levels for a fighting style is tempting, but rarely impactful. An Eldritch Knight might enjoy the Ranger&#8217;s 1st-level spellcasting, including great options like Ensnaring Strike and Hunter&#8217;s Mark.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rogue<\/span>: One level for Expertise is great if you&#8217;re using Athletics frequently. Two levels gets you Cunning Action, which dramatically improves your mobility. Three levels to get the Thief Rogue&#8217;s Fast Hands feature gets you a second Bonus Action every turn, which is a huge buff for two-weapon fighting builds. Of course, that means that you never hit level 11 in Fighter, which gets you a third attack during your Action, and that&#8217;s going to be more impactful than two-weapon fighting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sorcerer<\/span>: Wizard is an easier fit, but low-level subclass features may be worthwhile.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Warlock<\/span>: Two levels for invocations is very tempting. Three levels for Pact of the Blade will let you build around Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity, but typically Paladin+Warlock is a better fit for a martial warlock multiclass build.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wizard<\/span>: One level is a huge buff for an eldritch knight, allowing you learn essentially every wizard spell which you have the spell slots to cast. Two levels for some of the subclass features like Sculpt Spells can also be helpful. For other fighters it&#8217;s not especially useful, and anything you would want can be done via Camp Casting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Fighter Example Build &#8211; Lae&#8217;zel, Githyanki Champion<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/BG3_Laezel-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Baldur's Gate 3 Lae'zel\" class=\"wp-image-21702\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This official screenshot would be an awesome representation character if that shadow didn&#8217;t make it look like she had a beard.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Lae&#8217;zel starts the game with half plate armor and a longsword that she&#8217;s using two-handed. Within DnD lore, Githyanki aspire to be deemed good enough to wield one of their legendary silver swords, which are greatswords that can several astral chords created by Astral Projection, among other neat tricks. None of that actually applies to Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 because there is no Astral Projection within the game, but the lore is fun and it explains why the people on dragons are using a greatsword instead of something sensible like a spear or a bow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re going to lean into two-handed weaponry. We&#8217;re going for Champion to keep the build simple and approachable, which means that much of the time, Lae&#8217;zel works fine essentially on auto-pilot: get her into melee and smash things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Githyanki tend to learn toward Eldritch Knight. The term &#8220;gish&#8221;, which desribes a martial spellcaster, is literally a Gith word, and Lae&#8217;zel uses it to refer to at least on Githyanki character in the game. We&#8217;re ignoring that in favor of the simplicity of the Champion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Spoilers]: You can get a decent greatsword in the prologue by killing the devil at the end. Lae&#8217;zel will eventually get a <a href=\"https:\/\/bg3.wiki\/wiki\/Silver_Sword_of_the_Astral_Plane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pretty amazing greatsword<\/a> if you follow her sideplot far enough.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Lae&#8217;zel&#8217;s ability scores are not optimized, but they do fine until you can get her some better armor than her stating Githyanki Half-plate, which likely won&#8217;t be until you find a merchant.
