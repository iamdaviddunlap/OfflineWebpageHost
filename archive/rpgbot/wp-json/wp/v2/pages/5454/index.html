These are fantastic starting points, and are used as the basis of the starting packages listed below. Each class entry lists the starting gold values (both the dice values and the average).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to roll for gold, take the average gold, or take the items and gold listed in the class entry. If you want to get playing as fast as possible, I recommend using the listed starting package. If you prefer to buy your own items, either roll for gold or take the average, then purchase items as normal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Alchemist (3d6 x 10 gp or 105 gp)\n<ul

Everyone has parents, and everyone came from somewhere. Ultimate Campaign introduced a fantastic <a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCampaign\/characterBackground\/backgroundGenerator.html\">Background Generator<\/a> which you can use to randomly generate your character&#8217;s background.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"personality\">Personality<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The concept of <a href=\"\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jungian_archetypes\">Jungian Archetypes<\/a> has been used as a way to interpret literature for a long time, certainly longer than I have been reading. Various interpretations and iterations on these archetypes exist, but I stumbled on <a href=\"\/\/shop.mopop.org\/product\/Archetypes_of_Fantasy_Print?1559072065551\">my favorite example<\/a> at the <a href=\"\/\/www.mopop.org\/exhibitions-plus-events\/exhibitions\/fantasy-worlds-of-myth-and-magic\/\">Seattle MoPOP&#8217;s Fantasy exhibit<\/a>. Despite a lack of any actual explanation, the poster provides some fantastic concepts for your character&#8217;s personality and role in the game&#8217;s story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I couldn&#8217;t find any sort of official explanations for these archetypes, I have taken some liberties to define broad personality concepts for each archetype. If you have already rolled your character&#8217;s other details, you may find that your personality does not mesh well with the rest of your character. You may take this as a challenge, but in some cases you may wish to reroll if you can&#8217;t find a way to make things work. Many of the personality archetypes are also gender-specific (such as the Iron Maiden). If you are not happy being constrained to a gender, you may take this as a challenge to interpret the archetype as a different gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want an even more interesting personality?

They might understand and wield the power, or the power might be the influence of some otherworldly force that the character cannot control.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Bloodrager, Cleric, Magus, Oracle, Ranger, Shaman, Warpriest<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>The Maiden Warrior<\/td><td>The Maiden Warrior is typically a woman with historically female traits and interests who takes up arms to tackle some challenge or enemy. The Maiden Warrior falls somewhere between the Iron Woman and the Unlikely Hero. The Maiden Warrior is all about breaking out of tradition gender and personality roles, so don&#8217;t feel required to play a female character. Instead, your character might be a peaceful homebody who enjoys cooking, gardening, and needlepoint, but has an untapped talent for fencing. The Maiden Warrior should generally be a class which uses light armor and Dexterity instead of a class which depends on heavy armor and Strength.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Any<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>The Knight<\/td><td>The iconic warrior hero, the Knight is honorable, strong, true. Many Lawful-Good characters work as the Knight, but the Knight isn&#8217;t necessarily good. The Knight is typically Lawful-Good-aligned, but an Evil-aligned knight with a strict code of conduct makes just as much sense.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Cavalier, Cleric, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Samurai, Warpriest<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>The Barbarian<\/td><td>The Barbarian is a wild warrior, perhaps from a distant and uncivilized land, but nearly always more in tune with nature and the wilderness than most characters. Don&#8217;t feel obligated to play the Barbarian class, though this is an obvious and perfectly acceptable choice. The Barbarian is typically Chaotic-aligned.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Barbarian, Bloodrager, Druid, Shaman, Ranger<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>The Trickster<\/td><td>The Trickster is a clever and creative character. They might see odd solutions which other characters don&#8217;t, and they rarely face foes head-on. Any character with a talent for stealth, trickery, and deception can make a good trickster. The Trickster and the Shadow are easy to confuse, but where the Shadow is more devious and subtle, the Trickster is typically more flashy and in-your-face. The Trickster is typically Chaotic-aligned.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Alchemist, Bard, Fighter, Gunslinger, Ninja, Rogue, Swashbuckler, Wizard (Especially Illusionists)<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>The Earth Shaker<\/td><td>The key component of the Earth Shaker is their significance. Wherever the Earth Shaker goes, their presence has significant and lasting effects. An evil Earth Shaker might leave a path of destruction and chaos, while a good Earth Shaker might bring peace and prosperity as an indirect result of their actions.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Any<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>The Wise Wizard<\/td><td>The Wise Wizard isn&#8217;t necessarily a Wizard. Instead, they are defined by their characteristic wisdom, experience, and knowledge. Wise Wizards are often well traveled, but in lieu of real-world experience might be particularly intuitive, clever, or just very well-read. Wise Wizards nearly always have magical abilities, and are typically defined by high Intelligence and\/or Wisdom.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Arcanist, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Magus, Oracle, Wizard<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>The Warbringer<\/td><td>The Warbringer brings war, for good or for ill, but typically for ill.

The Witch&#8217;s neighbors might be afraid of magic in general, or the Witch might derive their powers from horrific sources like demons or other horrific extraplanar beings. The Witch is typically non-Lawful, and might be non-Good, but this depends largely on the feelings of the society in which the Witch lives.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Alchemist, Arcanist, Druid, Shaman, Sorcerer, Witch, Wizard<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>The Rogue<\/td><td>The Rogue is a loose cannon who lives by their own rules. The Rogue can often also be defined as some combination of the Trickster, the Shadow, and the Anti-Hero. The Rogue is often charming with a heart of gold, but may be crass, rebellious, or otherwise unruly. The Rogue is almost never Lawful-aligned.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Alchemist, Bard, Fighter, Gunslinger, Ninja, Rogue, Swashbuckler<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>The Damsel<\/td><td>The Damsel is not always in distress, but is typically a soft, gentle, and kind character. The Damsel is never a front-line character, and is generally not violent by nature. The Damsel is nearly always Good-aligned.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Bard, Cleric, Oracle, Rogue, Shaman<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>The Unlikely Hero<\/td><td>The Unlikely Hero was in the right place at the right time, and has been swept up by events and forced into a life of heroism. The Unlikely hero typically has no formal training at the beginning of their journey, and nearly always comes from humble beginnings. The Unlikely Hero is nearly always Good-aligned.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Barbarian, Fighter, Ranger, Rogue<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>The Iron Woman<\/td><td>The Iron Woman is a hard, but beautiful woman. In many examples, she struggles against the limitations of her gender (think Cercei Lanister from Game of Thrones), but is fiercely determined, and often ruthless. The Iron Woman shares many traits with the Maiden Warrior, but is typically no more combative than the Damsel. The Iron Woman is rarely Good-aligned, but even good people must sometimes be ruthless, devious, and strict.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Suggestions<\/strong>: Alchemist, Bard, Cleric, Oracle, Shaman, Sorcerer, Witch, Wizard<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>The Companion<\/td><td>The Companion is often called the Sidekick in many interpretations of character archetypes, but the Companion is more than that.
