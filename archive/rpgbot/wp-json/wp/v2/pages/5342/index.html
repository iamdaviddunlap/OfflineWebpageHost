The Swashbuckler has the ability to serve as a Face and a Striker, but could be turned into a Defender with a few feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Charmed Life helps\n\ta bit, but it has limited uses per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: You get martial weapons,\n\tbut with only light armor and bucklers, your AC isn&#8217;t going to be great until\n\tyou pick up Nimble.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: 4+ skill ranks is nice, and\n\tSwashbucklers get all of the skills required to be a Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Panache<\/span> (Ex): Panache fuels the\n\tSwashbuckler&#8217;s Deeds. You get a very limited pool, but you can recharge it by\n\tscoring critical hits or by killing worthy opponents. Because Panache is so\n\timportant, almost every Swashbuckler will use a weapon with a high threat\n\trange, such as a Rapier or Scimitar.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Deeds<\/span>: Swashbuckler Deeds, much like Gunslinger Deeds,\n\tare a list of special uses for Panache. Sweashbucklers get all Deeds\n\tautomatically, assuming that they are sufficiently high level. For more\n\tinformation on Deeds, see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/swashbuckler\/deeds\">Swashbuckler Deeds Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swashbuckler Finesse<\/span> (Ex): This is a\n\tfantastic option for a class dip for a ton of builds. You can use Weapon\n\tFinesse with any light or one-handed piercing weapons, which includes things\n\tlike heavy picks and spiked heavy shields. The ability to use Charisma in\n\tplace of Intelligence for Combat Feats means that you can get Combat Expertise\n\twithout the requisite 13 intelligence and pick up all of the cool combat\n\tmaneuver feats which require it. Remember that Slashing Grace allows you to\n\ttreat your selected slashing weapon as piercing for feats and such, so you can\n\tuse a scimitar or falcata.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Charmed Life<\/span> (Ex): Not quite as good as\n\tDivine Grace, but this will help compensate for the Swashbuckler&#8217;s poor saves\n\twhen save-or-suck effects arise.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nimble<\/span> (Ex): Free AC is great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Swashbuckler levels count as\n\tFighter levels, which means you can take Fighter-only feats like Disruptive.\n\tThe retraining option is an often-overlooked benefit of Fighter bonus feats\n\twhich allows you to do ridiculous things like take Weapon Specialization at\n\t4th level, then retrain that choice at 8th level into Improved Critical, or\n\tsomething else with a level-dependent prerequisite. Don&#8217;t actually take\n\tImproved Critical because you get Swashbuckler Weapon Training.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swashbuckler Weapon Training<\/span> (Ex): You are\n\ttreated as having Improved Critical 3 levels before you could get it, and\n\tprobably a level or two before you could afford a +1 keen weapon. The attack\n\tand damage bonuses are nice, too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Swashbuckler Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Your\n\tRapier\/Scimitar now has 15-20\/x3 criticals with no enhancements or feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: You might take 13 for Power Attack, but\n\tcertainly no more than that, and even that is difficult to justify. This is\n\tgenerally the Swashbuckler&#8217;s dump stat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: The Swashbuckler&#8217;s primary ability;\n\tapplies to attacks, AC, Reflex saves, many important skills, and if you take\n\tSlashing Grace it applies to damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Swashbucklers need hit points to\n\tcompensate for their AC, and they need help with Fortitude saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Only needed for skills. If you plan\n\tto play a Face, don&#8217;t take less than 10, otherwise you can dump this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Only needed for Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Cha<\/span>: Determines the size of your Panache\n\tpool, and how many points you start the day with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 18<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 17<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 11<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 16<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 15<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 10<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 13<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity is key to the Swashbuckler, and because the Swashbuckler doesn&#8217;t need to be enlarged like many martial characters, small characters are perfectly viable. Bonuses to Charisma are also helpful because they boost your Panache points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: No bonus to Dexterity, and a penalty\n\tto Charisma. While Dwarves are typically fantastic melee characters, the\n\tSwashbuckler isn&#8217;t a good option for Dwarves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elf<\/span>: Bonuses to Dexterity and Intelligence\n\tare both good for the Swashbuckler, but be careful of the penalty to\n\tConstitution. Most of the Elf&#8217;s racial abilities are focused on magic, but\n\talternate racial abilities can make the Elf a slightly better choice. The Elf\n\tfavored class bonus provides a nice boost to the Swashbuckler&#8217;s Panache\n\tpoints, which makes the Swashbuckler more sustainable in combat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: Though not as good as Halflings,\n\tGnomes get a bonus to Charisma, and have some interesting abilities. If you&#8217;re\n\twilling to trade some offensive ability for some hit points, the Gnome isn&#8217;t a\n\tterrible option. The Gnome favored class bonus gives more uses of Charmed\n\tLife, but Swashbucklers already get enough uses of Charmed Life to get through\n\tthe day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: The Half-Elf has a lot of great\n\toptions for the Swashbuckler, including a flexible ability bonus and some\n\tbonuses to social skills. Alternate racial abilities offer even more useful\n\toptions. The Half-Elf favored class bonus gives more uses of Charmed Life, but\n\tSwashbucklers already get enough uses of Charmed Life to get through the day,\n\tso take the Elf or Human favored class bonuses instead for extra Panache\n\tpoints.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: A flexible ability bonus,\n\tDarkvision, and some other situational abilities. The favored class bonus\n\ttakes a horrifying 12 levels to match the effects of Power Critical, so take\n\tthe Human favored class bonus for extra Panache points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: Bonuses to both of the\n\tSwashbuckler&#8217;s most important ability scores, small, and a collection of\n\tinteresting racial abilities. Look at alternate racial abilities (especially\n\tFleet of Foot and Low Blow). The Halfling favored class bonus gives more uses\n\tof Charmed Life, but Swashbucklers already get enough uses of Charmed Life to\n\tget through the day. The Halfling racial feats Improved Low Blow and Risky\n\tStriker are both excellent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Always the gold standard, Humans are\n\tfantastic Swashbucklers. The extra feat can get you to Slashing Grace at first\n\tlevel, and the racial ability bonus can go into Dexterity. On top of that, the\n\tHuman favored class bonus adds to the size of the Panache pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Anatomist<\/span> (Combat): Confirming critical\n\t\thits is crucial, and any bonus to those rolls is important, especially once\n\t\tyou get iterative attacks with progressively lower attack bonuses. Because\n\t\tthis is a trait bonus, it stacks with other options like Power Critical.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bloodthirsty<\/span> (Combat): A nice source of\n\t\tdamage once you can reliably deliver critical hits, but Anatomist will\n\t\tlikely deliver more total damage by making your critical hits more\n\t\treliable.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Killer<\/span> (Combat): If you do the math,\n\t\tBloodthirsty will give you the same bonus damage on a critical hit while\n\t\talso providing the extra damage upon reducing an enemy to 0 hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Resilient<\/span> (Combat): Fortitude saves are\n\t\timportant, but there are more appealing combat traits.

RAW you can&#8217;t, but\n\t\tthere are several places in the class&#8217;s text which mention Signature Deed.\n\t\tThis is probably errata waiting to happen.

It also removes the\n\t\tpossibility of a buckler, which is a crucial part of the Swashbuckler&#8217;s AC,\n\t\tand adds a huge feat tax to remain viable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Falcata<\/span>: Always a tempting option,\n\t\tespecially with Slashing Grace, but the Swashbuckler really needs a big\n\t\tthreat range to fuel the Panache pool.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Rapier<\/span>: The obvious option.
