None\n\t\tof the spells are on the Artificer spell list, so this adds a lot of new\n\t\tfunctionality.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Healing Word is among the\n\t\t\t\tmost essential spells in the game. Ray of Sickness is bad.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th Level<\/span>: Decent offensive options,\n\t\t\t\tbut nothing spectacular.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Both options are useful in\n\t\t\t\textremely common situations.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th Level<\/span>: A decent single-target\n\t\t\t\tdamage option and an absolutely crucial buff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th Level<\/span>: Raise Dead is\n\t\t\t\tsituational, and by this level other spellcasters have much better ways\n\t\t\t\tto raise the dead. Cloudkill is decent damage, but only if you can find\n\t\t\t\ta way to hold enemies in the area.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Experimental Elixir<\/span>: This is intentionally\n\t\thard to predict, which makes it hard to rely upon. When you get multiple\n\t\telixirs you&#8217;ll have several chances to get effects you care about, but the\n\t\tfree elixirs are still random. Since you roll the effects of the elixirs\n\t\twhen they&#8217;re created, you at least know what their effects will be, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not passing out random mystery cocktails to your party.\n\t\t<p>You can also spend a spell slot to create an additional elixir, which\n\t\t\tmeans that these are something like 1st-level spells. Think of the free\n\t\t\telixirs like a surprise that might be exactly what you need, but\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t count on them. Instead, expect to spend spell slots for elixirs.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Healing<\/span>: Basically a Potion of\n\t\t\t\tHealing. Nothing fancy, but always nice to have. When you later gain\n\t\t\t\tRestorative Reagents, this can be a great option because it both\n\t\t\t\trestores lost hit points and grants a pad of temporary hit points.\nThis provides as much healing as casting Cure Wounds as a 1st-level\n\t\t\t\t\tspell, but you also have the option of giving the elixir to an ally so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they could use it themselves, and once you get Restorative Reagents\n\t\t\t\t\tit becomes much more powerful than anything that a 1st-level spell\n\t\t\t\t\tslot could replicate.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swiftness<\/span>: Situational, but the\n\t\t\t\tduration is nice and long and it stacks with things like Longstrider.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilience<\/span>: Similar to Shield of\n\t\t\t\tFaith, but half the effect and more costly to start (an action to drink\n\t\t\t\tthe elixir vs. a Bonus Action to cast Shield of Faith). Still, with a\n\t\t\t\t10-minute duration, the recipient can drink it ahead of time.\n\t\t\t\tA good buff for your party&#8217;s melee characters, especially if they&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tworking with relatively poor AC (barbarians, two-handed weapon users, etc.).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boldness<\/span>: Similar to Bless for a\n\t\t\t\tsingle target, and it notably stacks with Bless. With a 1-minute\n\t\t\t\tduration, the recipient will need to drink it immediately\n\t\t\t\tbefore combat starts or during combat, which is a hard way to spend\nand Action.\n\t\t\t\tI would happily spend 1st-level spell slots to buff my party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tmartial characters with this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flight<\/span>: The ability to fly, even at\n\t\t\t\tsuch low speed, can solve a ton of problems.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transformation<\/span>: Situational. Alter\n\t\t\t\tSelf normally requires Concentration, so the fact that this doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tis great despite the shorter duration.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemical Savant<\/span>: Add your Intelligence\n\t\tmodifier to things like Healing Word, but also to things like Acid Splash,\n\t\tFire Bolt, and Poison Spray. This makes Acid Splash a very exciting cantrip\n\t\tbecause applying that damage to two targets is very effective, but you still\n\t\twant Fire Bolt as your go-to damage option for single targets.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Restorative Reagents<\/span>: Easy access to\n\t\tLesser Restoration without expending your extremely limited spell slots is\n\t\tnice, and the temporary hit points are a welcome addition to Experimental\n\t\tElixir because it means that even the least-useful elixir still provides a\n\t\ttangible benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chemical Mastery<\/span>: Two damage resistances,\n\t\tand you can cast two extremely powerful healing spells for free each day\n\t\twithout material components.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armorer\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/artificer#Armorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Armorer<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a martially-focus artificer similar to the Battle Smith without the mess of having a robot puppy following you around, the Armorer is for you. If you want to live your fantasy of playing a magical iron man, blasting and smashing people while nearly impervious to attacks, the Armorer is for you. If you want to play a character who&#8217;s missing a limb and have a magical prosthesis in its place, the Armorer is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, the Armorer is excellent. The features are good and useful beyond just a pile of numbers, and while there is some extra complexity on top of the Armorer&#8217;s already high degree of complexity, the resource pools are easy to manage (especially compared to the Artificer&#8217;s core features) and there&#8217;s a built-in solution to all of the subclasses own problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of room to draw comparisons between the Armorer and the Battle Smith. Both gain the ability to make weapon attacks using Intelligence, allowing you to split your focus between martial attacks and spellcasting without sacrificing efficacy with either. The trade-off between the two comes in how the two subclasses handle their roles as Defenders and\/or Strikers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Armorer can focus more on being a Defender, especially in Guardian Armor, and between Booming Blade and Thunder Gauntlets the Armor is extremely &#8220;sticky&#8221;, meaning that they&#8217;re good at forcing enemies to stay engaged with the Armorer rather than running off to attack your comparably frail allies. The Battlesmith does more damage thanks to their Steel Defender, but lacks that same &#8220;stickiness&#8221; which Thunder Gauntlets offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infiltrator Armor turns the Armorer into more of a ranged Striker and Scout, so it&#8217;s easier to compare them to the Artillerist, where the Armorer trades the Artillerist&#8217;s support capabalities for Advantage on Stealth checks to allow them to serve as a Scout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re building an armorer, the hardest part is surviving levels 1 and 2. You can play an armorer with 8 Strength and 8 Dexterity, but that means that your AC is dangerously low until you can get to 3rd level. Be cautious. Hide behind stuff. Fight at range as much as possible, and do everything you can to not be in places and situations where something will feel the need to cause you bodily harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more help with the Armorer, see our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/armorer\" data-type=\"page\">Armorer Artificer Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tool Proficiency<\/span>: Heavy armor proficiency\n\t\tmeans that you no longer need to concern yourself with Dexterity. Getting\n\t\tthrough levels 1 and 2 with 8 Dexterity was probably a nightmare, but now\n\t\tyou&#8217;re here and you can seal yourself inside a suit of plate mail (unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re going for Infiltrator armor) where you&#8217;re nice and safe. You also get\n\t\tsmith&#8217;s tools, which are one of the better tool options if you want to craft\n\t\tadventuring gear since so much of it is typically made of metal.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Armorer Spells<\/span>: Starts off slow, but\n\t\tfinishes strong. Mostly offensive damage spells, but at high levels you get\n\t\tmore diverse and useful options.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">3rd Level<\/span>: Two offensive options.\n\t\t\t\tThunderwave is situational, but sometimes pushing enemies is helpful.\n\t\t\t\tMagic Missile is nice and reliable, but without a boost to your spell\n\t\t\t\tdamage and with only 2\/3 spellcasting progression, offensive spells are\n\t\t\t\ttypically a terrible way to spend your spell slots. Even so, Magic\n\t\t\t\tMissile is a great way to break Concentration since it forces a save for\n\t\t\t\teach missile.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th Level<\/span>: Mirror image is a good\n\t\t\t\tdefensive buff, though it will wear off quickly for anyone trying to use\n\t\t\t\tit in melee. Shatter is passable AOE damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: AOE save or suck and\n\t\t\t\tlightning bolt, which fits the theme much better but is much less\n\t\t\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th Level<\/span>: Two excellent buffs,\n\t\t\t\tthough ironically Fire Shield may not be especially effective since the\n\t\t\t\tArtificer&#8217;s AC is notoriously high so enemies may have trouble hitting\n\t\t\t\tyou enough that it will deliver consistent damage output.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">17th Level<\/span>: A decent utility option\n\t\t\t\tand an excellent area control option.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Armor<\/span>: The Armorer&#8217;s signature\n\t\tfeature, Arcane armor is the heart of the three features which the Armorer\n\t\tgains at 3rd level. This removes the Strength requirement from heavy armor,\n\t\tallowing you to wear full plate comfortably with 8 Strength, and preventing\n\t\tthe armor from being removed against your will so it&#8217;s incredibly difficult\n\t\tto lose your signature tool.\n\t\t<p>Note that this feature doesn&#8217;t make your armor a magic item. That&#8217;s\n\t\t\timportant because it still allows you to infuse the armor. It also\n\t\t\tspecifically allows you to remove the helmet as a Bonus Action, and since\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re not wearing a helmet you can infuse and wear a separate helmet. You\n\t\t\twon&#8217;t be able to infuse your boots or gloves until level 9 when you get\n\t\t\tArmor Modifications, but two infusions can still go a very long way. Plus,\n\t\t\tyou can always use a shield, a weapon, hand-held items that you infuse,\n\t\t\tcloaks, etc.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Despite its benefits, this feature does have some problems. First, you\n\t\t\tneed to provide the armor, which means that you likely need to fork over\n\t\t\tthe 1,500gp to buy full plate, which players typically can&#8217;t afford until\n\t\t\taround level 5. Second, if you don other armor the effect ends on your\n\t\t\tcurrent Arcane Armor so if someone forces you into a suit of padded armor\n\t\t\t(admittedly hard since your armor can&#8217;t be removed against your will) and\n\t\t\tsteals your smith&#8217;s tools you&#8217;re in trouble. Third, depending on what type\n\t\t\tof armor you&#8217;re wearing, you may be unable to use magic items (including\n\t\t\tinfused ones) which go in on your hands or feet until you get Armor\n\t\t\tModifications at 9th level. The Player&#8217;s Handbook is non-specific\n\t\t\tabout which types of armor include boots or gloves, but Arcane Armor \n\t\t\tspecifies that it covers your whole body (which includes hands, feat, and\n\t\t\thead), and since armor is worth more than 1sp I&#8217;m inclined to believe\n\t\t\tthat it counts.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Armor Model<\/span>: The subclass of your\n\t\tsubclass, Armor Model allows you to choose between a front-line rank and a\n\t\tstealthy, back-line blaster. You can reset this choice every time that you\n\t\tcomplete a rest, allowing you to change roles as easily as changing pants.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guardian<\/span>: The go-to option, the\n\t\t\t\tGuardian is simple and effective. Get into melee and hit stuff until it\n\t\t\t\tdies.\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Thunder Gauntlets<\/span>: Equivalent\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamage to a longsword (1d8+int), and since it&#8217;s thunder damage\n\t\t\t\t\t\talmost nothing will resist it. Each gauntlet counts as an\n\t\t\t\t\t\tindependent weapon, so you&#8217;re still free to hold a shield in one\n\t\t\t\t\t\thand and punch stuff with the other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The secondary effect is a sort of taunt effect, but it only\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taffects attacks so enemies with special abilities like breath\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweapons and enemies who can cast spells may be able to get around\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit. Even so, it&#8217;s really good since many enemies rely entirely on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattacks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Combining Thunder Gauntlets with Booming Blade looks like a great\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcombination, but note that with the updated version of the spell\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpublished in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron you need to use a weapon with a gp\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue of 1 sp or greater.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It&#8217;s not clear yet if the Thunder Gauntlets qualify to use with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBooming Blade and Green-Flame Blade, but Jeremery Crawford\\ has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindicated that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sageadvice.eu\/2020\/11\/18\/does-the-monetary-value-of-the-component-now-negate-being-able-to-use-your-pact-of-the-blade-weapon-or-shadow-blade-in-conjunction-with-booming-blade\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he would allow Shadow Blade to work with Booming Blade<\/a>, and Shadow Blade faces the same issue with an unspecified item\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue. That&#8217;s not technically a rules answer, but it may be the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclosest that we get.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Defensive Field<\/span>: The temporary hit\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpoints are a good sized pool, and using this two to six times per\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday dramatically improves your ability to endure damage. While I\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunderstand the temptation, it may be wise to take a little bit of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdamage before activating this so that you can make use of hit dice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tduring short rests and avoid burning out your Defensive Field\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcharges early in the day.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Infiltrator<\/span>: The Infiltrator offers\n\t\t\t\tthe option to favor lighter armor, allowing the armorer to fight\n\t\t\t\teffectively at range and potentially even be stealthy if you built your\n\t\t\t\tartificer with 14 or more Dexterity.\n\t\t\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re planning to wear medium armor, strongly consider wearing a\n\t\t\t\t\tbreastplate instead of half plate. While half plate&#8217;s AC is 1 point\n\t\t\t\t\thigher, it imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n\t\t\t\t\tInfiltrator armor will offset this, but giving up 1 point of AC to\n\t\t\t\t\tinstead have permanent Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks is a\n\t\t\t\t\treally good trade. You can always make up for the lost AC with the\n\t\t\t\t\tEnhanced Defense infusion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lightning Launcher<\/span>: The damage on\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis is annoying and weird. Ligthning damage is a fine type, but the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfact that you can add an extra d6 to the damage of one hit per turn\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis an annoyance to remember. Keep in mind that this is a weapon\n\t\t\t\t\t\tattack, so you do add your ability modifier (Intelligence in this\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase) to the damage, and 1d6+int will outdo your damage from\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcantrips.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Powered Steps<\/span>: 5 feet of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadditional speed isn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s still nice.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dampening Field<\/span>: Generally you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbe wearing Full Plate, which imposes Disadvantage on Stealth (as\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdoes all other heavy armor). This offsets that problem, allowing you\n\t\t\t\t\t\tto stumble around with your -1 Dexterity Modifier and only slightly\n\t\t\t\t\t\truin the party&#8217;s hopes of being sneaky. If you have 14 Dexterity,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can wear breastplate and be very capable at Stealth even if your\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDexterity never improves from there.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: The Armorer relies on\n\t\tattacks rather than cantrips as their primary offensive option, so this is a\n\t\tsignificant increase in your damage output. Remember that if you&#8217;re relying\n\t\ton Lightning Launcher you only add the extra d6 damage once per turn.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor Modifications<\/span>: Arcane Armor presents\n\t\tsome limitations on the magic items\/infusions which you can wear (see Arcane\n\t\tArmor, above), which means that you likely can&#8217;t wear items like Winged\n\t\tBoots. Armor Modifications neatly solves that issue and also gives you two\n\t\tadditional Infused Item slots which you can only use on your armor so you no\n\t\tlonger need to feel selfish for buffing yourself instead of sharing your\n\t\tInfusions with your party.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Perfected Armor<\/span>: An additional effect on\n\t\teach armor model.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Guardian<\/span>: Save yourself the trouble of\n\t\t\t\twalking, and pull your target to you instead. You&#8217;re not forced to pull\n\t\t\t\tthem the full 30 feet, but you get to attack them for free if you do.\n\t\t\t\tBut maybe there&#8217;s some nasty AOE between you and them, or maybe there&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\ta conveniently-placed pit that you can drop them into. You can even use\n\t\t\t\tthis on your allies to pull them out of bad situations like grapples,\n\t\t\t\tand since it&#8217;s forced movement it doesn&#8217;t provoke opportunity\n\t\t\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infiltrator<\/span>: The Advantage mechanic\n\t\t\t\twould be enough to make this <span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>, but\n\t\t\t\tyou also get some extra damage if they&#8217;re hit. Keep in mind that you can\n\t\t\t\talso benefit from this, so if you hit them with your first attack you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tget Advantage against them on your second. If you hit with your second\n\t\t\t\tattack, expect an ally to capitalize on the Advantage before you get\n\t\t\t\tanother shot.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"artillerist\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/artificer#Artillerist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Artillerist<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Artillerist is as cool as the description makes it sound.

One could even argue from those numbers carving up 1 or 5 javelins in the same time frames. You might not use them, but your party might benefit from the ability to manufacture ammunition.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Artillerist Spells<\/span>: The Artillerist&#8217;s\n\t\tspell list is primarily offensive with some area control effects thrown in.\n\t\tNone of the spells are on the Artificer spell list, which is strange\n\t\tcompared to similar class features on other classes which typically saddle\n\t\tyou with at least a few situational spells that are already on your class&#8217;s\n\t\tspell list.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: Shield is a great spell at\n\t\t\t\tany level, and since Tool&#8217;s Required adds a material component to all of your\n\t\t\t\tspells, you can cast it with your hands full (provided that you&#8217;re holding or\n\t\t\t\twearing an infused item or an appropriate tool). Thunderwave isn&#8217;t a\n\t\t\t\tton of damage, but it&#8217;s nice for pushing enemies away if you get stuck\n\t\t\t\tin melee.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th Level<\/span>: Two good offensive spells,\n\t\t\t\tbut remember that the Artificer gets 2\/3 spell progression so you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tgetting Shatter at the same level that wizard get Fireball. Arcane\n\t\t\t\tFirearm comes online at the same level and provides a damage boost, but\n\t\t\t\tit only applies to one damage roll, so AOE options like Shatter are more\n\t\t\t\tefficient against multiple targets than options like Scorching Ray.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Fireball is one of the\n\t\t\t\tbest AOE damage spells in the game, especially for its level, and adding\n\t\t\t\tArcane Firearm&#8217;s damage boost will close some of the gap between the\n\t\t\t\tArtificer and the Wizard. Wind Wall is fine, but it&#8217;s really situational\n\t\t\t\tso you may go your entire career without casting it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-green\">13th Level<\/span>: Ice Storm isn&#8217;t a great\n\t\t\t\tspell, but Wall of Fire is an excellent area control option.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th Level<\/span>: Cone of Cold&#8217;s AOE is\n\t\t\t\tgreat, but the damage isn&#8217;t significantly better than that of Fireball.\n\t\t\t\tWall of Force is the real winner here. It&#8217;s a reliable, no-save way to\n\t\t\t\tshut off one or more enemies for the duration of the spell, and most\n\t\t\t\tenemies are totally powerless to escape or counter it.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Cannon<\/span>: The eldritch cannon is\n\t\tbasically a pet that can only perform one action. They&#8217;re severely limited\n\t\tby their 15 ft. movement speed, so generally you&#8217;ll either create a Tiny\n\t\tcannon and carry it around (or make someone else do it) or you&#8217;ll create a\n\t\tnew Small cannon whenever you need a cannon that can occupy a space.\n\t\tCreating a cannon takes an Action, so consider your choices carefully; an\n\t\tAction early in combat (or ideally before combat starts) is very important.\n\t\t<p>In addition to their active abilities, your cannon makes a decent tank.\n\t\t\tWith an AC of 18 and a decent pool of hit points, they can take a lot of\n\t\t\tdamage which would otherwise be dealt to your party members, and you can\n\t\t\theal them between fights using a cantrip (though the 1-minute casting time\n\t\t\tfor Mending can add up quickly if you&#8217;re not careful).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Small cannons are big enough to provide cover for small characters, and\n\t\t\tin tight quarters they might be able to completely prevent enemies from\n\t\t\treaching you by interposing themselves. However, be cautious about\n\t\t\tsacrificing your cannon: you can only have one, you only get to create one\n\t\t\tfor free each day, and it only lasts for an hour. After that it will cost\n\t\t\tyou a spell slot, but a 1st-level spell slot is a negligible price to pay\n\t\t\tfor how good the cannons can be.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flamethrower<\/span>: With 15 ft. speed and\n\t\t\t\ta 15 ft. AOE, it will be difficult to keep the flamethrower in range\n\t\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re in small areas like a cramped dungeon, but if you find\n\t\t\t\tyourself unexpectedly in an encounter with close-packed enemies, it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\toften more efficient to create a flamethrow cannon than to cast Burning\n\t\t\t\tHands or something similar.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Force Ballista<\/span>: Your go-to damage\n\t\t\t\toption. It&#8217;s only slightly more interesting than a crossbow. The damage\n\t\t\t\tis decent and it uses your Intelligence for the attack, so if all you\n\t\t\t\tneed is to kill one creature at a time, this is a good choice. The push\n\t\t\t\teffect isn&#8217;t huge, but it&#8217;s enough to break grapples by forcing enemies\n\t\t\t\tout of reach of your allies.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protector<\/span>: False Life is only a\n\t\t\t\t1st-level spell and provides largely the same benefit, but False Life\n\t\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t affect your whole party and you can&#8217;t spam it every round for an\n\t\t\t\thour. Even if your cannon spends all of its time following your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\ttank around to replenish their temporary hit points, the Protector\n\t\t\t\tcannon can go a long way to stretch your party&#8217;s limited daily\n\t\t\t\tresources. Between fights, activate the cannon repeatedly until you roll\n\t\t\t\tan 8 to ensure that you and your party members go into every fight with\n\t\t\t\tas many temporary hit points as possible.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Firearm<\/span>: This applies to all of\n\t\tyour artificer spells. Consider this on Shatter or Fireball. The d8 isn&#8217;t as reliable\n\t\tas adding your intelligence bonus, but it&#8217;s 4.5 damage on average, so it&#8217;s\n\t\troughly equivalent. Also note the wording of the ability. You don\u2019t add 1d8 to the damage; you roll 1d8 and add the value on the die to the damage. Specifically this means it does not get multiplied by a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Explosive Cannon<\/span>: A 50% damage increase\n\t\tfor the Flamethrower and the Force Ballista, but the Protector doesn&#8217;t get\n\t\tanything (not that the Protector needs anything; it&#8217;s still spectacular).\n\t\tYou also get the ability to turn your cannon into a bomb, and the damage\n\t\twill at least match a 1st-level spell, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider walking your\n\t\tcannon into a group of enemies and detonating it to be a good go-to option\n\t\tin most cases since your cannon continuing to act will be more impactful\n\t\tthan the explosion.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fortified Position<\/span>: Half cover means +2 AC\n\t\tfor your entire party, which is a significant boost. The second cannon means\n\t\tthat you&#8217;ll spend less time stressing over which cannon to choose, and if\n\t\tone of the offensive options is clearly the best option you could even\n\t\tchoose to make two of them. However, you still only get one free cannon per\n\t\tday, so either carry around Tiny cannons or expect to spend some spell\n\t\tslots.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-smith\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/classes\/artificer#BattleSmith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle Smith<\/a> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Battlesmith allows the Artificer to focus on Intelligence and Constitution, allowing you to thrive in melee without worrying about Strength or Dexterity. The Steel Defender is a really simple pet, and the cost of it dying is low enough that you don&#8217;t need to feel bad about it, so you&#8217;re free to throw it in front of you and your allies whenever things get dangerous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardest decision facing the Battlesmith is what to do with your hands. Most characters only have two hands, and if you plan to be in melee that&#8217;s often a problem. You could use a two-handed weapon, but a shield is an important option when you only have d8 hit dice. You could fight at range with a bow or crossbow, and that would work fine, but if you want to fight at range the Artillerist is typically a better fit. The Battlesmith is intended to wade into melee with a weapon in hand and clad in so many Infusions that you&#8217;re basically untouchable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that you can use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus, which means that you can use it to provide both Material and Somatic components for spells that require inexpensive material components, and thanks to the &#8220;Tools Required&#8221; part of the Artificer&#8217;s Spellcasting feature you don&#8217;t need a free hand to perform Somatic components so long as either your weapon or your shield are one of your Infused Items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/subclasses\/battle-smith\/\">Battle Smith Artificer Handbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tool Proficiency<\/span>: Most interesting and\n\t\texpensive non-magical adventuring gear is made of metal.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Smith Spells<\/span>: Most of the spells\n\t\tare from the Paladin spell list, which is exciting for a subclass built to\n\t\tbe a durable melee character similar to the Paladin. Many of the options are\n\t\texcellent, and the smite spells from the Paladin&#8217;s spell list work on ranged\n\t\tweapons so you&#8217;re not locked into melee if that&#8217;s not where you want to be.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: Spectacular defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuffs.

Warding Bond is hard due to the Artificer&#8217;s d8 hit die.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">9th Level<\/span>: Both spells are fine, but\n\t\t\t\tnot especially good for a 3rd-level spell.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th Level<\/span>: More great defensive\n\t\t\t\tbuffs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">17th Level<\/span>: Both options are\n\t\t\t\tsituational, but you don&#8217;t have another good way to deal with\n\t\t\t\textraplanar creatures and your best group healing is Aura of Vitality,\n\t\t\t\twhich can&#8217;t get a whole party back on their feat in one turn..<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battle Ready<\/span>: Finally a way to use\n\t\tIntelligence for your weapon attacks! You also get martial weapons, which\n\t\toffers a small improvement to your existing weapon options. Be sure to take\n\t\t14 Dexterity to max out medium armor, but otherwise go all-in on\n\t\tIntelligence.\n\t\t<p>You have a variety of good options for how to jump into combat with a\n\t\t\tweapon. Grab a longsword (or an equivalent weapon) and a shield, and\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re nearly as durable as a fighter (arguably more durable if you have\n\t\t\tthe right infusions), especially with your Steel Defender&#8217;s Deflect\n\t\t\tAttack. Deflect Attack may even be enough to justify using a two-handed\n\t\t\tmelee weapon so that you can focus on offense, but if you&#8217;re going to use\n\t\t\tBooming Blade or Green-Flame Blade, the bigger damage dice will be less\n\t\t\timpactful than the AC bonus from a shield.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be extra\n\t\t\tdefensive but still in melee, grab a whip and keep your Steel Defender\n\t\t\tbetween you and your enemies. If that&#8217;s still not safe enough, grab a\n\t\t\tranged weapon and send your Steel Defender into melee on its own.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Steel Defender<\/span>: The Steel Defender is\n\t\tprimarily a Defender, rather than a Striker. It has a decent pile of hit\n\t\tpoints and what amounts to Fighting Style (Protection). It deals damage\n\t\tequivalent to a longsword and since it&#8217;s force damage almost nothing will\n\t\tresist it, but its primary function is to protect you while you do the real\n\t\tdamage. It has a poor AC at just 15, so expect to spend a lot of time\n\t\trepairing it between fights. The Steel Defender&#8217;s Repair action allows it to\n\t\trepair itself, but at 3 uses per day you&#8217;ll get a lot more healing out of\n\t\tMending.\n\t\t<p>The Steel Defender notably doesn&#8217;t gain any ability to fly, which is a\n\t\t\tproblematic limitation once you reach high enough level that flying\n\t\t\tenemies become common. You&#8217;ll need a way to either get enemies down into\n\t\t\trange of your Steel Defender or you&#8217;ll need to find a way to make your\n\t\t\tSteel Defender fly. Infusing a pair of Winged Boots is probably your best\n\t\t\toption.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Helpful since the Battle\n\t\tSmith typically relies on weapons for damage output, but without an on-hit\n\t\tdamage boost you&#8217;ll get considerably more damage output out of cantrips like\n\t\tBooming Blade and Sword Burst, so Extra Attack may only be consistently\n\t\tuseful if you&#8217;re using a reach weapon or a ranged weapon. See my article on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\">Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Jolt<\/span>: 2d6 damage\/healing up to 5\n\t\ttimes per day isn&#8217;t much, but fortunately it doubles at 15th level, and the\n\t\thealing is as useful as Healing Word, allowing you to heal dying allies and\n\t\tget them back into the fight. Personally I would reserve this exclusively\n\t\tfor healing and critical hits. The damage isn&#8217;t enough to make a big difference\n\t\tnormally unless you know that it&#8217;ll kill the target, but the damage is\n\t\t&#8220;extra damage&#8221; rather than a separate damage source, so it&#8217;s multiplied on a\n\t\tcritical hit like Divine Smite or Hex.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Defender<\/span>: 2d6 more damage\/healing\n\t\ton Arcane Jolt makes it a little more impactful, but still not significant.\n\t\tThe AC boost is significant, especially since your pet has been sitting at\n\t\t15 AC for 11 levels while attack bonuses gradually increase. The tiny bit of\n\t\tdamage on Deflect Attack is nice, too. At this level 1d4+5 (I&#8217;m assuming\n\t\tthat you have 20 Intelligence by now) isn&#8217;t much at this level, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tstill a nice little buff to something which you were going to do anyway, and\n\t\tif you&#8217;re using it every round (which you really should) it will add up\n\t\tquickly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-pale\">3rd-Party Publishers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT has covered some 3rd-party content from our favorite creators.
