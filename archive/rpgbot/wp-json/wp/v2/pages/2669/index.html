Sneak Attack allows them to do a huge\n\tpile of damage in a single attack, and their pile of skills allows them to\n\teasily handle locks, traps, guards, and many other challenges. While a party\n\tcan function just fine without a Rogue, it&#8217;s hard to compete with the sheer\n\tnumber of important skill and tool proficiencies offered by the Rogue. In a\n\tparty they serve as some combination of Face, Scout, and Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Rogues typically split into melee or ranged builds, though the universal\n\tefficacy of Dexterity makes it easy for many rogues to switch between the two.\n\tMelee Rogues frequently go for two-weapon fighting because it provides a\n\tsecond chance to score Sneak Attack, and hit-and-run tactics enabled by\n\tCunning Action are great way to get into melee to attack before retreating out\n\tof reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Ranged rogues typically rely on sniping, which is also enabled by Cunning\n\tAction due to the ability to hide as a Bonus Action. Hiding after each attack\n\tusing Cunning Action is reliable and effective, though it can be very static\n\tand repetitive. Rogue subclasses expand upon those tactical options, but in\n\tmany cases these staple tactics remain crucial to the class&#8217;s function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, consider our other supporting material for the Rogue:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11730\">Rogue Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2672\">Rogue Subclass Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/spells\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2671\">Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells Breakdown<\/a> (if you plan to play an Arcane Trickster)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/build-the-ultimate-scoundrel-rogues-level-1-10-rpgbot-podcast-s4e8\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Rogue Optimization (Part 1)<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/skilled-skullduggery-for-your-devious-deceiver-rogues-levels-11-20-rpgbot-podcast-s4e9\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Rogue Optimization (Part 2)<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/dnd-rogue-roleplay-guide\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31531\">Rogue Roleplay Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

No shenanigans to get easy access to Sneak Attack? Steady Aim\n\tis your answer.

If\n\tyou&#8217;re asking yourself if you or someone in your game is experienced enough\n\twith the game that you don&#8217;t need Steady Aim, I recommend this as a barometer:\n\tIf the player in question knows the game well enough to think of a horse as an\n\tabuse case, that player probably doesn&#8217;t need Steady Aim.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Rogue Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dexterity is key for any Rogue, and Intelligence is important for Arcane\n\tTricksters, but your need for Wisdom and Charisma depend largely on your\n\tchoice of skills and role in the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Typically your dump stat.

These are the Rogue&#8217;s\n\ttypical roles, and this build can cover all the bases reasonably well at the\n\tsame time. Our Face and Scout emphasis will be a balance because each will\n\tconsume our limited choices of skill proficiencies and Expertise. I&#8217;ll present\n\tsome suggested options, but I encourage you to customize your build to suit\n\tyour tastes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll note two DPR entries below: One for a single attack, and one for\n\ttwo-weapon fighting. While the additional attack itself does a miniscule\n\tamount of additional damage, the additional opportunity to deal Sneak Attack\n\tdamage is a massive mathematical advantage that only grows as you gain\n\tlevels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We will use the ability scores below.

Dexterity and Charisma is likely the best ability score\n\tspread we can get for a thief, and the Lightfoot Halfling&#8217;s other racial\n\ttraits offer a bunch of other useful tricks.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Rogues get more skills at first level than any other class, and they also get\n\tExpertise immediately. You also get Thieves&#8217; Tools proficiency on top of the\n\trest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Perception<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Persuasion<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sleight of Hand<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stealth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose the Criminal background, you&#8217;ll get a redundant Stealth\n\tproficiency which you can trade for Insight or Intimidation. If you choose the\n\tNoble background you&#8217;ll get a redundant Persuasion proficiency which you can\n\ttrade for Deception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Expertise, I recommend Perception and Stealth. Other skills are\n\tappealing, but you&#8217;re more likely to die because of a failed Perception or\n\tStealth check than for failed Persuasion check. At 6th level you&#8217;ll get\n\tExpertise in two more skills, at which point you should consider skills which\n\tfit your campaign. If you&#8217;re doing a lot of stealing, consider Sleight of Hand\n\tand Thieves&#8217; Tools. If you&#8217;re doing a lot socially acceptable things, consider\n\tDeception and Persuasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-164\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14b - incontent_14 -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background-1\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Criminal is the obvious choice here, so we&#8217;ll pick Criminal. However, it\n\tmight not be the best choice among those available to use. Rogue grants\n\tThieves&#8217; Tools proficiency automatically, so Criminal&#8217;s tool proficiency is\n\tredundant. Under the rules for backgrounds, you can replace a redundant\n\tproficiency with one of the same type, but what other set of tools do you\n\twant? If you want proficiency in something like Healer&#8217;s Kit or Herbalism Kit,\n\tCriminal is great. If you can&#8217;t think of a second set of tools, look for other\n\tbackground options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Criminal doesn&#8217;t work for you, consider Noble. History proficiency isn&#8217;t a\n\tgreat choice for our low-Intelligence build, but you get Persuasion, a gaming\n\tset, and a language, and Position of Privilege is a great way to roleplay\n\tyourself into places with nice things to steal.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats-1\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Rogues get one more ability score improvement than most classes, and you only\n\tneed to bring on ability score (Dexterity) to 20 to be successful, so there is\n\ta lot of room for you to pick up feats if you&#8217;re willing to deviate from the\n\tBasic Rules and the SRD. If you&#8217;re new to the game, consider simple feats like\n\tSkilled or Resilient. If you want to dabble in magic, consider Magic Initiate\n\tand take a look at the Spells section above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14c - incontent_14 -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-165\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14c - incontent_14 -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Expertise<br>&#8211; Perception<br>&#8211; Stealth<br>Sneak Attack 1d6<br>Thieves&#8217;\n\t\t\t\t\tCant<\/td><td>For your starting equipment, take a shortsword, a short bow, any of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe pack options, leather armor, two daggers, and theives&#8217; tools.<br><br>At\n\t\t\t\t\tfirst level you already have most of what makes you a decent rogue.\n\t\t\t\t\tSneak Attack is still picking up steam, but 1d6 is a big chunk of\n\t\t\t\t\tdamage at this level, so do everything you can to get it.<br><br>In\n\t\t\t\t\tcombat, you can either fight at range or jump into melee as the\n\t\t\t\t\tsituation warrants.
