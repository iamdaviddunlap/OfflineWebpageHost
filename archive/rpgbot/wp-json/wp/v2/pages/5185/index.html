They&#8217;re a good trap option for players because they take just a minute to set up and come at a variety of price points, and they&#8217;re a great tool for GMs because they&#8217;re single-use, disposable, and can&#8217;t be looted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article will explore some of the practical parts of using Snares in your game, both in terms of how the rules work and from a character optimization perspective. This is not a replacement for the original rules text; it is intended to be read alongside the rules text in order to offer useful insights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"crafting-snares\">Crafting Snares<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The phrase &#8220;Crafting Snares&#8221; is immediately confusing. Unlike most items which you can craft and move around, Snares are not portable. You need to carry your raw materials and tools (see Tools and Materials, below) and craft the Snare wherever you want to place it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snares are built in a single 5-foot square. The Craft activity has the Manipulate trait, which means that you must be able to reach whatever your crafting, so you need to be in or adjacent to this square throughout the crafting process. The Snare is triggered when a creature enters the Snare&#8217;s square, so if you create a Snare in your own space you&#8217;re fine unless you exit the Snare&#8217;s square and then return to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no listed restriction on how a Snare can be placed. It&#8217;s never specified if the square needs to be on the ground, though I think that&#8217;s the intent. It&#8217;s also never specified if more than one Snare can be in the same space. Check with your GM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do have the option to craft a Snare as a Downtime activity in order to craft it at a discount. However, this uses the normal rules for crafting items, so it takes 4 days at minimum and a Craft check, and the Snare still isn&#8217;t portable. This is generally a terrible idea, but Snares are permanent so maybe it&#8217;s worth the time to craft a high-level Snare in your home base or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>During combat, it&#8217;s unlikely that most characters will craft Snares. 1 minute is longer than many combats, and you can&#8217;t sit around putting together a Snare while your friends are fighting and dying around you. If you plan to craft Snares in combat, you&#8217;ll want feats like the Ranger&#8217;s Quick Snares feat.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tools-and-materials\">Tools and Materials<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Crafting Snares requires a Snare Kit, a Formula for the desired Snare, and adequate materials to craft the Snare. A Snare Kit isn&#8217;t a problem, but the materials aren&#8217;t described in any detail. Where do you buy them? How much do they weigh? What are they? Totally unclear. As far as I can tell, you spend gold and get an equivalent value of generic snare materials which are ambiguously defined and of negligible Bulk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Like alchemical items, you&#8217;ll need a Formula to craft a Snare. You get four when you take the Snare Crafting feat, and there isn&#8217;t a level restriction on those so you can select Snares across a range of levels if you&#8217;d like, or you might take a bunch of high-level formulas to save money later. High-level formulas cost a huge amount of money. The core rules detail 21 Snares, so you&#8217;ll either spend a ton of money to learn them all or you&#8217;ll need to pick which ones are worth the cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using snares in any significant capacity, strongly consider upgrading to a Specialist&#8217;s Snare Kit when the 55gp cost is no long daunting. It&#8217;s a low cost for a +1 Item bonus to your Craft checks, and while you don&#8217;t make a check to craft a Snare, your Crafting DC sets the DC to detect and disable your Snares.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Be cautious about the cost of Snares. They&#8217;re single-use and can&#8217;t be moved, and if you over-use them the cost will quickly eat into your ability to equip yourself properly. The Ranger&#8217;s Snare Specialist feat allows you to prepare several snares per day at no material cost, so it&#8217;s a must-have for Snare enthusiasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"countering-snares\">Countering Snares<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Countering snares is simple: detect it and either disarm it, avoid it, or intentionally trigger it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"detecting-snares\">Detecting Snares<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Detecting snares works like detecting anything else: you use the Seek action, you pick an area to target, and you make a Perception check. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s a steep cost in combat, especially over a large area, but there isn&#8217;t a way around it except to stumble blindly into any square that might contain a Snare. Snares all make either an attack or require a Basic Reflex save, so if you have someone in the party with Evasion they&#8217;re a great candidate to run around the room trying to find Snares or other hazards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disabling-snares\">Disabling Snares<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>To disable a Snare, you can either use the Disable a Device action to intentionally disable it, or you can trigger it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Disabling a Snare requires the Thievery skill, plain and simple, and you need to have your Thievery Proficiency high. You don&#8217;t need to match the Craft Proficiency of whoever crafted the Snare, but you need to be one step behind them. But if they have better Proficiency, you need to make up the mathematical difference. Infiltrator Thieves&#8217; Tools are essential, and look for other bonuses like the Guidance spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Triggering a snare intentionally isn&#8217;t as easy as you would hope. A Snare is only triggered when a small or larger creature enters its square. You could roll a wagon over a Snare, and somehow that doesn&#8217;t trigger the snare. You could disintegrate the floor underneath it, and RAW the Snare is happy to hang suspended in mid-air and wait for something to fall through it. The creature size limitation also prevents you from triggering Snares by throwing rats into the square, so the classic &#8220;bag of rats&#8221; abuse case doesn&#8217;t apply here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>may<\/em> be able to trigger a trap by damaging it, such as by shooting it with an arrow. The core rules for traps specify that damaging a trap &#8220;usually triggers it&#8221;, and since Snares have the Trap trait, they&#8217;re technically also traps. Unfortunately there&#8217;s no guidance on how the GM should interpret the word &#8220;usually&#8221; here, so you&#8217;ll need to work it out with your GM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-character\">Your Character<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that you have your head around how Snares work, it&#8217;s time to talk about how you make them work for your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character-basics\">The Basics<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you want to craft and use snares, you need three things: Intelligence, the Craft skill, and the Snare Crafting General Feat. You can achieve all of those at 1st level, but you don&#8217;t necessarily need to do that. Snares cost money, and low-level characters often need to strain their financial resources to acquire all of the mundane equipment that they want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, this initial investment of character options gets you quite a bit. The ability to craft snares opens up an interesting tactical option with a fairly minor investment. Unfortunately you won&#8217;t be setting Snares in combat, but you can still use them in ambushes and to protect yourself while resting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character-build\">Character Build<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Rangers get access to snare-related feats, but other classes will need to explore the Snarecrafter archetype.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kobold\">Kobold<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Kobolds have racial feats which directly complement snare builds.

Hopefully you&#8217;ll never need this,\n\t\tbut at low levels when you can&#8217;t afford to place a Snare every round this\n\t\tcan keep you from wasting a Snare because its current position isn&#8217;t working\n\t\tout like you hoped.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=506\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snare Specialist<\/a>: The second most important feat, behind only Snare Crafting. You get a\n\t\tbunch of new formulas, and you get to prepare a number of snares per day\n\t\twithout paying the materials costs, allowing you to use your highest-level\n\t\tSnares without constantly sweating over the price. You get to Craft these\n\t\tSnares in 3 Actions rather than the full 1-minute crafting time, making it\n\t\tpossible to use them in combat, and you get additional free Snares as your\n\t\tProficiency in Crafting increases. Notably you must <em>prepare<\/em> these\n\t\tsnares ahead of time, so much like preparing spells you need to pick which\n\t\tones you&#8217;re preparing when you perform your Daily Preparations.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=509\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quick Snares<\/a>: Craft all Snares in three Actions.

It will later become obsolete when Lightning Snares\n\t\tbecomes avaialable, so plan to retrain it.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"8\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Feats.aspx?ID=516\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Powerful Snares<\/a>: This makes low-level Snares reliable at any level, allowing you to use a\n\t\tmuch more diverse set of Snares without sacrificing effectiveness.

Snare Specialist removes the cost to\n\t\tCraft the Snare, but doesn&#8217;t remove the additional Crafting Requirement. If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re a Snare enthusiast you&#8217;re likely good enough at Crafting that alchemy\n\t\tis an option, so that might not be a problem. If you have the Powerful\n\t\tSnares feat, this can be an effective way to deliver higher-level alchemical\n\t\tbombs.

The one improvement is\n\t\tthat on a Critical Failure on the save, the target is immobilized. For the\n\t\tsame gp price you could use a Grasping Snare and a Striking Snare and still\n\t\thave 50 gp left over. The advantages that Snagging Hook Snare has over\n\t\tthat combination is that you can place one snare faster than two, and many\n\t\tfeats will give you free Snares, so if free snares are an option, Snagging Hook\n\t\tSnare is a good choice, but I wouldn&#8217;t spend gold to craft this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12th-level\">12th-Level Snares<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=330\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bleeding Spines Snare<\/a>: The initial damage is less than Striking Snare, but if the persistent\n\t\tbleed damage applies even once it&#8217;s more damage than Striking Snare. Beyond\n\t\tthat, this remains in place for a full minute rather than breaking\n\t\timmediately.

Creatures which\n\t\tfail the initial save need to spend Actions to either Escape or to attack\n\t\tthe cage and destroy it. Of course, at this level enemies can smash through\n\t\tthe cage in one or two attacks, and creatures high enough level to threaten\n\t\tyou will have bonuses on their Escape check which are high enough that they\n\t\tcan reliably escape. On top of that, if you&#8217;ve taken Powerful Snares,\n\t\tlow-level options like Grasping Snare can immobilize creatures with the same\n\t\tsave DC at less than one tenth the gp cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"16th-level\">16th-Level Snares<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Equipment.aspx?ID=335\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hail of Arrows Snare<\/a>: A bunch of damage in a 20-foot radius.

You can move\n\t\tthe wheel 60 feet with one Action, so creatures will often need to take more\n\t\tthan one Stride to get out of range. Creatures can also attack the wheel to\n\t\tdestroy it, but it has 200 hit points so that&#8217;s going to take a lot of time\n\t\tthat your enemies could be spending attacking you instead. If they attack\n\t\tthe wheel, you win because they&#8217;re wasting time attacking a disposable\n\t\tresource. If they run, they waste Actions running.

It does as\n\t\tmuch damage as three hits from Flying Blade Wheel Snare, and in many cases\n\t\tdealing less total damage but dealing it all at once is better than more\n\t\ttotal damage dealt over time because you might kill the target faster and\n\t\tprevent them from harming you in return, not to mention the Actions that\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not spending to repeatedly activate the wheel.
