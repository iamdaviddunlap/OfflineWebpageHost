A dedicated Blast and Striker, the Warmage forgoes all subtlety in favor of blowing stuff up and dealing piles of d6&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>To be completely honest, the Warmage is a bad class. Its damage output is trivially higher than a Sorcerer, and the ability to equip armor can be easily replicated by a variety of other classes. In order to improve the warmage, look for ways to expand your spell list: Arcane Disciple, items like Runestaves, and classes like the Rainbow Servant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#class-features\">Warmage Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#runestaves\">Runestaves<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which tend to be more consistent than 3.5 handbooks. Because so little of 3.5 is available on the SRD, I will attempt to tag items with a superscript indicating their book of origin. For help identifying sourcebook abbreviations, see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/abbreviations\">Sourcebook Abbreviations Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I generally omit campaign-setting specific content. I am of the opinion that those options are intended to be limited to campaigns run in those settings, and as such they don&#8217;t really apply to a generic campaign. Those options also tend to be wildly unbalanced and rarely receive errata. I also omit the use of &#8220;Flaws&#8221; since they allow a massive increase in power with essentially no cost to the character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Warmage Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: With d6 hit points the Warmage can&#8217;t take many hits, but it&#8217;s a bit better than the Wizard.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: 1\/2 BAB, but BAB doesn&#8217;t really matter. The few attacks which the Warmage will make will be touch attacks.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Saves<\/span>: Will is the Warmage&#8217;s only good save, and with no major dependencies on Dexterity or Constitution you will need to make a point to boost your bad saves..\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple weapons give the warmage some nice backup options when you run low on spells, and access to light armor and light shields will give you a better AC than most arcane spellcasters. Armored Mage allows the Warmage to cast spells unhindered, and at level 8 the Warmage can move up to medium armor.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: 2+ skill ranks, and a very thin skill list. The Warmage needs a bit of Intelligence for Warmage Edge, but 12 Intelligence will get you all of the Warmage&#8217;s interesting skills.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Spells<\/span>: The Warmage is a Charisma-based spontaneous caster, similar to the Sorcerer. However, unlike the Sorcerer, the Warmage&#8217;s spell list is limited to a very small set of offensive spells.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Armored Mage<\/span> (Ex): Wearing armor and shields while casting spells will give you a somewhat survivable AC.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Warmage Edge<\/span> (Ex): This bonus is nice at very low levels, but it will be quickly eclipsed by caster-level based damage. It is the Warmage&#8217;s only ability which depends on Intelligence, so it&#8217;s hard to justify putting a lot of resources into boosting Intelligence. It&#8217;s especially nice at first level because it makes cantrips do respectable damage.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Advanced Learning<\/span> (Ex): Limited to Evocation spells, but this opens up a lot of fantastic spells which aren&#8217;t on the Warmage spell list. This is especially nice because the Warmage got no new spells added to their spell list after Complete Arcane was published.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Sudden Empower<\/span>: 50% more damage for free once per day.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Sudden Enlarge<\/span>: Frequently mistaken for Widen spell. Enlarge improves a spell&#8217;s range. Very few spells have range problems, which makes this very situational.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Sudden Widen<\/span>: Excellent for high level spells with small areas of effect.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Sudden Maximize<\/span>: Maximum damage always feels good.\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alternate-class-features\">Alternate Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eclectic Learning<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: The warmage really needs access to non-blaster spells like Fly to stay relevant at high levels. Casting spells a full spell level behind everyone else is painful, but the added versatility is fantastic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Warmage&#8217;s abilities largely resemble a Sorcerer; strong emphasis on Charisma, and the rest is mostly focused on survivability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Essential for saves, AC, and ranged touch attacks.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points are crucial.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Take a bit for Warmage Edge, but don&#8217;t bend over backwards to improve it. The damage bonus is fairly small.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Take a bit for Will saves.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span>: The Warmage&#8217;s spellcasting ability.\n\n<h3 id=\"races\">Races<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonuses to Charisma are are incredibly rare, so look for other bonuses. Dexterity is nice, and small size is always good for strict spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Dwarf<\/span>: The penalty to Charisma really hurts, but the defensive abilities are tempting.\n\n<span class=\"rating-orange\">Elf<\/span>: The bonus to Dexterity is nice, but the penalty to Constitution is annoying.\n\n<span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: A bonus to Constitution adds some survivability, and the penalty to Strength doesn&#8217;t matter. The Gnome&#8217;s other abilities are largely wasted on the Warmage.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Awful.\n\n<span class=\"rating-red\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Penalties to both Intelligence and Charisma.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Halfling<\/span>: Small size and a bonus to Dexterity make the Halfling great with rays and ranged touch attacks.\n\n<span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: A bonus feat is always welcome.\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Concentration<\/span> (con): Essential for almost any spellcaster.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Intimidate<\/span> (cha): The Warmage has the Charisma to be a Face, but lacks access to Bluff and Diplomacy.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knowledge (Arcana)<\/span> (int): One of the most important Knowledge skills.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Knowledge (History)<\/span> (int): Situational.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcraft<\/span> (int): Great for identifying spells.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This section does not cover metamagic feats. For help with metamagic, see my <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd35\/characters\/metamagic\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2279\">Practical Guide to Metamagic<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Mastery<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Spell Resistance can really shut down a Warmage, so the ability to reliably overcome spell resistance can be very helpful. Typically enemies will have spell resistance somewhere around 8+CR, which means that Arcane Mastery allows you to constantly overcome the SR of any enemy up to 2 CR&#8217;s above your level.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Battle Caster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Lets you upgrade to medium armor, heavy armor if you&#8217;re 8th-level or higher.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Edge<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Tempting at a glance, but the damage bonus is pitiful.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Slot<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: The Warmage is a spontaneous caster, so you get plenty of spell slots per day.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: The Warmage&#8217;s spell list is very short, so you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems learning all of the worthwhile spells. Some people interpret this feat to let you learn any spell from any spell list so long as it fits the spell level requirements, but I cosnider that a very dubious interpretation of the rules. Check with your DM.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge Devotion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CC<\/a><\/sup>: Normally reserved for melee classes, Knowledge Devotion can be a great option for Warmages who depend on rays and touch attacks, and the bonus class skill can be helpful for qualifying for prestige classes.<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-blue\">Obtain Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Familiars are fantastic. Check out my <a href=\"\/dnd35\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spell-Linked Familiar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB2<\/a><\/sup>: Allows your familiar to cast cantrips and 1st and 2nd-level spells, effectively making them a small turret.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Piercing Evocation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CM<\/a><\/sup>: Most of the Warmage&#8217;s damage output is energy damage, so ignoring 10 points of resistance allows you to keep using your favorite spells with less concern for energy types. Of course, Warmages also have several damage spells which fall under Conjuration, so they won&#8217;t be covered.<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-green\">Spell Penetration<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Spell resistance becomes very common at high levels, but Arcane Mastery is more reliable.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spell Penetration<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Arcane Master and Spell Penetration should allow you to always overcome the SR of any enemy you could expect to encounter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Versatile Spellcaster<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">RotD<\/a><\/sup>: Allows you to use your lower level spell slots to cast your higher level spells. Not always useful, but it can make it much easier to reuse your best spells.<\/li>\n \t<li> <span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Focus (Ranged Spell \/ Touch Spell)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Nice for touch spells and rays, but you shouldn&#8217;t have any trouble hitting with touch attacks.\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon Specialization (Ranged Spell \/ Touch Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">CAr<\/a><\/sup>: Not a ton of damage, but in theory you can apply the bonus to each ray of Scorching Ray, which adds up quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Crossbow<\/span>: Helpful when your spells run low at low levels.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Halfspear<\/span>: Commonly pictured with warmages and Sorcerers, but totally useless.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Armor is presented in the order in which you should acquire it, rather than alphabetical order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Studded Leather<\/span>: Starting armor.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Light Shield<\/span>: Starting armor if you want a shield, but you probably want two hands to use a crossbow. Once you have enough spell slots that you don&#8217;t want a crossbow, the light shield is essentially the same as a buckler because it still allows you to hold items in your shield hand.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chain Shirt<\/span>: Permanent armor. Consider upgrading to Mithral if you have a lot of Dexterity, but it&#8217;s not essential.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"runestaves\">Runestaves<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Introduced in the Magic Item Compendium, runestaves are a fantastic supplement to any spontaneous caster&#8217;s spell list. Many runestaves offer utility options which will make nice improvements to the Warmage&#8217;s spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wondrous-items\">Wondrous Items<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Charisma<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Essential.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ioun Stone (Orange)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: A +1 to caster level means a lot of extra damage from your spells. Expensive, but a very worthwhile investment at high levels.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Vest of Resistance is identical and takes up a much less useful slot.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Metamagic Rods<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">PHB\/MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Metamagic is a great choice for many casters, but some metamagic feats aren&#8217;t useful enough to justify spending a feat on them.<\/li>\n \t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vest of Resistance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd35\/abbreviations\/\">MIC<\/a><\/sup>: Same cost as a cloak, and takes up the largely useless &#8220;torso&#8221; slot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3
