The ability to customize spells on the fly makes it easy to adapt your spellcasting to the needs of the moment and to maximize the effect of your favorite spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Sorcerer&#8217;s spell list allows them to serve as a Blaster, Controller, Striker, and Utility Caster, and sorcerers make one of the easiest Faces in the game due to their skill list and their dependence on Charisma. The Divine Soul subclass also adds Healer to the class&#8217;s possible roles. Which of those roles you emphasize depends almost entirely on your choice of spells and on the spells provided by your subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Sorcerer lacks the versatility of a Wizard due to their limited number of prepared spells, but share many of the same capabilities and many of the same spells. Where the Wizard is powerful because they have a tool for every problem, the Sorcerer is powerful because they own a few good tools and can use them to fix any problem. The Sorcerer gets more spell slots than the Warlock, allowing them to focus more on leveled spells than the Warlock, who must use them sparingly and rely heavily on cantrips and Invocations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 DnD rules.

That means\n\tthat Concentration spells are easier to maintain without investing in options\n\tlike the War Caster feat.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Proficiencies<\/span>: No armor or shields, and\n\tonly the most basic weapons, but the Sorcerer skill list contains\n\t<em>all<\/em> of the Face skills, including Insight.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Sorcerer&#8217;s spells are numerous and versatile. They get full spellcasting. When combined with the Sorcerer&#8217;s other class features, you can do a lot of unique things with your spells which are entirely unavailable to other spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Innate Sorcery<\/span>: A small, but meaningful boost to your offensive spells. This is as impactful as +2 to your Charisma, and it will give you a numerical edge that no one else can match until Epic Boons become available. Save this for important fights, and use it as soon as you possibly can to maximize the benefits. You only get 2 uses per Long Rest until you get Sorcery Incarnate at level 7, and then it costs 2 Sorcery Points to use Innate Sorcery again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Font of Magic<\/span>: Font of Magic is a defining\n\tfeature for the Sorcerer. Sorcery Points provide a secondary resource pool which you can use to make your spellcasting even more impactful.<\/p\n>\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sorcery Points<\/span>: Sorcery points fuel the\n\t\tSorcerer&#8217;s abilities and allow the class to do much more than just casting\n\t\tspells. You have a limited pool per day, but you have the option of\n\t\tconsuming spell slots to get additional Sorcery Points. This pool is fairly\n\t\tlimited, so budgeting your Sorcery Points is crucial. If you need more, look\n\t\tat the Metamagic Adept feat and items like the Bloodwell Vial.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Flexible Casting<\/span>: Using Sorcery Points to\n\t\tget additional spell slots is very expensive, so only do it when you\n\t\tabsolutely need to do so. Converting spell slots to Sorcery Points is a bit\n\t\tless daunting once you have a large pool of spell slots, but be sure not to\n\t\tdo it too much or you will quickly run out of daily resources. That said, it can be very effective to turn a bunch of Sorcery Points\n\t\tinto level 1 spell slots to fuel Absorb Elements and Shield.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic<\/span>: Metamagic allows you to stretch\n\tthe effects of your limited number of prepared spells, allowing you to easily\n\tcapitalize on existing spells instead of constantly needing to find and learn\n\tnew ones. Metamagic should consume the bulk of your Sorcery Points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You gain 2 Metamagic options at level 2, 10, and 17, for a total of 6. The Metamagic Adept feat can add two more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Sorcerer subclasses are briefly summarized below.

This adds some very important sustainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>7. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Sorcery Incarnate<\/span>: The ability to use Innate Sorcery again is great. The Sorcery Point cost is modest, but you still shouldn&#8217;t rush to use Innate Sorcery in every encounter since points are so valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using two Metamagic options on one spell is massive. Of course, it&#8217;s also very expensive. You can&#8217;t afford to use this on every spell, or you&#8217;ll be out of points by the end of your first encounter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>20. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Apotheosis<\/span>: Absolutely amazing. With this, spending 2 Sorcery Points to use Innate Sorcery is actually a discount compared to using Metamagic normally. Remember that you can also use two Metamagic options on each spell, so be sure that the more expensive of your two choices is the one that you don&#8217;t pay for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-sorcerer-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Sorcerer Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sorcerer\u2019s too-small pool of spells known has been expanded, and the new Innate Sorcery feature offers some cool new things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Spellcasting. Sorcerers now know\/prepare considerably more spells than in the 2014 rules. The cap has been raised from 15 to 22. Also now allows you to change a cantrip when you gain a Sorcerer level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Innate Sorcery. New. Spend a Bonus Action to be really good at offensive spells for 1 minute.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Metamagic. Largely minor mechanical improvements and clarification of wording.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Careful Spell. Protected creatures now take no damage if the spell would deal half damage on a successful save. This was an odd and frustrating omission from the 2014 version.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extended Spell. Now also gives you Advantage on saves to maintain Concentration on the affected spell.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heightened Spell. Cost reduced from 3 to 2, and the target now suffers Disadvantage on <em>all<\/em> saves against the spell. A massive upgrade from the 2014 version, and I already thought this was one of the best options.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quickened Spell. No functional change, but the text is extremely explicit that you still only get one leveled spell per turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seeking Spell. Cost reduced from 2 to 1, and you can now use it on a spell which is already affected by another Metamagic.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Subtle Spell. Now also omits material components if they\u2019re not consumed by the spell and don\u2019t have a specified cost.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Twinned Spell. Completely reworked. Now only works with spells that add more targets when cast at a higher level, and costs 1 point to add 1 more target. No more twinned Haste. Look how they massacred my boy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Sorcerous Restoration. New. Once per Long Rest, restore some Sorcery Points on a Short Rest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>7. Sorcery Incarnate. Spend 2 Sorcery Points to activate Innate Sorcery, and when Innate Sorcery is running you can add two Metamagic effects to the same spell. Similar to the 2014 Sorcerous Restoration capstone feature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Arcane Apotheosis. New. While Innate Sorcery is running, use Metamagic once for free each turn. This is an awesome capstone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Sorcerer Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An increase to Charisma is too crucial to forego, so any Background which\n\tdoesn&#8217;t include Charisma is immediately out.

Proficiency in medium armor, shields, and\n\t\tConstitution saving throws are really tempting (though the Sorcerer already\n\t\tgets proficiency in Constitution saves, so that&#8217;s not as appealing for the\n\t\tSorcerer as it is for the Warlock and the Wizard), plus artificers get\n\t\taccess to some low-level spells which the Sorcerer doesn&#8217;t, like Cure Wounds.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bard<\/span>: More Charisma-based spellcasting is nice, and the Bard gets access to both Cure Wounds and Healing Word. Two levels gets your Expertise, which is very tempting, but may not be necessary if you prepare Enhance Ability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cleric<\/span>: A single level for proficiency in heavy armor and shields, and there are plenty of level 1 Cleric spells which don&#8217;t care if your Wisdom is relatively poor.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: Starting with 1 level in Fighter gets you heavy armor, shields, a Fighting Style (pick Defense for the AC bonus), Weapon Mastery to make True Strike more effective, and you don&#8217;t give up proficiency in Constitution saves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Paladin<\/span>: Despite having some dependence on Charisma, the Paladin doesn&#8217;t offer the Sorcerer as much as the Fighter does.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue<\/span>: Expertise would be nice for your\n\t\tFace skills, and Cunning Action gives you a great way to get out of melee.<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Warlock<\/span>: Two levels for Eldritch Blast and Agonizing Blast gives you a powerful and reliable offensive cantrip. Pact Magic Slots can be used to create Sorcery Points, and they recharge on a Short Rest, but you&#8217;ll get more out of advancing your Sorcerer levels to get higher-level spell slots sooner.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Born or imbued with an innate source of magical power, DnD 5e&#8217;s Sorcerer is a powerful arcane spellcaster able to twist and manipulate their spells via Metamagic and empower themselves with Innate Sorcery.
