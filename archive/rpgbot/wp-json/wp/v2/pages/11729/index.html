Dexterity increases are crucial, and increases to Constitution and Wisdom are helpful. Things get even more complicated with a Strength-based build because rangers only get medium armor proficiency so you also need 14 Dexterity. It&#8217;s absolutely crucial that your race supports your ability score needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re going for a melee build, look for things that improve your durability like Constitution increases and damage resistances. Rangers get d10 hit points and can cast some healing spells, but rangers are not as durable as the Fighter and can&#8217;t heal as well as the Paladin, so you either need to make up the difference in durability or play like a bit like a rogue does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re going for a ranged build, you have more space to explore things like flight and innate spellcasting. Non-magical flight is spectacular for any ranged build, and innate spellcasting can offer some options which go beyond the Ranger&#8217;s limited spell list and small pool of spell slots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re in a small party or if you&#8217;re playing your party&#8217;s Rogue-equivalent, look for additional skill proficiencies. Rangers get three skills and with the Canny Optional Class Feature they get Expertise in one thing, which is good but not enough to match a rogue, so races with extra skill proficiencies bring the Ranger closer to the Rogue&#8217;s skill capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2665\">Ranger Handbook<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Ranger Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dragonmarks\">Dragonmarks<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#lineages\">Lineages<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filter-controls\">Filter Controls<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"app-root\">\n\t<p>Filter controls are loading.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/js\/dnd5RacesPageFilters.js?version=12\"><\/script>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Ranger Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that not all races will be available in every game.

While the Custom Lineage isn&#8217;t affected by your base race, the three lineages published in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft (Dhampir, Hexblade, and Reborn) borrow from your base race thanks to the Ancestral Legacy trait.
