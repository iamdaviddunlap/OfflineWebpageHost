Your best bet is to\n\t\t\t\t\tuse the mobility in combination with grappling the Push Weapon Mastery\n\t\t\t\t\tto force enemies into dangerous positions, such as in a tight group,\n\t\t\t\t\tso that allied spellcasters can hit them with area damage.

This will go an unusually long way when combined\n\t\t\t\twith the damage resistance from Rage, but you should only expect the THP\n\t\t\t\tto absorb 1 or 2 attacks per Rage, especially at low levels.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Life-Giving Force<\/span>: A huge amount of\n\t\t\t\tTemporary Hit Points, but you can&#8217;t use them on yourself, you may not be\n\t\t\t\table to apply them consistently in combat, and they expire when your\n\t\t\t\tRage ends. Fortunately, Rage has a 10-minute duration, so you and your\n\t\t\t\tparty can stand around for a few turns feeling generally angry while you\n\t\t\t\tpass out THP.\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>Since you apply this at the start of your turn while Raging, you\n\t\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t be able to use this until the turn after you Rage. Combat\n\t\t\t\t\ttypically lasts 3 turns, so, if you Rage on turn 1, you might get to\n\t\t\t\t\tapply the THP twice in an encounter, and the points may not last long\n\t\t\t\t\tenough to have an effect. Allies need to be within 10 feet of you for\n\t\t\t\t\tyou to target them, so encourage them to end their turns nearby. You\n\t\t\t\t\tcan use Branches of the Tree to teleport them to you if necessary, but\n\t\t\t\t\tthat occurs at the beginning of their turn, so they may be able to\n\t\t\t\t\twalk to you without eating your Reaction.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t<p\n\t\t\t\t\t>This amount of temporary hp is typically expensive and requires feats\n\t\t\t\t\tlike Inspiring Leader or upcasting spells like False Life. With the\n\t\t\t\t\tdurability provided by this, you can protect relatively frail allies\n\t\t\t\t\tlike horses and familiars which otherwise become a liability early in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe game since their hp doesn&#8217;t scale. You might even try mounted\n\t\t\t\t\tcombat.<\/p\n\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Branches of the Tree<\/span>: The obvious use here\n\t\tis to pull enemies adjacent to you and reduce their speed to 0, usually\n\t\tforcing them to spend their turn there. This can usually put your allies out\n\t\tof harm&#8217;s way, and if your target resorts to ranged attacks, they&#8217;ll make\n\t\tthem at Disadvantage since they&#8217;re in your reach.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can also use this to help allies. Creatures can choose to willingly\n\t\t\tfail saving throws, and reducing the target&#8217;s speed to 0 is optional, so\n\t\t\tyou can teleport allies out of dangerous positions, then let them spend\n\t\t\tthe rest of their turn doing whatever they like.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you can fly, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from using Branches of the Tree\n\t\t\twhile airborn. This is dangerous for non-flying enemies because you can hit\n\t\t\tthem with easy falling damage, but the ability to reduce flying enemies&#8217; speed\n\t\t\tto 0 means that you can force them to fall, too, giving you an easy counter to\n\t\t\tenemies which might otherwise be difficult to hold in place. Once enemies have\nfallen, you&#8217;ve reduced their speed to 0, which prevents them from standing for the rest of the turn.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battering Roots<\/span>: A World Tree Barbarian\n\t\twith a Reach weapon like a glaive can attack out to 20 feet, allowing you to\n\t\treach enemies over a huge area. Adding the Push and Topple masteries also\n\t\tdiversifies your tactical options quite a bit. If you&#8217;re using a Push or\n\t\tTopple weapon, now&#8217;s the time to switch. Note that you only get the extra\n\t\tmastery options with Heavy\/Versatile weapons, so you may still want to throw\n\t\ttridents to deal with enemies more than 20 feet away.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that the extended reach only applies on your own turn. It does\n\t\t\tnot allow you to make Opportunity Attacks at crazy distances unless you\n\t\t\tsomehow cause a creature to move during your own turn.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Travel Along the Tree<\/span>: 60 feet is a\n\t\twonderful amount of teleportation. Combined with Battering Roots and just\n\t\tplain walking, almost no enemy is out of reach. You may even be able to\n\t\tteleport into the air to grapple flying enemies. Remember that you can use this\nas part of the Bonus Action to activate Rage.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The group teleportation option won&#8217;t be consistently useful, but using it\n\t\t\tto teleport into combat and ambush your enemies can be very effective. You\n\t\t\tneed to be able to see the target location, and the range isn&#8217;t fantastic,\n\t\t\tbut seeing through a keyhole, a crack underneath a door, or through a\n\t\t\twindow all qualify.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"totem\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Path of the Zealot<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Path of the Zealot tries to be an unstoppably durable Striker, but it does less damage than the Berserker, and it&#8217;s not significantly more durable than any other Barbarian. The Zealot&#8217;s only truly unique features, Zealous Presence and Rage of the Gods, don&#8217;t come online until high levels, and they&#8217;re not worth the wait.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Fury<\/span>: A large and consistent damage\n\t\tboost. You only get to use this once one each of your turns (you can&#8217;t use\n\t\tit outside of your own turn), so, if you&#8217;re using Reckless Attack, you likely\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need to scramble for additional attack attempts to guarantee that\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll deal this damage reliably. Resistance to Necrotic and Radiant damage\n\t\tis rare, and resistance to both is almost non-existent.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warrior of the Gods<\/span>: A small amount of\n\t\tadditional durability. There is no reason to split this up over multiple\n\t\tuses, so reserve it for when you&#8217;re in a bad situation and heal yourself as\n\t\tmuch as possible all at once.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fanatical Focus<\/span>: Excellent for\n\t\tsave-or-suck effects, and, since it works once per Rage, you get to use it\n\t\tnumerous times in a single day. Rerolls are fantastic, but often put you in\n\t\tthe position of rerolling a save with a poor modifier that you&#8217;re still\n\t\tgoing to fail. Adding your Rage damage bonus means that your chances to\n\t\tsucceed on the reroll are a bit better. Unfortunately, save DC&#8217;s scale\n\t\tfaster than the Rage damage bonus, so this won&#8217;t make it significantly\n\t\teasier to pass saves targeting your worst saving throw modifiers.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Zealous Presence<\/span>: Advantage on all attacks and saves for a round can be impactful, but it only lasts for one round, it does&#8217;t affect you, and you only get to use it once per day unless you spend a Rage to use it again.&#8221;\n<p>This gets more useful the larger your\n\t\tparty is, so encourage your allies to summon creatures, use pets, etc. If\n\t\tyour allies happen to also need to make saves, we can consider that a bonus\n\t\tas the main purpose of this ability is the Advantage on attack rolls. It&#8217;s\n\t\tdifficult to time abilities like this to protect allies from effects which\n\t\tcall for saving throws.<\/p>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Despite how potentially powerful this is, it has a ton of problems. If\n\t\t\tyou want to grant allies Advantage on attacks, you can knock enemies\n\t\t\tprone with unarmed strikes or a Topple weapon, or you can restrain them\n\t\t\twith a net. Neither of those options have daily resource limits. Providing\n\t\t\tAdvantage on saves is much harder, but it&#8217;s also much less likely to take\n\t\t\teffect than the Advantage on attacks. On top of that,\n\t\t\t<em>this doesn&#8217;t affect you<\/em>. You&#8217;re using this purely to buff your\n\t\t\tallies. Is a replaceable 1-round buff really as impactful as 10 minutes of\n\t\t\tRage? Probably not.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Rage of the Gods<\/span>: This lasts for 1 minute\n\t\tonce per day, and you must choose to use it when you Rage, so you can&#8217;t walk\n\t\taround with Rage running to save yourself a Bonus Action like other\n\t\tBarbarians can.
