The extra attack\n\t\t\t\talso gives you another chance to apply the bonus damage from Planar\n\t\t\t\tWarrior. You might look at Haste&#8217;s additional action alongside Distant\nStrike and think that you can trigger Distant Strike&#8217;s additional attack twice. You do get the teleportation,\nbut since you only make one attack there&#8217;s no way to attack two creatures to get the extra attack.\nIt&#8217;s often more efficient to cast Elemental Weapon if all you care about is damage output, but Haste also provides movement and defensive buffs which you might want.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">13th-Level<\/span>: A wonderful spell, but\n\t\t\t\tyou likely don&#8217;t have the Wisdom to back it up with a decent spell DC\n\t\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re built around Druidic Warrior, which is a poor choice for the Horizon Walker.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">17th-Level<\/span>: One of the safest and\n\t\t\t\teasiest ways to transport your entire party long distances, but full casters\nhave been casting this since level 9.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Portal<\/span>: Situational. In most\n\t\tgames this won&#8217;t matter much, but in a plane-hopping campaign it could be\n\t\textremely useful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Planar Warrior<\/span>: Since this consumes your\n\t\tBonus Action, two-weapon fighting and other sources of bonus action attacks\n\t\tlike Crossbow Expert generally won&#8217;t work well for you, and the damage boost from Hunter&#8217;s Mark is rarely worth the spell slot and action cost to cast or re-target it. Despite shaking up much of the typical ranger build strategy, the benefits are excellent.\n\t\tBonus damage, and weapon damage on the affected attack all becomes force\n\t\tdamage (which is resisted by almost nothing). It only works once per turn,\n\t\tso you may be able to do more total damage by investing heavily in two-weapon fighting or\n\t\ttaking Crossbow Expert, but this is free, it scales on its own at level 11,\n\t\tand without the need for two-weapon fighting, melee rangers can easily\n\t\tjustify using a shield.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ethereal Step<\/span>: One round is frequently all\n\t\tyou need. Walk through walls or doors or slip past enemies (including those\n\t\twhich have Blindsight or can see invisibility). Etherealness even lets you\n\t\tmove upward or downward, allowing you to move through floors and ceilings\n\t\t(albeit at half the rate as moving horizontally).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Distant Strike<\/span>: The teleportation is on\n\t\ttop of your normal movement. If you have two enemies to attack in a small\n\t\tenough area, you could teleport back and forth between the two while\n\t\tattacking in order to trigger the additional attack from Distant Strike.\n\t\tThis isn&#8217;t limited to melee, so this gets much easier with ranged weapons,\n\t\tallowing you to teleport out of melee before attacking multiple targets, and then easily\n\t\ttriggering the additional attack.\n<p>You\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need to hit both targets, so think of the additional attack from Distant\n\t\tStrike as a free attack against a different enemy while you&#8217;re busy\n\t\tfocusing on your primary target.<\/p?\n\t\t<p>Consider casting Haste before you jump into combat. The additional attack\n\t\t\tprovided by Haste is an Attack action, so it qualifies for triggering Distant\n\t\t\tStrike&#8217;s teleportation (though not another free attack since the Haste action\nonly gets you one attack), allowing you to teleport and attack four times (2 from Extra\n\t\t\tAttack, one from Haste, one from Distant Strike) in a turn without using\n\t\t\tyour bonus action. You can still use your Bonus Action to engage in\n\t\t\ttwo-weapon fighting, but it won&#8217;t trigger the teleportation because it&#8217;s\n\t\t\tnot part of the Attack action.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spectral Defense<\/span>: You don&#8217;t need to use\n\t\tthis until you get hit, so if your AC is decent and you manage to avoid\n\t\tdrawing too many attacks, this can prevent a ton of damage. Spectral Defense\n\t\tworks against all forms of attacks, including spell attacks, but since it\n\t\tgives you resistance to the damage it won&#8217;t stack with any other\n\t\tresistances. This isn&#8217;t quite as good as Uncanny Dodge (which halves the\n\t\tdamage rather than granting Resistance to it), but it&#8217;s close.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"horizon-walker-ranger-ability-scores\">Horizon Walker Ranger Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">typical rangers<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"horizon-walker-ranger-races\">Horizon Walker Ranger Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Little different from <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/#races\" data-type=\"page\">typical rangers<\/a>.

So against big single enemies, Hunter&#8217;s Mark is worthwhile. If there are two or more enemies, Planar Warrior and Favored Foe will do just fine because you won&#8217;t need to spend a Bonus Action to change targets.<br><br>We should also revisit Ensnaring Strike when we&#8217;re looking at big single enemies: <br><br>DPR with Musket: 16.4<br>DPR w\/advantage with Musket+Planar Warrior: 27.01 + 3.5 ongoing<br><br>Against big single foes, Hunter&#8217;s Mark beats Ensnaring Strike by ~2 damage over our first two turns, then Ensnaring Strike Catches up on turn 3. If you have allies who can benefit from your target being Restrained, Ensnaring Strike is easily the better option.<br><br>2nd-level spells also means that we can upcast Ensnaring Strike for more ongoing damage, but it&#8217;s rarely worth the cost. We&#8217;re here for the status condition. We can also learn Misty Step to get us out of grapples or anything else that we couldn&#8217;t walk out of with Zephyr Strike.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Favored Foe (1d6)<br>Roving<\/td><td>Improving Favored Foe&#8217;s damage boost changes our math a bit, but doesn&#8217;t change our tactics significantly. Hunter&#8217;s Mark still beats Favored Foe against single targets by about 3 damage over the course of 3 turns, which likely isn&#8217;t worth the spell slot.<br><br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior: 21.38<br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+Favored Foe: 25.24<br>DPR with Musket+Hunter&#8217;s Mark: 22.0<br>DPR with Musket+Hunter&#8217;s Mark+Planar Warrior: 26.97<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Ethereal Step<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Enhance Ability<\/td><td>Ethereal Step lets you move through a wall, a door, etc. once per rest.

Elemental Weapon gives us bonuses to both attack and damage, and crucially it lasts an hour without needing to spend a Bonus Action to change targets. That means that in many encounters we can pre-cast it and walk into combat ready to use Planar Warrior every turn.<br><br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+Elemental Weapon: 28.40<br><br>That&#8217;s nearly as much damage as using Hunter&#8217;s Mark does on turn 2, and we don&#8217;t have to reassign it and we don&#8217;t lose damage output on turn 1. Elemental Weapon+Planar Warrior is clearly our best option in terms of our damage output. Ensnaring Strike may still outdo Elemental Weapon against single targets, provided that our allies can capitalize on it.<br><br>We also get the option to learn Haste from Horizon Walker Magic. With a duration of just 1 minute, you&#8217;re likely going to cast it in combat. It does raise our DPR to 34.29, but giving up a turn worth of attacking to do it isn&#8217;t helpful.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Hide in Plain Sight<br>Tireless<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Distant Strike<br>Planar Warrior (2d8)<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211;<\/td><td>Distant Strike is the reason we&#8217;re built to fight at range, and it changes our tactics quite a bit. The 10-foot teleportation can get us between targets in close quarters, but if enemies are too far apart, we may need to risk an opportunity attack to enable the additional attack. Using a ranged weapon neatly solves that problem, and we can use the teleportation to get out of melee before attacking.<br><br>In addition to the third attack, we also get an improvement to Planar Warrior. At this point we have 3 3rd-level spell slots, so running Elemental Weapon in every encounter is not only possible, but expected.<br><br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+Elemental Weapon+Bonus Attack from Planar Warrior: 40.66<br><br>This brings us into the &#8220;High DPR&#8221; range and we stay there until we hit level 20.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Sharpshooter<\/td><td>Now we&#8217;re going to ask a scary question: Should we use Sharpshooter? We&#8217;ve been enjoying hitting on a 5 since we started to use Elemental Weapon, and changing that to hitting on a 10 is big hit.<br><br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+Elemental Weapon+Bonus Attack from Distant Strike+Sharpshooter: 46.17<br><br>The fear with Sharpshooter is that the attack penalty will make it hard to apply Planar Warrior, but with three attacks we still have an 88% chance to hit once per turn and therefore apply the damage bonus.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>4th-level spells. Our spell options aren&#8217;t great, but we can upcast Magic Weapon to get +2 attack and damage, which introduces yet another potential boost to our damage output.<br><br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+Elemental Weapon+Bonus Attack from Planar Warrior: 46.38<br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+Elemental Weapon+Bonus Attack from Distant Strike+Sharpshooter: 46.89<br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+4th-level Magic Weapon+Bonus Attack from Planar Warrior: 46.90<br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+4th-level Magic Weapon+Bonus Attack from Distant Strike+Sharpshooter: 54.02<br><br>Switching from Elemental Weapon to 4th-level Magic Weapon gets us another 7.13 DPR compared to Elemental Weapon, which is quite a bit.<br><br>We don&#8217;t have any great 4th-level spell options, so we&#8217;ll use those slots exclusively for Magic Weapon.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Favored Foe (1d8)<br>Vanish<\/td><td>By this level Favored Foe is obsolete, and the larger damage die doesn&#8217;t help. It&#8217;s nice in a pinch if you don&#8217;t already have a buff running, but it&#8217;s not going to compete with Elemental Weapon or 4th-level Magic weapon.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Spectral Defense<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211;<\/td><td>Spectral Defense significantly improves our durability, but since you have both Distant Strike to get out of melee and Sharpshooter to fight at a safe distance, you likely won&#8217;t draw many attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Any<\/td><td>We can do essentially whatever we want here. Gift of the Chromatic Dragon is a good option because we can protect ourselves from damage which Spectral Defense doesn&#8217;t cover and our Proficiency Bonus is high enough that we&#8217;ll get numerous uses per day.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Teleportation Circle<\/td><td>5th-level spells. Do we use Swift Quiver? It&#8217;s a go-to option for archery builds because it fully doubles our number of attacks, but it means giving up both Magic Weapon <em>and<\/em> Planar Warrior. It also lasts just one minute compared to the full hour duration of Elemental Weapon or Magic Weapon. We can also upcast Elemental Weapon at this level for +2 to hit and +2d4 damage.<br><br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+4th-level Magic Weapon+Bonus Attack from Distant Strike+Sharpshooter: 54.02<br>DPR with Musket+Planar Warrior+5th-level Elemental Weapon+Bonus Attack from Distant Strike+Sharpshooter: 60.17<br>DPR with Musket+Swift Quiver+Bonus Attack from Distant Strike+Sharpshooter: 56.65<br><br>5th-level Elemental Weapon is the clear winner. Not only is the DPR higher, but it also lasts long enough to carry between two or three fighters.<br><br>So what do we do with our 5th-level spells? Whatever we want! Horizon Walker gives us access to Teleportation Circle, which is a fine choice.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Feral Senses<\/td><td>Probably the last feature that we care about.
