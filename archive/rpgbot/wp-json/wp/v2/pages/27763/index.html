The Druid&#8217;s spellcasting has a strong emphasis on area control spells, allowing them to shape the battlefield to their party&#8217;s advantage. By spellcaster standards, the Druid is relatively simple to play because you so rarely need to track more than one ongoing effect, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t make them less fun or less powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Druid is primarily a spellcaster, and fills a role in the party similar to the Cleric, serving primarily as a Controller, Healer, Scout, Support, and Utility caster. Subclass features can emphasize those roles or expand them to include Blaster, Defender, and Striker. Druids also have notoriously poor AC in only light armor, and with only d8 hit points they can be frail compared to similar classes like the Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Druid subclasses vary wildly in complexity. Some Druid subclasses like Circle of Spores are exceptionally hard to build and play effectively, while some subclasses like Circle of the Land are relatively simple to play. If you stick to one of the low-complexity subclasses, the Druid is among the easiest spellcaster classes to play. For new players looking to try their first spellcaster, Circle of the Land can be a great introduction to the complexities of managing spellcasters. Beyond that, the ability to turn into an animal is always a recipe for fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2024 dnD 5e rules.

Intelligence is a\n\tdump stat for Druids, so even with proficiency it won&#8217;t be a great save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple weapons, light armor, and shields.\nYou won&#8217;t be able to match the Cleric&#8217;s AC, and using weapons in any meaningful way isn&#8217;t\nan option for the vast majority of Druids. Primal Order adds medium armor and martial weapons,\nbut proficiency in martial weapons doesn&#8217;t suddenly make you good at using weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Druid&#8217;s spell list\n\tincludes a lot of really fantastic options which are only available to the\n\tDruid (and a handful which are only available to Druids and Rangers). The\n\tDruid has many of the best area control effects, like Entangle and Spike\n\tGrowth, and a lot of unique damage spells like Call Lightning. However, Druids\n lack many utility options\n\tavailable to Clerics and Wizards, and their approach to problems like raising the dead is often different from other spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <span class=\"rating-orange\">Druidic<\/span>: The ability to speak Druidic and use Druidic symbols will never matter\n\tunless your DM specifically writes something into the campaign to use it. In 10+ years of 5e, I&#8217;ve never seen Druidic symbols written into a published adventure (they might be there, but I haven&#8217;t noticed them).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having Speak With Animals prepared for free is likely more impactful. The ability to talk to local animals means that you can gather information from rats, bats, birds, bugs, and other beasts which are ubiquitous in most parts of the material plane. It&#8217;s up to your DM how useful it is for you to do so, but if your DM is willing to play along, local beasts can be a useful source of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Primal Order<\/strong>: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magician<\/span>: An additional cantrip and a huge bonus to two very important skills.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warden<\/span>: Medium armor is a nice upgrade to your AC, but what are you going to do with martial weapons? Druids don&#8217;t get Weapon Mastery or Extra Attack. Elemental Fury (Primal Strikes) provides a modest damage boost, but, just like the Cleric&#8217;s Divine Strike, it doesn&#8217;t provide enough of a damage boost to compete with unmodified cantrips. Even worse, the Druid&#8217;s best weapon options are clubs and quarterstaves thanks to Shillelagh. Literally the only reason to take Warden is medium armor. If you&#8217;re worried about AC that much, start with a level of Fighter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Shape<\/span>: Wild Shape is a fantastic utility option, but it&#8217;s only a combat option for Circle of the Moon. Other features like Wild Companion and some subclass features may use Wild Shape as a resource pool, and those uses are frequently more impactful than Wild Shape for many Druids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay careful attention to your Wild Shape forms. Much like a prepared spell, each known form is a tool in your toolbox, and you want a diverse set of tools for solving multiple problems. At low levels, even non-Moon druids might find options like the Wolf useful in combat, but that stop being useful as enemies outpace the Wolf in combat. Options like the Rat are useful for stealth in a variety of environments, and options like the Octopus and the Bat can lets you explore in a variety of environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"30915\">Wild Shape Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Companion<\/span>: A disposable familiar. Normally Find Familiar costs 10gp to cast, which deters you from throwing away your familiar at least slightly. Without that cost, and with an inexpensive renewable resource pool like Wild Shape, you can use this to summon familiars and use them with no regard for their safety. Send them to scout any even remotely dangerous environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Subclass<\/strong>: Druid subclasses are briefly summarized below. See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/2024-druid\/druid-subclasses\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28263\">Druid Subclasses Breakdown<\/a> for help selecting your subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Circle of the Land: Expand your spellcasting with powers based on specific biomes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Circle of the Moon: Turn into beasts and fight stuff.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Circle of the Sea: Summon a water-based emanation to damage and repel enemies, and eventually to let you fly and resist damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\".\/subclasses#\"><\/a>Circle of the Stars: Adopt one of three powerful modes in combat to expand your abilities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>5. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Resurgence<\/span>: This gives you a great way to manage limited resources throughout the day. For subclasses dependent on Wild Shape, turning a spell slot into a Wild Shape can dramatically expand your resource pool. For other subclasses, you can get an extra level 1 spell slot once per day. That&#8217;s obviously very lopsided, but bottomless spells from consuming Wild Shape slots would be a huge problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>7. <strong>Elemental Fury<\/strong>: Remember that your choice here locks you into your choice when you get Improved Elemental Fury at level 15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: Consistently useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Strike<\/span>: This is only useful for Circle of Spores and Circle of the Moon. Unless your subclass pushes you into making weapon attacks by giving you a good reason to do so, cantrips will consistently beat Primal Strike&#8217;s damage output with much less effort. But for Moon Druids and Spores Druids, this is a decent damage boost for things that you were going to do anyway.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>15. <strong>Improved Elemental Fury<\/strong>: Remember that your choice of Elemental Fury at level 7 locks you into your choice here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Potent Spellcasting<\/span>: Thorn Whip folks from an absurd distance away.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Primal Strike<\/span>: Another damage increase. It still won&#8217;t compete with cantrips for most druids.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>18. <span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast Spells<\/span>: For most druids, the ability to cast spells in Wild Shape allows you to use Wild Shape much more frequently in combat in order to improve your mobility. Turning into an owl or another flying beast with Flyby allows you to move in and out of melee safely, allowing you to deliver touch range spells with no risk or to get out of reach without relying on teleportation like many spellcasters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Circle of the Moon, this is even better. You could already cast your subclass spells while in Wild Shape, but this opens up your entire spell list. This presents a massive change in your tactics, so be sure to reexamine your prepared spells as soon as you get this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>20. <strong>Archdruid<\/strong>: You&#8217;ve had a much weaker version of these features since you got Wild Resurgence at level 5, but this is a massive upgrade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evergreen Wild Shape<\/span>: This means that Circle of the Moon and other subclass that depend on Wild Shape uses can&#8217;t walk into combat without their signature feature. For other subclasses it&#8217;s a nice convenience, but you&#8217;re probably fine without it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature Magician<\/span>: By this level you get 4 uses of Wild Shape per rest. If you convert all of them, you can restore a level 8 spell slot once per day. Evergreen Wild Shape will guarantee you 1 use whenever you roll initiative, so you can cast a long-running level 8 spell outside of combat, recover the spell slot, then still use Wild Shape in combat. That&#8217;s a very powerful option even for subclasses that depend on Wild Shape uses in combat, though you may still want the ability to Wild Shape multiple times in the same encounter, so you&#8217;ll need to weigh your options before you use this.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Longevity<\/span>: Almost never impacts the game, but very cool thematically.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-druid-changes-from-2014-rules\">2024 Druid Changes from 2014 Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section is from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 DnD Rules Transition Guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Weapon proficiencies are no longer a specific list; now just simple weapons, which omits scimitars. Druids have had proficiency with scimitars for as long as there have been druids, but there has rarely been a good reason for that to be the case.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Armor proficiencies no longer include medium armor, but druids have also lost the prohibition on metal armor, so if you get armor proficiency from other sources you might happily stomp around in full plate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Druidic. Now gives you Speak with Animals prepared for free. The check to spot hidden druidic messages is changed from Wisdom (Perception) to Intelligence (Investigation).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Primal Order. New. Choose an additional cantrip and the ability to add your Wisdom modifier to Arcana and Nature checks or proficiency in martial weapons and medium armor.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Spellcasting. Now allows you to change a cantrip when you gain a Druid level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Wild Shape. Big rework here.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Now a Bonus Action for everyone rather than just Circle of the Moon<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can use Wild Shape again without returning to your original form<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 uses per Long Rest at level 2, but scales to 4 per Long Rest and you recover one use per Short Rest<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Known Forms. Druids are now limited to just 4 known forms initially, scaling up to 8 at level 8. You can change one on a Long Rest, so it would take multiple days to replace all of your forms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Burrow and swim speeds are no longer restricted by level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You now gain temporary hit points instead of using a separate hp pool while in Wild Shape. Wild Shape doesn&#8217;t end when your run out of THP.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You no longer retain any racial traits, removing complicated discussions around Dragonborn Druids and their breath weapons<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Wild Companion. Functionally identical to the Optional Class Feature publishes in Tasha&#8217;s.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Wild Resurgence. A fantastic new addition. This adds a ton of sustainability to Moon Druids and Spores Druids, while also giving other Druids an extra spell slot every day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>7 and 15. Elemental Fury. Very similar to the Cleric&#8217;s Blessed Strikes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Archdruid. Big rework here.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Evergreen Wild Shape. Gain one use of Wild Shape if you\u2019re out when you roll initiative. 2014 Archdruid gave you infinite uses. This prevents you from using Wild Shape as a bottomless pool of hp, but that\u2019s already not a problem since you use your own hit points in Wild Shape.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nature Magician.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Druid Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>An increase to Wisdom is too crucial to forego, so any Background which doesn&#8217;t include Wisdom is immediately out.
