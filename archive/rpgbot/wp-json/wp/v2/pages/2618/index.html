While your race and background carry equal weight in who your character is, your class defines what your character does.

Listed below are Handbooks on each of DnD&#8217;s classes, exploring the nuances and tricks to get the most out of each. To that end we not only go over the features and options of each class, but put those ideas into practice with subclass handbooks and example builds.
