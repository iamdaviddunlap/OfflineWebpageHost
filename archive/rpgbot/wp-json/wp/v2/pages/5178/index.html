Divine spells include many of the best healing and support options, but direct damage options are rare and are frequently only viable against specific creature types like celestials, fiends, and undead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players familiar with Pathfinder 1e should note that spell save DCs have changed since previous editions. Where in 1e your save DC included the level of the spell, in Pathfinder 2e your Spell Save DC is the same for any spell that you cast (though it gets complicated if you can cast spells from multiple traditions). If you cast a 1st-level spell one turn, then a 9th-level spell the next, they will have the same save DC. Because of this change, low-level spells can remain fantastically useful at high levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIS ARTICLE IS INCOMPLETE<\/strong>.

Cantrips are always heightened to half your level rounded up, so they&#8217;ll match the level of the highest-level spells that you can cast. This scaling keeps Cantrips a reliable source of damage output at any level, though most spellcasters still want to rely on ranked spells when they suit the situation rather than counting on Cantrips as your only source of damage output. Because your number of Cantrips is limited, many spellcaster should try to split their options between damage and utility. A spellcaster whose only capability is damage is basically an archer with extra steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Chill Touch<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: No more damage than than any other cantrip, and it&#8217;s only touch\n\t\trange.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Daze<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Poor damage and bad scaling. You&#8217;re gambling for critical failures to\n\t\tstun the target. Against single enemies that&#8217;s a bad gamble, and doing more\n\t\tdamage to quickly eliminate the target is a better choice. Against larger\n\t\tnumbers of low-level enemies, use area damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An essential for adventurers. Someone in every party needs to know\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disrupt Undead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful because it only affects one creature type.\n\t\tDon&#8217;t grab this just because it&#8217;s an easy win against undead, either.\n\t\tZombies have weakness to positive damage, but that weakness isn&#8217;t universal.\n\t\tSkeletons, shadows, and vampires lack that vulnerability.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Lance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Alignment damage only affects creatures of an opposite alignment. For\n\t\texample: good damage only harms evil creatures. In many games, you&#8217;ll be\n\t\tplaying good-aligned characters facing evil enemies, in which case this is\n\t\tvery convenient. However, the moment you go outside of those clear opposed\n\t\talignments, things start to break down and this loses effectiveness.\n\t\t<p>The ability to deal alignment damage this easily also has some weird\n\t\t\tin-world implications. A zealous cleric might use this to scour the local\n\t\t\tpopulation, slaying anyone who opposes the &#8220;correct&#8221; alignment, then\n\t\t\tdeclaring that if the victims weren&#8217;t bad people, they wouldn&#8217;t have been\n\t\t\tharmed.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Forbidding Ward<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A +1 bonus is impactful, and status bonuses are the most likely to stack\n\t\twith other things like the circumstance bonus from Raise a Shield, but this\n\t\tonly affects one ally and only against one enemy and only so long as you\n\t\tSustain the Spell, so the cost is high and benefits are small. In the vast\n\t\tmajority of encounters, your actions are better spent elsewhere.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Guidance<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An excellent, easy way to assist allies with important checks. This\n\t\tgenerally won&#8217;t be worth an action in combat, but during exploration it&#8217;s\n\t\tfantastic. The cooldown is intentionally very long to prevent it from\n\t\tbecoming a perpetual +1 bonus to all checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Know Direction<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational, and you can usually replace it with the Survival\n\t\tskill.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple utility. Often essential if no one has a free hand for a\n\t\ttorch.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Message<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Prestidigitation<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Neat, but not especially impactful. A great RP tool, but you can&#8217;t solve\n\t\tany serious mechanical challenges with it that couldn&#8217;t be solved by mundane\n\t\tmeans.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Read Aura<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: You can usually solve this with Detect Magic, which is more broadly\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: One action for +1 AC and the potentially to block some damage as a\n\t\tReaction. This is a great use for a spare 3rd action, and since it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tcare about your spellcasting stat it&#8217;s a great innate spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sigil<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. The best use I&#8217;ve found for this is to\n\t\tidentify imposters or to track objects that may have changed hands. Cast the\n\t\tmark invisibly on your allies and refresh it when it fades, then if there&#8217;s\n\t\tever a question you can touch the mark to reveal it. If it&#8217;s there, you\n\t\tmight be okay. If not, roll for initiative, because you&#8217;ve found an\n\t\timposter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stabilize<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: More reliable than Administer First Aid for much of the level range, and\n\t\tit doesn&#8217;t require tools, so there is some value here. If you&#8217;re investing\n\t\tin the Medicine skill, you can likely stop using this around level 10, if\n\t\tnot sooner.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bane<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A -1 penalty isn&#8217;t mathematically significant unless the effect is\n\t\tapplied to a large number of enemies. This can be helpful for debuffing\n\t\tlarge groups of weak enemies which are relying on their numbers to offset\n\t\ttheir relatively poor stats, and in that case your enemies will have\n\t\trelatively poor saves so they&#8217;re more likely to fail the Will save. But in\n\t\tthose cases it&#8217;s typically more effective to cast an area damage spell to\n\t\tquickly reduce the number of enemies rather than trying to debuff them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bless<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: +1 to attacks is a consistently useful bonus at any level, makin Bless\n\t\tuseful at any character level. The 1-minute duration is enough to last\n\t\tthrough most fights, and if you can cast it before initiating combat, you\n\t\tcan start with a minor but useful mathematical advantage. However, the range\n\t\tof Bless is extremely limited and spending actions to Sustain the Spell in\n\t\torder to grow the radius is costly and slow. In close quarters or alongside\n\t\tranged weapon-using allies, this can work very well, but if you&#8217;re fighting\n\t\tin a large, open space, you may struggle to keep allies inside the area.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Command<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A simple crowd-control spell with a few options. Commanding creatures to\n\t\trun away or drop what they&#8217;re holding is often the best option because it\n\t\tcan force an enemy to disarm themselves or to run out of melee (potentially\n\t\tprovoking Reactions), and the creature must then spend Actions to address\n\t\thow you&#8217;ve inconvenienced them. However, it&#8217;s a single-target spell with a\n\t\t2-Action casting time, and you can generally expect to cause 2 Actions worth\n\t\tof inconvenience if the target fails their save, which may not be a good\n\t\tenough trade.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Detect Alignment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational. Remember that this isn&#8217;t as simple as casting the spell and\n\t\tdeclaring who in the room is evil. Only creatures of 6th level or higher\n\t\t(plus any creature from the types listed in the spell) have an aura which\n\t\tthis can detect. Once you&#8217;re high enough level that enemies of 6th level and\n\t\tabove are the norm, you can use this for things like detecting nearby\n\t\tinvisible creatures.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Disrupting Weapons<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational by design. 1d4 isn&#8217;t a lot of damage, but against undead with\n\t\tWeakness to Positive damage (like zombies) this is enough to get the bonus\n\t\tdamage from Weakness. I wouldn&#8217;t both casting this at levels higher than 1;\n\t\tthe scaling isn&#8217;t good enough and the biggest benefit is the bonus damage\n\t\tfrom Weakness which doesn&#8217;t care about how<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fear<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: For half the Action cost you can Demoralize a target. Demoralize will\n\t\tonly make them Frightened 1, but that leaves you with two Actions to cast a\n\t\tdifferent spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Harm<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This isn&#8217;t a fantastic spell, but it has some appealing features. This\n\t\tallows you to heal undead, a crucial function for necromancers or groups\n\t\twith undead in the party. But since most parties don&#8217;t feature undead, it&#8217;s\n\t\tmostly a damage spell. Harm mimics Heal&#8217;s scaled versions running from one\n\t\tto three Actions with similar effects. Unfortunately, the two-Action and\n\t\tthree-Action version don&#8217;t increase the damage dealt to living creatures, so\n\t\tit doesn&#8217;t feel as satisfying as Heal. Still, the 3-Action version affects\n\t\tall targets in a 30-foot radius, so you can deal a surprising amount of\n\t\ttotal damage with a single spell slot if you have enough enemies in the\n\t\tarea.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heal<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Essential. Generally you don&#8217;t want to spend Actions in combat healing\n\t\tyour allies unless they&#8217;re unconscious because defeating your enemies faster\n\t\twill generally have a better result than repeatedly healing an ally as their\n\t\thit points bounce up and down. Still, when you need healing Heal is your\n\t\tbest bet. Heal has three options from one to three Actions, each version\n\t\toffering a slightly different version of the spell&#8217;s effects. If you need to\n\t\tget a dying ally back on their feet, the 1-Action version is often\n\t\tsufficient and you&#8217;ll still have two Actions for something else like casting\n\t\ta different spell. Of course, the 1-Action version only works at Touch\n\t\trange, so the 2-Action version is often helpful if your ally is out of\n\t\treach. The 3-Action version works in an AOE, and since Heal both heals\n\t\tliving creatures and harms undead it&#8217;s a great option if multiple allies are\n\t\tdown or if you&#8217;re facing a group of undead foes. The damage is Positive\n\t\tdamage, which bypasses the resistances of most undead, and some undead like\n\t\tzombies are even weak to it so you get a bunch of bonus damage for dealing\n\t\tany amount of Positive damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This won&#8217;t remain useful beyond low levels, but at levels 1 through 4,\n\t\tthis is the best weapon you can get. It only lasts one minute, but if you\n\t\tcast this on the biggest weapon in the party (ideally something like a\n\t\tgreataxe), you can get a ton of extra damage output for the spell&#8217;s\n\t\tduration. If you can, cast this before you jump into combat.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mending<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Tempting if you like to use shields, but the Repair activity is more\n\t\teffective, doesn&#8217;t require a spell slot, and doesn&#8217;t have a Bulk limitation.\n\t\tYou could save this for days when you&#8217;re not adventuring, but even then\n\t\tproficiency in Craft is easy to get and just as good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Unless the enemy is using effects which trigger the +3 bonus or you&#8217;re\n\t\tfacing summoned creatures, this isn&#8217;t worth the spell slot. The bonus is too\n\t\tsmall to justify both a spell slot and the 2-Action casting time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ray of Enfeeblement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Both an attack roll and a save, and the only effect is to debuff the\n\t\ttarget for a couple rounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sanctuary<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A fantastic protection at any level. There&#8217;s a lot of things that a character can do in combat\nto be helpful that aren&#8217;t &#8220;hostile&#8221;.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Link<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: I&#8217;m not sure what to make of this spell. It&#8217;s obviously a gamble for the\n\t\tspellcaster. With a 10-minute duration, 6-second rounds, and 2 points of hp\n\t\ttransferred per round, that&#8217;s up to 200 hit points transferred from you to\n\t\tthe target. If you somehow have a great way to heal yourself (and only\n\t\tyourself), this is a great way to spread that healing around, but otherwise\n\t\tit&#8217;s just a way to consolidate damage on one character and rapidly kill\n\t\tyourself. I would never risk this unless you have a truly stellar quantity\n\t\tof hit points to spare or you have readily-accessible healing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ventriloquism<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Situational, and anyone who hears the effect automatically gets a save to\n\t\tnotice the illusion. Rely on Ghost Sound as much as you possibly can before\n\t\tresorting to this.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2\">2nd-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Augury<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is one of my favorite divination spells, and has been since 3rd\n\t\tedition DnD. While it&#8217;s not terribly precise, it&#8217;s often enough to get a\n\t\tparty unstuck when &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221; sets in. If your party can&#8217;t decide\n\t\twhat to do, cast Augury and try to get some hints. Unfortunately, the flat\n\t\tcheck means that it&#8217;s only 75% accurate, so be cautious whenever you receive\n\t\ta result of &#8220;None&#8221;.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Calm Emotions<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This can defuse a violent situation even if you were attacking the\n\t\ttarget(s) in the previous round. If a fight is going poorly, you can drop\n\t\tthis on your enemies and suddenly they can&#8217;t take hostile actions for up to\n\t\ta minute. That&#8217;s enough time for you to run away or to otherwise get your\n\t\tparty&#8217;s act together before the &#8220;time out&#8221; ends and you go right back to\n\t\tfighting.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Comprehend Languages<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Technically situational, but meeting a creature with which you don&#8217;t\n\t\tshare a language is common. The wording of the spell is specific enough that\n\t\tyou can cast this on your party&#8217;s Face while they&#8217;re actively hearing a\n\t\tlanguage which they don&#8217;t know, and they&#8217;ll gain the ability to understand\n\t\tthat language. Unfortunately you can&#8217;t grant the ability to also speak the\n\t\tlanguage unless you cast this at 3rd level, but if the speaker isn&#8217;t hostile\n\t\tyou can always cast this twice so that your Face and the other creature can\n\t\tunderstand each other despite not speaking the same language.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Continual Flame<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A permanent magical light source for 6gp and whatever it costs you to\n\t\tlearn the spell. If you use a Spell Repertoire, don&#8217;t bother learning this.\n\t\tIf you can, find an NPC spellcaster to cast this for you or buy an\n\t\tEverburning Torch for 15gp. You have the option to cast Continual Flame at\n\t\thigher spell levels, but the spell itself doesn&#8217;t offer any specific\n\t\tbenefits for doing so. As far as I can tell, the only benefit is for the\n\t\tlight to remain in effect in an area of magical darkness.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Food<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Enough food to feed your party. This remains a helpful utility for your\n\t\twhole career, but if you can find trail rations or feed yourself by other\n\t\tmeans you should do so.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Darkness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is the most clearly-written version of this spell that I&#8217;ve seen\n\t\tacross several editions of DnD and both editions of Pathfinder, but it is\n\t\tstill very nuanced. The base version of the spell allows Darkvision to\n\t\tcontinue functioning, which means that if your party has Darkvision and your\n\t\tenemies do not, casting this will provide your party with a significant\n\t\ttactical advantage. The 4th-level heightened version of the spell also\n\t\tinhibits Darkvision, but weirdly that&#8217;s only appealing compared to the base\n\t\t2nd-level version if your enemies have Darkvision and you do not because it\n\t\tinhibits everyone equally. However, the Darkness spell is by no means an\n\t\tunassailable way to darken the battlefield at your convenience: Darkness\n\t\tsuppresses magical light of Darkness&#8217;s level or lower, but due to cantrips\n\t\tbeing automatically heightened, even the Light cantrip can easily override\n\t\tDarkness unless Darkness is heightened. This allows players to easily\n\t\tcounter magical Darkness, but remember that your enemies can do the\n\t\tsame.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Darkvision<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you or one of your allies don&#8217;t have Darkvision, this can be an\n\t\timportant option. Sources of magical light are typically less costly, but\n\t\tthey also give away your position which can be a problem when you&#8217;re trying\n\t\tto sneak around unnoticed. You can purchase a pair of Goggles of Night for\n\t\t150 gp, but that might be a prohibitively high cost for several levels after\n\t\tthe Darkvision spell becomes an option.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deafness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Being deafened in combat is only a minor inconvenience for most\n\t\tcreatures.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Death Knell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: When you first get 2nd-level spells, this is too expensive. But as you\n\t\tgain levels and a 2nd-level spell slot becomes easier to spend, this could\n\t\tbe a good buff for casters planning to wade into melee like warpriest\n\t\tclerics and war mystery oracles. Grab a bag of rats, knock one to 0 hit\n\t\tpoints, kill it with Death Knell, and now you have a decent combat buff for\n\t\t10 minutes.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dispel Magic<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An absolutely essential option. While it&#8217;s not spelled out in the spell&#8217;s\n\t\tdescription, the Counteract rules make the level at which you cast this very\n\t\timportant. On a Critical Success you can dispel effects up to three levels\n\t\thigher than the level at which you cast Dispel Magic and on a Success up to\n\t\tone level higher. On a failure you can still dispel effects of a lower\n\t\tlevel, so upcasting Dispel Magic can be a powerful way to strip enemies of\n\t\tproblematic buffs or to disarm them of magic items like weapons which might\n\t\tdramatically boost their damage output.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Endure Elements<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. Very few games explore temperature\n\t\textremes.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Enhance Victuals<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you&#8217;re just trying to live, use Create Water and Create Food. This is\n\t\tfor when you need to impress an NPC.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Faerie Fire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good, inexpensive counter to invisibility at any level.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gentle Repose<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. If raising creatures from the dead is an\n\t\toption, this can be very useful because you can preserve a creature&#8217;s body\n\t\tlong enough to gather whatever you need to do so (help, diamonds, etc.). It\n\t\tshould be sufficient to own a scroll or a wand of Gentle Repose for these\n\t\temergency situations. The 5th-level option is great for preserving the\n\t\tbodies of important people like nobility, famous heroes, etc. if there isn&#8217;t\n\t\tanyone strong enough to raise them from the dead at the moment.<\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ghoulish Cravings<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Inficting diseases with stage durations measured in days is nearly never\n\t\tuseful for players.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Fear<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Fear effects are common, but most are also very short-lived.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Paralysis<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but possibly worth having a scroll.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resist Energy<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple defensive option. 10 minutes is long enough to get you through a\n\t\tfight or two, and as you gain levels and additional spell slots you can\n\t\tafford to cast this on multiple allies or to give more than one type of\n\t\tdamage resistance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Restoration<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This spell is&#8230; odd. Most of the affected conditions have a short\n\t\tduration and go away once the spell or effect which produces them ends,\n\t\ttypically much sooner than the 1-minute casting time of Restoration.\n\t\tFurthermore, &#8220;toxin&#8221; isn&#8217;t a rules term, so RAW that portion of the spell is\n\t\tsimply non-functional. I believe it&#8217;s intended to refer to poisons, but it\n\t\tmight also apply to diseases. I&#8217;m not sure. We&#8217;ve gotten three full\n\t\treprintings of the Core Rulebook, including errata, and this hasn&#8217;t been\n\t\tfixed.\n\t\t<p>At high levels, this adds the ability to remove the Doomed condition,\n\t\t\twhich is crucial because being Doomed by any amount significantly\n\t\t\tincreases your odds of dying.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Restore Senses<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. A scroll is likely sufficient.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple option for handling invisibility. At high levels casting the\n\t\tspell at 5th level will be a common daily occurence so that you&#8217;re always\n\t\tready to face invisible enemies. The creatures and objects are still\n\t\tConcealed, but that won&#8217;t protect them from Fireball.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield Other<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Helpful for mitigating damage which might otherwise be piled solely on\n\t\tyour party&#8217;s Defender, and the 10-minute duration is long enough to cast\n\t\tthis before wandering into somewhere dangerous. However, the spell ends\n\t\tearly if you and the target are ever more than 30 feet apart, which is a\n\t\tfrustratingly small distance and doesn&#8217;t appear to be affected by Reach\n\t\tSpell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Silence<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Combined with Invisibility or darkness, this can make a creature\n\t\tfunctionally undetectable to creatures that don&#8217;t have other strong senses\n\t\tlike scent or tremorsense.\n\t\t<p>The 4th-level version can be used to prevent enemy spellcasters from\n\t\t\tusing spells with a Verbal component, strictly limiting their options. If\n\t\t\tyou throw this on a character who can grapple effectively, they can grab\n\t\t\tan enemy spellcaster and dramatically reduce their effectiveness.<\/p><p> <\/p><\/li>\n\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sound Burst<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Passable AOE damage, but it won&#8217;t compete with most AOE damage options,\n\t\tespecially once 3rd-level spells come online.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spiritual Weapon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Decent damage with decent scaling, you can use it from a safe distance,\n\t\tit uses your spellcasting ability modifier, the damage type is great, and\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t need to commit a hand to wielding it or actions to run around in\n\t\tmelee. You can Sustain the Spell multiple times per turn, making another\n\t\tStrike each time (and incurring the usual Multiple Attack Penalty), allowing\n\t\tthis to effectively replace a real weapon for divine casters like the\n\t\tCleric. Full casters also progress their proficiency to Legendary, while\n\t\tmost weapon users stop at Master and must make up the difference with\n\t\texpensive runes.\n\t\t<p>In case it wasn&#8217;t brutally obvious: This spell is better than the\n\t\t\tWarpriest Cleric&#8217;s entire set of weapon-related features.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Status<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The duration is good, and you&#8217;ll always know when your allies are in bad\n\t\tshape. It seems odd to me that this doesn&#8217;t give you an impression of the\n\t\ttarget&#8217;s hit points, but &#8220;Wounded&#8221; and &#8220;Dying&#8221; are conditions affecting the\n\t\tcreature, so at least you&#8217;ll know when they hit 0.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Undetectable Alignment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Extremely situational, and you can still check alignments using Divine\n\t\tLance.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Water Breathing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but when you need it there&#8217;s really no\n\t\tsubstitute. Heightening the spell increases the duration significantly, so\n\t\tif you need to spend a lot of time in and around water, expect to heighten\n\t\tthis.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Water Walk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Too situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bind Undead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: 1-day duration with no save. You need to do some metagaming to match the\n\t\tlevel of this spell to the level of the undead in question, which feels\n\t\tweird, but if you have ambitions of a skeletal entourage, you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tmuch choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blindness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent against single targets, especially enemy spellcasters who often\n\t\thave relatively poor Fortitude saves and need to be able to see to target\n\t\tmany spells (spells which simply select a number of targets, such as the\n\t\tspell Blindness, require you to be able to see the target). Unfortunately,\n\t\tBlindness has the Incapacitation trait so you can&#8217;t use it effectively on\n\t\tsmall numbers of powerful creatures that are most likely to justify\n\t\tmagically blinding them.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Chilling Darkness<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Poor damage unless you&#8217;re facing hostile celestials.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Circle of Protection<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A consistent and useful defensive buff, provided that you&#8217;re consistently\n\t\tfacing enemies of a specific alignment. In many campaigns, your enemies will\n\t\tbe evil, so in a lot of cases this will work very well. The 10-foot radius\n\t\tis enough that your party&#8217;s melee characters can usually stay close enough\n\t\ttogether to all benefit, but ranged characters will likely be outside of the\n\t\tarea most of the time.\n\t\t<p>Casting this at 4th level raises the duration to a full hour. If you\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t need a ton of time post-combat to heal and Refocus, you could easily\n\t\t\twalk this through two or three encounters in a dungeon or a similar\n\t\t\tsituation.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crisis of Faith<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. I would only prepare this if you know for\n\t\tcertain that you&#8217;re going to face enemy divine spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dream Message<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. I don&#8217;t recommend this for casters with a\n\t\tSpell Repertoire because it&#8217;s just not useful often enough to justify the\n\t\tspace. It&#8217;s more likely that a friendly NPC will use this to communicate to\n\t\tthe players.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glyph of Warding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Exceptionally abusable. A normal use case for this is to place a hostile\n\t\tspell on a choke point in a structure to deter intruders or to punish\n\t\tcreatures for opening a chest with your most treasured belongings. Be\n\t\tcautious with area damage spells in these cases because they can cause\n\t\tunwanted collateral damage, such as fireballing your own bedroom. If you\n\t\tnever went beyond these very normal cases, Glyph of Warding is neat but\n\t\twon&#8217;t be used frequently.\n\t\t<p>But the abuse cases are both easy to achieve and terrifying. There is no\n\t\t\tlimit on how many glyphs of warding you can have in existence, no limit on\n\t\t\tmoving an affected container, no cost beyond spell slots and possibly the\n\t\t\tcost of the target item, no restriction on what a &#8220;container&#8221; must be, and\n\t\t\tno restriction on the triggering condition. As an example: I could fold a\n\t\t\tpiece of paper into a crude cup, cast Glyph of Warding on it, set a\n\t\t\tpassword to allow you to move it, place a spell into it like Harm, and\n\t\t\tmake the trigger &#8220;attempts to harm me.&#8221; You could accumulate these cups of\n\t\t\tharmful nonsense over time and eventually walk into an encounter and\n\t\t\tdisintegrate the first enemy that attempts to harm you.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Note that while the spell doesn&#8217;t have a section of the spell&#8217;s entry\n\t\t\tdetailing specific benefits for heightening the spell, doing so raises the\n\t\t\tmaximum level of the spell you place in the glyph. You could store a\n\t\t\t9th-level spell by casting Glyph of Warding at 10th level.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Heroism<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Always helpful, but very expensive when you first get access to 3rd-level\n\t\tspells. As you gain levels, this can become an easier go-to buff with your\n\t\tlower-level spell slots. Higher-level versions of the spell increase the\n\t\tsize of the bonus, which is mathematically very appealing, but the 10-minute\n\t\tduration is likely no more than two encounters, which means that you need to\n\t\tsave the higher-level versions for when you know it&#8217;s going to matter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Locate<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Not useful enough to know permanently in a spell repertoire, but for\n\t\tprepared casters this is a great solution when you need to find plot items\n\t\tor named antagonists.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Neutralize Poison<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Poison is common across the level range, and has a nasty habit of still\n\t\taffecting you and your party once an encounter ends. The counteract check\n\t\tmeans that this isn&#8217;t guaranteed, unfortunately, so be prepared to use the\n\t\tMedicine skill, too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Disease<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and diseases typically take hours or days to\n\t\tbecome a problem, leaving plenty of time to address them with Medicine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sanctified Ground<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Vary situational. It&#8217;s basically Circle of Protection, but a larger\n\t\tradius and you can&#8217;t move it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Searing light<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Great single-target damage against fiends and undead, but otherwise\n\t\tterrible.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vampiric Touch<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Decent damage of a good damage type, and the temporary hit points will\n\t\thelp keep you alive after you run into melee to deliver this. This is a\n\t\tgreat option for gish characters like the Magus, but wizards should be very\n\t\tcareful about using this without Reach Spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wanderer&#8217;s Guide<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Intended to improve the pace of overland travel by reducing the penalty\n\t\tfor difficult terrain like forests. The precise behavior of the spell is\n\t\tintentionally vague, but overland travel is handled narratively, so it makes\n\t\tsense. You won&#8217;t need this every time that you travel, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\tdeviating from paved roads it can be helpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Zone of Truth<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Helpful for questioning hostile or deceptive creatures, but allowing both\n\t\ta save and Deception checks means that it&#8217;s not fool-proof. If you can,\n\t\tcombine this with high Perception scores and the Discern Lies spell for\n\t\textra insurance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4\">4th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Air Walk<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: In a way, this is budget magical flight, but it has a crucial advantage:\n\t\tThe &#8220;Fly&#8221; action includes the text &#8220;If you&#8217;re airborne at the end of your\n\t\tturn and didn&#8217;t use a Fly action this round, you fall.&#8221; This means that\n\t\tflying, magically or otherwise, presents a persistent action tax. Air Walk\n\t\thas no such cost, making it the superior combat option over both natural\n\t\t<em>and<\/em> magical flight.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anathematic Reprisal<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Very situational, and massively dependent on your deity&#8217;s Anathema. You\n\t\tcould try some abusive stuff to trigger this, of course. For example: an\n\t\tIomedae worshiper might issue a verbal challenge to an enemy to fight\n\t\tone-on-one, and upon being refused, you might consider that anathema\n\t\t(&#8220;refuse a challenge from an equal&#8221;), get upset, and respond with\n\t\tAnathematic Reprisal. But the damage of the spell is atrociously low to\n\t\tcompensate for this being cast as a Reaction. If you do use this, I don&#8217;t\n\t\trecommend learning or preparing it until you&#8217;re well pest 4th-level spell\n\t\tslots.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dimensional Anchor<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great counter counter to enemy spellcasters who might teleport to\n\t\tsafety. The target does get a save, but even on a Success the spell still\n\t\tworks for a full minute. There is still a Counteract check involved, so this\n\t\tisn&#8217;t foolproof.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Discern Lies<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Massively helpful in social situations, but not useful often enough to\n\t\tjustify learning it permanently in Spell Repertoire unless your campaign is\n\t\theavily focused on intrigue and social situations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Wrath<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Divine Wrath does roughly as much damage as a 3rd-level Fireball, but\n\t\trelying on alignment damage means that it&#8217;s likely to not affect your allies\n\t\tand may trigger vulnerabilities from enemies (fiends vulnerable to good\n\t\tdamage, etc.). In addition, the Sickened and possible Slow effects make this\n\t\tvery appealing when your party is facing a crowd of enemies. The damage\n\t\tscaling will fall behind spells like Fireball, but the status conditions\n\t\tremain helpful. This doesn&#8217;t have the Incapacitation trait, so against\n\t\tenemies with poor Fortitude saves it&#8217;s a great way to rob them of some\n\t\tActions if you get lucky and they roll a Critical Failure.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Freedom of Movement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful. The duration is long enough that you could\n\t\tpre-cast it before going into an encounter, but you would need to know that\n\t\tyou&#8217;re facing something that likes to immobilize\/grapple\/restrain you ahead\n\t\tof time.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Globe of Invulnerability<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: At a glance, this is a great defense against enemy spellcasters, allowing\n\t\tyou to safely cast spells outward while being protected from spells\n\t\ttargeting anyone inside the sphere (you, for the most part). But it&#8217;s not\n\t\tportable, so it&#8217;s really only useful if you&#8217;re comfortable standing still\n\t\tfor the rest of the encounter.\n\t\t<p>The fact that the the globe is a 10-foot burst (so it&#8217;s a sphere 20 feet\n\t\t\tacross) and can&#8217;t be broken by things like walls or floors is a\n\t\t\tsurprisingly major problem. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to use in close quarters\n\t\t\tlike a dungeon, and if you&#8217;re on the ground, only a 10&#215;10 group of squares\n\t\t\tis close enough to the ground to be considered inside the sphere. The rest\n\t\t\tof the sphere floats uselessly above you.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Holy Cascade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful because it only affects two creature types, but\n\t\tthe damage and scaling are both good, and the damage types may trigger\n\t\tvulnerabilities, further improving the damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Outcast&#8217;s Curse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but if you want to ruin someone&#8217;s life without\n\t\tending it, I can&#8217;t think of a better option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Read Omens<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup> (uncommon):\n\t\tExtremely vague. Thematically very cool, but it doesn&#8217;t offer the GM any\n\t\tadvice on how to handle this, so many GMs will struggle to give you anything\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Remove Curse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Technically this only situationally useful, but it&#8217;s also among the only\n\t\tways to remove cruses, and curses are often permanent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spell Immunity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Affects exactly one spell and still has a chance to fail because it\n\t\tinvolves a Counteract check. The 24-hour duration is generous, but it&#8217;s\n\t\tnearly impossible to guess a single spell which you&#8217;ll need to resist this\n\t\tway.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Talking Corpse<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Incredibly useful in a game where enemies with crucial information will\n\t\toften greet you with lethal force. Unfortunately, if the target creature\n\t\twould not have wanted to help you in life, they can choose to make the\n\t\texperience extremely frustrating. You get any number of questions you want\n\t\twithin the 10 minute span, but unless the creature rolls a Critical Failure,\n\t\tthey could blather for 10 minutes to stall you until the spell ends.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Vital Beacon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: It&#8217;s easy to look at this and say &#8220;for the same spell slot, Heal would be\n\t\tmore efficient for healing my party,&#8221; but that&#8217;s not the intended use case.\n\t\tVital Beacon lasts until your next daily preparations, so you&#8217;re pre-casting\n\t\ta healing resource which you party can use 4 times throughout the day.\n\t\tUnfortunately, the only time you would want to use this is during combat,\n\t\tand this simply isn&#8217;t enough healing to justify the action cost unless it\n\t\tsaves a drying creature, which isn&#8217;t possible because the creature being\n\t\thealed needs to spend the action to &#8220;supplicate.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5\">5th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Abyssal Plague<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Drained 1 on a failure, Drained 2 on a critical failure. Drained reduces\n\t\tthe target&#8217;s hp by 1 per level, which is about the same as doing 1 point of\n\t\tdamage per level. Even if you use this on a level 20 enemy and they roll a\n\t\tFailure, that&#8217;s the equivalent of 20 damage, which simply isn&#8217;t enough for a\n\t\tspell of this level, and it&#8217;s a disease so the 1-day interval is not going\n\t\tto help you except in extremely unusual cases.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Banishment<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Save-or-suck for anything from a different plane of existence. Simple,\n\t\teffective, and if you&#8217;re prepared for the specific creature(s) you can\n\t\timpose a penalty on the save. Unfortunately Banishment has the\n\t\tIncapacitation Trait, so it&#8217;s hard to use against powerful foes, and if the\n\t\ttarget rolls a Critical Success you&#8217;ll be Stunned 1 so you only want to use\n\t\tthis when you can be reasonably certain that the target will fail their\n\t\tsaving throw.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Breath of Life<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Too essential to not have. Note that this isn&#8217;t perfect protection. Death\n\t\teffects and Disintegrate explicitly can&#8217;t be stopped, and Breath of Life\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t remove the conditions which caused the creature to die. For example:\n\t\tif the creature is Doomed enough to kill them outright.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Death Ward<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, but a very powerful defense against undead\n\t\tenemies and necromancy-using spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Drop Dead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to get out of a bad situation. If someone in your party is in\n\t\trough shape, it may be best to turn them invisible and have them retreat to\n\t\tsafety rather than letting them fall to 0 and play hit point ping pong for\n\t\tthe rest of the encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Flame Strike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: The Cleric&#8217;s conceptual answer to Fireball. The damage is fine, but not\n\t\tas good as a Fireball of the same level. The benefit over Fireball is that\n\t\tit partially ignores resistance and immunity. But with the diversity of\n\t\tdamage options available, especially with better areas of effect, Flame\n\t\tStrike struggles to find a niche where it&#8217;s useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prying Eye<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An exceptionally powerful scouting option, Prying Eye allows you to scout\n\t\tdangerous areas from a safe distance, and the eye&#8217;s small size can often\n\t\tslip it through obstacles by sneaking under doors or through cracked\n\t\twindows. The duration doesn&#8217;t expire until you fail to Sustain the spell, so\n\t\tgiven enough time you can send the eye great distances and scout huge areas.\n\t\tThe biggest limitation is that the eye uses your normal senses, so be sure\n\t\tthat you have Low-Light Vision and\/or Darkvision so that you can send the\n\t\teye into dark places and still see.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sending<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and extremely expensive for how limited the\n\t\tfunction is. Teleport is one spell level higher and you can go have a full\n\t\tconversation.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Blast<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: An easy go-to area damage option due to its extremely versatile\n\t\tcombination of variable damage type and variable area of effect, but it\n\t\tcomes at the cost of dealing low damage for a spell of this level. You can\n\t\thopefully make up the difference by affecting more targets or by triggering\n\t\tvulnerabilities.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spiritual Guardian<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Because this functions very similarly to Spiritual Weapon, it&#8217;s natural\n\t\tto compare the two spells. It&#8217;s not a perfect comparison, but it&#8217;s a good\n\t\tstarting point. Both spells have the same range, can be Sustained the same\n\t\tway to attack and retarget the spell, and attack the same way. Spiritual\n\t\tGuardian&#8217;s damage is delayed by one spell level compared to Spiritual\n\t\tWeapon, so a Spiritual Guardian always does as much damage as a Spiritual\n\t\tWeapon of one spell level lower.\n\t\t<p>The core question is whether or not Spiritual Guardian&#8217;s other benefits\n\t\t\tare worth that additional spell level. If used purely offensively, you can\n\t\t\tuse Spiritual Guardian to help allies flank, which is a huge boon for your\n\t\t\tmelee allies, especially for characters like rogues who depend on targets\n\t\t\tbeing Flat-Footed. In a fight where you can repeatedly enable allies to\n\t\t\tflank, that&#8217;s a huge benefit.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You can also use the guardian defensively by assigning to protect an\n\t\t\tally. This takes an Action to Sustain the Spell initially, but it appears\n\t\t\tthat the guardian will continue to guard your ally until you tell it to do\n\t\t\tsomething else. Preventing up to 40 damage could easily save your allies\n\t\t\tlife in a tough fight, and not needing to spend an Action to Sustain the\n\t\t\tSpell in order to attack every round leaves that action free for other\n\t\t\tthings on turns where you might need to do things like cast 3-Action\n\t\t\tspells.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>I do think this is an improvement over Spiritual Weapon, but only if your\n\t\t\tparty will benefit from the additional functionality. If your party is\n\t\t\talready able to flank reliably without the additional help, Spiritual\n\t\t\tWeapon will suffice in most cases.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Celestial<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Many of the summonable options are also spellcasters, allowing you to summon a large pool\n\t\tof additional spellcasting at the cost of a single spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Summon Fiend<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Many of the summonable options are also spellcasters, allowing you to summon a large pool\n\t\tof additional spellcasting at the cost of a single spell slot.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tongues<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A staple option for overcoming language barriers, but at such high level\n\t\tthis is an expensive way to solve the problem.

The 3-Acton casting time is hard, but\n\t\tif you can get this in place it can quickly define the outcome of a fight.\n\t\tIf your party has the ability to push enemies into the wall repeatedly,\n\t\tabusing the wall quickly becomes the defining tactical feature of an\n\t\tencounter.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Field of Life<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Outside of combat, this is more efficient healing than casting Heal, but\n\t\tI would absolutely never cast this mid-combat. The automatic damage to\n\t\tundead is neat, but unless you&#8217;re facing a literal army of low-level\n\t\tzombies which are climbing over each other&#8217;s falling bodies to get into\n\t\tmelee with you every round, casting 3-Action Heal will always be a better\n\t\tidea.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Raise Dead<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A spell you hope to never need. Raise Dead is expensive, and the cost\n\t\tgrows exponentially as your target&#8217;s level increases. The target cannot\n\t\thave died more than 3 days prior, which is a narrow window. Plan to use\n\t\tGentle Repose to keep the corpse &#8220;fresh&#8221; for later raising if you&#8217;re not in\n\t\ta situation where you can do so immediately.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Repulsion<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A great way to keep enemies away from you and your other squishy allies,\n\t\tespecially since many creatures are wholly unable to fight at range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Righteous Might<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Turn into an outright better Warpriest than the best Warpriest for a full\n\t\tminute. Let&#8217;s look at the math: At level 11 when you get access to this\n\t\tspell, a Warpriest Cleric or Battle Mystery Oracle will be Expert at best in\n\t\ttheir weapon. With +15 proficiency, a +2 Greater Striking Weapon (which is a\n\t\tlevel 12 item, but bear with me), and 18 Strength, you match the +21 attack\n\t\tbonus. Clerics don&#8217;t get Weapon Specialization until level 14, and even then\n\t\tit&#8217;s a +3 bonus, which with 18 Strength still won&#8217;t match Righteous Might&#8217;s\n\t\t+8 damage bonus for melee weapons. Righteous Might also adds the Holy\n\t\tproperty, which means that all told it&#8217;s a 3,400gp weapon you&#8217;re swinging. A\n\t\tlevel 11 character is expected to have 3,200 gp according to the character\n\t\twealth table (CRB 511), so that&#8217;s basically impossible.\n\t\t<p>I&#8217;m using Warpriest as a punching bag, which is unfair. Battle Mystery\n\t\t\tOracles suffer from the exact same problem.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>But beating up on weak subclass options doesn&#8217;t tell us if the spell is\n\t\t\tactually good. The weapon attacks are pretty good, as I explained above,\n\t\t\tbut won&#8217;t quite match a character like a Champion or a Fighter because\n\t\t\tthey&#8217;ll have better ability scores, weapon proficiency, and damage\n\t\t\tbonuses, but it gets you close without any of the investment. 20+Level AC\n\t\t\tis the equivalent of being Trained and wearing +2 Full Plate, which is\n\t\t\twhere a warpriest sits at this level (they don&#8217;t hit Expert until level\n\t\t\t13). Again: it won&#8217;t match a full martial class, but it&#8217;s still pretty\n\t\t\tgood. You still need upgraded armor for the save bonuses and property\n\t\t\trunes, of course, but that&#8217;s baked into the game&#8217;s math anyway. The\n\t\t\ttemporary hp and physical damage resistance will close the gap in max hp\n\t\t\tcompared to martial classes and outdo Armor Specialization Effects, so\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re reasonably durable provided that your Constitution is good.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Taken as a whole: This does not make you as good as a martial character,\n\t\t\tbut it does make you better than the best Warpriest of roughly the same\n\t\t\tlevel for one minute at a time, which is long enough to get through a\n\t\t\tfight on a single spell rather than burning through limited spell\n\t\t\tslots.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellwrack<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: If you can get this set up on a powerful enemy early in a fight, the\n\t\tdamage can add up quite a bit. But it takes 4 instances of the persistent\n\t\tdamage to match the damage of casting Chain Lightning, so the fight needs to\n\t\tbe long for this useful in combat. The best-case scenario is to get this on\n\t\tan enemy outside of combat and leave it in place for later, but at that\n\t\tpoint why not just kill them and be done with it?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Blast<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good, straightforward, single-target damage. It&#8217;s interesting that this\n\t\tcan target astrally projected creatures and creatures possessing other\n\t\tcreatures, but that rarely comes up in most games.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stone Tell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Potentially very powerful, but hugely dependent on your GM since what the\n\t\tstone understands and what it could tell you are so vaguely defined. You\n\t\tmight be able to get detailed information like &#8220;there are three humanoids\n\t\tinside this stone house&#8221; or you might get &#8220;there are lots of things touching\n\t\tmy floor right now&#8221;.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stone to Flesh<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Forget passwall, forget disintegrate, forget pickaxes. Turn problematic\n\t\tstone (a wall, a door, a support column, etc.) into flesh and either watch\n\t\tthe structure collapse or chop your way through whatever obstacle you&#8217;re\n\t\tfacing. This is a tradition dating back at least as far as the original Tomb\n\t\tof Horrors at the first Origins convention in 1975. Oh, and you can rescue\n\t\tpetrified creatures, which happens sometimes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">True Seeing<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and the fact that you could fail the secret\n\t\tCounteract check means that creatures could still make themselves invisible\n\t\tand go undetected even while you&#8217;re running True Seeing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vampiric Exsanguination<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Good damage of a good type in a reasonably large are of effect, plus you\n\t\tget temporary hit points, but the range on the cone is short so frail\n\t\tcharacters like sorcerers and wizards should be cautious unless you&#8217;re also\n\t\tusing Reach Spell.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Zealous Conviction<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a weird buff that also lets you take over your friends&#8217;\n\t\tcharacters, which is generally considered a rude, borderline offensive\n\t\tchoice. If you do cast this spell, tell your allies to &#8220;act as they would\n\t\tnormally&#8221; and never anything else unless something weird happens, like they\n\t\tget mind controlled. The temporary hp won&#8217;t last long at this level, and\n\t\twhile the Will save bonus is excellent, I only recommend using this if you\n\t\tknow for certain that you&#8217;re facing enemies which target Will saves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7\">7th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Lock<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful.

It&#8217;s hard to\n\t\tspend such a high-level spell slot on something like this, but with a\n\t\t24-hour duration you can cast it before going to sleep, get a full night&#8217;s\n\t\tsleep, then wake up with 16 hours left on the spell&#8217;s duration. If you don&#8217;t\n\t\tneed to adventure on back-to-back days, you should strongly consider this as\n\t\tpart of your daily routine.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ethereal Jaunt<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent for both infiltration and escape.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Finger of Death<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent single-target damage with excellent scaling.

The expected outcome is 100 negative damage, which is a\n\t\tbig pile of damage. Lines are a difficult AOE so expect to hit no more than\n\t\ttwo creatures, and you generally want to kill something with the initial\n\t\tdamage rather than suffering 30 damage if you don&#8217;t, but maybe you&#8217;ll get\n\t\tlucky and the 30 damage will kill an enemy or two, in which case I would\n\t\thappily take the 30 damage rather than letting those creatures get another\n\t\tturn. The possibility that you can outright kill creatures on a Critical\n\t\tFailure is very tempting, but unless you&#8217;re hitting a bunch of creatures\n\t\tsomehow I don&#8217;t recommend making that gamble.\n\t\t<p>Because the level cap is so high, you can safely use this even with your\n\t\t\tallies in the line.

The AOE is reasonably\n\t\tlarge and you get to pick targets, so you can omit your allies. The Success\n\t\teffect still forces targets to pay tribute twice (likely once on each of\n\t\ttheir next two turns), and the Critical Failure effect forces targets to\n\t\tspend all of their actions paying tribute until they do it 6 times in total,\n\t\tso if you can Slow or Stun them you can stretch out the number of turns that\n\t\tthey spend doing nothing threatening.

It&#8217;s rare to have an enemy with\n\t\twhich you&#8217;ve connected telepathically before that you haven&#8217;t already\n\t\tkilled.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wail of the Banshee<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Full damage on a Success, but the 8d10 damage isn&#8217;t impressive at this\n\t\tlevel. What you want is the Drained condition applied on a Failure, which is\n\t\tequivalent to a big pile of additional damage and penalties to Fortitude\n\t\tsaves.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon of Judgement<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good option against large single foes. This will feel conceptually\n\t\tsimilar to Spiritual Weapon, but the similarities are almost entirely\n\t\tcosmetic. Weapon of Judgement is a &#8220;set it and forget it&#8221; sort of spell, and\n\t\tit works best if you get it up on turn 1.\n\t\t<p>The &#8220;war&#8221; option encourages the target to attack another creature you\n\t\t\tselect and punishes them if they do not do so. You could select another\n\t\t\tenemy as the second target, then the first target must choose between\n\t\t\tsuffering a punitive attack or attacking one of their allies. If no second\n\t\t\tenemy exists, select a creature like a familiar or a fleeing rat and do\n\t\t\teverything in your power to prevent your enemy from attacking them so that\n\t\t\tyou get as many Weapon of Judgement attacks as possible.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The &#8220;peace&#8221; option is more straightforward: the target suffers a punitive\n\t\t\tattack every time it takes a hostile action against one or more of the 5\n\t\t\tcreatures you specify when you cast the spell. If you select your party as\n\t\t\tthe 5 creatures, you can inflict a punitive attack every time your enemy\n\t\t\tdoes something hostile. Against enemies that rely on Strikes, that might\n\t\t\tbe several times per round. The Weapon of Judgement suffers Multiple\n\t\t\tAttack Penalty in this case, which is a specific exception included in the\n\t\t\teffects of the spell (MAP normally only applies on your own turn). Of\n\t\t\tcourse, MAP still refreshes every turn, so you could willingly provoke\n\t\t\tReactions to get another Weapon of Judgement on another creature&#8217;s turn\n\t\t\twithout the MAP accumulated during your enemy&#8217;s turn.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10\">10th-Level Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Avatar<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Righteous Might&#8217;s cooler, older sibling. Your attack bonus matches an 18\n\t\tability score, a +3 weapon, and master proficiency at 20th level. The\n\t\tgranted attacks do 6 dice worth of damage, which manufactured weapons can&#8217;t\n\t\tmatch even with a Rune of Greater Striking. 25+Level AC takes +3 full plate\n\t\tand Master proficiency to match. 30 temporary hp adds even more durability.\n\t\tYou&#8217;re effectively matching a 20th-level martial character, if only\n\t\tnumerically. The 1-minute duration is enough to get through one fight.\n\t\t<p>Each deity has a specific avatar form that does impact how useful the\n\t\t\tspell is, each providing unique attacks and movement options, so your\n\t\t\tdeity&#8217;s avatar might not fit your exact needs at any given moment.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gate<\/span> (uncommon): Only situationally\n\t\tuseful. Usually Plane Shift is sufficient, especially if you can follow it\n\t\twith Teleport to get closer to your intended destination.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Miracle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Wish, but divine instead of Arcane. The ability to cast spells from any\n\t\tspell list is excellent.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remake<\/span> (uncommon): Only situationally\n\t\tuseful. This feels like it should be a ritual.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Revival<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Only situationally useful, and the situation is &#8220;we have made a series of\n\t\terrors and multiple people are now dead&#8221;. Instead of preparing to be in\n\t\tthat situation, try to avoid the situation. This might be worth a scroll,\n\t\tbut preparing it will turn your 10th-level spell slot or spell known into a\n\t\tpermanent tax on your resources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Divine tradition covers classes like the Cleric and the Oracle, as well as several subclasses of the Sorcerer and the Witch.
