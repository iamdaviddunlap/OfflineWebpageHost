You won&#8217;t need to use\n\t\tthis in every fight, but certainly don&#8217;t hesitate to use it if you think it\n\t\twill be helpful.\n\t\t<p>The temporary hit points don&#8217;t have a specified expiration, so they\n\t\t\texpire when you complete a long rest. If you use Mantle of Inspiration\n\t\t\tearly in the day, the temporary hit points may last all day long. Once you\n\t\t\tget Font of Inspriation at 5th level, be sure to use Mantle of Inspiration\n\t\t\tbefore you take a Short Rest to squeeze some benefit out of any remaining\n\t\t\tBardic Inspiration dice.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Enthralling Performance<\/span>: Similar to\n\t\t<em>Charm Person<\/em> with a 1-minute casting time, during which you need to\n\t\tsomehow hold that target(s)&#8217;s attention and during which you can&#8217;t be\n\t\tinterrupted. <em>Charm Person<\/em> is a 1st-level spell, it will have the\n\t\tsame save DC, and creatures don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;ve targeted them with the\n\t\tspell so you can cast <em>Charm Person<\/em> even while being observed, and\n\t\tso long as the creature can&#8217;t identify the spell and isn&#8217;t naturally\n\t\tinclined to be hostile about you casting spells, you could try repeatedly\n\t\tuntil the target fails its save.\n\t\t<p>Where Enthralling Performance shines is when you need to charm a group.\n\t\t\tEnthralling Performance can affect up to 5 creatures once you hit 20\n\t\t\tCharisma, which would cost a 5th-level spell slot to replicate with\n\t\t\t<em>Charm Person<\/em>. The effect goes a bit beyond the basic effects of\n\t\t\tCharmed, too, so you can easily turn your new fans toward various\n\t\t\tnon-violent purposes like using them to force your way into a fancy party,\n\t\t\tto ward off local law enforcement, or to improve your reputation by having\n\t\t\tthe crowd tell random strangers how great you are.<\/p>\n<p>However, since\n\t\t\tEnthralling Performance recharges on a Short or Long Rest, you generally\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t exceed a 5-person crowd size (though magical options like Catnap to\n\t\t\ttake a 10-minute short rest may make it possible).<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The biggest problem with Enthralling Performance is finding a suitable crowd who\n\t\t\talready likes you enough to listen to your for a full minute in a place\n\t\t\twhere you can put them to a useful purpose without restorting to violence.\n\t\t\tThis might be very easy dependening on the nature of your campaign, but in\n\t\t\tmost DnD campaigns you&#8217;ll spend long periods isolated from polite society\n\t\t\t(there are very few taverns in dungeons) or in locales with sparse\n\t\t\tpopulations of friendly humanoids.<\/p>\n<p>In campaigns which frequently involve\n\t\t\tlarge cities, this could be much more useful, but if you try to solve\n\t\t\tevery problem by inciting a mob of your fans, your DM might have the\n\t\t\tguards run you out of town. Look for opportunities to use this, but don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tabuse it.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantle of Majesty<\/span>: By charming a creature\n\t\tand using <em>Command<\/em> to prevent the creature from using their turn\n\t\t(Drop and Grovel are great options), you can mostly paralyze a creature.\n\t\tUnfortunately, since you don&#8217;t use a spell slot for Mantle of Majesty,\n\t\t<em>Command<\/em> is cast at its minimum spell level and will only affect one\n\t\tcreature. This will work great to lock down strong single enemies, but in a\n\t\tfight against a group you probably don&#8217;t want to use this.\n\t\t<p>The auto-failure effect with <em>Command<\/em> is also weird since Mantle\n\t\t\tof Majesty doesn&#8217;t charm things, so you need to do that part on your own\n\t\t\twith a different effect, such as Charm Person.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that Mantle of Majesty still causes you to\n\t\t\tcast a leveled spell, so on turns where you&#8217;re casting <em>Command<\/em> as\n\t\t\ta Bonus Action you&#8217;re unable to cast any other spells except cantrips.\n\t\t\tAgain: fine for big single foes, but dangerous in encounters with multiple\n\t\t\tenemies.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unbreakable Majesty<\/span>: This is an amazing\n\t\toption both defensively and offensively. Make sure to buff your AC or look\n\t\tfor other defensive options so that you won&#8217;t get killed if a creature\n\t\tpasses the save, but you should strongly consider drawing attacks\n\t\tspecifically to force this effect on enemies. Disadvantage on saving throws\n\t\tagainst your spells in the following round means that a well-chosen\n\t\tsave-or-suck spell can immediately take the creature out of the fight.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-glamour-bard-ability-scores\">College of Glamour Bard Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Not useful for us unless doing silly\n\tthings.

Mage hand is great, we get a +1 Charisma, and a\n\t\tbonus action shove. Many players read this feat and think of ways to shove\n\t\tenemies around, but we can also use it to scoot our allies around if they\n\t\tvoluntarily fail the save (which the feat specifically allows). This can\n\t\treally save our team in a pinch, such as when an ally is grappled. It&#8217;s only\n\t\tgreen because of how many other Bonus Actions we&#8217;re going to have, but when\n\t\tyou need this tool it&#8217;s great to have.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-glamour-bard-weapons\">College of Glamour Bard Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Crossbow, Light<\/span>: We&#8217;re not that tanky and\n\t\twe don&#8217;t really have a ranged attack cantrip without a dip or feat, so this\n\t\tis a good option if we&#8217;re already keeping our Dexterity up.

A deeper dive of six will\n\t\tget to Aura of Protection, adding our Charisma mod to all saves for\n\t\tourselves and allies within 10 feet. At the absolute most I would push to\n\t\teight because seventh level gives us another aura from whatever Oath we take\n\t\tand eighth would give us an ASI. This is all to build on our unique AoE\n\t\tBardic Inspiration with more passive AoE support from Paladin Auras.<p>The biggest issue with Paladin is the 13 Strength requirement for\n\t\t\tmulticlassing. It becomes a juggling act to build this way (although a\n\t\t\tcase could be made for simply starting Paladin and wearing heavy armour to\n\t\t\tignore Dex), but it can be rewarding to have it all come together.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: Like the Paladin, we can get\n\t\tourselves some armour and a fighting style from Fighter. Unlike Paladin, we\n\t\tlose out on some multiclass spell slots for taking this option unless we go\n\t\tEldritch Knight, but Fighter allows multiclassing with either Strength or\n\t\tDexterity above 13, and a higher Dexterity is more likely on a Bard. The\n\t\tsample build later on in this guide will explore this option as we add a\n\t\tBattle Master onto a Glamour Bard to add more battlefield positioning\n\t\tmanipulation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-college-of-glamour-bard-build-the-marshal\">Example Build College of Glamour Bard Build &#8211; The Marshal<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Marshal was a class that appeared in D&amp;D Third Edition in the\n\tMiniatures Handbook book.

We could Mantle of Inspiration for a group reposition right before the fireball impact. There&#8217;s going to be even more creative and useful ways to use these tools than we have room for in this guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Now, if doubling down on that kind of tool-set is not your cup of tea,\n\tdon&#8217;t fret.

Alternatively, we\n\tcould take Fey Touched, still gaining +1 Charisma, but gaining the Bless spell\n\tfor one of the most efficient support spells in the game. For further\n\texplanation,\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">read this to learn why an average of +2.5 to hit breaks the game.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fourth level Bard, fifth overall, we&#8217;re taking Crossbow Expert. This gives us an additional attack whenever we&#8217;re not busy using our Bonus Action for other abilities. We can optionally lean further into the support role with Martial Initiate (Superior Technique) to get more dice and a Maneuver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, we could take our +2 Charisma ASI now, and then at Fighter Fourth, taking Martial Adept will give us an extra d8 instead of the d6 we would get for taking that before Battle Master, plus two more maneuvers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Fighter fourth and sixth, ninth and eleventh overall, we take +2 Charisma\n\tfirst to cap ourselves and then +2 Dexterity to improve our crossbow attacks\n\tand AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Bard eighth and twelfth, fourteenth and eighteenth overall, we continue\n\ttaking +2 Dexterity allowing us to cap it out to 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level and Class<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Bard 1<\/td><td>Custom Lineage Bonus Feat<br> <em>Telekinetic<\/em><br>Bardic Inspiration (d6)<br>Spellcasting<br>Cantrips Known:<br>&#8211; Mage Hand<br>&#8211; Vicious Mockery<br>&#8211; <a style=\"font-style: italic; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\" href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/practical-guide-to-illusions\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15461\">Minor Illusion<\/a><br>Spells Known:<br>&#8211; Comprehend Languages<br>&#8211; Faerie Fire<br>&#8211; Healing Word<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8989\">Silvery Barbs<\/a><\/td><td>We begin play with the Telekinetic feat as a bonus from Custom Lineage.

Manoeuvring Attack allows one ally to make a quick reposition.&nbsp;<br><br>Commanding Presence is an enhancement to our Face skills by allowing us to spend the Superiority Die on Intimidation or Persuasion checks (Performance too but we&#8217;re not concerned about those).
