None\n\t\tof the spells are on the Artificer spell list, so this adds a lot of new\n\t\tfunctionality.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Healing Word is among the\n\t\t\t\tmost essential spells in the game. Ray of Sickness is bad.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">5th Level<\/span>: Decent offensive options,\n\t\t\t\tbut nothing spectacular.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Both options are useful in\n\t\t\t\textremely common situations.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">13th Level<\/span>: A decent single-target\n\t\t\t\tdamage option and an absolutely crucial buff.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-green\">17th Level<\/span>: Raise Dead is\n\t\t\t\tsituational, and by this level other spellcasters have much better ways\n\t\t\t\tto raise the dead. Cloudkill is decent damage, but only if you can find\n\t\t\t\ta way to hold enemies in the area.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Experimental Elixir<\/span>: This is intentionally\n\t\thard to predict, which makes it hard to rely upon. When you get multiple\n\t\telixirs you&#8217;ll have several chances to get effects you care about, but the\n\t\tfree elixirs are still random. Since you roll the effects of the elixirs\n\t\twhen they&#8217;re created, you at least know what their effects will be, so\n\t\tyou&#8217;re not passing out random mystery cocktails to your party.\n\t\t<p>You can also spend a spell slot to create an additional elixir, which\n\t\t\tmeans that these are something like 1st-level spells. Think of the free\n\t\t\telixirs like a surprise that might be exactly what you need, but\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t count on them. Instead, expect to spend spell slots for elixirs.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Healing<\/span>: Basically a Potion of\n\t\t\t\tHealing. Nothing fancy, but always nice to have. When you later gain\n\t\t\t\tRestorative Reagents, this can be a great option because it both\n\t\t\t\trestores lost hit points and grants a pad of temporary hit points.\nThis provides as much healing as casting Cure Wounds as a 1st-level\n\t\t\t\t\tspell, but you also have the option of giving the elixir to an ally so\n\t\t\t\t\tthat they could use it themselves, and once you get Restorative Reagents\n\t\t\t\t\tit becomes much more powerful than anything that a 1st-level spell\n\t\t\t\t\tslot could replicate.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swiftness<\/span>: Situational, but the\n\t\t\t\tduration is nice and long and it stacks with things like Longstrider.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilience<\/span>: Similar to Shield of\n\t\t\t\tFaith, but half the effect and more costly to start (an action to drink\n\t\t\t\tthe elixir vs. a Bonus Action to cast Shield of Faith). Still, with a\n\t\t\t\t10-minute duration, the recipient can drink it ahead of time.\n\t\t\t\tA good buff for your party&#8217;s melee characters, especially if they&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tworking with relatively poor AC (barbarians, two-handed weapon users, etc.).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boldness<\/span>: Similar to Bless for a\n\t\t\t\tsingle target, and it notably stacks with Bless. With a 1-minute\n\t\t\t\tduration, the recipient will need to drink it immediately\n\t\t\t\tbefore combat starts or during combat, which is a hard way to spend\nand Action.\n\t\t\t\tI would happily spend 1st-level spell slots to buff my party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tmartial characters with this.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flight<\/span>: The ability to fly, even at\n\t\t\t\tsuch low speed, can solve a ton of problems.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transformation<\/span>: Situational. Alter\n\t\t\t\tSelf normally requires Concentration, so the fact that this doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tis great despite the shorter duration.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemical Savant<\/span>: Add your Intelligence\n\t\tmodifier to things like Healing Word, but also to things like Acid Splash,\n\t\tFire Bolt, and Poison Spray. This makes Acid Splash a very exciting cantrip\n\t\tbecause applying that damage to two targets is very effective, but you still\n\t\twant Fire Bolt as your go-to damage option for single targets.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Restorative Reagents<\/span>: Easy access to\n\t\tLesser Restoration without expending your extremely limited spell slots is\n\t\tnice, and the temporary hit points are a welcome addition to Experimental\n\t\tElixir because it means that even the least-useful elixir still provides a\n\t\ttangible benefit.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Chemical Mastery<\/span>: Two damage resistances,\n\t\tand you can cast two extremely powerful healing spells for free each day\n\t\twithout material components.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alchemist-artificer-ability-scores\">Alchemist Artificer Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/#ability-scores\">typical artificer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alchemist-artificer-races\">Alchemist Artificer Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/#races\">typical artificer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"alchemist-artificer-feats\">Alchemist Artificer Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Chef<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>:\n\tThe temporary hit points won&#8217;t stack with those from Experimental Elixir once you get\nRestorative Reagents.

Combined with the Alchemist&#8217;s Alchemical Savant, you can add your Intelligence to the damage of Chill Touch and Toll the Dead while targeting two adjacent creatures. What does this have to do with alchemy? Alternatively, you could go for Peace Cleric for Emboldening Bond. Combine that with Bless and Experimental Elixir (Boldness), and you can add 3d4 to attack rolls and saving throws. Beyond the 1st-level subclass features, there&#8217;s not a lot to be gained from a dip into Cleric since alchemists already get comparable 1st-level spells.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Sorcerer<\/span>: You can create an Experimental Elixir by spending a spell slot of any level, which means that melting down high-level spell slots for more elixirs may be helpful. Two levels should do the trick, but three for metamagic is nice, too.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Warlock<\/span>: Spell slots that recharge on a short rest.

This is technically a back-row support caster, but you&#8217;re as durable as a cleric before considering infusions and elixirs, so it&#8217;s entirely possible that you can wade into melee alongside your friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/#example\">staple build<\/a> is also an alchemist, but this build goes further afield, embracing the full range of available options rather than sticking to the SRD and Basic Rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll go for the ability scores suggested for ranged artificers in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2619\">Artificer Handbook<\/a>. We&#8217;ll be in light armor so that we can fly, so we want some Dexterity to pad our AC, but we&#8217;re going to be fighting at range and using a shield, so we have room to focus on Intelligence and feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fairy.

Artificer also gives us thieves&#8217; tools, tinker&#8217;s tools, and an artisan&#8217;s tool of our choice. We get Insight, investigation, disguise kit, and thieves&#8217; tools from our background.

We also want to pad our limited spellcasting where possible to leave more room for Experimental Elixir.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 4, we&#8217;ll take Fey Touched. For the 1st-level spell, we&#8217;ll select Bless. Stacking the d4 bonus to attacks and saves with Experimental Elixir (Boldness) is a huge mathematical advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 12, we&#8217;ll take War Caster. By this level we&#8217;re becoming extremely durable, so even though we&#8217;re building a back-row support character, we can start to walk into melee to help our party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our level 16 and 19 ASI&#8217;s are open. We could take Elemental Adept to help mitigate common fire resistance and still lean into one of our favorite damage types, but Elemental Bane solves the same problem. We could take Chef and pass out the snacks for when the temporary hp from Experimental Elixir are expended. We could skip the +2 Intelligence at level 8 and pick up more hybrid feats like Shadow Touched and Gift of the Gem Dragon.

Bless notably stacks with Experimental Elixir (Boldness), which means that we&#8217;ve effectively recreated the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/peace-domain\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15080\">Peace Domain Cleric<\/a>&#8216;s horrifying math problem.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Alchemical Savant<\/td><td>5th level is awesome for alchemists. You get both a subclass feature <em>and<\/em> 2nd-level spells.<br><br>At this level, Alchemical Savant is a +4 bonus to one roll per spell. Your cantrips also improve at this level, so you go from 1d6 with Acid Splash to 2d6+4, which is a massive increase, especially since you might hit two targets. Your leveled spells benefit, too; Healing Word is now 1d4+8 instead of 1d4+4.<br><br>Now that we have access to 2nd-level spells, start preparing Aid. Aid can function like Mass Healing Word in a pinch, and the additional maximum hit points make part of our party much more durable. Throw Bless and Experimental Elixir (Boldness) on them to cover attacks and saves, and they&#8217;re punching far above their weight.<br><br>We&#8217;ll ignore our 2nd-level subclass spells because our Bonus Action is dedicated to our Homunculus (so no Flaming Sphere) and Melf&#8217;s Acid Arrow is weak. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Tool Expertise<br>Experimental Elixir (2)<br>Infused Items: 3<br>New Infusions Known:<br>&#8211; Resistant Armor<br>&#8211; Spell-Refueling Ring<\/td><td>Better infusions and a second experimental elixir. With our new infusion we&#8217;ll get a Spell-Refueling Ring on most days unless we&#8217;re expecting to encounter a specific damage type repeatedly. The ring is intended to be for us, but you might share it temporarily if your party has a full spellcaster with good 3rd-level spells. Once your party&#8217;s full casters are casting 5th-level spells, ask for the ring back.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>Flash of Genius<\/td><td>+4 at this level and about to be +5.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase (18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>The Intelligence increase gets us better spellcasting and another prepared spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>Restorative Reagents<\/td><td>This is a great level. 3rd-level spells, and Restorative Reagents makes our Experimental Elixir much more impactful. The free elixirs are still unpredictable, which is annoying, but you can burn spell slots for extras if you want something specific.<br><br>Even at this level, you have just 9 spell slots total, so you need to really make them count. Avoid passing out all of your elixirs on the first encounter of the day.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Magic item Adept<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Green-Flame Blade<br>Infused Items: 4<br>New Infusions Known:<br>&#8211; Replicate Magic Item (Cloak of Protection)<br>&#8211; Replicate Magic Item (Winged Boots)<\/td><td>Winged Boots is for your allies in case they haven&#8217;t already found a way to fly. If you don&#8217;t need it, learn something else.<br><br>You finally get a third cantrip at this level, too. We&#8217;ll grab Green-Flame Blade in preparation for War Caster in a couple levels. It&#8217;s not the perfect solution here because we can&#8217;t apply the secondary damage and it doesn&#8217;t have Booming Blade&#8217;s deterrent effect, but it does apply the damage bonus from Alchemical Savant.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Spell-Storing Item<\/td><td>Spell-Storing Item is just stunningly good and it&#8217;s so much fun to use. Obvious examples include staple buffs like Invisibility or healing options like Lesser Restoration, but the more you lean into this, the more powerful it gets.<br><br>Remember: anyone can use this item, including your Homunculus Familiar. Since other creatures explicitly aren&#8217;t you, when they cast the spell, they&#8217;re the one potentially concentrating. This is great for having everyone in the party pass the item to cast Invisibility, or you can have your homunculus concentrate on buffs like Enhance Ability.<br><br>The Alchemist gets Flaming Sphere as a subclass spell, and we&#8217;ve ignored it until now. You know who never uses their Bonus Action? Our homunculus. Hand our homunculus our spell-storing item with Flaming Sphere, and now as a Bonus Action we can command our Homunculus both to shoot something and to roll their sphere around.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: War Caster<\/td><td>Advantage on Concentration checks, and we can cast single-target spells in place of opportunity attacks. Green-Flame Blade is our go-to, but if you have some save-or-suck options like Otiluke\u2019s Resilient Sphere (which you can get next level) also work.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>4th-level spells bring a few cool options. Arcane Eye is an excellent scouting option. Elemental Bane can be a big pile of damage quickly if you and your allies can agree on a single damage type to deal repeatedly. Remember that the extra damage is once per turn, so you can apply it on your turn, your homunculus&#8217;s turn, your target&#8217;s turn, and each of your ally&#8217;s turns.<br><br>Our subclass spells give us Blight (mediocre damage on a Con save) and Death Ward. Death Ward is an excellent defensive buff, especially if you&#8217;re facing undead. With an 8-hour duration, it&#8217;s easy to pre-cast this and let it monopolize your 4th-level spell slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Magic Item Savant<br>New Cantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Any<br>Infused Items: 5<br>New Infusions Known:<br>&#8211; Gem of Seeing<br>&#8211; Ring of Protection<\/td><td>Magic Item Savant lets you attune to 5 items, and conveniently you can now infuse 5 items. Hopefully by now you&#8217;ve found some permanent magic items so that you can share infusions with your friends, but if you need to pile infusions onto yourself, you&#8217;ll be doing just fine. Adding Ring of Protection to your infusion options means that we can stack it with Cloak of Protection for truly impressive defenses.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Chemical Mastery<br>Experimental Elixir (3)<\/td><td>Chemical Mastery is excellent, making you more durable and also allowing you to fill in for a cleric even more effectively.<br><br>We also get a third randomized elixir each day.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Any<\/td><td>See above under Feats.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>5th-level spells! Our subclass spells at this level won&#8217;t see a lot of use, but they&#8217;re prepared for free, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about it. 5th-level gets you access to Greater Restoration, but try to rely on Chemical Mastery instead. Wall of Stone is likely your go-to option.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Magic Item Master<br>Infused Items: 6<br>New Infusions Known:<br>&#8211; Any 2 <\/td><td>6 attuned items! By this level, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/starting-above-1st-level\/#wealth-by-level-table\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">typical game<\/a> you&#8217;ll have around 5 &#8220;major&#8221; magic items. Typically not all of those will require attunement, so you&#8217;ll likely want to reserve some infusions for yourself to fill all 6 slots.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>Feat: Any<\/td><td>See above under Feats.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>Soul of Artifice<\/td><td>Nice and tanky! Wander up to the front lines and make yourself a problem. With Cloak and Ring of Protection and any 4 other attuned items you&#8217;re looking at +2 AC, +8 to saves, and Flash of Genius if you still fail a save somehow.

It fills a role somewhere between a cleric-equivalent and a wizard-equivalent, making it a good option in small parties, but it will often be outshined in parties with multiple full casters. The Alchemist adds a number of excellent healing and support options to the Artificer, but doesn&#8217;t fundamentally change how the core class functions. You won&#8217;t be able to match the healing power of a full caster like the Cleric, but you&#8217;ll be able to cover those capabilities well enough to replace a cleric
