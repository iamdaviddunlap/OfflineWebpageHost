First, it never\n\t\t\t\tmisses, so it&#8217;s a great option when facing foes with high defenses.\n\t\t\t\tMagic Missile deals Force damage, which very few creatures are resistant\n\t\t\t\tto. 120 ft. range is plenty to keep you well out of harm&#8217;s way. And\n\t\t\t\tfinally, you can choose to cast it with 1, 2, or 3 Actions to increase\n\t\t\t\tthe effects at the expense of your time. Spending more Actions will get\n\t\t\t\tmore effect out of the spell, so it&#8217;s a more efficient use of your spell\n\t\t\t\tslots, but if you need to move or cast another spell in the same turn\n\t\t\t\tyou can still get some damage out of Magic Missile.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Mouth<\/span>: The fact that the\n\t\t\t\tduration of Magic Mouth is unlimited allows all sorts of shenanigans.\n\t\t\t\tYou can use this mail letters or leave messages for people, but you can\n\t\t\t\talso use the spell to create distractions. Cast Magic Mouth on an\n\t\t\t\tobject, and set the trigger to &#8220;the object is lifted from the ground&#8221;.\n\t\t\t\tKeep the object off the ground (a shelf or a pocket will suffice) and\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s ready whenever you need it. Make the message something like\n\t\t\t\tincoherent screaming or terrifying chanting in a language like infernal,\n\t\t\t\tand suddenly you have a very upsetting surprise that also serves as a\n\t\t\t\tmobile alarm against anything curious enough to pick up whatever bauble\n\t\t\t\tyou cast the spell on.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Levitate<\/span>: Only situationally useful,\n\t\t\t\tand generally you&#8217;ll abandon this the moment flight is readily\n\t\t\t\tavailable.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Blink<\/span>: The damage resistance is\n\t\t\t\tgreat, but the unpredictability of the movement can be a huge problem in\n\t\t\t\tclose quarters. You might find yourself accidently adjacent to an enemy\n\t\t\t\tor inside a wall. You could use this to get out of dangerous situations\n\t\t\t\tlike a grapple, but I wouldn&#8217;t use this while you&#8217;re trying to stay on\n\t\t\t\tthe offensive.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prying Eye<\/span>: An exceptionally powerful\n\t\t\t\tscouting option, Prying Eye allows you to scout dangerous areas from a\n\t\t\t\tsafe distance, and the eye&#8217;s small size can often slip it through\n\t\t\t\tobstacles by sneaking under doors or through cracked windows. The\n\t\t\t\tduration doesn&#8217;t expire until you fail to Sustain the spell, so given\n\t\t\t\tenough time you can send the eye great distances and scout huge areas.\n\t\t\t\tThe biggest limitation is that the eye uses your normal senses, so be\n\t\t\t\tsure that you have Low-Light Vision and\/or Darkvision so that you can\n\t\t\t\tsend the eye into dark places and still see.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Force<\/span>: Excellent area control.\n\t\t\t\tWall of part of an encounter with multiple foes, and suddenly the\n\t\t\t\tencounter gets a lot easier. The wall is big enough that enemies can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tquickly go around it (though they could go over it if they can fly), and\n\t\t\t\twith 30 hardness most creatures will struggle to break through it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Warp Mind<\/span>: I already don&#8217;t trust the\n\t\t\t\tConfused condition, and this is the Confusion spell but 3 levels higher\n\t\t\t\tand with the option of a permanent duration and it has the\n\t\t\t\tIncapacitation trait, so against major enemies which you would actually\n\t\t\t\tcare about making permanently confused it&#8217;s actually less effective than\n\t\t\t\tConfusion.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maze<\/span>: The target doesn&#8217;t get a save\n\t\t\t\tagainst being put in the maze. You need to spend an Action every turn to\n\t\t\t\tSustain the Spell, but one Action to remove the target from combat for\n\t\t\t\tseveral rounds is frequently worth both the spell slot and the action\n\t\t\t\tcost. Maze the biggest thing in the encounter, kill everything else,\n\t\t\t\tthen drop a bunch of problems into the space that the creature will\n\t\t\t\tre-emerge into before it escapes or before you willingly end the\n\t\t\t\tspell.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Disjunction<\/span>: Very situational.\n\t\t\t\tGenerally you don&#8217;t want to risk permanently disenchanting loot.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"norgorber\"><a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Deities.aspx?ID=13\" class=\"rating-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Norgorber<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As befits the god of assassins and thieves, clerics of norgorber are well\n\tsuited to a high-Dexterity built with rogue-like skills.

The spell ends if you perform\n\t\t\t\ta &#8220;hostile action&#8221;, and while that&#8217;s not explicitly defined it likely\n\t\t\t\tincludes anything which requires an attack roll or which affects another\n\t\t\t\tcreature in a harmful way even if it doesn&#8217;t require an attack roll or\n\t\t\t\tsaving throw. It&#8217;s unclear what happens if you do something like cast\n\t\t\t\tWall of Fire while invisible, so check with your GM. Generally you can\n\t\t\t\tget away with being inivisible in combat while doing things like casting\n\t\t\t\tbuff spells and area control spells, but I don&#8217;t know if commanding pets\n\t\t\t\tor summoned creatures to attack counts as a &#8220;hostile action&#8221;. The\n\t\t\t\t4th-level version of the spell reduces the duration but allows you to\n\t\t\t\tmake hostile actions without breaking the spell, so you can spend a\n\t\t\t\tminute invisibly blaster your enemies.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Phantasmal Killer<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tgreat (a 4th-level Fireball does the same amount of damage), and while\n\t\tFrightened is a great debuff I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s enough to make up the\n\t\tdifference.

If you&#8217;re generous, you might cast this on one or more of your\n\t\t\t\tallies, especially front-line allies who are likely to draw a lot of\n\t\t\t\tattacks. Unfortunately, the scaling on the spell isn&#8217;t great, so I\n\t\t\t\trecommend only casting False Life as a 2nd-level spell where your\n\t\t\t\tspellcasting ability modifier is the largest portion of the total number\n\t\t\t\tof temporary Hit Points.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mask of Terror<\/span>: Similar in concept to\n\t\t\t\tSanctuary, but less fragile.
