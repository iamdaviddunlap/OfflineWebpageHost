Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"investigator-talents\">Investigator Talents<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an\n\tinvestigator&#8217;s Studied Combat or Studied Strike. Only one of these talents can\n\tbe applied to an individual attack, but the decision can be made when the\n\tdamage is dealt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemist Discovery<\/span> (Ex): Access to some of\n\tthe best Alchemist Discoveries for buffing your Infusions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combine extracts<\/span>: Fantastic, especially\n\t\tfor healing extracts and extracts with short durations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Concentrate poison<\/span>: The biggest problems\n\t\twith poison are price and DC. This helps with the DC issue, but the\n\t\tadditional cost may be prohibitive.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dilution<\/span>: This is a great way to save\n\t\tmoney on potions, but by 12th level the cost of most potions should be\n\t\tfairly cheap.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elixir of life<\/span>: Hugely expensive and\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Enhance potion<\/span>: Squeeze some extra healing\n\t\tor some extra buff duration out of your potions without spending a ton of\n\t\tgold to make your potions higher caster level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eternal potion<\/span>: There are a ton of potions\n\t\twhich this would be fantastic for.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extend potion<\/span>: Great for buffs with short\n\t\tand medium durations.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Infusion<\/span>: Share your extracts with your\n\t\tallies. Essential if you don&#8217;t have a decent support caster handy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mutagen<\/span> (Su): An excellent way to get a\n\t\tlong-duration bonus to your Dexterity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Poison Conversion<\/span>: Turn all of your\n\t\tpoisons into injury or contact poisons. Ingested poisons tend to be the\n\t\tbest, but the hardest to use, so abuse them heavily.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Amazing Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): This only means\n\tan average of 1 higher on your inspiration die rolls, but combines very well\n\twith Tenacious Inspiration.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blinding Strike<\/span>* (Ex): Permanently blinded?\n\tThis is fantastic, and I can see why it&#8217;s reserve for level 17.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): Using Inspiration\n\ton your saves is a great way to keep yourself alive, and cutting down on the\n\tInspiration cost will help keep you going all day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Confusing Strike<\/span>* (Ex): This is not nearly\n\tgood enough to be reserved for 19th level.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deafening Strike<\/span>* (Ex): Deafness really\n\tonly affects spellcasters, so this is situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Device Talent<\/span> (Ex): UMD is a class skill, and\n\twhile it&#8217;s fantastic, you don&#8217;t want your expensive magic item charges to be\n\tdependent on a die roll. Instead, pick up the Pragmatic Activator Trait so\n\tthat you can use your high Intelligence instead of your mediocre Charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Effortless Aid<\/span> (Ex): The Swift Aid Feat is\n\tbetter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Eidetic Recollection<\/span> (Su): Not only are you\n\tgood at Knowledge, you are <em>consistently<\/em> good at Knowledge. Of course\n\tyou can add Inspiration to Knowledge rolls for free, but reliability is\n\tnice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Empathy<\/span> (Ex, Su): Situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Expanded Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): More free uses\n\tof Inspiration is always nice, and Diplomacy, Heal, and Perception see a ton\n\tof use.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Combat Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): Combat\n\tInspiration is great, so most Investigators will take it. Pick your favorite\n\tweapon, and get a permanent 1d6 bonus to attacks with it. I can see why this\n\tis reserved for level 19, especially in the face of Amazing\/Tenacious\n\tInspiration.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Hidden Agendas<\/span> (Ex): Very situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Inspirational Expertise<\/span> (Ex): A +4 insight\n\tbonus is pretty nice, even if the duration is short.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspired Alertness<\/span> (Ex): Situational by\n\tdesign. If your Perception is poor and your GM likes ambushes, this can save\n\tyou a lot of trouble.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Inspired Intimidator<\/span> (Ex): Skill Focus\n\t(Intimidate) will pay off better (especially after 10th level), and doesn&#8217;t\n\tcost inspiration.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Item Lore<\/span> (Ex): Very situational, and you\n\tprobably have someone in the party who can do it, or you can pay some NPC to\n\tcast Identify for you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Perceptive Tracking<\/span> (Ex): Very\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Study<\/span> (Ex): The text appears to be\n\tincorrect: Studied Combat is a move action by default, but dropping that to a\n\tswift action is phenomenal. I would take this on every Investigator without\n\tquestion, and I would probably take it as my first Talent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Repositioning Strike<\/span>* (Ex): Reposition is\n\tvery situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue Talent<\/span> (Ex): Most of the options are\n\tbad, redundant with your Infusions, or can be replaced by Inspiration.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">assault leader<\/span> (Ex): Because the\n\t\tInvestigator doesn&#8217;t depend on flanking as much as the Rogue, this isn&#8217;t as\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">black market connections<\/span> (Ex): If you are\n\t\thigh enough level for this ability to matter, you likely have access to\n\t\tteleportation spells available to your party. Teleport to a bigger city and\n\t\tgo shopping.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Camouflage<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational. With\n\t\tdecent and maxed ranks in Stealth, you shouldn&#8217;t need this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Canny Observer<\/span> (Ex): Hugely situational.\n\t\tHow often do you eavesdrop?<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Charmer<\/span> (Ex): While this is tempting for a\n\t\tRogue, you will do better with Expanded Inspiration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Coax Information<\/span> (Ex): This functionally\n\t\tsaves you an entire skill worth of skill ranks. If you&#8217;re the party&#8217;s Face\n\t\tand don&#8217;t have enough skill ranks to throw around, this can be very\n\t\thelpful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Combat Swipe<\/span>: Stealing isn&#8217;t something\n\t\tyou typically do in combat. Sneak in and use Sleight of Hand like a real\n\t\tRogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Convincing Lie<\/span> (Ex): I didn&#8217;t even know\n\t\tthat there were rules for people repeating your lies. This is hugely\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cunning Trigger<\/span> (Ex): Unless you took\n\t\tQuick Trapsmith, this is totally useless. Even then, if you&#8217;re using traps a\n\t\tlot you should be placing your traps in such a way that you don&#8217;t need to\n\t\ttrigger them yourself.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deft Palm<\/span> (Ex): I would let a player hide a\n\t\tweapon in plain sight without this talent. I would apply a fairly high\n\t\tpenalty, but I would allow it. Even if your DM isn&#8217;t as liberal as I am,\n\t\tthis is hugely situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Expert Leaper<\/span> (Ex): There are very few\n\t\tsituations where this will come up, and those situations can usually be\n\t\tsolved by flying.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fast Fingers<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are\n\t\tfantastic, but Sleight of Hand doesn&#8217;t see a lot of use in most\n\t\tcampaigns.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Getaway<\/span> (Ex): This is good for Scout\n\t\tRogues, or for archery rogues who get stuck in melee. Sapping Offensive is\n\t\tgenerally better unless multiple foes are threatening you. If multiple foes\n\t\tare threatening you, you should probably just Withdraw.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Fast Picks<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fast Stealth<\/span> (Ex): This can be helpful\n\t\tfor infiltrating and scouting, but if you&#8217;re sneaky enough you shouldn&#8217;t\n\t\thave a problem moving at half speed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">firearm training<\/span> (Ex): Studied Combat and\n\t\tStudied Strike only work on melee attacks, and they&#8217;re your primary source\n\t\tof damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Guileful Polyglot<\/span> (Ex): Cast tongues.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">grit<\/span> (Ex): Firearms don&#8217;t work for\n\t\tInvestigators<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hard to Fool<\/span> (Ex): Rerolls are great, but\n\t\tthis is very situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Hold Breath<\/span> (Ex): Cast Water Breathing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Honeyed Words<\/span> (Ex): You will do better\n\t\twith Underworld Inspiration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Iron Guts<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Lasting Poison<\/span> (Ex): The biggest problem\n\t\twith poison is the cost. This doubles your mileage with poisons, but\n\t\texacerbates the issue of low DCs. If you&#8217;re planning to use poison,\n\t\tdefinitely consider this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ledge Walker<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">major magic<\/span> (Sp): You get Infusions, so you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t really need magic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">minor magic<\/span> (Sp): You get Infusions, so you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t really need magic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nimble Climber<\/span> (Ex): Cast Spider Climb.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Peerless Maneuver<\/span> (Ex): Good for tumbling\n\t\tto avoid attacks of opportunity.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Disable<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">quick disguise<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"\">quick trapsmith<\/span> (Ex): Traps can be useful, but very\n\t\tfew fights take place on the players&#8217; home turf.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resiliency<\/span> (Ex): This is almost\n\t\ttoughness. With some discipline, toughness is better because you always have\n\t\tthe hit points. If you tend to get yourself into bad situations, this is a\n\t\tnice fail-safe.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rogue Crawl<\/span> (Ex): If you are prone, you\n\t\tare in serious trouble. The best use of this is to 5-foot step\/crawl away,\n\t\tthen stand as a move action.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rope Master<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Stand Up<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational. You\n\t\tshould not be tripped enough to justify taking this.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Strong Stroke<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Terrain Mastery<\/span> (Ex): Favored Terrain is\n\t\tone of the Ranger&#8217;s worst abilities.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Trap Spotter<\/span> (Ex): This saves you the\n\t\ttrouble of constantly looking around for traps.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wall Scramble<\/span> (Ex): Highly situational.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sapping Offensive<\/span>* (Ex): This doesn&#8217;t\n\tspecify that you need to damage the target with an attack, which is\n\tpotentially abusable, but this is still situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Sickening Offensive<\/span>* (Ex): Sickened is a\n\tdecent status condition, applying penalties to attacks, damage, and saves.\n\tThis can be a good way to debuff enemies, or to set them up to be hit with a\n\tspell next round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stealing Strike<\/span>* (Ex): Situational, but\n\tcertainly better than taking Improved Steal.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Studied Defense<\/span> (Ex): Insight bonuses to AC\n\tare rare, and the scaling it good. This could be good in a pitch, but it will\n\tseverely inhibit the Investigator&#8217;s damage output.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Tenacious Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): 1d6 has an\n\taverage of 3.5. Rolling twice and taking the highest increases that to 4.7.\n\tTaking Amazing Inspiration to boost your Inspiration die to d8&#8217;s will increase\n\tyour average to 5.8. If you really depend on your Inspiration die, Amazing and\n\tTenacious Inspiration are a good investment.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Toppling Strike<\/span>* (Ex): Tripping a target\n\tmakes them very vulnerable to melee attacks, and getting a free Trip after\n\tthrowing a pile of d6&#8217;s is great. Combine this with Improved\/Greater Trip, and\n\tyou can really get a lot done.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Unconventional Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): At 17th\n\tlevel your skill bonuses should be absurd, and devoting the equivalent of a\n\tfeat to one skill is a poor use of an excellent resource. Skill Focus would be\n\tconsiderably better at this point, which is pitiful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Underworld Inspiration<\/span> (Ex): The listed\n\tskills are situational, but a constant free 1d6 bonus to all of them is nice\n\tif you can bring them into play often.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investigator Talents Investigator talents marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to an investigator&#8217;s Studied Combat or Studied Strike.
