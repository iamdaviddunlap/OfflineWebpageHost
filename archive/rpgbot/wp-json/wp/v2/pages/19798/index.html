The system works to prevent streaks of low rolls, which is intended both to make things less frustrating and to speed up combat.

We\u2019ll have more as we add optimization handbooks, but here are some highlights:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Dragonborn: Dragonborn have tails. Otherwise they match the 2014 PHB.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dwarves\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gold (AKA Hill Dwarves): No changes. +1 hp per level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shield (AKA Mountain Dwarves): The ability score changes mean no second +2 increase. You do still get medium armor proficiency.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Duergar: Advantage on saves vs. illusions, charm, and paralysis. Innate spellcasting and Superior Darkvision are unchanged.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elves\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>High: No changes. You get a wizard cantrip.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wood: Mask of the Wild (which is terrible) is replaced by proficiency in Stealth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drow are a full race with two subraces.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Lolth-sworn: Red eyes by default, get some additonal evil dialog choices, and get locked out of some other dialog choices.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seldarine:&nbsp;Nothing extra.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Githyanki: Martial Prodigy (proficiency light armor, medium armor, short swords, long swords, greatswords) and Mage Hand remain, but Jump is gone (Jump is renamed, but that\u2019s not relevant here), and Decadent Mastery is replaced with Astral Knowledge, which is stunningly good. Pick an ability score and get proficiency with all skills for that ability until your next long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma each have 4 skills; Dexterity has three. Also, you can pick it in the middle of a conversation before you attempt a roll, giving yourself an edge should you need to unexpectedly diplomacize or pass a knowledge check.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Half-elves: Half-elves don\u2019t get three ability score increases as they do in the 2014 PHB, and the standard half-elf is gone. You get Darkvision and a subrace.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Drow: No changes. You get the Drow\u2019s innate spellcasting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>High: You get a wizard cantrip; no choice of weapon proficiencies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wild: You get fleet of foot (speed bonus) and proficiency in stealth. Honestly, this is better than what they get in the official rules.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Half-Orcs: Savage attacks now triples all damage dice on a crit rather than adding a single extra weapon damage die. This makes it much more impactful and also doesn\u2019t punish you for using a greatsword over a greataxe. Consider a crit fishing build (champion fighter+barbarian), but remember that the level cap is only 12.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Halflings: Halfling nimbleness doesn\u2019t exist, but otherwise no changes from the PHB, including to the subraces.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Humans: Standard humans in the PHB get +1 to all scores, but that\u2019s gone. Instead, you get proficiency in light armor, shields, some simple weapons like spears, one skill, and a boost to carrying capacity. Variant humans aren\u2019t a thing, so no feats at first level. If you want armor, pick mountain dwarf. If you want skills, pick Githyanki. If you want more carrying capacity, remember that you can click &#8220;send to camp&#8221; on items in your inventory.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gnomes: Gnome Cunning now applies to ALL int\/wis\/cha saving throws rather than only against spells, which is a massive buff.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Forest: No free Minor Illusion, but you get Speak With Animals for free, which means that you can always talk to animals even if you\u2019re not a druid or a ranger (or a wild barbarian, or a warlock with a certain invocation, etc.). This may not seem mechanically impactful, but this spell gates many of the most hilarious dialogue available in the game.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rock: Tinker is gone, and Artificer\u2019s Lore is changed to expertise on History checks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Deep (Svirfneblin): Stone Camouflage is now Advantage on stealth checks at all times, which is a huge benefit for characters like rangers and rogues (until and unless you get The Graceful Cloth or some other item which provides the same benefit).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tieflings: No changes to the core traits, but you get to choose one of three subraces, which work like the variants introduced in Mordenkainen\u2019s Tome of foes. With the ability score increase changes, this effectively means that you get to choose your innate spellcasting.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Asmodeus: Thaumaturgy (which has changed to Advantage on Intimidation\/Perform for one minute), Hellish Rebuke, Darkness.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mephistopheles: Mage Hand, Burning Hands, Flame Blade (which now works like a normal weapon and lasts until you take a long rest).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Zariel: Thaumaturgy, searing smite (works with ranged attacks), branding smite. Smite spells have been changed to not consume your spell slot (the daily casting in this case) or your Bonus Action if you miss with the attack.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Being small is even less of an issue in BG3 than in 5e.

This notably includes potions of healing, allowing you to throw a healing potion to heal unconscious allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Attunement is not a thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spell scrolls do not have a fixed save DC or attack bonus; instead, they are based on the stats of the character using the scroll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"combat\">Combat<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"initiative\">Initiative<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Initiative is d4+Dex instead of d20+dex, so high-Dexterity characters can be mathematically unbeatable.

While targeting an enemy, you may see a message saying \u201cpath interrupted\u201d, which means that your line of sight is blocked. Attacks can\u2019t be made without line of sight, so breaking line of sight by moving can force enemies to move or prevent attacks altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"movement\">Movement<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There is no grid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumping is a bonus action which consumes 3 meters\/10 feet of movement speed, and can typically allow you to jump further even with 8 Strength than you could move with that same 3 meters\/10 feet of movement. If you are not planning to use your Bonus Action, it\u2019s free movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Strength score of 10 or below, a creature can jump 4.5 meters\/15 ft, and this increases by 1.5 meters\/5 ft for every two points in strength above 10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"facing\">Facing<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Facing exists. Creatures can only see within their cone of vision, which means that if you exit that creature&#8217;s cone you&#8217;ll be able to Hide. You may also be able to forcibly change other creatures&#8217; facing by using effects like <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/spells\/minor-illusion\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"19967\">Minor Illusion<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"high-ground\">High Ground<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>When a creature is at least 3 meters\/10 feet above their target and makes a ranged attack, they receive a +2 bonus to attack rolls. Conversely, when a creature is at least 3 meters\/10 feet below their target and makes a ranged attack, they receive a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Combat environments frequently include elevation changes, so look for ways to gain elevation with your ranged attackers. Jumping will frequently allow you to move up and down considerable distances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: a +2\/-2 changes your DPR by roughly 10%, so the modifier is significant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"action-economy\">Action Economy<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>You can now throw other creatures as an Action. The thrown creature must be at least one size smaller than you, there is a Strength requirement based on the target&#8217;s weight, and you need to win a contested Athletics check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All characters may use the Help Action. This action raises dying allies to 1 hit point, and also covers any action that a creature could take to help another creature recover from a status condition, such as a creature affected by the Sleep spell.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stuff-you-cant-do\">Stuff You Can\u2019t Do<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Dodge (Monks can do this via Patient Defense)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grapple<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ready<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shove creatures prone<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spellcasting\">Spellcasting<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"preparing-spells\">Preparing Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Prepared spell casters may change their prepared spells at any time outside of combat.

Ritual spells must be prepared\/known to be cast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: find familiar can be cast as a ritual. Because you can change prepared spells at any time outside of combat, you can prepare the ritual, cast it, then change your prepared spells to be combat-ready.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ritual Caster feat allows you to learn and cast two Ritual Spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14c - incontent_14 -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-165\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14c - incontent_14 -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Changes to individual spells are numerous and significant. It\u2019s best to look at them fresh rather than compare them to the 2014 PHB rules.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conditions\">Conditions<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Blinded: In addition to the other effects (Advantage to be hit, Disadvantage to attack), ranged attacks are limited to 15 ft range. Blinded creatures can still make opportunity attacks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Frightened: Creatures which are frightened are unable to move at all (rather than being unable to move toward the source of their fear), unless the effect instead makes them &#8220;fearful&#8221; which gives them the frightened effect as well as making them flee.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prone: Being prone gives disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, attacks against a prone creature have advantage out to a range of 3 meters\/10 feet rather than 5 feet (great for Extra Rach weapons), and ranged attacks against a prone creature do not have disadvantage. Your character cannot do anything while prone. Starting the turn while prone will cause you to automatically use half your movement to stand up. Becoming prone during your turn automatically ends your turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turned: Turned creatures will not dodge, as it is not implemented as an action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wet: New condition. Prevents the character from burning (e.g. from Searing Smite) and grants resistance to fire damage, but also makes the creature vulnerable to lightning and cold damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is based heavily on the 5e ruleset, and is largely a faithful adaptation.
