Unfortunately, because\n\tthe subraces differentiate the Elf&#8217;s traits so much, it&#8217;s rare for more than\n\tone subrace to be viable in the same class unless you&#8217;re using the Customizing\n\tYour Origins optional rules presented in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Since the initial release of 5th edition, the evolution of the game has\n\trepeatedly shaken up the Elf&#8217;s place in the character optimization meta. At\n\tinitial release, the Wood Elf was the only race with increases to Dexterity\n\tand Wisdom (excluding humans and half-elves since they have flexible\n\tincreases), and the Elf was one of very few races which got additional skills,\n\tespecially since elves get Perception. This made them appealing in many\n\tbuilds, including Druids and Monks. As we got additional source books, the\n\tintroduction of Booming Blade made the High Elf a powerful option for rogues\n\tand for &#8220;gish&#8221; builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of the custom origin rules was a big hit to the Elf, making\n\tthe Wood Elf largely pointless, but making other elf subraces much more\n\tappealing. The High Elf especially is now an even more appealing option for\n\tgish builds since you can reassign the Intelligence increase to something\n\telse, making the High Elf an appealing option for martial bard builds,\n\tclerics, druid, rogues, and some multiclass builds. The Drow&#8217;s innate\n\tspellcasting is appealing for Charisma-based spellcasters. The sea elf exists.\n\tThe Eladrin and the Shadar-kai offer teleportation for martial builds,\n\tespecially non-casters. There&#8217;s an elf for every build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Elves are one of very few published races with an aquatic option. While the\n\tSea Elf is conceptually interesting, it gets very little beyond the ability to\n\tfunction well underwater, so I habitually ignore it in my character\n\toptimization content.

An extra cantrip\n\tis a great addition to the Artificer&#8217;s somewhat limited spellcasting. However,\n\tthe Artificer takes most of their cantrips from the Wizard&#8217;s spell lists, and\n\tall the obvious options that you might want (Booming Blade, Fire Bolt, etc.)\n\tare already on the Artificer&#8217;s spell list. You don&#8217;t get anything new, just\n\tmore of the same. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, of course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re fine with the Artificer&#8217;s limited number of cantrips, consider the\n\tEladrin (either version) or the Shadar-Kai. Both will give you access to\n\tteleportation long before you get it from the Artificer&#8217;s spellcasting, and it\n\twill help conserve precious spell slots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-barbarian\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\">Barbarian<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eladrin (the version in Mordenkainen&#8217;s Tome of Foes) and the Shadar-Kai\n\toffer access to teleportation, which is a powerful asset for a class so\n\theavily locked into melee. Avoid the Drow, the Pallid Elf, and the High Elf\n\tsince you can&#8217;t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-bard\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\">Bard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to Booming Blade might be single most simplest way to make front-line\n\tbards viable, despite getting two subclasses (swords and valor) which attempt\n\tto make that happen, so the High Elf is a great choice. For casting-focused\n\tbards, the Drow&#8217;s innate spellcasting is a powerful addition, and the Eladrin\n\t(both kinds) offers access to teleportation. The Shadar-Kai is also an option,\n\tbut their teleportation is only once per day, so the Eladrin is a better\n\tchoice for a spellcaster who doesn&#8217;t need to teleport into the thick of melee\n\tcombat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-cleric\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\">Cleric<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Clerics planning to use weapons struggle to keep up with clerics relying\n\tsolely on cantrips. Even with the benefit of Divine Strike,\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/#divine-strike-vs-cantrips\">cantrips are still more effective<\/a>. Access to Booming Blade makes melee weapon attacks a viable option, so the\n\tHigh Elf is again a great choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For casting-focused clerics, the Pallid Elf&#8217;s innate spellcasting is\n\ttempting, but you can get similar benefits from the Trickery Domain. The\n\tEladrin (either version) may also be appealing since clerics don&#8217;t have\n\tshort-range teleportation on their spell list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-druid\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\">Druid<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Booming Blade is great option for Circle of Spores.

The Wood Elf exists, but Mask of the Wild isn&#8217;t\n\tespecially powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-fighter\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\">Fighter<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eladrin and the Shadar-Kai are appealing for melee builds who want access\n\tto teleportation.

Combining this\n\tcapability with the Horizon Walker can be a very satisfying build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While rangers typically rely on on-hit damage bonuses from things like\n\tFavored Foe or Hunter&#8217;s Mark, a high elf with Booming Blade is still an\n\toption, especially if you have a subclass feature that takes a Bonus Action\n\tand adds an on-hit damage bonus like the Fey Wanderer&#8217;s Dreadful Strikes since\n\tthose features often make Hunter&#8217;s Mark less appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-rogue\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\">Rogue<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rogue has a lot of great options. The Drow&#8217;s spellcasting offers easy\n\tways to get Advantage or otherwise solve problems. The High Elf&#8217;s access to\n\tBooming Blade offers easy hit-and-run tactics in conjunction with Cunning\n\tAction. The Eladrin and the Shadar-Kai offer access to teleportation, though\n\tCunning Action might make that less important. The Pallid elf&#8217;s ability to\n\tcast Invisibility is very appealing for any rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-sorcerer\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drow and the Pallid Elf both offer some innate spellcasting, and having\n\taccess to additional spells, even just once per day, is huge for the Sorcerer.\n\tSimilarly, the Eladrin offers teleportation which you would normally get from\n\tMisty Step, allowing you to safely skip that crucial tactical option and spend\n\tyour extremely limited number of spells known on other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-warlock\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\">Warlock<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drow&#8217;s access to Faerie Fire is a powerful tool for a warlock built\n\taround Eldritch Blast, and any amount of innate spellcasting is helpful for a\n\tclass with so few spell slots. Similarly, the Eladrin and the Shadar-Kai offer\n\taccess to teleportation without the high price of a spell slot. High Elf&#8217;s\n\taccess to a cantrip is nice, but the Warlock gets enough of them that it\n\tdoesn&#8217;t add anything meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-origin-wizard\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\">Wizard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An elf wizard is one of those classic DnD tropes that dates back to the\n\tearliest editions. High elves in particular were the &#8220;default&#8221; race for\n\twizards in the core rules. But with Intelligence increases available on any\n\trace, the High Elf is no longer just &#8220;the one you pick for wizards&#8221;, and\n\tstrangely it&#8217;s probably not the best elf option, either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the High Elf&#8217;s additional cantrip is nice, the wizard arguably already\n\tgets enough to get by. Unless you really want that cantrip, the Eladrin is a\n\tbetter choice. A 2nd-level spell slot spent on Misty Step (not to mention\n\tpreparing it) can be a steep cost, so having built-in teleportation is a\n\tpowerful option. The Pallid elf similarly reduces the need to prepare\n\tInvisibility.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-default\">Elf Classes (Default Rules)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This section assumes that you&#8217;re <em>not<\/em> using the option &#8220;Customizing Your Origin&#8221; rules presented in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything or the updated version of the race published in Mordenkainen&#8217;s Monsters of the Multiverse.

High elf rogues should consider booming blade, which\n\tmakes for great hit-and-run tactics when combined with Cunning Action. Mark of\n\tShadow offers several excellent options for the Rogue, even if you don&#8217;t plan\n\tto pursue Arcane Trickster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rogue is, in my opinion, the single best use case for Elven Accuracy. If\n\tyou&#8217;re consistently relying on Advantage to deliver Sneak attack the extra die\n\timproved your chance of rolling a natural 20 (and therefore a critical hit)\n\tfrom 9.75% to 14.26%. And if you&#8217;ve ever gotten to roll a critical hit with\n\tSneak Attack you understand how exciting it is to roll all of those dice. If\n\tyou use the Steady Aim Optional Class Feature in conjunction with Elven\n\tAccuracy, you get to roll that nonsese almost every turn. It honestly feels\n\tlike cheating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sorcerer\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drow, Eladrin, and Mark of Shadow elves all get Charisma increases, which is\n\treally all that you need to succeed as a sorcerer, but they don&#8217;t add\n\tcapabilities which the sorcerer couldn&#8217;t already provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"warlock\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\">Warlock<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drow, Eladrin, and Mark of Shadow elves make excellent warlocks. Extra\n\tCharisma is all that you truly need, but Dexterity helps to pad the Warlock&#8217;s\n\tAC in light armor, which is crucial for Hexblades. Drow innate spellcasting\n\thelps to complement the Warlock&#8217;s limited spell slots, and be sure to pick up\n\tDevil&#8217;s Sight to capitalize on the ability to cast Darkness. Eladrin can\n\tteleport, reducing the need for Misty Step. Mark of Shadow grants some extra\n\tspellcasting, and adds several new spell options to the Warlock&#8217;s spell\n\tlist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"wizard\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\">Wizard<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A high elf wizard is among the most obvious and iconic wizard builds. All you\n\ttruly need to succeed as a wizard is an Intelligence increase, and the core\n\tElf&#8217;s Dexterity increase and Perception proficiency will help to keep you\n\talive. One extra cantrip may not seem like much since you already start with\n\tthree, but cantrips are very powerful and an extra can do a lot to diversify\n\tyour capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Elf Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"elven-accuracy\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/elven-accuracy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elven Accuracy<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you can get Advantage reliably, this is a fantastic feat. The +1 ability\n\tincrease is nice, but the reroll mechanic is the real draw here. You need\n\tAdvantage to trigger the reroll, but you can reroll one die each time you roll\n\twith Advantage (though you&#8217;re limited to attack\/checks\/saves with the four\n\tlister ability scores), so Advantage is essentially rolling three dice and\n\tchoosing the highest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a little unusual to lean into Elven Accuracy this far, but my blog post\n\t&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/oops-all-elves\/\">Oops All Elves<\/a>&#8221; dives into\n\texactly how crazy you can get by building a party around one feat.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"revenant-blade\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/feats\/revenant-blade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revenant Blade<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">ERLW<\/a><\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re proficient with martial weapons and want to engage in two-weapon\n\tfighting, the Double Scimitar is appealing (provided that it&#8217;s available in\n\tyour game). Since the primary attack has a larger damage die than weapons\n\twhich qualify for two-weapon fighting, you&#8217;ll get more average damage once you\n\tgain Extra Attack. However, most builds which use two-weapon fighting are\n\tDexterity-based, so without the Revenant Blade feat the double scimitar can be\n\ta hard choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re building for two-weapon fighting, Revenant Blade is an improvement\n\tis excellent but not necessarily your best option. It&#8217;s an option to replace\n\tDual Wielder, and Revenent Blade isn&#8217;t always better. Both feats provide a +1\n\tAC bonus, so let&#8217;s ignore that and compare the differences:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenant Blade adds the Finesse property to the Double Scimitar, making it\n\tequivalent to using a rapier and a dagger with Fighting Style (Two-Weapon\n\tFighting). Dual Wielder allows you to use non-light weapons while two-weapon\n\tfighting, allowing you to use two rapiers, two longswords, or something else\n\talong those lines. Two rapiers is better damage than a double scimitar (if we\n\tignore magic weapons), but Revenant Blade adds a +1 increase to either\n\tStrength or Dexterity (probably Dexterity) and doesn&#8217;t require a Fighting\n\tStyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you hit 20 Dexterity, Dual Wielder with Fighting Style (Two-Weapon Fighting) will have better damage output because two rapiers are again more powerful. But the possibility of magic items tips things toward Revenant Blade since it&#8217;s easier to find one magic weapon than two, and the resource cost to spend a Fighting Style is steep, so taking a Fighting Style (Defense) with Revenant Blade is typically a more effective combination than Dual Weilder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We go into this in more detail in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/weaponized-bonus-actions\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"13340\">Practical Guide to Weaponized Bonus Actions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dragonmarks\">Elf Dragonmarks<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Dragonmarks are detailed in Eberron: Rising from the Last War.
