Circle of the Land adds almost nothing in terms of complexity to the Druid, which is great because it&#8217;s already such a complex class. However, if you can&#8217;t get by on just the Druid&#8217;s spellcasting, Circle of the Land won&#8217;t solve that problem for you because it expands on the Druid&#8217;s existing spellcasting capabilities but doesn&#8217;t add any new capabilities to the class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Land is arguably the most approachable full spellcaster. You\n\tdon&#8217;t need to manage spells known like a sorcerer, you don&#8217;t need to manage a\n\tspellbook like a wizard, and in combat where things get messy, you can largely\n\tignore the Druid&#8217;s other class features and focus solely on your spellcasting.\n\tThis makes the Circle of the Land Druid a great option for new players to\n\tlearn how to play a spellcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, that simplicity means that experienced players and players who like to engage with the mechanics may find that Circle of the Land doesn&#8217;t have enough buttons to push to hold their interest in a long-running game. With the subclass&#8217;s simple needs and low built-in complexity, you have lots of room to explore feats and other complex player options to expand your capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Circle of the Land Druid Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-land-druid-ability-scores\">Circle of the Land Druid Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-land-druid-races\">Circle of the Land Druid Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-land-druid-feats\">Circle of the Land Druid Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-land-druid-weapons\">Circle of the Land Druid Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-land-druid-armor\">Circle of the Land Druid Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-circle-of-the-land-druid-build-wise-old-owl\">Example Circle of the Land Druid Build &#8211; Wise Old Owl<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.
