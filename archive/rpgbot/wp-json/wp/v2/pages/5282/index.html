With an odd assortment of abilities which frequently don&#8217;t cooperate, the Monk has trouble being effective. Still, with the right archetype the Monk can be Defender, Scout, Striker, or even a Support or Librarian. For the most part, the monk serves best as a Defender or Striker, and the better Monk archetypes tend to reflect this.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"archetypes\">Archetypes<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"drunker-master\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/drunken-master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drunken Master<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drunken master gives up some of the Monk&#8217;s less interesting passive abilities for the ability to generate Ki by drinking alcohol. This gives the Monk a functionally unlimited pool of Ki as long as there is booze handy. Drunken Master is also compatible with a startling number of other archetypes, which gives you lot of very interesting character options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fast Drinker and Deep Drinker feats are basically required ofr this\n\tarchetype.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drunken Ki<\/span> (Su): Ki fuels a lot of what\n\tmonks do, and any ability to gain or recharge Ki is welcome. The ability to\n\tgenerate temporary Ki with something as cheap as alcohol is absolutely\n\tfantastic. Rules for alcohol side-effects are apparently missing from the\n\trules, so it appears that you can chug brewskies all day without so much as a\n\thangover. Oh, and on top of being able to get ragingly drunk, you can use a\n\tswift action to get a free 5 foot step.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Drunken Strength<\/span> (Su): Extra damage never\n\thurts, but you can generally get much better returns from a point of Ki. Of\n\tcourse, if you have enough liquor to fuel your Ki pool, your Ki points may be\n\ta fairly cheap resource. If you have Fast Drinker, you can get a point of Ki\n\tor two every round to get some extra damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Drunken Courage<\/span> (Su): Fear is generally\n\tpretty gentle, and not particularly common, but immunity to it is pretty\n\tnice.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Drunken Resilience<\/span> (Ex): The scaling is\n\tpretty small, but Monks generally have low AC and only d8 hit points. DR can\n\treally help keep you alive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Firewater Breath<\/span> (Su): Blasting generally\n\tisn&#8217;t the Monk&#8217;s job, but this is a pretty solid AOE blast. The DC will keep\n\tpace with casters, and the cone is a reasonable size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: No<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Still Mind, Purity of Body, Diamond Body, Diamond Soul, Empty Body<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Master of Many Styles, Monk of the Four Winds, Monk of the Lotus, Monk of the Sacred Mountain, Sensei, Weapon Adept<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"flowing-monk\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/flowing-monk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flowing Monk<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flowing Monk is a Monk based on Dexterity. If you have read my <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk\">Monk Handbook<\/a>, you know that Monks need strength to do anything useful. The flowing Monk can be very good defensively, but falls into the classic Tank pitfall: tons of great defenses, but no reason for anyone to attack you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: The Flowing Monk gets very few\n\tgood bonus feat options, and the loss of the 2nd level bonus feat further\n\texacerbates the problem.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Base\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Agile Maneuvers<\/span>: The Flowing Monk is\n\t\t\t\ta dexterity-based Monk, so Agile Maneuvers is an obvious way to boost\n\t\t\t\tyour CMB.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Combat Reflexes can\n\t\t\t\tmake the Flowing Monk a potential Defender. Be sure to invest in Enlarge\n\t\t\t\tPerson to get yourself some reach.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflect Arrows<\/span>: Situational and\n\t\t\t\tbad.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dodge<\/span>: More AC never hurts on a\n\t\t\t\tMonk.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Reposition<\/span>: Too\n\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Trip<\/span>: Fantastic for a Monk,\n\t\t\t\tand you can use it with Redirection.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nimble Moves<\/span>: Situational, and you can\n\t\t\t\tget Acrobatic Steps for three times the effect.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: If your dexterity is\n\t\t\t\tconsiderably higher than your Strength, this is a must-have.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>6th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Acrobatic Steps<\/span>: Better than Nimble\n\t\t\t\tMoves, but still situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bodyguard<\/span>: Situational, and not all\n\t\t\t\tthat great.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Disarm<\/span>: Situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Feint<\/span>: You get almost nothing\n\t\t\t\tfor feinting.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Throw<\/span>: Redundant with\n\t\t\t\tRedirection.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mobility<\/span>: Running around drawing\n\t\t\t\tattacks of opportunity isn&#8217;t generally something that Monks do.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Second Chance<\/span>: The Monk is all about\n\t\t\t\tFlurry of Blows, and giving up your flurry attacks is foolish. At 6th\n\t\t\t\tlevel when you can first get this feat, you can already make 4 attacks,\n\t\t\t\tthe second of which is already at your highest BAB. Using this feat\n\t\t\t\tmeans that you are giving up two attacks for literally nothing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sidestep<\/span>: Prevents you from using\n\t\t\t\tRedirection, which is considerably better.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>10th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">In Harm&#8217;s Way<\/span>: You probably\n\t\t\t\tshouldn&#8217;t be spending a lot of time standing next to allies who need you\n\t\t\t\tto take hits for them. Instead, keep your enemies far away from your\n\t\t\t\tsquishy friends.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Repositioning Strike<\/span>: Counting on\n\t\t\t\tcritical hits is not a good way for a Monk to do things, and Reposition\n\t\t\t\tis rarely useful.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snatch Arrows<\/span>: Situational and bad.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spring Attack<\/span>: Not for Monks. Stand\n\t\t\t\tstill and use Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tripping Strike<\/span>: Just use Improved\n\t\t\t\tTrip. Counting on critical hits is not a good way for a Monk to do\n\t\t\t\tthings.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Redirection<\/span> (Ex): Reposition is highly\n\tsituational, but a free Trip attempt as an immediate action is fantastic.\n\tAdding the Sickened condition makes this even better. Be sure to invest in\n\tImproved Trip and a tripping weapon to maximize Redirection&#8217;s effectiveness.\n\tBecause you can only use this once per round, be careful when facing numerous\n\topponents.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unbalancing Counter<\/span> (Ex): This won&#8217;t get\n\tyou much, but if you have a Rogue in the party they will appreciate the help.\n\tBecause this replaces the Monk bonus feat at level 2, it makes the Flowing\n\tMonk&#8217;s bonus feat list less useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Flowing Dodge<\/span> (Ex): Because this only works\n\tfor adjavent enemies, watch out for enemies with reach. This bonus will really\n\thelp when you get mobbed by weak enemies, which is a big problem for Monks due\n\tto their low AC and weak hit points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Elusive Target<\/span> (Ex): Saving throw bonuses do\n\tnot keep pace with attack bonuses, so you will likely find that this is hugely\n\tinnefective unless you invest a large quantity of resources into your Reflex\n\tsave.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Volley Spell<\/span> (Su): This is very cool, but\n\tbecause it consumes so much Ki it will be very difficult to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Monk of the Sacred Mountain<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bonus Feats, Stunning Fist, Bonus Feat (2nd), Fast Movement, Purity of Body, Diamond Body, Quivering Palm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"hungry-ghost-monk\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/hungry-ghost-monk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hungry Ghost Monk<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hungry Ghost Monk is considered by many to be the best Monk archetype, and for very good reason. Steal Ki provides a bottomless pool of Ki, and Life Funnel provides a matching source of hit points. The Monk&#8217;s biggest defensive issue is hit points, and the Monk&#8217;s biggest limiting factor is the Ki Pool. By addressing these two issues, Monk can continue to fight until he eventually collapses from lack of sleep. The Hungry Ghost&#8217;s abilities are hugely abusable, as they depend on critical hits and dropping enemies to 0 hit points. Because &#8220;enemies&#8221; is such a loosely defined term, you could easily fuel your abilities with a box of sligthly annoyed rats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Punishing Kick<\/span> (Ex): Tripping is a great\n\toption for Monks, who tend to have low attack bonuses and depend heavily on\n\tfull attacks. Because Combat Expertise increases the Monk&#8217;s already terrible\n\tMultiple Ability Dependency, this is a great way to get a reliable Trip\n\toption. Giving up Stunning Fist is unfortunate, but you get this long before\n\tyou could meet the +8 BAB requirement, and you can take Stunning Fist as a\n\tfeat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Steal Ki<\/span> (Ex): This is why you take Hungry\n\tGhost. This is the most abusable way to get Ki that I have ever seen. You\n\tcould very easily carry around a box of rats that you then infuriate to the\n\tpoint of hostility, then murder them for their Ki. Oh, and a Coup De Grace is\n\tan automatic Critical Hit, so you can Coup De Grace your unconcious foes for\n\textra points when your box of rats runs dry. The ability to get free saves\n\tagainst diseases is almost the same as immunity to them considering how good a\n\tMonk&#8217;s saves are, especially with the ability to add your wisdom bonus on the\n\tsaving throw.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Life Funnel<\/span> (Su): As with Steal Ki, you can\n\tkeep a box of rats, make them angry, then turn them into hit points. Or you\n\tcan murder onconcious enemies. Hugely abusable either way. Miles better than\n\tWholeness of Body.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Life from a Stone<\/span> (Su): Not that you really\n\tneed it, but now you can steal Ki from the undead and constructs. In addition\n\tto your box of rats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Sipping Demon<\/span> (Su): Giving up spell\n\tresistance really hurts, but temporary hit points address the Monk&#8217;s low hit\n\tpoints, and the Monk&#8217;s already excellent saves should address the issue of\n\tspells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Stunning Fist, Purity of Body, Wholeness of Body, Diamond Body, Diamond Soul<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Master of Many Styles, Monk of the Sacred Mountain, Sensei<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kata-master\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/kata-master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kata Master<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Monk&#8217;s biggest problem is that it is the most MAD class in the game. The Monk&#8217;s only dump stat is Charisma. Now add a dependency on Charisma. The Kata Master doesn&#8217;t get the Monk anything particularly useful, and makes it even more MAD than it already was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Panache<\/span>: Panache depends on Charisma, and\n\tbecause the Kata master gets to few Deeds, it isn&#8217;t really worth investing\n\tin.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Menacing Swordplay<\/span> (Ex): Monks aren&#8217;t good at\n\tIntimidation.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Pool<\/span> (Su): Largely removes the need for\n\tCharisma to fuel the Kata Master&#8217;s Panache pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Targeted Strike<\/span> (Ex): Very versatile, but\n\tit cuts down on the Monk&#8217;s damage output..<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"opange\">Dizzying Defense<\/span> (Ex): Situational.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Stunning Fist, Still Mind, Ki Pool (Modified), Wholeness of Body, Quivering Palm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Master of Many Styles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"ki-mystic\"><a class=\"rating-green\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/ki-mystic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ki Mystic<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ky Mystic gets some very powerful support abilities. He gains the ability to provide rerolls on his allies&#8217; attack rolls and saving throws at the cost of Ki. While these abilities are fantastic, and the Ki Mystic gets a little bit of extra Ki, the rate at which the Ky Mystic goes through Ki will often leave him out of points early in the day. Without a way to generate more Ki, or to get a bigger Ki pool through Monk Vows, the Ki Mystic will be constantly starved for Ki.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Mystic<\/span> (Su): Getting Ki Pool a level\n\tearly is nice, even if it&#8217;s slightly smaller until level 4. The extra +2 ki is\n\talso nice. A +2 bonus to all knowledge checks is really helpful if you&#8217;re\n\tserving as the party&#8217;s Librarian, and the ability to spend Ki to boost skills\n\twith a +4 insight bonus is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mystic Insight<\/span> (Su): 2 ki points is\n\texpensive, but a reroll on an attack roll or saving throw can absolutely turn\n\tthe tide of a fight.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mystic Visions<\/span> (Su): To be clear: This\n\tfeat works like the spell &#8220;Divination&#8221;, not just any spell of the Divination\n\tschool. Situationally useful if you don&#8217;t have a Cleric handy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mystic Prescience<\/span> (Su): Permanent Insight\n\tbonus to AC and CMD. Insight bonuses to AC are very rare.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Mystic Persistence<\/span> (Su): While this\n\trunning, your party is going to dominate almost any fight that they&#8217;re in.\n\tHowver, this ability eats your Ki Pool like nothing else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: No<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Still Mind, Purity of Body, Diamond Body, Diamond Soul, Empty Body<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Master of Many Styles, Monk of the Four Winds, Monk of the Lotus, Monk of the Sacred Mountain, Sensei, Weapon Adept<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"maneuver-master\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/maneuver-master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maneuver Master<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Combat Maneuvers are a great way to disable enemies and apply negative status conditions, but the best status condition is dead. The Maneuver Master is fantastic at combat maneuvers, and can do more in a round than anyone else. The archetype makes excellent use Flurry of Blows, Monk Bonus Feats, and even introduces a really fun option for using your Ki pool. Despite a list of very excellent abilities, the Maneuver Master sacrifices the Monk&#8217;s only real source of damage output. Still, the ability to disable your enemies may make the Monk&#8217;s remaining attacks more reliable, which might actually outpace the normal Monk&#8217;s damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: Access to all of the Combat\n\tManeuver feats is excellent. Pick a favorite maneuver (Trip is a good choice,\n\tand Dirty Trick is very versatile), and take the Improved and Greater\n\tversions. Skip the X Strike feats, as they are very difficult to rely on.\n\tInstead, take a second Greater combat maneuver feat. When selecting your\n\tfavorite maneuvers, be sure to keep Flurry of Maneuvers in mind, as you will\n\twant something that you can benefit from multiple times in a round, such as\n\tDirty Trick.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Maneuvers<\/span> (Ex): While you give up\n\ta lot of the Monk&#8217;s normal damage output, this is a huge improvement on your\n\tcombat maneuvers. Because you can use Standard Action combat maneuvers, you\n\tcan finish your flurry of blows with something like a Grapple, a Bull Rush, or\n\ta Drag. Be sure to plan your maneuvers at the beginning of your flurry to\n\tmaximize their effectiveness. If you plan to inflict penalties to your enemies\n\tdefenses (with Trip for example), use your maneuver(s) early to maximize their\n\tusefulness.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Maneuver Defense<\/span> (Ex): Very situational,\n\tbut nice against enemies with the Grab or Trip special rules.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reliable Maneuver<\/span> (Ex): Miles better than\n\tslow fall. One Ki point is a really great price for what amounts to an attack\n\troll. Don&#8217;t forget that this won&#8217;t work in conjunction with Meditative\n\tManeuver because they are both swift actions. A reroll on a d20 works out to\n\tsomething like +5 bonus, so this is more powerful than Meditative Maneuver,\n\tbut Meditative Maneuver doesn&#8217;t cost Ki. Reliable Maneuver also only works for\n\tone attempt, while Meditative Maneuver works for an entire round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Meditative Maneuver<\/span> (Ex): If you don&#8217;t need\n\tyour swift action in any given round, this is your go-to usage. It works on\n\tevery maneuver of one type in a given round, so pick something spammable like\n\tDirty Trick or something that you can use on attacks of opportunity like\n\tTrip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Sweeping Maneuver<\/span> (Ex): Great for rounds in\n\twhich you need to move into reach.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Whirlwind Maneuver<\/span> (Ex): Trip everyone, then\n\tuse Improved Trip to get free attacks against all of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: No<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Flurry of Blows, Still Mind, Slow Fall, Purity of Body, Diamond Body, Quivering Palm<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Monk of the Four Winds, Weapon Adept<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"martial-artist\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/martial-artist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Martial Artist<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Martial Artist gives up the Monk&#8217;s Ki pool and related abilities for sheer martial prowess. The Martial Artist&#8217;s powers make him stronger, more durable, and generally better in combat than the average Monk. You lose some of the versatility provided by powers like Abundant Step, but the ability to survive a fight is worth the trade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Alignment<\/span>: Chaotic Monks! Woo!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Pain Points<\/span> (Ex): The bonus to critical hit\n\trolls is laughable, but the extra DC to Stunning Fist and Quivering Palm are\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Martial Arts Master<\/span> (Ex): Weapon\n\tSpecialization with Unarmed Strike is a good idea.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Exploit Weakness<\/span> (Ex): Your bonus should be,\n\tat minimum, your level +2, meaning that you should succeed on this check at\n\tleast 60% of the time against average enemies, and even more in encounters\n\twith multiple weak foes. The +2 bonus to hit is really nice by itself, but\n\tbypassing hardness\/DR greatly improves the Monk&#8217;s ability to deal damage. For\n\tsome reason the wording doesn&#8217;t specify that the bonus to hit only applies\n\tagainst the target, but it probably should. The defensive option is also good;\n\tthe bonuses scale reasonably well, and at high levels the dodge can keep you\n\talive against troublesome foes.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extreme Endurance<\/span> (Ex): Fatigue and\n\tExhaustion aren&#8217;t very common or particularly annoying, but Stunning will ruin\n\tyour day, and Death Effects will kill you (obviously). The ability to be any\n\talignment makes this an interesting option for multiclassing into Barbarian so\n\tthat you can rage cycle.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Physical Resistance<\/span> (Ex): Ability damage is\n\ta huge pain at any level, and it becomes increasingly common at high levels.\n\tReducing the damage by even one or two points makes you largely immune to the\n\teffects of most diseases and poisons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: An extra bonus feat is great,\n\tespecially because Monks get to ignore prerequisites when selecting their\n\tbonus feats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Defensive Roll<\/span> (Ex): This will save your\n\tlife.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quivering Palm<\/span>: Save or Die on a Monk. Pain\n\tPoints increases the DC by 1, and you can use it more often than any other\n\tMonk.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Defensive Roll<\/span> (Ex): Like improved\n\tevasion for attacks. Fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: No<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Still Mind, Ki Pool, Slow Fall, Purity of Body, Wholeness of Body, Diamond Body, Diamond Soul, Timeless Body, Tongue of the Sun and Moon, Empty Body, Perfect Self<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Sensei<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"master-of-many-styles\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/master-of-many-styles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Master of Many Styles<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Style Feats are a fantastic addition to the Monk, and they can do a lot to<br>\n\timprove your Monk both offensively and defensively. Generally a Monk can only<br>\n\tjustify using one or two styles because you can only maintain one at a time.<br>\n\tThe Master of Many Styles removes this limitation, and really lets style feats<br>\n\tshine. However, the loss of Flurry of Blows can really hurt your damage<br>\n\toutput, so be sure to focus on your damage output to comensate.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Before considering this archetype, read the\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk#style-feats\">Style Feats<\/a>\n\tsection of my Monk Handbook for insight into which style feats will work for\n\tyou. Keep in mind that many style feats will combine very well, so while they\n\tmay be poor by themselves, they can be excellent as a set.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: The first thing you need to know\n\tis that only the first feat in a Style Feat chain is actually a Style feat.\n\tFortunately, this lets you select feats in a style feat chain while ignoring\n\tmost of the prerequisites. Don&#8217;t worry about things like BAB, ability scores,\n\tskill ranks, etc.. All you need is the base Style feat. No, you don&#8217;t need the\n\tfull style chain to get the feat at the top of the chain.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fuse Style<\/span> (Ex): This is why you play the\n\tMaster of Many Styles. Pick one offensive style and one defensive style, and\n\tleave them both up for the duration of the fight. As you gain levels, you can\n\tadd additional styles to the mix. This increase leaves you just enough room to\n\tpick up the feats you need to make full use of your styles.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfect Style<\/span> (Ex): 5 styles is a lot, and\n\tit&#8217;s a lot to keep track of. I would pick 5 styles and live in them forver.\n\tInvesting more feats in or more styles is very difficult, likely won&#8217;t pay\n\toff, and you will spend hours every round trying to figure out which styles\n\tyou are in and what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bonus Feats (Modified), Flurry of Blows, Perfect Self<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Master, Hungry Ghost Monk, Kata Master, Ki Mystic, Monk of the Lotus, Monk of the Sacred Mountain, Wildcat<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monk-of-the-empty-hand\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/monk-of-the-empty-hand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monk of the Empty Hand<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Monk of the Empty hand specializes in enhancing improvised weapons using Ki. While this is a really cool mechanic similar to the Magus&#8217;s ability to enhance weapons, the Ki cost is simply too high for this archetype to function. The archetype lacks a way to generate additional Ki, and disallows Monk Vows, so the Ki Pool is a major problem with no easy solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: The monk&#8217;s\n\tweapon list actually includes some very interesting options. Until mid levels,\n\tweapon are often a much better choice than fighting unarmed, and weapons are a\n\tgood source of CMB bonuses. Giving up those options hurts.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Flurry of Blows<\/span> (Ex): Largely the same, but\n\tyou can flurry with improvised weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: Improvised Weapon Mastery is\n\tbasically required.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Dirty Trick<\/span>: An excellent\n\t\toption, but hard to rely on and hard to optimize.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Steal<\/span>: Steal is an awful combat\n\t\tmaneuver.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improvised Weapon Mastery<\/span>: This archetype\n\t\tcenters on using improvised weapons, so this is basically required.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Versatile Improvisation<\/span> (Ex): This adds\n\tsome nice versatility to your damage types since you can&#8217;t rely on switching\n\tto a weapon when bludgeoning damage won&#8217;t cut it. (See what I did there?)<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Pool<\/span> (Su): You&#8217;re probably not much of\n\ta ranged weapon enthusiast, but sometimes this can be helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Weapons<\/span> (Su): This ability would be realy\n\tcool if it had a duration longer than one round. A 20th level Monk with 20\n\twisdom gets a total of 15 Ki points per day. You might get to use this ability\n\tfor one fight before you exhaust your Ki Pool.

Their abilities can be very powerful if you manage your Ki, and the Aspect Master and Immortatily aspects are truly fantastic abilities. Elemental Fist and Slow Time are the most definitive portions of the archetype, so be sure to find a way to recharge your Ki in order to fuel them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Fist<\/span> (Su): Elemental Fist is a\n\tpretty poor way to spend Ki because the damage is so small. Increasing the\n\tdamage as you grow in level really helps improve the usefulness of the feat.\n\tIf you still want Stunning Fist, you can take Stunning Fist as a feat if you\n\tneed to Stun people.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Slow Time<\/span> (Su): Though twice as expensive\n\tas Abundant Step, with the Monk&#8217;s move speed this will allow you to get around\n\tvery quickly. The extra standard actions mean extra attacks at your best BAB.\n\tYou might even consider taking Vital Strike to capitalize on having multiple\n\tstandard actions. However, because the Ki cost is so high, be sure to save\n\tthis for when you really need to mess someone up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aspect Master<\/span> (Su): Many of the aspects\n\tprovide some very cool options for the Monk.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aspect of the Carp<\/span>: Swim speed is\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aspect of the Ki-Rin<\/span>: Flight is fantastic,\n\t\teven if you need to end your turn on the ground.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Aspect of the Monkey<\/span>: Climb speed is\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aspect of the Oni<\/span>: Excellent\n\t\tescape\/infiltration mechanic.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aspect of the Owl<\/span>: Flight is the best\n\t\tmovement type. The rules don&#8217;t specify maneuverability, so I would assume\n\t\tPerfect.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aspect of the Tiger<\/span>: Pounce fixes a lot of\n\t\tproblems for the Monk.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Immortality<\/span> (Su): Never age, and if you die\n\tyou just reincarnate.

Unfortunately, Ancient Healing Hand is the only actual healing\n\tmechanic, and the Ki cost is fairly high. Ki Sacrifice allows the Monk to\n\traise the dead without material components, which is nice, but still doesn&#8217;t\n\treally make you a Healer. If the party has someone who can use a wand of Cure\n\tLight Wounds, they will be a better healer than you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ancient Healing Hand<\/span> (Su): Losing the\n\tability to heal yourself hurts because the Monk has so few hit points, and two\n\tKi points for so little healing is very expensive. Save this for the end of\n\tthe adventuring day when you no longer need to keep your Ki Pool full.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Sacrifice<\/span> (Su): No preperation, no\n\tmaterial components, and you get upgraded to Resurrection at level 15.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">True Sacrifice<\/span> (Su): This would be a great\n\tway to end a character, but you really can&#8217;t rate this as a useful ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Wholeness of Body, Diamond Body, Quivering Palm, Perfect Self<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Monk of the Sacred Mountain, Sensei, Tetori<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monk-of-the-lotus\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/monk-of-the-lotus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monk of the Lotus<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathfinder is a game about swashbuckling fantasy, and the Monk of the Lotus is a pacifist archetype. The abilities are focused on disabling enemies without killing them, and magically charming them. If you want to be a pacifist who talks his problems out, maybe you should consider a Bard or something else with some Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch of Serenity<\/span> (Su): This is a\n\tfantastic debuff, but because you don&#8217;t actually do damage you need to either\n\ttalk the target into not fighting, or your party needs to kill them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Touch of Surrender<\/span> (Su): This would be a cool\n\tmechanic if it didn&#8217;t cost so much Ki. But hey, sometimes you want to punch\n\tpeople until they like you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Touch of Peace<\/span> (Su): Charm stuff. No save.\n\tGo charm the Tarrasque and see what happens.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Learned Master<\/span> (Ex): This would be fantastic\n\tif it had shown up early enough to justify putting ranks into a bunch of\n\tnon-class skills which depend on an ability score you don&#8217;t need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Stunning Fist, Abundant Step, Quivering Palm, Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Master, Ki Mystic, Master of Many Styles, Monk of the Empty Hand, Sensei<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"monk-of-the-sacred-mountain\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/monk-of-the-sacred-mountain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monk of the Sacred Mountain<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the monk&#8217;s biggest problems is that it depends on Flurry of Blows for damage, and Flurry of Blows depends on standing still and making a full attack. The Monk of the Sacred mountain doubles down on this issue, but in exchange gets a few defensive abilities which help make up for the Monk&#8217;s weak hitpoints and AC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Iron Monk<\/span> (Ex): Losing evasion really\n\thurts, but the Monk really hurts in terms of hit points and AC. A little but\n\tof natural armor and Toughness does quite a bit to help with that. Of course\n\tyou can&#8217;t take Toughness again to get even more hit points, so make sure that\n\tyou still buff your Constitution a bit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bastion Stance<\/span> (Ex): Trip isn&#8217;t a\n\tparticularly common tactic for enemies, and forced movement is even less\n\tcommon. If you fight a lot of wolves or NPCs, this might be useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Limb Defense<\/span> (Ex): Monks need all the\n\thelp that they can get in terms of AC. Giving up your 5 foot step really hurts\n\tyour tactical options. However, it&#8217;s also great motivation to stand still and\n\tmake full attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Adamantine Monk<\/span> (Ex): DR can go a long way\n\tto keep a Monk alive. The scaling is pretty small, and giving up Improved\n\tEvasion hurts, but a bit of DR really addresses the issue that the Monk is\n\tvulnerable to lots of really small hits.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vow of Silence<\/span> (Su): An insight bonus to AC\n\tis very rare. It comes a bit late in the game, but even at this level the Monk\n\tneeds all of the help he can get in terms of defense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Evasion, Slow Fall, High Jump, Improved Evasion, Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Master, Flowing Monk, Hungry Ghost Monk, Kata Master, Ki Mystic, Master of Many Styles, Monk of the Empty Hand, Monk of the Four Winds, Monk of the Healing Hand<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"qinggong-monk\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/qinggong-monk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qinggong Monk<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Qinggong Monk is a weird a la carte archetype. You can take as many or as few of the abilities as you like, and you can trade in the Monk&#8217;s worst abilities for something more exciting. Because the Qinggong Monk&#8217;s abilities are fueled by Ki, th size of your Ki Pool is very important. Invest in your Wisdom score, take Extra Ki, and take some Monk Vows to keep your pool full.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Qinggong Monk can be combined with any archetype, and many of the powers\n\tare worthwhile for any type of Monk.

Your five foot step is more useful on your own turn when\n\t\t\t\tyou can use it to get into a position to immediately attack. If you use\n\t\t\t\tthis feat, your enemy can 5 foot step away from you at the end of their\n\t\t\t\tattack in order to force you to use a move action to follow them.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snatch Arrows<\/span>* (1 ki point):\n\t\t\t\tSituational, and very bad.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spring Attack<\/span> (1 ki point): Not good\n\t\t\t\tfor a Monk.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>8th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon&#8217;s Breath<\/span> (2 ki points): A\n\t\t\t\tdecent blast effect which can allow you to handle large groups of\n\t\t\t\tenemies.

You also don&#8217;t need to spend\n\t\t\t\tthe 1000 gp for the material component.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Share Memory<\/span> (0 ki points):\n\t\t\t\tSituational, but potentially very cool. Because it consumes no Ki and\n\t\t\t\tcan be used on unwilling targets, you can use this is a very effective\n\t\t\t\tinterrogation technique.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Silk to Steel<\/span> (1 ki point): The\n\t\t\t\tduration is too short, and the benefits aren&#8217;t very good.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spider Step<\/span> (1 ki point): Cool, but\n\t\t\t\tvery situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Whirlwind Attack<\/span> (2 ki points): This\n\t\t\t\tfeat is normally terrible because it requires several feats which\n\t\t\t\tconflict with the purpose of the feat.

However, it will rarely be as effective\n\t\t\t\tas Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wholeness of Body<\/span> (monk ability, 2\n\t\t\t\tki points): It doesn&#8217;t provide a lot of healing, but this is a great way\n\t\t\t\tto spend your Ki at the end of the day.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>10th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">discordant blast<\/span> (2 ki points): The\n\t\t\t\tdamage is poor, and you&#8217;re a melee character.

Note that a Coup De Grace is a critical hit, so you can\n\t\t\t\tuse it with this ability. The spell doesn&#8217;t specify enemies, either, so\n\t\t\t\tyou can keep a box of pet rats and eat them for free Ki. You do need to\n\t\t\t\tactivate the effect ahead of time, but the minutes per level duration\n\t\t\t\twill get you through most fights. Between fights, just reactivate it for\n\t\t\t\tfree. I would take this on literally every Monk.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lunge<\/span> (1 ki point): Situational, but\n\t\t\t\tocasionally useful if your five foot step doesn&#8217;t get you close\n\t\t\t\tenough.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shadow step<\/span> (1 ki point): Cheaper\n\t\t\t\tthan Abundant Step, but also less versatile.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">spit venom<\/span> (2 ki points): Expensive,\n\t\t\t\tand the blindness doesn&#8217;t last enough for you to benefit from it, but\n\t\t\t\tcon damage poison is very tempting.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Step Up and Strike<\/span>* (2 ki points):\n\t\t\t\tDue to the wording of the feat, you need Step Up and\/or Following Step\n\t\t\t\tto make use of this, and the Ki cost is fairly high.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Wind Stance<\/span> (2 ki points): Most Monks\n\t\t\t\tdon&#8217;t get to move more than 5 feet in one round, and even then the bonus\n\t\t\t\tjust isn&#8217;t very good.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>12th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">abundant step<\/span> (monk ability, 2 ki\n\t\t\t\tpoints): Fantastic, even if it costs two Ki points.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">battlemind link<\/span> (4 ki points): Neat,\n\t\t\t\tand potentially very effective, but this is also the most expensive Ki\n\t\t\t\tPower available.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">diamond body<\/span> (monk ability):\n\t\t\t\tSituational, but nice to have.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Fist<\/span> (2 ki points): Miles\n\t\t\t\tbetter than the Elemental Fist, and because you can use Elemental Fist a\n\t\t\t\tnumber of times per day equal to your Monk level, you can just turn this\n\t\t\t\ton and throw a flaming flurry of blows for one turn.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improvised Weapon Mastery<\/span> (2 ki\n\t\t\t\tpoints): I&#8217;m really not sure why a Monk would need this.

But you can use\n\t\t\t\tBlood Crow Strike to get better range, and your unarmed strike damage\n\t\t\t\toutput is probably comparable. Blood Crow Strike also costs one less Ki,\n\t\t\t\tand you can use Stunning Fist on any of those attacks.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Sonic Thrust<\/span> (2 ki points): Poor\n\t\t\t\tutility and poor damage.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>16th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bleeding Critical<\/span> (3 ki points):\n\t\t\t\tCritical hits are not a good mechanic for Monks, and this is very\n\t\t\t\texpensive.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Blind-Fight<\/span>* (2 ki points): At\n\t\t\t\tthis level invisibility is a common problem.

The Sensei needs literally every ability, and even if you somehow had 18s in all of your abilities, the archetype still wouldn&#8217;t be very good. The best use I can see for this archetype is as a class dip for weird Cleric builds which want knowledge skills or which want to use their wisdom for attack rolls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Oh great, a bunch of skills dependent\n\ton the Monk&#8217;s dump stats. If you want to play a Monk as a face or librarian, I\n\tguess this is your best bet.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Advice<\/span> (Ex): Bardic Music is a great\n\tability, but it becomes more useful as Bards level because they can activate\n\tsongs as move or swift actions. Without this improvement, your Advice ability\n\tis lackluster in comparison.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Insightful Strike<\/span> (Ex): This allows you to\n\tdepend on one of three abilities for your attacks. If you want to deal damage,\n\tStrength is probably still your best bet.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mystic Wisdom<\/span> (Su): While this is a very\n\tgenerous use of your Ki Pool, the lousy duration makes it very difficult to\n\tuse. However, you can do silly things like use Abundant Step on your whole\n\tparty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Flurry of Blows, Bonus Feat (2nd, 6th, 14th, 18th), Evasion, Fast Movement, Improved Evasion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Drunken Master, Hungry Ghost Monk, Kata Master, Ki Mystic, Martial Artist, Monk of the Four Winds, Monk of the Healing Hand, Monk of the Lotus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"sohei\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/sohei\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sohei<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sohei is more of a fighter than a Monk. He gives up most of the Monk&#8217;s Ki abilities for proficiency with light armor and martial weapons, and gets a cool ability to buff whoever&#8217;s horse he happens to be riding. The Sohei is, in concept, a mounted archetype, but it doesn&#8217;t get a Mount like one would expect. Instead, the Sohei can buff whatever he is riding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of this weirdness, the Sohei combines Flurry of Blows with the\n\tability to use two-handed martial weapons. This combination can make the Sohei\n\ta fantastic melee DPS. The addition of light armor also vastly reduces the\n\tSohei&#8217;s need for Wisdom, thereby reducing the Monk&#8217;s iconic Multiple Ability\n\tDependency.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: You don&#8217;t get an Animal Companion\n\tor Mount, so Handle Animal has fairly limited usefulness. You will want to buy\n\tand train a horse, but even then you don&#8217;t need to dump a ton of ranks into\n\tHandle Animal. Monastic Mount allows you to buff your mount with Ki, but even\n\tthen your mount is mostly expendable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Woo! Armor for\n\ta Monk!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: Most of the mounted combat\n\tfeats won&#8217;t work well with Flurry of Blows, but you can pick up Trick Riding\n\twithout taking Mounted Combat, then take Mounted Skirmisher to use Flurry of\n\tBlows after a mounted charge. However, keep in mind that multiplied damage\n\tfrom Spirited Charge and Lances\n\t<a href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/paizo\/faq\/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9p1k\">only applies to the first attack<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Devoted Guardian<\/span> (Ex): Initiative bonuses\n\tare excellent, and being guranteed to act in surprise rounds can make a big\n\tdifference. I&#8217;m not certain what happens if you&#8217;re still unaware of your\n\tenemies, but leave that up to your GM.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Unarmed Strike<\/span>: Your unarmed strike maxes out\n\tat 1d6. Time to go find a real weapon. Fortunately, you&#8217;re proficient with\n\tmartial weapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monastic Mount<\/span> (Su): Despite not actually\n\tgetting the Mount ability, Monastic Mount does a lot for your mount\n\tdefensively. However, because your mount will still have its base hit points,\n\tnatural armor, and saves it will have trouble surviving combat if it is\n\tdirectly targeted. Be sure to keep your mount&#8217;s temporary hit points charged\n\tor you will quickly find yourself on foot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Weapon<\/span> (Su): This is like a really lousy\n\tversion of the Magus&#8217;s ability to enhance his weapons. The 1 round duration\n\twill eat through your Ki Pool very quickly, and the enhancement shouldn&#8217;t be\n\tmuch better than whatever your weapon already has.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Training<\/span> (Ex): This is perhaps the\n\tSohei&#8217;s best ability. Because Flurry of Blows works like two-weapon fighting,\n\tyou can effectively use a two-handed weapon as though you were using an\n\tidenticaly weapon in each hand. This means that you can use Power Attack to\n\tgreat effectiveness, and small bonuses like Weapon Focus and Weapon training\n\tstill stretch their effectiveness over multiple attacks like normal two-weapon\n\tfighters. Be wary of the Monk Weapons group; while it contains a great number\n\tof interesting weapons, the Sohei does not get proficiency with Monk weapons\n\tby default. Instead, I would go with Polearms or Spears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Weapon and Armor Proficiency, Stunning Fist, Unarmed Strike, Fast Movement, Slow Fall, Purity of Body, Diamond Body, Abundant Step, Quivering Palm, Timeless Body, Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: None<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tetori\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/tetori\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tetori<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to grapple, this is how you do it.

Or, you can maintain a grapple as a move\n\t\taction and start a second as a standard action. Strangle two people at the\n\t\tsame time!<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Pinning Knockout<\/span>: It sucks that it&#8217;s\n\t\tnonlethal damage, but Monks can deal nonlethal damage with their unarmed\n\t\tstrikes without penalty, so when this works it effectively doubles your\n\t\tdamage output.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Choke Hold<\/span>: Decent way to shut down enemy\n\t\tspellcasters, especially those with spells like Dimension Door prepared\n\t\twhich have verbal components but no somatic components. Actually strangling\n\t\tsomething to death will take considerably more time than just grappling\n\t\ttheir hit points to 0. You get this feat very late, so if you want it early\n\t\tyou can take it as a normal feat, then bonus feat rules allow you to take\n\t\tany other normal feat in its place. This has the added benefit of getting\n\t\tyou an extra feat slot at high levels when you meet more pre-requisites.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Neckbreaker<\/span>: 2d6 points of Strength or\n\t\tDexterity damage will really hurt your opponents chances of escaping your\n\t\tGrapple. Once they hit 0, you can either Coup De Grace them or continue to\n\t\tdeal ability damage until their Constitution hits 0. You also get this feat\n\t\twithout the pile of prerequisite feats or ranks in Heal.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Graceful Grappler<\/span> (Ex): This ability sets\n\tthe Tetori head and shoulders above other grapplers. Using your level in place\n\tof BAB for CMB\/CMD brings you on par with fighters, but this abilities higher\n\tlevel aspects are amazing. Not being flat-footed while grappling makes you\n\tmuch less vulnerable to groups of foes. Grab does wonders for your early\n\tdamage output, and gets you a +4 bonus on your crucial first grapple attempt.\n\tConstrict will give you a ton of extra damage, especially at high levels when\n\tyou can make up to three grapple attempts in a round.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Counter-Grapple<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but\n\tdecent. No one should start grapples but you. Don&#8217;t forget that you get a +5\n\tto your CMB checks if you are in control of the grapple. Don&#8217;t let the other\n\tguy have that bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Break Free<\/span> (Ex): If the grapple ever goes\n\tbadly for you, you can add your Monk level (in addition to using your Monk\n\tlevel in place of your BAB) to bail.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Inescapable Grasp<\/span> (Su): Apparently no one\n\tever gets to leave the grapple except you. You can even grapple ghosts!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Form Lock<\/span> (Su): This is a good way to\n\tremove effects like Baleful Polymorph, and to keep enemies from polymorphing\n\tinto something too big for you to grapple. I&#8217;m not certain if this prevents\n\tcreatures from returning to their original form, but I don&#8217;t think it does.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Iron Body<\/span> (Su): Nice defensive buff, but a\n\tbit late to the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: Yes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bonus Feats, Flurry of Blows, Slow Fall, High Jump, Improved Evasion, Abundant Step, Diamond Soul, Timeless Body, Tongue of the Sun and Moon, Empty Body<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Kata Master, Monk of the Healing Hand<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"weapon-adept\"><a class=\"rating-orange\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/weapon-adept\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weapon Adept<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a few decent choices, the Weapon Adept adds fairly little to Monk weapons. The coolest part of the Monk weapon group is that the weapons are diverse, and many of them have bonuses to one or more combat maneuvers. Perfect Strike limits you to the classic core rulebook weapons, which are among the most bland options on the Monk&#8217;s weapon list. With some enhancement a weapon can be a fine choice in the hands of a monk, but the weapon adept really doesn&#8217;t add anything meaningful to the Monk&#8217;s ability to use weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perfect Strike<\/span> (Ex): This feat would be\n\treally cool if it let you use a decent weapon. Take a look at the weapon\n\tsection of my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk#weapons\">Monk Handbook<\/a>\n\tfor help picking a weapon. Your best bet is likely the Kama because it can be\n\tused for Trip attempts. You&#8217;re stuck with 1d6 damage and x2 crit no matter\n\twhat you pick. Perfect Strike is a cool ability because it can make your\n\tattacks much more reliable, but due to the limited uses per day you&#8217;ll want to\n\tsave it for high risk situations. I don&#8217;t even know why quarterstaff is on the\n\tweapon list; you can&#8217;t flurry with it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Way of the Weapon Master<\/span> (Ex): Weapon Focus\n\tand Specialization are great because they apply to all of your attacks. The +2\n\tdamage isn&#8217;t much by itself, but it adds up quickly with a high number of\n\tattacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Getting Evasion 7 levels\n\tlate hurts, but at least you still get it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Uncanny Initiative<\/span> (Ex): Imagine everyone&#8217;s\n\tsurprise when you pick 20 literally every time.

Do you like Monks? Here&#8217;s where they intersect. Dirty Trick is easily one of the best combat maneuvers, and emphasizing it can make the Monk very effective at locking down and defeating single targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ready for Anything<\/span> (Ex): Initiative bonuses\n\tare always great, and bonuses to Perception are nice too.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Brawler Maneuver Training<\/span> (Ex): Wow this is\n\tbadly worded. This scales much like the Fighter&#8217;s Weapon Training: You&#8217;re\n\tlocked into Dirty Trick at first, but at higher levels you can pick any\n\tmaneuver. Every time you get a new maneuver, the bonuses for your existing\n\tmaneuvers increase by 1. This gives you a total +4 bonus to CMB\/CMD for Dirty\n\tTrick, which is fantastic because it&#8217;s so hard to find bonuses to dirty\n\ttrick.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improvised Weapon Mastery<\/span> (Ex): I&#8217;m not\n\tsure why a Monk would use an improvised weapon instead of their bare hands,\n\tbut if you&#8217;re going to do it, it&#8217;s nice to get a little bit more damage. Note\n\tthat you don&#8217;t get proficiency, so be sure to pick up the Catch Off-Guard feat\n\tand the Surprise Weapon trait if you intend to use this frequently.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feat<\/span>: The Dirty Trick feats are the\n\tonly ones that you should want.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knockout<\/span> (Ex): Save or suck dependent on\n\tyour offensive ability score. Knock them out, then take a Coup De Grace on\n\tyour next turn. Be sure to use Dirty Trick to make them Shaken and Sickened\n\tbeforehand so that they take -4 to their saving throws.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Turn the Tables<\/span> (Ex): Most enemies don&#8217;t\n\tuse combat maneuvers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dirty Blow<\/span> (Ex): Now you never need to\n\tdecide between performing a Dirty Trick and hitting things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bonus Feats (Modified), Still Mind, Ki Pool, High Jump, Slow Fall, improved evasion, abundant step, diamond soul, empty body<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Master of Many Styles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"zen-archer\"><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/core-classes\/monk\/archetypes\/paizo-monk-archetypes\/zen-archer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zen Archer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zen Archer is a fantastic take on archery.

Still, overally\n\tthis is going to be more arrows, and therefore more damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: <\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Base\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Get Snap Shot and\n\t\t\t\tImproved Snap Shot, and you can control a 15 foot radius circle around\n\t\t\t\tyourself.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflect Arrows<\/span>: Situational, and\n\t\t\t\tbad.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dodge<\/span>: More AC never hurts,\n\t\t\t\tespecially for a squishy character like a monk.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Far Shot<\/span>: Occasionally important,\n\t\t\t\tbut range on a composite longbow is already impressive, and at 4th level\n\t\t\t\tyou can spend Ki to increase your range.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Point-Blank Shot<\/span>: Not particularly\n\t\t\t\tpowerful, but you can spend a lot of time in melee range, and this will\n\t\t\t\tlet you take archery feats beyond your bonus feats.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Shot<\/span>: Essential.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rapid Shot<\/span>: Can&#8217;t be used with Flurry\n\t\t\t\tof Blows, and Flurry will give you a better attack bonus and the same\n\t\t\t\tnumber of shots.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>6th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Focused Shot<\/span>: Intelligence is a dump\n\t\t\t\tstat for Monks.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Precise Shot<\/span>: Ignore cover\n\t\t\t\tand concealment, two of the biggest problems for archers.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Manyshot<\/span>: Can&#8217;t be sued with Flurry of\n\t\t\t\tBlows.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mobility<\/span>: You probably won&#8217;t be running\n\t\t\t\taround much in the middle of a fight.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Parting Shot<\/span>: You have Point Blank\n\t\t\t\tMaster by this level. Stand and fight.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>10th level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Critical<\/span>: Critical hits with\n\t\t\t\tbows are fairly infreuqent, but 19-20\/x3 is pretty great, and you get a\n\t\t\t\thuge number of attacks.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pinpoint Targeting<\/span>: One attack as a\n\t\t\t\tstandard action will be very likely to hit, but you won&#8217;t do a whole lot\n\t\t\t\tof damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shot on the Run<\/span>: Very rarely more\n\t\t\t\tuseful than firing before\/after you move.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snatch Arrows<\/span>: Situational, and fairly\n\t\t\t\tbad even in cases where it might apply.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Perfect Strike<\/span> (Ex): This isn&#8217;t a fantastic\n\tfeat, but allowing you to use it with your bow certainly helps.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Way of the Bow<\/span> (Ex): Weapon Focus and\n\tSpecialization are great because they apply to all of your attacks. The +2\n\tdamage isn&#8217;t much by itself, but it adds up quickly with a high number of\n\tattacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Zen Archery<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s annoying that you\n\tdon&#8217;t get this at first level, but it&#8217;s still really cool. Of course, because\n\tyour Dexterity and Wisdom both apply to one save and both apply to your AC,\n\tyou can basically pick which save you want to be good at. Keep in mind that\n\tWisdom also effects your Ki pool, but Dexterity gives you more attacks\n\topportunity with Snap Shot. Pick one to focus on, but don&#8217;t neglect either.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Point Blank Master<\/span> (Ex): This is a feat with\n\ta +11 BAB prerequisite, and you get it at 3rd level. Walk up to people and\n\tFlurry of Blows them do death with a bow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Pool<\/span> (Su): Very situational, but this\n\tlargely removes the need for Far Shot.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ki Arrows<\/span> (Su): Use this when you are sure\n\tthat you&#8217;re going to hit several times. Extra damage is nice, and the Monk&#8217;s\n\tunarmed strike damage gets pretty great at high levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Reflexive Shot<\/span> (Ex): Basically the Snap\n\tShot feat. I&#8217;m not sure why they don&#8217;t just give you snap shot, but I imagine\n\tit&#8217;s to make you waste an extra feat to get Improved Snap shot. I would still\n\ttake Snap Shot and Improved Snap shot because they make archers very scary in\n\tclose quarters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Trick Shot<\/span> (Su): Hilarious and very\n\teffective, especially at high levels where enemies have concealment more\n\treadily available.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Focus Bow<\/span> (Su): Very late to the party,\n\tthis allows you to treat your arrows as magical, adamantine, and lawful. By\n\tnow your bow should be very well enchanted, you should be able to afford\n\tplenty of adamantine arrows, and you can affords oils of Align Weapon in\n\tquantities large enough to bathe in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monk Vows: No<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Bonus Feats, Stunning Fist, Evasion, Maneuver Training, Still Mind, Purity of Body, Improved Evasion, Diamond Body, Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: Qinggong Monk<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The monk has always been a difficult class to master. With an odd assortment of abilities which frequently don&#8217;t cooperate, the Monk has trouble being effective.
