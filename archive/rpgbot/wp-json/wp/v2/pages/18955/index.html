One could go all in, leveraging the rest of their spellcasting to bring far more healing. Or one could use their spells for more damage and control while simply tossing out Balms for spot healing unconscious allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Circle of Dreams Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-dreams-ability-scores\">Circle of Dreams Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-dreams-races\">Circle of Dreams Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-dreams-feats\">Circle of Dreams Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-dreams-weapons\">Circle of Dreams Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-dreams-armor\">Circle of Dreams Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-dreams-multiclassing\">Circle of Dreams Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-circle-of-dreams-druid-build-lucidity\">Example Circle of Dreams Druid Build &#8211; Lucidity<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level\">Level<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

It&#8217;s largely redundant with\n\t\tHealing Word, but it does have a few notable advantages. The pool of dice\n\t\twill quickly outpace your number of low-level spell slots, allowing you to\n\t\tquickly and inexpensively rescue dying allies. The ability to use more than\n\t\tone die is helpful if you want your ally past single-digit hit points, and\n\t\tthe temporary hit points can help keep them conscious, though with so few\n\t\ttemporary hit points you shouldn&#8217;t expect a miracle. Finally, since Balm of\n\t\tthe Summer Court isn&#8217;t a spell, you can use it in the same turn as casting a\n\t\tleveled spell.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow<\/span>:\n\t\tSituational, and there are tons of other options available that cost resources to solve the\n\t\tsame issues better, though this feature automatically happens during every Short and Long Rest with no limitations. For example, Rope Trick will allow the party to climb\n\t\tinto an extradimensional space with an invisible entrance for the price of a 2nd-level spell slot and only for the length of a single Short Rest. Still, if you\n\t\tdon&#8217;t have a wizard in the party this is nice to have while camping in\n\t\tdangerous places like dungeons.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hidden Paths<\/span>: Excellent range, it works as\n\t\ta Bonus Action, and you get a decent number of uses per day. It&#8217;s especially\n\t\tnice because Misty Step isn&#8217;t available to druids and this can target a willing ally. This is a great way to\n\t\tget out of dangerous areas, to escape grapples, or to rescue allies from the\n\t\tsame.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Walker in Dreams<\/span>: Dream and\n\t\tTeleportation Circle aren&#8217;t on the Druid spell list, but Scry is. The unique\n\t\tversion of Teleportation Circle is a nice way to get yourself and your party\n\t\tback to a known safe point. Generally you can do that by other means\n\t\tlike walking or turning into a bird and flying long distances, but don&#8217;t underestimate the utility of what is essentially a Town Portal. This feature could be invaluable for situations where you need to retrieve something or someone and half of the challenge is escaping after securing the target: Turn into a mouse, chill in the target\u2019s cell for an hour, activate escape portal, mission over. If your party\n\t\tincludes a character who can cast Teleport, this is an inexpensive way to\n\t\tget home after teleporting.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-dreams-ability-scores\">Circle of Dreams Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing in the Circle of Dreams features differs enough for us to deviate from the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/#ability-scores\">Druid Handbook\u2019s ability spread<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: We don&#8217;t need it; we can turn into animals with Strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Pump up that AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Get more HP and don&#8217;t die.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Someone else can do Knowledge skills.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wis<\/span>: Spell DCs and an important saving throw.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Someone else can talk to people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-dreams-races\">Circle of Dreams Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Circle of Dreams doesn\u2019t change too much of what a Druid already does, the ratings spelled out in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/races\/\">Druid Race Breakdown<\/a> are still accurate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-dreams-feats\">Circle of Dreams Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>For the most part, we can rely on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/#feats\">Druid Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Chef<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>: Since we can be extra safe during Short Rests, we can stretch out the day\u2019s Hit Dice healing by cooking up food.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Inspiring Leader<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\"><\/a><\/sup>: If we have the Charisma for it, we can take advantage of our nice safe Short Rests to do it more often.
