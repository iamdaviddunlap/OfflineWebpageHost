The Fiend is a blaster first and\n\tforemost, and is heavily dependent on fire damage, so consider taking the\n\tElemental Adept feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The iconic Warlock subclass, the Fiend leans hard into the Warlock&#8217;s core capabilities, complementing them without adding any additional complexity. This makes it a very approachable subclass, which is likely why it was chosen for inclusion in the SRD over the Great Old One.

The Fiend&#8217;s spell list offers several excellent options\n\t\tto address this.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">1st-level Spells<\/span>: Burning Hands is a\n\t\t\t\tdecent AOE, especially at low levels, and since Warlocks get armor and\n\t\t\t\tmore hp than Sorcerers and Wizards, you can survive\n\t\t\t\tbeing close enough to melee to use it, however, I wouldn&#8217;t use it beyond\n\t\t\t\tvery low levels. You&#8217;ll get more total damage out of Hex or other spell\n\t\t\t\toptions despite Burning Hands&#8217; scaling. Command is a great\n\t\t\t\tcontrol\/debuff effect and scales really well with your spell slots.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">2nd-level Spells<\/span>: Blindness\/Deafness\n\t\t\t\tis a powerful debuff, but allowing repeated saves can make it\n\t\t\t\tunreliable. Scorching Ray is a bit redundant with Eldritch Blast, but it\n\t\t\t\tscales very well and benefits from the same tactics.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd-level Spells<\/span>: A good AOE blast\n\t\t\t\tand a good area control effect. Fireball remains the best instantaneous\n\t\t\t\tAOE damage spell at every spell level until around spell level 8, and,\n\t\t\t\twhile the Warlock can&#8217;t cast Fireball past 5th level, it still remains a\n\t\t\t\tperfect go-to AOE blast option. However, remember that you will often\n\t\t\t\tget better results out of spells with ongoing effects like Hunger of\n\t\t\t\tHadar, and with so few spell slots you need to squeeze as much out of\n\t\t\t\tthem as you can. Stinking Cloud is an ongoing AOE save-or-suck effect,\n\t\t\t\tbut creatures within the area are Heavily Obscured so it&#8217;s hard to\n\t\t\t\tattack them. Hunger of Hadar is likely a better choice in most\n\t\t\t\tcases.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">4th-level Spells<\/span>: Fire Shield is fine\n\t\t\t\tfor &#8220;gish&#8221; builds, but, if you&#8217;re going for a Warlock gish you&#8217;re probably going\n\t\t\t\tto play a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/hexblade\/\">Hexblade<\/a>. Fire Shield also seems redundant with Armor of\n\t\t\t\tAgathys, which notably lasts longer, provides temporary hit points,\n\t\t\t\tdeals more damage to attackers, and scales with spell level. Wall of\n\t\t\t\tFire is one of the best area control spells in the game and with the\n\t\t\t\tright invocations you can push and pull enemies through it to repeatedly\n\t\t\t\tcapitalize on the guaranteed damage dealt when a creature passes through\n\t\t\t\tthe wall.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">5th-level Spells<\/span>: Flame Strike is\n\t\t\t\tFireball, but a smaller AOE and worse damage. Sure, some of the damage\n\t\t\t\tis radiant, but if damage resistance is a problem, you should be using\n\t\t\t\tEldritch Blast since nearly nothing resists Force damage. Hallow is\n\t\t\t\tvery situational.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dark One&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: This makes Fiendish\n\t\tVigor considerably less important. It also makes it important that you\n\t\toccasionally pick off weak foes to ensure that your temporary hit points are\n\t\tup before you focus on more important foes. RAW the creature just needs to\n\t\tbe hostile, so a permissive DM might allow you carry around a bag of angry\n\t\trats and kill one whenever you need temporary hit points.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck<\/span>: Adds an average of\n\t\t5.5 to your roll, which is mathematically much better than what you get from\n\t\tAdvantage (Advantage is worth slightly more than +3). Save this for crucial\n\t\tsaving throws or if you&#8217;re desperate need to escape a grapple but can&#8217;t\n\t\tteleport or something.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fiendish Resilience<\/span>: This doesn&#8217;t specify\n\t\trestrictions on the damage type, so if you want to do Slashing for a while\n\t\tthen switch to Radiant, you can do it. This is one of very few ways to get\n\t\tresistance to Force damage, but you still want to use this for common damage\n\t\ttypes like fire, poison, and slashing.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hurl Through Hell<\/span>: Only works once per\n\t\tday, but 10d10 damage is pretty great on top of whatever your attack was\n\t\t(let&#8217;s be honest: it was Eldritch Blast). The creature is also removed from\n\t\tthe game until the end of your <em>next<\/em> turn, allowing you to temporarily\n\t\tbanish the creature, and potentially place hazards in and around its space\n\t\tsuch as Hunger of Hadar, Wall of Fire, or the rest of your party.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Fiend Warlock Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#ability-scores\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Fiend Warlock Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Fiend Warlock Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Fiend Warlock Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#weapons\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Fiend Warlock Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Fiend Warlock Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>No different from a\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/#multiclassing\" data-type=\"page\">typical warlock<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Fiend Warlock Build &#8211; The Iconic<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Fiend is the iconic Warlock, so we&#8217;re going to build an iconic Fiend Warlock.

Our imp&#8217;s attacks are arguably still better damage, but their attack bonus is 2 lower than ours, so they might struggle to hit without Advantage.<br><br>More importantly, we now have Fireball. With Flames of Phlegethos, the damage will be marginally better, improving the average damage per die from 3.5 to 3.92. At 8d6 damage, that raises our average from 28 to 31.36. So, marginally better, but it&#8217;s not going to knock your socks off.<br><br>This level also allows us to cast Darkness as an innate spell.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#summon-creature-spells\">Summon Undead<\/a><\/td><td>With Dark One&#8217;s Own luck, we have some insurance against poor rolls. This lets us do something fun but risky: We can drop Fireball at our own feet. We have resistance to fire damage and easy temporary hit points from Dark One&#8217;s Blessing. If you find yourself surrounded, drop a Fireball on the ground.<br><br>At 31.36 average damage, we halve that to roughly 16. We can have 10 temporary hit points from Dark One&#8217;s Blessing, allowing us to fireball a crowd of enemies around us at the cost of roughly 6 hp. We&#8217;re unlikely to pass our own save, but if we come close and still fail, we can use Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck to try to pass and further mitigate the damage.<br><br>Unfortunately, the temporary hp from Dark One&#8217;s Blessing won&#8217;t scale as fast as the damage from Fireball, but nothing screams &#8220;cool&#8221; like fireballing an enclosed space and walking out just slightly singed.<br><br>This trick is why I&#8217;m not including Elemental Adept in the build. You don&#8217;t want to ignore your own resistance and explode yourself. Leave that to Wild Magic Sorcerers.<br><br>We&#8217;ll grab Summon Undead for when our party needs an extra body.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Invocation:<br>&#8211; Repelling Blast<br>Retrain Invocation:<br>&#8211;\n\t\t\t\t\tInvestment of the Chain Master -&gt; Grasp of Hadar<br>New Spell\n\t\t\t\t\tKnown:<br>&#8211; Wall of Fire<\/td><td>By this level, your familiar&#8217;s attacks are likely feeling less effective as their attack bonus gradually falls behind. The tactical need to strap Darkness to your familiar to have them fight on your behalf has probably also caused some problems, and, by now, your familiar has probably been destroyed a few times.<br><br>But now is also a great time to change tactics, because we now have Wall of Fire. To maximize the benefits, you want to push enemies through the wall as often as possible, forcing them to either go through the wall again to rejoin the fight or to waste several turns waiting for it to go away while you kill their friends.<br><br>The combination of Repelling Blast and Grasp of Hadar allows us to push and\/or pull enemies through the wall when we hit them with Eldritch Blast. We get two shots, allowing us to reposition one enemy twice or to reposition two enemies once each.<br><br>Remember that, when someone creates simultaneous effects, the creator of the effects chooses the order in which they occur, so you can push your target through the wall, then immediately pull them back to keep them where you can see and attack them. This doesn&#8217;t let you re-trigger the Wall of Fire damage in the same turn, but your allies may still want a chance to hit them.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: Skill Expert<br>&#8211; Cha 18 -&gt; 19<br>&#8211; Prof: Intimidation<br>&#8211;\n\t\t\t\t\tExpertise: Persuasion<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Shadow of Moil<\/td><td>To further improve our capabilities as the party&#8217;s Face, we&#8217;ll grab Skill Expert. This puts us behind the Fundamental Math temporarily, but we&#8217;re frequently attacking with advantage and we&#8217;re using very few save-or-suck spells, so we should be fine.<br><br>When you can&#8217;t Fireball your problems and there isn&#8217;t a good way to bring Wall of Fire into the situation, turn on Shadow of Moil and start blasting.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>New Invocation:<br>&#8211; Voice of the Chain Master<br>New Spell\n\t\t\t\t\tKnown:<br>&#8211; Hold Monster<\/td><td>Voice of the Chain Master turns our imp familiar into an even better scout. Between invisibility and flight it was already great at exploring on our behalf, but the ability to perceive through its senses means that we can take more direct command. Speaking through it also allows us to do tricky things like harassing enemies who recognize our voice or deliver messages when we&#8217;re too lazy to go find whoever we want to talk to.<br><br>You might consider retraining Devil&#8217;s Sight since your familiar can see in magical darkness, but remember that your familiar has 10 hp, and their death would mean that you suddenly can&#8217;t see in magical darkness. That might be fine at this point, but think about it carefully.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Fiendish Resilience<\/td><td>We already have resistance to fire, so poison or slashing damage are\n\t\t\t\t\tyour go-to options here.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Eyebite<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<br>New\n\t\t\t\t\tCantrip Known:<br>&#8211; Mind Sliver<\/td><td>Eyebite is cruise control for an entire fight. If you have Summon Undead running, you can command your undead as a Bonus Action while you repeatedly put enemies to sleep or cause them to panic.<br><br>Mind Sliver is here to impose a save penalty before we hit enemies with a save-or-suck.<br><br>We get our third Eldritch Blast ray at this level. Shadow of Moil and Eldritch Blast remain a consistently effective combo. Finally, we get our third spell slot. Time to drop three Fireballs, then take a nap.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>Feat: Fey Touched (Cha 19 -&gt; 20)<br>New Invocation:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Fey Touched gets our Charisma to 20, lets us cast Misty Step Once per day, and lets us pick a 1st-level spell. Silvery Barbs is a fine choice, but Heroism might also be cool because you can use spell slots to cast it again, so you&#8217;re automatically upcasting it to 5th level and can target your whole party.<br><br>Is it weird to have a fiend patron, but borrow magic from some fey? Yes, it certainly is. But we&#8217;ve got 20 Charisma and they can&#8217;t convince us to stop.<br><br>We have an empty space for an invocation here. Choose whatever seems interesting. Misty Visions is a personal favorite of mine because illusions are so much fun.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Finger of Death<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>Finger of Death is not the Warlock&#8217;s best 7th-level spell. But saving\n\t\t\t\t\ta 7th-level spell to last-hit an enemy to get both a permanent zombie\n\t\t\t\t\tand temporary hit points from Dark One&#8217;s Blessing is an incredible\n\t\t\t\t\tflex.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>Hurl Through Hell<\/td><td>Basically short-term banishment when you hit with an attack. You have three shots with Eldritch Blast, so pick someone who really needs a 1-round time out, boot them to the lower planes, then drop an inward-facing circular Wall of Fire around their space and watch them return to the world&#8217;s most terrifying sauna.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: Dominate Monster<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<br>New\n\t\t\t\t\tInvocation:<br>&#8211; Chains of Carceri<\/td><td>Chains of Carceri only applies to three creature types, but they&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\tdecently common at this level since beasts, humanoids, and most\n\t\t\t\t\tmonstrosities have fallen off of the CR scale by now.<br><br>For\n\t\t\t\t\tanything that you can&#8217;t hit with Chains of Carceri, there&#8217;s Dominate\n\t\t\t\t\tMonster.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>Feat: Metamagic Adept<br>&#8211; Careful Spell<br>&#8211; Quicken Spell<\/td><td>We get exactly two Sorcery Points, so spend them wisely. We&#8217;re mostly\n\t\t\t\t\there for Quickened Spell so that we can cast Mind Sliver, then hit our\n\t\t\t\t\tdebuffed target with Finger of Death or Dominate Monster.<br><br>Careful\n\t\t\t\t\tspell is for when you fireball the floor underneath you. Pass your\n\t\t\t\t\tsave for half damage, halve it again for fire resistance. Your\n\t\t\t\t\t5th-level fireballs deal 12d6 (avg. 42 normally, but 47.04 with Flames\n\t\t\t\t\tof Phlegethos), reducing your average damage to yourself to just\n\t\t\t\t\t11.75. That&#8217;s not even enough to get through the temporary hit points\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom Dark One&#8217;s Blessing. If you manage to kill something with the\n\t\t\t\t\tFireball, you get fresh temporary hp.<br><br>Hot enough to kill,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut your eyebrows aren&#8217;t even crispy.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>Mystic Arcanum: True Polymorph<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Any<\/td><td>I like to cast True Polymorph in order to turn myself into a massive problem.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>New Invocation:<br>&#8211; Shroud of Shadow<\/td><td>Enter every situation invisible.

The iconic Warlock subclass, the Fiend leans hard into the Warlock&#8217;s core capabilities, complementing them without adding any additional complexity.
