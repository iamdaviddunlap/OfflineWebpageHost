In combat, the Investigator relies on Formulate a Stratagem, encouraging players to make a single high-damage Strike rather than flailing against their targets with numerous Strikes in the same turn. Like the Rogue, the Investigator fits into a party as a Scout and Striker, but thanks to high Intelligence and abundant skills and access to Advanced Alchemy, they can also serve as a Face, a Librarian, and potentially a Healer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the Investigator shares a lot in common with the Rogue, they work differently in some key ways. Managing your &#8220;subjects&#8221; is a crucial part of succeeding as an investigator, and where the Rogue needs to rely on makes foes flat-footed to be effective in combat, the Investigator just needs enough Actions to make Forumate a Stratagem work. As a player, expect to spend a lot of time asking the GM questions and scutinizing every word of what the GM says in order to find clues. In many ways, you need to be an investigator as much as your character is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Investigator Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Ability<\/strong>: Intelligence. With high Intelligence, you&#8217;ll have abundant skills and you&#8217;ll be well-equipped to succeed with skills like Arcana and Crafting. You can also use Formulate a Strategem in order to use Intelligence for your attack rolls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: 8+ hit points. Much like the\n\tRogue, you&#8217;re frail. However, you don&#8217;t have the Rogue&#8217;s Dexterity to pad your\n\tAC, so the problem is even worse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Initial Proficiencies<\/span>: The Investigator&#8217;s\n\tproficiencies are excellent everywhere except their armor..<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span>: The best Perception\n\t\tprogression in the game, matching the Rogue.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Saving Throws<\/span>: Terrible Fortitude saves,\n\t\tbut otherwise fine. Reflex saves are common and between high Dexterity and\n\t\troughly average Dexterity save progression you should do fine. The\n\t\tInvestigator&#8217;s Will saves are also good, but you should still put some\n\t\tresources into Wisdom if you can.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: A total of 6+Int skills, and with\n\t\tIntelligence as your Key Ability Score you&#8217;ll likely exceed the total\n\t\tstarting skills of every other character, including most rogues. The\n\t\tInvestigator notably also gets the same number of Skill Feats that the Rogue\n\t\tdoes, though the Investigator gets half of them via the Skillful Lessons\n\t\tfeature, which is limited to skills which rely on mental ability scores\n\t\t(Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) so they&#8217;re not quite as flexible as the\n\t\tRogue&#8217;s.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Attacks<\/span>: The same progression as most\n\t\tmartial classes like the Barbarian and the Champion, and you get up to\n\t\tmartial weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Defenses<\/span>: Only light armor, but your\n\t\tproficiency progression is good.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Class DC<\/strong>: None of the Investigator&#8217;s Class Feats or\n\t\tfeatures depend on your Class DC. The Investigator doesn&#8217;t even get access\n\t\tto Critical Specialization Effects on its own (you may be able to get them\n\t\tfrom your Ancestry or from multiclassing).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the Case<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pursue a Lead<\/span>: Managing your two subjects\n\t\tis central to how you play the Investigator. If you can keep your subjects\n\t\trelevant, you can benefit from a frequent Circumstance bonus, and Devise a\n\t\tStratagem becomes less costly to use. You can&#8217;t reasonably expect every\n\t\tcreature you face to be a subject, but try to make as many enemies as\n\t\tpossible a subject before you encounter them. As a general guideline, if the\n\t\tGM knows the creature&#8217;s name you should usually be able to make it a subject\n\t\tbefore you fight it.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Clue In<\/span>: A nice way to include party\n\t\tmembers in your investigations. The bonus isn&#8217;t huge, but it will occur\n\t\tfrequently and it costs you nothing except your Reaction to share it with\n\t\tyour allies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Devise a Strategem<\/span>: Half of the\n\tInvestigator&#8217;s primary combat tactic. While the text of the Action isn&#8217;t\n\tespecially long, there is a lot of buried nuance here, and understanding the\n\tcomplexities of Devise a Stratagem will make you more effective in combat.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use Devise a Stratagem, the first thing that you do is to roll a d20. This will take the place of the d20 rolled for your first Strike against the target of your stratagem. The text specifies that you can use it &#8220;later in the round&#8221;, which is unhelpful since the Investigator doesn&#8217;t get Attack of Opportunity or a similar mechanism. Still, this allows you to roughly know the results of your potential Strike before you make it. If you roll terribly, don&#8217;t waste the Action to make your Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you then choose to make a Strike against the target of your Strategem, you make the Strike normally, except that instead of rolling a d20 you <em>must<\/em> use the roll from when you used Devise a Stratagem, and you <em>may<\/em> use your Intelligence in place of Strength or Dexterity for the attack roll (though you would be a fool not to do so, since Strategic Strike only applies if you use Intelligence for the attack).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devise a Stratagem only works once per round (usually), which is an important limitation. It effectively limits you to a single effective Strike per turn, as your Strength or Dexterity will almost certainly lag behind your Intelligence. Rather than making numerous Strikes, the Investigator is expected to make singular, powerful strikes each turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exception to the &#8220;once per round&#8221; practical limitation is when &#8220;you&#8217;re aware the creature you choose is the subject of a lead you\u2019re pursuing&#8221;. Since you can only have two subjects at a time, expect that most creatures you fight will not be one of your subjects. When you do finally face a subject in combat, use the extra Actions for things like Recall Knowledge, Demoralize, and other single-Action options that tilt comabt in your favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devise a Stratagem also supports the Strategic Strike feature (see below). As far as I can tell, they&#8217;re only separate features so that characters using the Investigator multiclass dedication feats can&#8217;t get Strategic Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Methodology<\/strong>: See &#8220;Subclasses &#8211; Methodologies&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Strategic Strike<\/span>: A consistent and easy\n\tdamage boost, and it automatically scales with level, adding dice at a similar\n\trate to Runes of Striking. This additional damage boost makes up for the\n\tInvestigator&#8217;s preference for single Strikes over making multiple Strikes per\n\tturn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investigator Feats<\/strong>: See Investigator feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Feats<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skill Increases<\/strong>: Standard for everyone except the Rogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>General Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Keen Recollection<\/span>: There are only four\n\tknowledge skills (not counting Lore), and with the Investigator&#8217;s high\n\tIntelligence it&#8217;s not only easy to be Trained in all of them, it&#8217;s expected.\n\tYou should expect to use this with Lore, but otherwise it won&#8217;t see much\n\tuse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skillful Lessons<\/span>: Between this and the\n\tnormal Skill Feat progression, you get a skill feat at every level. Skillful\n\tLessons is limited to Int\/Wis\/Cha skills, but there are abundant useful\n\toptions to choose from, and you can reserve your regular Skill Feats for\n\tskills which use physical ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ancestry Feats<\/strong>: Standard.<\/p>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Expertise<\/span>: Your proficiency with\n\tweapons advances at the same rate as other martial classes like the Barbarian\n\tand the Rogue.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilant Senses<\/span>: The best Perception\n\tprogression in the game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Specialization<\/span>: Since your\n\tProficiency with weapons improves at the same rate as martial class like the\n\tBarbarian and the Champion, you&#8217;ll start at the +3 bonus in most cases.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Great Fortitude<\/span>: Better saving throws is\n\talways great.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Investigator Expertise<\/span>: Increasing the\n\tbonus from Pursue a Lead is really nice. The Class DC improvement is totally\n\tuseless, though.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Deductive Improvisation<\/span>: While the\n\tInvestigator can easily outdo nearly any other character in terms of trained\n\tskills, sometimes you&#8217;ll still have gaps, and sometimes those skills with\n\thaved Trained Actions which you might need. This gets you easy access to those\n\tActions without the need to spend a skill increase. Some skills also have\n\tActions locked behind specific levels of Proficiency, and this reduces that\n\trequirement somewhat so you don&#8217;t need to invest heavily in skills which you\n\tdon&#8217;t use often.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Combining Dedictuve Improvisation with the Untrained Improvisation feat is a<br>\n\tpowerful and effective way to get a lot out of skills in which you&#8217;re<br>\n\tuntrained. However, if you&#8217;re going to invest heavily in untrained skills on a<br>\n\tcharacter with such abundant Skill Increases, consider if it would be easier<br>\n\tto simply spend a few Skill Increases on more skills rather than investing a<br>\n\tbunch of additional feats.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resolve<\/span>: You are very good at Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Incredible Senses<\/span>: Legendary in Perception\n\tfeels really good, and you&#8217;ll use it almost constantly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Armor Expertise<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat, but you get this very late.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Mastery<\/span>: More attack bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Reflex saves are the most common\n\ttype of &#8220;Basic Save&#8221;, and often Basic Saves are the ones where the difference\n\tbetween a Success and a Critical Success is the most significant. This will\n\tprotect from a lot of damage from area effects like fireballs and breath\n\tweapons.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Weapon Specialization<\/span>: More\n\tdamage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Resolve<\/span>: Very powerful. Preventing\n\tCritical Failures on Will saves can protect from numerous very harmful\n\teffects.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Light Armor Mastery<\/span>: More AC is always\n\tgreat.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Master Detective<\/span>: You&#8217;ve done it! You made\n\tit all the way to level 19, spending fully 18 levels looking for clues,\n\tscrutinizing the GM&#8217;s every word, asking them to re-read boxed text\n\tmeticulously over and over again for hints to possible clues, then moving on\n\tto poking, prodding, searching, and otherwise scrutinizing every noun within\n\twalking distance. Finally, after 18 levels of playing your class, the GM is\n\tinstructed to just tell you when there is a clue in the room and to give you a\n\thint about its nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, it feels like you&#8217;ve come all this way and Paizo decided that you were likely bored with the class&#8217;s central concept so they give you an easy button. It doesn&#8217;t actually make your character better, and if you&#8217;ve survived this long you likely don&#8217;t need the help, so I don&#8217;t understand why this is here or why it&#8217;s all the way at level 19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also your class DC increases, but it&#8217;s still totally unused so it doesn&#8217;t really matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses &#8211; Methodologies<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"subclasses-alchemical-sciences\">\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Methodologies.aspx?ID=1\" class=\"rating-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alchemical Sciences<\/a>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t quite so versatile and powerful as the Alchemist&#8217;s capabilities with alchemy, but it has some similar benefits. Proficiency in Crafting and the Alchemical Crafting feat get you set up to craft alchemical items early in your career, and Quick Tincture helps mitigate the cost of crafting high-level alchemical items while also allowing you to capitalize on alchemical items which aren&#8217;t useful enough to justify spending gold to craft them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because alchemical items can do so much (even if you only consider elixirs and tools), Alchemical Sciences is inherently a very capable and flexible subclass, far outpacing other investigator subclasses. Access to healing items like Elixirs of Life and buffs like Eagle Eye Elixir make the Forensic Sciences and Interrogation subclasses mostly obsolete. With a few skill feats (remember that the Investigator gets one at every level) you can completely replicate both subclasses, with the exception of the unique Pointed Question Action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can still craft bombs normally, Quick Tincture notably doesn&#8217;t allow you to craft bombs, so you&#8217;ll need to spend time and gold to do so just like most other characters.

Elixirs include\n\t\tpowerful options like Elixir of Life for healing, mutagens to buff yourself\n\t\tand your allies, and utility options like Darkvision Elixir.
