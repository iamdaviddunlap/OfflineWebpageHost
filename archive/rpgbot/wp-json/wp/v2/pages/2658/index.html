Monks are excellent Defenders and Strikers, and typically fill a role in a party as a Fighter-equivalent or Rogue-equivalent depending on your subclass and proficiencies. Certain subclasses also introduce healing and Support capabilities, allowing monks to thrive in new roles depending on your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Monk can be difficult to play compared to the Fighter or the Rogue. They are the most MAD (multiple ability dependent) class in DnD 5e, needing three high ability scores to function effectively with very little room to ignore any of them, and the Monk isn&#8217;t as durable as the Fighter nor as lethal as the Rogue. Monks also lean heavily into using Bonus Actions right from level 1, which can be briefly confusing for new players who are still acclimating to the game&#8217;s mechanics. Subclasses can introduce additional complexity to the class, but that complexity also brings a lot of diversity and a lot of fun options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite those challenges, the Monk can be incredibly satisfying to play. I&#8217;ve had all kinds of fun slapping enemies prone, launching them through air, stunning them before unleashing a flurry of blows, and otherwise making my presence felt on the battlefield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our other supporting content for the Monk:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11728\">Monk Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/subclasses\">Monk Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/monks-levels-1-4-ascend-to-greatness-or-stumble-in-the-shadows-rpgbot-podcast-s4e53\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27279\">MONKS Levels 1 \u2013 4 \u2013 Ascend to Greatness or Stumble in the Shadows \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E53<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/monks-levels-5-20-beyond-the-flurry-of-blows-strategic-tips-for-mastering-the-class-rpgbot-podcast-s4e58\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27364\">MONKS Levels 5 \u2013 20 \u2013 Beyond the Flurry of Blows: Strategic Tips for Mastering the Class \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E58<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/dnd-monk-roleplay-guide\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"31533\">Monk Roleplay Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

You&#8217;re expected to use &#8220;monk weapons&#8221;, which are defined\n\tunder the Martial Arts entry. Essentially you&#8217;ll be using a 1d6 weapon with\n\tversatile until level 10 (which means either a quarterstaff or a spear), then\n\tyou&#8217;ll use your bare hands from then on unless you&#8217;ve found a magic weapon.\n\tMonks get the typical 2 skills, and the Monk skill list includes a lot of\n\tmediocre options which depend on Abilities which Monks don&#8217;t generally need\n\tand therefore can&#8217;t afford to invest in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unarmored Defense<\/span>: 20 Dexterity and 20\n\tWisdom is an eventual goal for every Monk. With both, you have 20 AC, which\n\tmatches the AC of a character in full plate with a shield.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Martial Arts<\/span>: Martial Arts is why you play a\n\tMonk. It removes the need for Strength, and gives you all the benefits of\n\ttwo-weapon fighting without the need for weapons, feats, or combat styles.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki<\/span>: Some basic, but extremely potent uses\n\tfor your Ki pool which every Monk will rely upon.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Flurry of Blows<\/span>: At low levels this isn&#8217;t\n\t\ta great option because you won&#8217;t have a lot of Ki, but as you grow in level\n\t\tit will become less costly. Keep in mind that Martial Arts already grants\n\t\tyou a single extra attack as a Bonus Action, so you&#8217;re only getting one\n\t\tattack for your Ki point. This is the floor of effectiveness on using a ki\n\t\tpoint. If a thing you could do with Ki is worse than Flurry of Blows, you\n\t\tshould never do that thing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Patient Defense<\/span>: When your health is low\n\t\tthis is a great fallback option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Step of the Wind<\/span>: Similar to Cunning\n\t\tAction, but with a Ki cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmored Movement<\/span>: Some extra speed is\n\tnice for a class so strictly bound to melee, and the ability to run across\n\twater and up vertical surfaces really adds to the mystical feel of the\n\tMonk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monastic Tradition<\/strong>: Monk subclasses are briefly summarized\n\tbelow.

However, when it comes\n\tup it&#8217;s a cool defensive option, and the math is really solid. Even a\n\thigh-level character does little more than the damage die plus their ability\n\tmodifier in damage, so the 1d10+dex+level will be very reliable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Slow Fall<\/span>: Situational, but it&#8217;ll save\n\tyour life when it comes up.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Three attacks with Martial\n\tArts, or four with Flurry of Blows.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning Strike<\/span>: There&#8217;s no limit on how\n\tmany times you can do this (except running out of Ki), so against particularly\n\ttough opponents it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to spend Ki on each of your attacks\n\tuntil you succeed, or to just stun-lock a single foe for the duration of a\n\tfight.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding and using Stunning Strike effectively is absolutely crucial to\n\tplaying the Monk effectively. The Stunned condition robs the creature of turn,\n\tprevents them from making opportunity attacks or casting reaction spells like\n\tShield or Counterspell, grants Advantage on attacks to hit them (including any\n\tother attacks that you make that turn), causes them to automatically fail\n\tStr\/Dex saves (ex: Disintegrate), and Stunning Strike lasts until the\n\t<em>end<\/em> of your next turn, so you could spend your whole next turn\n\tattacking them with Advantage, not to mention whatever your party can do with\n\ta full round to pile on the damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki-Empowered Strikes<\/span>: Especially important\n\tin games with no magic items. Many enemies have resistance to non-magical\n\tweapon attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span>: Combined with high Dexterity and\n\tthe Monk&#8217;s Reflex saves, you should be able to reliably negate AOE effects.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Stillness of Mind<\/span>: Situational, but a lot\n\tof enemies have Charm and\/or Fear effects.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Purity of Body<\/span>: Disease and Poison can both\n\tbe debilitating, and become more common as you gain levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/span>: This would be\n\tmore helpful if Monks were any good at talking to things.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diamond Soul<\/span>: Dramatically improves your\n\tsurvivability. Notably this also applies to Death Saving Throws. Even though\n\tthey&#8217;re not tied to an ability score, they&#8217;re still a saving throw, and\n\taccording to Jeremy Crawford,\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/728614065438756865\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;If all saves are affected by a thing, death saves are affected.&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Timeless Body<\/span>: Almost never matters\n\tin-game.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Empty Body<\/span>: A crucial high-level tactic for the Monk. Activating this makes you hard to target, much more durable, and also grants Advantage on all of your attacks. Many fights will begin with you activating this, but definitely try to activate it before initiative is rolled if you can.<\/p>\n\t<p>Astral Projection is situational, but by this level a safe means to explore\n\tthe outer planes is very welcome.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perfect Self<\/span>: Dramatically improves the\n\tMonk&#8217;s sustainability throughout the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optional-class-features\">Optional Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything, Optional Class Features offer ways to add additional features or replace existing ones. These rules are optional, and you should not assume that your DM will allow these features without consulting them first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments and suggestions for specific Optional Class Features are presented here, but for more information on handling Optional Class Features in general, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\">Practical Guide to Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dedicated Weapon<\/span> (Addition): On its own,\n\tthis does little to expand the Monk&#8217;s weapon options since you need to find\n\tproficiency elsewhere. You can get more proficiencies from a feat or by\n\tmulticlassing, but more likely you&#8217;re going to get it from your race. Most\n\traces won&#8217;t get you anything more interesting than a longsword by default, but\n\twith the Customizing Your Origin optional rule you can turn a racial weapon\n\tproficiency into whatever weapon proficiency you want (there&#8217;s some\n\tsimple\/martial nuance, but realistically you&#8217;re going to get a martial\n\tweapon). If you just want damage, a longsword is your best bet, but consider\n\tgetting whips for reach or shortbows so that you can do something useful at\n\trange (Dedicated Weapon allows weapons with the two-handed trait, unlike\n\tMartial Arts).<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Dedicated Weapon on all monks using a subclass which I\n\trate <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span> or lower. It&#8217;s not a huge buff,\n\tbut access to whips can be very impactful and raising the monk&#8217;s weapon damage\n\tfrom 1d8 (quarterstaff or spear) to 1d10 means that they&#8217;ll be slightly more\n\tlethal by skipping straight to their maximum damage die size for their weapon\n\tattacks.\n<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki-Fueled Attack<\/span> (Addition): A fantastic\n\tbuff for subclasses which have Ki-eating abilities which they&#8217;ll use during\n\tcombat, such as the Way of Four Elements spellcasting. This allows you to\n\tstill attack in the same turn as you use those abilities, thereby boosting\n\tyour damage output. Many monks will gain little or no benefit from this, but\n\tseveral weaker subclasses benefit significantly.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Ki-Fueled Attack on all monks using a subclass which I\n\trate <span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span> or lower. These subclasses\n\ttypically benefit a great deal from this feature, and this buff may be enough\n\tto make those subclasses much more viable.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Quickened Healing<\/span> (Addition): The only\n\tcase where I expect monks to use this is to spend remaining Ki before taking a\n\tShort Rest. Doing so can improve the Monk&#8217;s durability, allowing them to\n\tcompensate for their relatively small hit die compared to the Fighter by\n\thealing themselves beyond what their hit dice could provide. This may be\n\tenough to justify less stress over your Constitution, but you need to get\n\tthrough combat alive to have a chance to use this.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Quickened Healing on all monks using a subclass which I\n\trate <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span> or lower. It&#8217;s not a huge buff,\n\tand in most games the Monk&#8217;s hit dice will be sufficient, so I don&#8217;t expect\n\tthis to be used frequently.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Focused Aim<\/span> (Addition): Inefficient, but\n\tsometimes you&#8217;re desperate to just make on attack connect. Monks don&#8217;t have a\n\tbig single on-hit effect like Sneak Attack, and this comes online late enough\n\tthat it&#8217;s hard to justify multiclassing to use this. Keep this in your back\n\tpocket until you&#8217;re desperate.<\/p>\n<p>I recommend allowing Focused Aim on all monks. It&#8217;s an extremely inefficient\n\tuse of Ki compared to nearly anything else that the Monk could do, so having a\n\tplayer spend their Ki to make one attack hit successfully means that they&#8217;re\n\tgiving up a precious resource that they could spend elsewhere doing something\n\tmore impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Monk is the most MAD class in the game. While Dexterity is their primary ability score, they also need both Constitution and Wisdom to function. Fortunately, you have very little use for Strength, Intelligence, or Charisma, so it&#8217;s easy to dump three scores and focus on the three that we care about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we need three high ability scores, races which offer three Ability Score Increases are especially appealing. This includes the default Human (technically they get 6), Custom Origin Half-Elf (+2\/+1\/+1), the Custom Origin Triton (three +1&#8217;s), and any race after Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything because those races offer the choice of +2\/+1 or three +1 increases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Way of the Astral Self has a higher reliance on Wisdom due to Astral Arms, so if you&#8217;re building an Astral Self monk, reverse Dexterity and Wisdom in the recommendations below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Str<\/span>: Monks get good Strength saves, which\n\treduces the need for Strength, but a little bit of Strength will help stretch\n\tthe effectiveness of that proficiency. Athletics is also a nice option if you\n\twant to Shove enemies prone, but several monk subclasses already offer options\n\tto knock foes prone without resorting to Athletics.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dex<\/span>: Dexterity rules the Monk. Almost all\n\tmonks rely on Dexterity for attacks, so it sets your attacks, damage, and AC,\n\tand having good Dexterity will help avoid AOE damage which can quickly cut\n\tinto your d8 hit points.

Use the Longsword if you just need more damage\n\t\t(remember that you can use it two-handed to get 1d10 damage with Versatile).\n\t\tThis can also get you a +1 to Dexterity, making it a tempting 1st-level feat\n\t\toption for the Custom Lineage and the Variant Human.

The best\n\tbase damage you can get from a Monk weapon is 1d8 (with Versatile), which will\n\tmatch your Martial Arts damage until level 17. Monks use Dexterity with any\n\tMonk weapon, so the biggest differences between weapons are damage type and\n\tpossibly a range increment. Martial Arts doesn&#8217;t specify that it only applies\n\tto melee attacks or weapons, so you can use Dexterity with things like\n\tJavelins to apply your Martial Arts damage to thrown weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Dart<\/span>: Javelins are strictly better.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Javelin<\/span>: Similar to the spear. No\n\t\tVersatile so the damage isn&#8217;t as good, but much better range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Handaxe<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s best source of\n\t\tslashing damage, and it can be thrown. However, since it won&#8217;t do as much\n\t\tdamage as a spear, stick to your spear or quarterstaff unless your foe is\n\t\tspecifically weaker to slashing damage than piercing or bludgeoning damage.\n\t\tFor flavor, call it a kama.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Quarterstaff<\/span>: Versatile allows the\n\t\tquarterstaff to match the Monk&#8217;s unarmed damage until 17th-level, but since\n\t\tit&#8217;s the same damage type as unarmed strikes, and can&#8217;t be thrown, it&#8217;s not\n\t\tas good as the spear. Still, 2nd-place is pretty good. For flavor, call it a\n\t\tbo staff or a three-sectioned staff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Short Sword<\/span>: Short swords are a trap. See\n\t\tJavelin or Spear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spear<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s gold standard. You can\n\t\tget 1d8 damage with Versatile, which is the absolute best a Monk can get\n\t\tuntil their unarmed strikes hit 1d10 at 17th-level. Plus, it deals piercing\n\t\tdamage and you can throw it!<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Unarmed<\/span>: You&#8217;re going to use Unarmed\n\t\tStrikes no matter what since Martial Arts&#8217; and Flurry of Blows&#8217; extra\n\t\tattacks both require you to use unarmed strikes. Since weapon damage will\n\t\texceed your unarmed damage until level 17, you <em>only<\/em> want to use\n\t\tyour unarmed strikes for these bonus attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons-dedicated-weapon\">Weapon for Dedicated Weapon<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Provided that you&#8217;re using the Dedicated Weapon Optional Class Feature, you\n\tweapon options are expanded considerably beyond the typical set of monk\n\tweapons. However, the limitation on weapon traits means that in a practical\n\tsense there is a limited number of truly optimal weapons. You&#8217;ll need to find\n\tweapon proficiencies somewhere, but between racial traits, feats, and\n\tmulticlassing, you have plenty of options. Unfortunately you can only have one\n\tDedicated Weapon at a time, but if you can get the proficiencies you can\n\tchange weapons daily to get whatever suits your needs at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your first and most obvious choice is a weapon that can exceed the damage of\n\ta spear. Since you can&#8217;t use weapons with the Two-Handed trait, your best bet\n\tis a Versatile (1d10) weapon like the Battle Axe, the Longsword, or the\n\tWarhammer. I typically prefer a slashing weapon because your unarmed strikes\n\tare probably locked into bludgeoning damage. Going straight to 1d10 damage at\n\tlevel 2 means that you&#8217;re getting as much damage as the Monk&#8217;s best Martial\n\tArts damage die, which feels pretty good at level 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you should address the issue of ranged combat. The Monk&#8217;s best ranged options are normally crossbows and darts, and those aren&#8217;t fantastic options. I recommend getting a shortbow. If nothing else, you can use Extra Attack without worrying about the Loading property or how to draw darts fast enough. If you use the Focused Aim Optional Class Feature, you can trigger Ki-Fueled Attack and make an attack with your shortbow as a Bonus Action. It&#8217;s not perfect, but that goes a long way to improve the Monk&#8217;s capabilities in ranged combat. Most monks won&#8217;t match the Kensei&#8217;s capabilities with a bow, but that&#8217;s to be expected since the Kensei is supposed to be the best monk at using weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have additional proficiencies (most sources of weapon proficiencies\n\twill provided three or more), you&#8217;ve got some flexibility. I recommend the\n\tWhip because it gives you easy access to Reach. The damage die is small, but\n\tyour Martial Arts die raises it to be in line with similar weapons, so the\n\ttrade is less harsh. The ability to make hit-and-run attacks while remaining\n\tout of enemies reach is a great tactical option for the Monk, especially if\n\tyou have a durable ally to discourage enemies from chasing you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can fit a feat into your build, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/gunner\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"12513\">Gunner<\/a> makes firearms a possibility. Making a musket your dedicated weapon gives you a good ranged option that you can use within melee reach and also gives you a +1 Dexterity increase, so it&#8217;s easy to fit into your build despite the Monk&#8217;s MAD issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Monk Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks need armor even less than Wizards, instead relying on Unarmored Defense.

It doesn&#8217;t require attunement, and has a fly speed of 50 feet,\n\t\tthough many medium characters will exceed the 200 pound limit to reduce the\n\t\tspeed to 30 feet, but even then 30 feet fly speed with no duration cap and\n\t\trequiring no action after speaking the command word is absolutely\n\t\tincredible. The only drawback is that you&#8217;re using the item&#8217;s speed rather\n\t\tthan giving yourself a fly speed, so things that improve your speed won&#8217;t\n\t\tmake the broom move faster, and you can&#8217;t Dash with the broom.

It also includes an option to regain some Ki points once per day, which is immensely helpful since the Monk can burn through them so quickly.

The +1 to attacks\n\t\tand damage is a significant boost to damage output, and the Eldritch Maul\n\t\tproperty allows you to temporarily engage enemies while remaining outside of\n\t\tmelee reach.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eyes of the Eagle<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Perception is the most frequently rolled skill in the game, and you are\n\t\tlikely the person in the party who is best at it (provided that you got\n\t\tproficiency from your race or your background).

Despite their\n\t\tunassuming, undecorated appearance and lack of obvious weaponry, you can\u2019t\n\t\thelp but notice the grace with which they move, the fluidity with which they\n\t\tsweep that staff through the air, and the coiled muscles beneath the simple\n\t\tgarb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dscryb.com\/scene\/tatu-searis-the-human-way-of-the-open-hand-monk\/?aff=183\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>&#8212; Boxed text provided by dScryb<\/em><\/a>\n\t\t<sup><a href=\"\/about\/faq\/#what-are-affiliate-links-and-why-do-you-use-them\">(affiliate link)<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0&#8220;Staple\u00a0Build&#8221;.\u00a0This\u00a0build\u00a0is\u00a0simple,\u00a0and\u00a0relies\u00a0on\u00a0options\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0SRD\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0Basic\u00a0Rules\u00a0wherever\u00a0possible.\u00a0If\u00a0you\u00a0need\u00a0a\u00a0functional\u00a0build\u00a0with\u00a0nothing\u00a0fancy\u00a0or\u00a0complicated,\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0great\u00a0place\u00a0to\u00a0start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Hand Monk is a solid striker with a nice mix of melee capabilities and doesn&#8217;t add much additional complexity or resource taxes on top of the base class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more optimized build, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/subclasses\/open-hand\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"13825\">Way of the Open Hand Monk Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We will assume the point buy abilities suggested above or races that get 3 ability score increases. Humans get a +1 to every ability score increase, which is the closest we can get within the Basic Rules and the SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Increased<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Human is by far the simplest race. The base human is a tempting option for\n\tclasses which rely on multiple abilities, and no class is more reliant on\n\tmultiple ability scores than the Monk. So: This will be the only staple build\n\twhere we employ the human.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll take Insight and Stealth. Insight will help us be useful in social\n\tsituations, and Stealth helps us to serve as a scout. If you get a redundant\n\tproficiency from your background, get Perception to capitalize on your Wisdom.\n\tYou might also consider getting Athletics proficiency so that you can be\n\tbetter at grappling.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background-1\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>None of the backgrounds included in the Basic Rules work especially well for\n\tthe Monk, unfortunately. Criminal is probably our best option. Deception isn&#8217;t\n\ta great skill for a Monk, but Stealth and Thieves&#8217; Tools lets us stand in for\n\ta Rogue very nicely. Acolyte is passable, but with poor Charisma I don&#8217;t know\n\twhat we would do with two languages.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats-1\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Monks are one of the few martial classes where feats aren&#8217;t a universally\n\tgood idea. The Monk needs three high ability scores, so other than Variant\n\tHuman there isn&#8217;t usually a good time to take a feat. Once you have maxed out\n\tyour Dexterity and Wisdom, it may be more beneficial to take Tough than a\n\tConstitution increase, but if you stick to increasing your ability scores\n\tyou&#8217;ll do just fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>&#8211; Unarmored Defense<br>&#8211; Martial Arts<\/td><td>For your starting gear, take a simple weapon (a spear, specifically), either pack, and 10 darts. That&#8217;s not a lot of gear, and weirdly doesn&#8217;t include clothing. Unless your background comes with clothes, you may start without pants or shoes.<br><br>The Monk is really solid at 1st level. Unarmored Defense with the ability scores we selected gives you an AC of 16, matching a fighter in heavy armor (ignoring the possibility of a shield). Martial Arts gives you two attacks per turn, and with a spear in hand your damage output is very solid. It&#8217;s important to understand how useful a spear is, especially at this level. You can use it two-handed and perform unarmed strikes by kicking people or something, so you get one attack that deals 1d8+3 and your extra Martial Arts attack deals 1d4+3.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>&#8211; Ki<br>&#8211; Unarmored Movement<\/td><td>After spending a level being a martial artist, we now get Ki and we start to really feel like a monk. Flurry of Blows will probably eat most of your Ki Points, but don&#8217;t blow through it too quickly. You only have 2 points, and while they recharge on a short rest, you probably can&#8217;t afford to use them every round.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>&#8211; Monastic Tradition: Way of the Open Hand<br>&#8211; Open Hand\n\t\t\t\t\tTechnique<br>&#8211; Deflect Missiles<\/td><td>Open Hand Technique offers some fun tactical options. Pushing enemies 15 feet away is an easy way to escape a grapple, and preventing an enemy from taking reactions means that you rarely need to take the Disengage action. The option to knock enemies prone is the most tempting option, but remember that Flurry of Blows takes place after you complete your Attack action, so you probably won&#8217;t benefit from knocking the target prone unless you&#8217;re already grappling it to prevent it from standing.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>&#8211; Ability Score Improvement (Dexterity 16 -&gt; 18)<br>&#8211; Slow\n\t\t\t\t\tFall<\/td><td>With up to three attacks per turn, a Dexterity increase gets a lot of mileage. Monks are notably the only class which gets a new class feature at 4th level, which is neat but doesn&#8217;t really change anything.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>&#8211; Extra Attack<br>&#8211; Stunning Strike<\/td><td>Extra Attack brings you to 3 attacks nearly every turn, and with 5 Ki points to spend between short rests you can afford to perform a Flurry of Blows frequently. Extra Attack also means that you get to use the better damage die from your spear more frequently, but your unarmed strike damage also increases to 1d6 at this level so the damage gap is shrinking.<br><br>Stunning Strike is crucial to playing the Monk effectively. Stunning a creature robs them of their turn, they fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and you get Advantage on attacks against them until the end of your next turn.<br><br>If you can stun an enemy on your first attack, you can follow up with Flurry of Blows to hit them with Open Hand Technique and knock them prone or push them away, and you make all of those attacks at Advantage. Unfortunately they can still move, so they can stand on their own turn even if they don&#8217;t take any actions, but even if they stumble away you still have until the end of your next turn to attack them with Advantage. Pile on the attacks.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>&#8211; Ki-Empowered Strikes<br>&#8211; Wholeness of Body<\/td><td>By this level enemies with resistance to weapon damage from non-magical attacks are increasingly common, and since unarmed strikes aren&#8217;t a weapon they can&#8217;t benefit from spells like Magic Weapon.<br><br>Wholeness of Body isn&#8217;t terribly exciting, but it&#8217;s a big pile of healing as an action so you can use it in combat in a pinch. If you&#8217;re in a really rough spot, use Wholeness of Body and spend a Ki Point to Dodge as a bonus action.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>&#8211; Evasion<br>&#8211; Stillness of Mind<\/td><td>As a front-line melee character you&#8217;re going to be targeted by AOE damage effects. Evasion helps to mitigate the damage, which is great since you don&#8217;t have the Fighter&#8217;s d10 hit points.<br><br>Stillness of Mind is better than you might expect. A huge number of effects make a creature charmed, including many that don&#8217;t seem like charm effects, and this allows you to easily escape those effects.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>&#8211; Ability Score Improvement (Dexterity 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>Maximizing your Dexterity brings your AC to 18, matching a fighter in full plate armor, and with up to four attacks per turn your damage output is considerably higher.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>&#8211; Unarmored Movement Improvement<\/td><td>The improved version of Unarmored Movement allows you to move up vertical surfaces like walls, and across the surface of water. You want to end your turn on solid ground, but between the Monk&#8217;s increased speed, Step of the Wind, and Dash, you can run 135 ft. straight up a wall in one turn. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>&#8211; Purity of Body<\/td><td>Poison is common across the whole level range, and immunity to it helps to stretch your d8 hit points.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>&#8211; Tranquility<\/td><td>Tranquility gives you the option of being a pacifist. The save DC won&#8217;t match a spellcaster&#8217;s, but it should be good enough to protect you sometimes. Keep in mind that once you attack you&#8217;re done playing a pacifist for the day, so on some days you may need to wake up and immediately choose violence.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>&#8211; Ability Score Improvement (Wisdom 16 -&gt; 18)<\/td><td>Improve your DCs and your AC.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>&#8211; Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/td><td>The ability to speak with everything is neat, but with dumped Charisma I don&#8217;t know how much good it will do. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>&#8211; Diamond Soul<\/td><td> Between Diamond Soul, Evasion, Still Mind, and good ability scores, you&#8217;re exceptionally difficult to hurt. Enemies&#8217; best bet is to attack you, but with 19 AC you&#8217;re reasonably hard to hit. You have 14 Ki points at this level, so don&#8217;t hesitate to use Diamond Soul to re-roll a saving throw.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>&#8211; Timeless Body<\/td><td>Timeless Body doesn&#8217;t matter much, but there are a handful of effects that can kill you by magically aging you.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>&#8211; Ability Score Improvement (Wisdom 18 -&gt; 20)<\/td><td>With maximized Wisdom, your AC now sits at 20, matching a character in full plate with a shield.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>&#8211; Quivering Palm<\/td><td>Quivering Palm is a save-or-die effect, plain and simple. 3 Ki points is a lot, but it&#8217;s well worth the cost. Even if the target succeeds on the save, it&#8217;s still an average of 55 damage, which is enough to be a serious problem for a creature that has already taken a lot of damage. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>&#8211; Empty Body<\/td><td>Remember that this is invisible as the condition, not as the invisibility spell. You&#8217;re free to attack as much as you like, generally doing so with Advantage since enemies usually won&#8217;t be able to see you. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>&#8211; Ability Score Improvement (Constitution 16 -&gt; 18)<\/td><td>At this level a Constitution increase comes with a big pile of extra hit points. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>&#8211; Perfect Self<\/td><td>At this level you have 20 Ki Points, so you&#8217;re probably spending a Ki Point every turn. Perfect Self helps if you get surprised by an encounter before you&#8217;ve had a chance to rest and recharge. <\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Character optimization guide for the DnD 5e Monk<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":24921,"parent":2618,"menu_order":6,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"post-templates\/article-page.php","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[24,17],"tags":[12,36,5],"class_list":["post-2658","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-dnd","category-dnd5","tag-characters","tag-dnd","tag-dnd5","has_thumb"],"rankMath":{"parentDomain":"rpgbot.net","noFollowDomains":[],"noFollowExcludeDomains":[],"noFollowExternalLinks":false,"featuredImageNotice":"The featured image should be at least 200 by 200 pixels to be picked up by Facebook and other social media sites.","pluginReviewed":false,"postSettings":{"linkSuggestions":true,"useFocusKeyword":false},"frontEndScore":false,"postName":"monk","permalinkFormat":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/%pagename%\/","showLockModifiedDate":true,"assessor":{"focusKeywordLink":"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-admin\/edit.php?focus_keyword=%focus_keyword%&post_type=%post_type%","hasTOCPlugin":{"simpletoc\/plugin.php":"SimpleTOC"},"primaryTaxonomy":false,"serpData":{"title":"","description":"Monks are iconic martial-artists, but can be challenging to play.
