It protects you about the same amount\n\t\t\t\tas a <em>Healing Word<\/em> of the equivalent spell slot, does at least\n\t\t\t\tthe same amount of damage back to attackers, and it&#8217;s temp hp so you can\n\t\t\t\tapply it before you take damage. Having <em>Command<\/em> always prepared\n\t\t\t\tis also a nice benefit.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">2nd-Level Spells<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<em>Spiritual Weapon<\/em>, the absolute king of spells that should be\n\t\t\t\tconcentration but aren&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll have some things to do with your bonus\n\t\t\t\taction already, but once you&#8217;re out of things to shove, feel free to get\n\t\t\t\tone of these out and go to town. <em>Hold Person<\/em> is also there and\n\t\t\t\tcan be put to some ok use before you turn on at level 9.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd-Level Spells<\/span>: Giving\n\t\t\t\t<em>Fear<\/em> to this subclass was someone&#8217;s idea of being sadistic to\n\t\t\t\tyour DM. If positioned correctly, you can literally end a fight with\n\t\t\t\tseveral targets by yourself, assuming they fail wisdom saves. This level\n\t\t\t\talso gives you <em>Bestow Curse<\/em> if you&#8217;re fighting something immune\n\t\t\t\tto fear.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">4th-Level Spells<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\t<em>Stoneskin<\/em> is an impressive defensive buff, and having\n\t\t\t\tresistance makes <em>Armor of Agathys<\/em> even better, but the material\n\t\t\t\tcomponent is annoying. <em>Dominate Beast<\/em> is incredibly\n\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th-Level Spells<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<em>Dominate Person,<\/em> on the other hand, is useful nearly always.\n\t\t\t\t<em>Cloudkill<\/em> will finally get you some area-of-effect damage,\n\t\t\t\tthough by this level it&#8217;s a bit of a moot point.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li><li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity<\/span> Conquering presence won&#8217;t\n\t\tdo you much good until level 7, and even then it will only be good for two\n\t\tlevels, then situationally useful for another two levels, before becoming\n\t\tlargely irrelevant thanks to <em>Fear<\/em>. Thankfully, it does have another\n\t\tuse which is very good for our attack-focused Paladin.<\/li><li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Conquest<\/span> This is the ability\n\t\taround which we define the build. From\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/basic-rules\/combat#BeingProne\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the basic rules<\/a>, if you have a movement speed of 0, you cannot stand from prone. It is\n\t\ttherefore our job to make everything prone and afraid of us.<\/li><li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scornful Rebuke<\/span> It&#8217;s literally just free\n\t\tdamage when things attack you. It&#8217;s not a lot, especially at this level, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s always on and it&#8217;s better than nothing.<\/li><li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Invincible Conqueror<\/span> Once per long rest,\n\t\tgo to town on whatever fight seems difficult.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Not substantially different from other Paladins, though you may want to focus\n\ton Charisma more than Constitution so that your saves for things like a\n\tcritical <em>Fear<\/em> can be harder to pass. Also, given that we&#8217;re focused\n\ton Athletics, building around Dexterity instead of Strength doesn&#8217;t really\n\twork here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span> Not only the driver for your melee\n\tattacks but powers Athletics as well, a core function of the example build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Dex<\/span> You&#8217;ll be wearing heavy armor and\n\t\tShield Master adds a bonus to Dexterity saves, so you can afford dump\n\t\tDexterity. However, Dexterity saves are still a great way for enemies to get\n\t\taround your other defenses, so high Dexterity saves can mitigate a common\n\t\tsource of damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span> Third in importance. While you have\n\tmany defensive capabilities, you are a front line combatant and need the\n\thitpoints to match. You also have some concentration spells and will need the\n\thelp with saves until Aura of Protection comes online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span> Dump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Wis<\/span> Dump<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cha<\/span> The Paladin&#8217;s spells and many class\n\tfeatures are powered by Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th> <\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There is very little difference between what makes a generally good Paladin\n\tand what makes a good Oath of Conquest Paladin. Look for Strength and Charisma\n\tboth, particularly if you plan to follow the example build at the end of this\n\tarticle.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Only one skill is really critical to the build and that&#8217;s Athletics. Paladins\n\talready get Athletics as a skill choice so your background can be pretty\n\tflexible. With that said, we would also like Persuasion and Intimidation (and\n\tperhaps even Deception) to capitalize on our impressive Charisma. Look for\n\tsome combination of these.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your DM will let you take Boros Legionnaire (or if you happen to be in a\n\tRavnica campaign) even better. The expanded Spell list doesn&#8217;t actually get\n\tyou the Cantrips (since it just adds them to your class list but no Paladin\n\tfeature ever lets you learn Cantrips from your list) but it does get you more\n\tthings known which is always nice.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In general, this build wants too many ASIs to bother with many feats. With\n\tthat said, Shield Master is critical to the example build, and therefore\n\tshould be taken ASAP, preferably at level 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are strictly against multiclassing, you can achieve some of the same\n\tbenefit by taking Martial Adept and picking up Menacing Attack. This choice\n\tdoes let you focus solely on Strength but, honestly, it&#8217;s just shooting you in\n\tthe foot.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You start with a longsword, you end with a longsword. Given that you need a\n\tshield for Shield Master to capitalize on Aura of Conquest, a longsword is\n\tgoing to be the go-to unless you find a magic one-handed weapon that&#8217;s better.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting option if you&#8217;re willing to give up a bit of damage is a whip. The reach means that you would actually be able to maintain someone in an attack\/fear lock even from 10 feet away which could be beneficial if you get something without reach on the ground and need to back away because it&#8217;s scarier than you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For ranged options, javelins are the go-to Strength-based option, but the range is poor compared to weapons like the longbow, so once you have the gold you might buy a bow for situations where a javelin can&#8217;t reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, there&#8217;s functionally no reason to choose any melee weapon\n\tover any other melee weapon for this build except for whatever does best\n\tdamage or has neat magical abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You&#8217;ll start with Chain Mail until you get the gold to upgrade it to Full Plate<\/li><li>Shield: Just tape it to your arm. It shouldn&#8217;t ever be off.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Oath of Conquest Paladin Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With the exception of the spells noted above in the Class Features\n\tdescription, nothing is particularly different for an Oath of Conquest Paladin\n\tas compared to other Paladins.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>While Warlock has been an enormously popular choice for Paladins for a long\n\ttime, this build finally has an actually interesting reason beyond smiting to\n\tdo it. Paladins multiclassing into Hexblade Warlocks are a dime a dozen\n\tbecause it lets you run everything off Charisma while still getting the\n\tshort-rest-recovery spell slots to power smite the combo is known for. But\n\tthat&#8217;s boring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Added in Van Richten&#8217;s Guide to Ravenloft, Undead patron Warlocks combine with\n\tOath of Conquest Paladins in a delicious harmony of scary. What Oath of\n\tConquest has been lacking since its introduction in Xanathar&#8217;s was a way to\n\tconsistently make something afraid of it. The Undead patron&#8217;s Form of Dread\n\tability is exactly that, and its uses per day scales based on proficiency\n\twhich will continue increasing as the character progresses, even with just a\n\tone or two level dip into Warlock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Warlock doesn&#8217;t excite you or you are very interested in playing a Paladin\n\tthat doesn&#8217;t focus on Charisma, you can take 3 levels of Fighter instead to\n\tget the Battlemaster archetype and take Menacing attack. I really wouldn&#8217;t\n\trecommend this, but it&#8217;s an option.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Variant Human Paladin<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>This world lacks purpose. I will be the one to unify it because I am the\n\t\tonly one with the strength to do it right. But even my strength will fail as\n\t\tI age.

While we don&#8217;t have Aura of Conquest yet, Shield Master is\n\tstill immensely powerful both to give us something to do with our bonus\n\tactions and for defensive purposes. We take Variant human so we can walk out\n\twith it at level 1 and round our two odd scores up to 16s. Custom Lineage\n\twould work almost as well, but you&#8217;d have Strength or Charisma one point short\n\tof where we start now until level 4 when you would split the ASI to balance\n\tthem both out instead of putting both points into Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Take Intimidation and Persuasion<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Take Smuggler to get Athletics and Deception, completing the complement of\n\tCharisma-based Face skills.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, walk out with Shield Master at level 1. Level 4 will get\n\tyour Strength to 18, and level 8 will get your Charisma there as well.\n\tUnfortunately we then fall behind on ASIs due to multiclassing. You won&#8217;t get\n\tCharisma to 20 until 14 and finally cap Strength to 20 at level 18.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td>1 &#8211; Paladin 1<\/td><td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Divine Sense<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Lay on Hands<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t<\/td><td> <p>For your starting equipment, take the default starting gear. I recommend the 5 javelins if you want a Strength-based ranged option, but a crossbow is a simple weapon and has better range so that&#8217;s also an option. Attach your holy symbol to said shield so it can be your focus. Use the bonus action from Shield Master basically as often as possible. If you knock something prone it has to spend half it&#8217;s speed to stand up, making it far less likely it&#8217;ll be able to get past you to your backline. It will also grant Advantage on melee attacks, which your hypothetical Rogue will love. Do note that it grants Disadvantage on ranged attacks against the target so if you have a ranged-heavy party, be aware of when you use it on what targets.<\/p> <p> <\/p><p>Your AC is a comforting 18, and you have Lay on Hands and Shield Master to help keep you up. With that said, as your LoH pool grows, it can be tempting to dump all of it into healing when the need arises. I would recommend always leaving yourself a pool of 2 no matter what level you are you you can bring the divine caster in your party back to consciousness twice if need be.
