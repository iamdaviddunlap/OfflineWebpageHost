With access to every skill, expertise,\n\tfull casting, and a decent set of proficiencies, the Bard can fill essentially\n\tevery role in the party. Subclasses like College of Lore are more of the\n\tclassic support Bard, with improved magical options and support abilities,\n\twhile College of Swords and College of Valor can serve as front-line melee\n\tcharacters who can bring their spellcasting and support capabilities into the\n\theat of battle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because bards can do so much within a single class, they can fill nearly any\n\trole within a party. Their open skill options, Expertise, and buff spells\n\tallow them to thrive as a Face and a Scout, while their offensive spellcasting\n\tmakes them effective Controllers and Support casters. The Bard&#8217;s biggest\n\tdeficiencies are damage output and durability, so it&#8217;s hard to build them as a\n\tBlaster, Defender, or Striker, but that&#8217;s not to say that it&#8217;s impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Strangely, the Bard&#8217;s emphasis on the Performance skill from previous\n\teditions has wholly vanished. There is nearly no mechanical reason to take the\n\tskill. That&#8217;s not to say that your DM can&#8217;t make it fun, of course. If nothing\n\telse, if your game uses the Lifestyle rules or the Downtime rules, your\n\tproficinecy in Performance allows you to live comfortably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our supporting content\n\tfor the Bard:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/races\/\">Bard Races Breakdown<\/a>\n\t<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/spells\/\">Bard Spells Breakdown<\/a>\n\t<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/subclasses\/\">Bard Subclasses Breakdown<\/a>\n\t<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/magical_secrets\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"9764\">Practical Guide to Magical Secrets<\/a>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

When you know that your party needs a bit of help, like on a\n\tdifficult save or on a crucial attack roll, give them an inspiration die.\n\tSince it can be used after rolling the d20, the inspiration die can be a\n\tfantastic option when you&#8217;re a point or two short of a save DC or your enemy&#8217;s\n\tAC. At fifth level the uses recharge on a Short Rest (see &#8220;Font of\n\tInspiration&#8221;), so you can afford to be much less stingy, but you still don&#8217;t\n\twant to burn through them too quickly.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Bardic Inspiration<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music.

The last paragraph of the\n\t\tInstrument of the Bards entry is easy to overlook, but it&#8217;s exciting: If you\n\t\tplay the instrument while casting a spell which causes the target to become\n\t\tCharmed (Charm Person, Dominate Person, etc.) and which requires either\n\t\tsomatic or material components, the targets suffer Disadvantage on their\n\t\tsave. The list of applicable spells is small, but it&#8217;s still exciting.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">Pearl of Power<\/span>\n\t\t<sup> <a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a> <\/sup>: Useful on any\n\t\tspellcaster.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Rhythm-Maker&#8217;s Drum<\/span>\n\t\t<sup> <a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a> <\/sup>: +1 to your attacks and\n\t\tspell DC&#8217;s.
