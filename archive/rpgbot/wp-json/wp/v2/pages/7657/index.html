It looks confusing and the text in\n\tthe Player&#8217;s Handbook has some gaps (which I&#8217;ll fix below), but if you\n\tunderstand the core rules of advancing a single-class character you don&#8217;t need\n\tto know much more to successfully advance a multiclassed character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This page uses two terms which were used in previous editions of DnD, but\n\tdon&#8217;t exist officially in 5th edition. However, they&#8217;re useful descriptors of\n\tconcepts core to multiclassing, so I&#8217;m going to use them throughout the\n\tarticle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Character Level<\/strong>: Your characters total number of levels\n\t\tacross all of their classes. For a single-class character, your Character\n\t\tlevel is the same number as your Class Level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Class Level<\/strong>: Your number of levels in a single class. For\n\t\texample, if Joe is a Fighter 3 \/ Rogue 1, their class level in Fighter is 3\n\t\tand their class level in Rogue is 1.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-selecting\">Selecting a Class<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>When multiclassing, typically your first step is to consider which class you want to multiclass into. Every class has things to offer, so I&#8217;ll go into more detail on suggestions later in this article. Provided that you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/customization-options#Prerequisites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">meet the prerequisites<\/a>, you can take levels in that class the next time you would gain a level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that you can&#8217;t take the same class more than once. You can&#8217;t\n\tmulticlass into a class in which you already have levels. No Rogue 1 \/ Rogue\n\t1. I see new players ask about that a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-prerequisites\">Prerequisites<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There are some prerequisites to multiclass into every class. Typically, all\n\tthat&#8217;s required is an ability score of 13 or better in one or two ability\n\tscores which the class is dependent upon. See the Customization Options\n\tchapter of the Player&#8217;s Handbook for the table of multiclass prerequisites.\n\tFor the Artificer, see the Artificer class description in Eberron: Rising from\n\tthe Last War or in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-xp\">Experience Points<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Experience points are based on your character level, and that doesn&#8217;t change\n\tregardless of how many classes you have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-hp\">Hit Points and Hit Dice<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Hit Points are additive: As you gain levels, you&#8217;ll roll for hit points (or\n\ttake the rounded average, which you should always do) and add them to your hit\n\tpoint maximum just like if you gained a level in your original class. Remember\n\tthat you use the &#8220;Hit Points at Higher Levels&#8221; entry for your class rather\n\tthan the &#8220;Hit Points at 1st Level&#8221; entry. &#8220;Hit Points at 1st Level&#8221; refers to\n\tyour character level, not your class level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hit Dice are similarly additive. Every time you gain a level in a class, you\n\tadd a hit die of the appropriate size to your pool of hit dice. This will\n\toften result in having multiple hit die sizes. When you spend a hit die, you\n\tcan choose which die to use. But the hit dice aren&#8217;t interchangeable: if you\n\tonly have one d12 hit die (such as from one level in Barbarian) and the rest\n\tare d6&#8217;s (such as from several levels in Wizard), you only get to use the d12\n\thit die once per day.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-proficiency-bonus\">Proficiency Bonus<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Proficiency Bonus is based on your character level. While it&#8217;s included in\n\tevery class&#8217;s class features table, it advances based on the sum of your\n\tlevels rather than your level in a single class. If you multiclass, your\n\tProficiency Bonus is still just as good as everyone else&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-cantrips\">Cantrips<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Knowing a cantrip can come from a variety of sources: your race, your class,\n\tfeats, or maybe your DM just gave it to you or something. Cantrips, like\n\tProficiency Bonus, advance based on your character level. No matter how many\n\tclasses you take, your damage-dealing cantrips will add more damage at\n\tcharacter levels 5, 11, and 17. If you multiclass late in your career, your\n\tdamage is still based on your character level, so if you spend your 20th level\n\tto take one level of Wizard you&#8217;re suddenly very good at cantrips.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-ability-score-increases\">Ability Score Increases<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Ability Score Increases are a class feature. While most classes gain Ability\n\tScore Increases at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level (Fighters and Rogues\n\tboth get more), it&#8217;s still a class feature. It is entirely possible to\n\tmulticlass so much that you never gain an Ability Score Increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-proficiencies\">Proficiencies<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>When you multiclass into a new class, you don&#8217;t get everything which you\n\twould normally get from being a 1st-level character of that class. You do get\n\teverything listed in the class features table for the class, but you&#8217;ll\n\ttypically get a reduced set of the class&#8217;s initial proficiencies (armor,\n\tskills, tools, weapons, etc.), and you never gain new starting equipment or\n\tsaving throw proficiencies when you multiclass into a new class unless the\n\tclass grants a feature that gives you additional saving throw proficiencies\n\tlike the Rogue&#8217;s Slippery Mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that duplicate proficiencies do not get replaced or upgraded or\n\tanything like that. If you get proficiency in medium armor twice, you&#8217;re still\n\tjust proficient in medium armor. If you get proficiency in Stealth twice,\n\tyou&#8217;re still just proficient in Stealth. The rule which allows you to replace\n\tredundant proficiencies is specific to backgrounds, and applies only to\n\tproficiencies granted by your background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the Customization Options chapter of the Player&#8217;s handbook for the table\n\tof which proficiencies you gain from multiclassing.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-shared-features\">Class Features from Multiple Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Several classes grant features with the same name. When this happens, there\n\tare some specific rules for some of these features. The Player&#8217;s Handbook\n\tdetails Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, and Unarmored Defense but I&#8217;ve added\n\tsome additional class features which new players often find confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Ability Score Increases<\/strong>: Ability Score increases are\n\t\tindependent of one another. You can gain as many as you can squeeze out of\n\t\t20 levels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Channel Energy<\/strong>: You don&#8217;t get more uses between rests, but\n\t\tyou can add additional ways to use it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cantrips<\/strong>: Cantrips known are additive, but remember that\n\t\tthe source that gives you the cantrip determines the ability score which you\n\t\tuse with that spell. For example: a High Elf Cleric \/ Wizard would get one\n\t\tcantrip from their race and a few from each class. You could select Toll the\n\t\tDead from all three sources technically (don&#8217;t do that) and you would have\n\t\tthe ability to cast it using both Wisdom (Cleric) and Intelligence (High Elf\n\t\tor Wizard).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extra Attack<\/strong>: The wording of Extra Attack very\n\t\tspecifically doesn&#8217;t <em>add<\/em> an attack; it replaces the number of\n\t\tattacks you can make. If two sources say &#8220;you can make two attacks&#8221;, you can\n\t\tstill only make two attacks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Unarmored Defense<\/strong>: Unarmored Defense provides new\n\t\tcalculation methods for determining your AC, just like donning armor or\n\t\thaving natural armor from your race. You can choose which AC calculation to\n\t\tuse (generally you&#8217;ll want to use the highest), but you still only get to\n\t\tuse one at a time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-it-work-spellcasting\">Spellcasting \/ Pact Magic<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The rules for spellcasting for multiclassed characters are detailed, and it&#8217;s\n\timportant that you read the original source text. I can&#8217;t reproduce it here\n\tbecause it&#8217;s not part of the SRD, so please see the Player&#8217;s Handbook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting note: All of the partial spellcasters in the Player&#8217;s\n\tHandbook (paladins, arcane tricksters, etc.) round their levels down when\n\tcalculating your effective level for the purposes of spellcasting. The\n\tArtificer rounds up, and currently they&#8217;re the only class to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"should-i-multiclass\">Should I Multiclass?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand how multiclassing works, it&#8217;s time to ask yourself an\n\timportant question: Should I multiclass?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, no. A single-class character is usually perfectly fine. While\n\tmulticlassing is a great way to get something <em>different<\/em> for your\n\tcharacter, it&#8217;s not guaranteed to be something <em>better<\/em> than what you\n\twould get from a single class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if you do multiclass you can find a great number of powerful new\n\toptions to improve your character.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-should-i-multiclass\">When Should I Multiclass?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This question has two meanings: &#8220;When should I choose to make a multiclass character?&#8221; and &#8220;when in my character&#8217;s level progression should I multiclass?&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t fit well into a section heading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should multiclass when you&#8217;re looking to address a gap in your\n\tcharacter&#8217;s capabilities, such as poor action economy, low AC, or new\n\tspellcasting options. As explained above, many characters work fine as a\n\tsingle-class character, but sometimes new class features can really add a lot\n\tto your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When to begin taking levels in a new class is more complicated. It&#8217;s tempting to start looking at other classes right at level 2, and sometimes that&#8217;s okay to do. But be careful about what happens at level 5. Level 5 brings powerful options like Extra Attack and 3rd-level spells like Fireball, and the game&#8217;s math is designed to respond to that sharp increase in player characters&#8217; capabilities with an equivalent jump in difficulty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you postpone crucial features like Ability Score Increases, Extra Attack, and high-level spells, you may have trouble with high-CR foes. If you do choose to multiclass, be sure that whatever you get in exchange will offset whatever you give up or postpone.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-many-levels\">How Many Levels Should I Take in Each Class?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is probably the second-hardest question, right behind &#8220;which class do I\n\ttake?&#8221;, and it has a similarly frustrating answer: it depends on your\n\tbuild.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players will commonly take what I refer to as a &#8220;class dip&#8221;, where they take\n\ta small number of levels in a class before moving on to another class or back\n\tto their original class. This is often an effective way to build a\n\tmulticlassed character because classes often grant several powerful features\n\tin their first few levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll instead want to alternate sets of levels between two\n\tclasses. This is less common because it often results in being bad at two\n\tclasses rather than really good at one with some goodies from another, but I\n\thave seen a handful of builds where it makes sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classes have some logical &#8220;break points&#8221; where it often makes sense to break\n\taway from that class. This is typically after you get some specific class\n\tfeatures like the class&#8217;s initial subclass features or an Ability Score\n\tIncrease. I&#8217;ll discuss break points for each class in the Classes and\n\tSubclasses section, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-and-subclasses\">Classes and Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Below I&#8217;ll discuss each class and subclass and what they can offer other\n\tclasses. There are few truly bad options since nearly every class and subclass\n\thas something to offer, but not every class\/subclass will add something useful\n\tto every build. I&#8217;ll list numbered bullets with break points and explain why\n\tyou might advance to that level before switching away from the class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re building a new character and planning to multiclass at some point,\n\tI encourage you to explore the section below now. Starting with a level in a\n\tclass changes your character a great deal, and even if you never take another\n\tlevel in that class a 1st-level class dip can be a great build choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"artificer\">Artificer<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Artificers are a great class dip for many spellcasting classes both because\n\tof their unique rules for multiclassing, access to medium armor and shields,\n\tand because they get proficiency in Constitution saving throws, not to mention\n\ta number of fantastic class features which essentially any character can\n\tuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Tinkering, Spellcasting<\/span>: Magical\n\t\tTinkering doesn&#8217;t do much, but the Artificer&#8217;s spellcasting includes a lot\n\t\tof options from the Wizard&#8217;s spell list, and notably you get to round\n\t\tArtificer levels up when you calculate your effective level for determining\n\t\tyour spell slots.

The Right Tool for the\n\t\tJob is situational, but can be useful for a class that&#8217;s so good with\n\t\ttools.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase<\/span>: Every class gets\n\t\tan Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you already took three levels\n\t\tin the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one more just to get the\n\t\tASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Artificer Specialist feature<\/span>: Varies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tool Expertise, 3 Infused Items<\/span>: Tool\n\t\tExpertise is neat, but you&#8217;re probably here for the additional Infused Item\n\t\tand the additional Infusion options.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"artificer-armorer\">Armorer<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Tempting for the Arcane Trickster, but otherwise the Battle Smith is a better\n\tclass dip for &#8220;gish&#8221; builds. It&#8217;s easy to think &#8220;I just want good armor&#8221; and\n\tlook at the Armorer, but unless you&#8217;re going to use the specific benefits of\n\tthe armor it&#8217;s not worth the class dip compared to anything else that gets you\n\theavy armor proficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Tools of the Trade, Armorer Spells, Arcane Armor, Armor Model<\/span>: The armor is why you&#8217;re here. The Defender armor is good for front-line\n\t\tbuilds, while Infiltrator Armor is very tempting for the Rogue because you\n\t\tget persistent Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and you can use the\n\t\tLightning Launcher to deliver Sneak Attack. However, it doesn&#8217;t address the\n\t\tMAD issues for the Arcane Trickster like the Battle Smith does, which makes\n\t\tit a hard choice.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Arcane tricksters might\n\t\tdecide that 2 more levels to get Extra Attack is worth the cost, but I would\n\t\tthink long and hard about how desperate you are to make a second attack\n\t\tcompared to what you give up, especially since Booming Blade is an\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"artificer-alchemist\">Alchemist<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Nothing good enough to justify the opportunity cost of multiclassing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tool Proficiency, Alchemist Spells, Experimental Elixir<\/span>: The spells are nothing new to the Artificer&#8217;s spell list. Experimental\n\t\tElixir is a neat way to turn your 1st-level spell slots into some new\n\t\teffects, but it&#8217;s not good enough to justify multiclassing for three\n\t\tlevels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Alchemical Savant<\/span>: A nice bonus to\n\t\tcommon damage spells and to healing spells, but compared to taking more\n\t\tlevels in a class with full spellcasting (sorcerer, wizard, etc.) it&#8217;s not\n\t\tworth the levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"artificer-artillerist\">Artillerist<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Three levels to get an Arcane Cannon can be a powerful asset, even if you\n\tdon&#8217;t have a lot of Intelligence to throw around. Arcane Cannon is that\n\tgood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tool Proficiency, Artillerist Spells, Eldritch Cannon<\/span>: The spells are nothing new to the Artificer&#8217;s spell list. You&#8217;re here for\n\t\tEldritch Cannon. Even if your Intelligence is mediocre, the Protector option\n\t\tis still spectacular. If you&#8217;re built around Intelligence, the Flamethrower\n\t\tand Force Ballista options both work fine even with only three levels in\n\t\tartificer. Even the Wizard might find Eldritch Cannon a better use of a\n\t\t1st-level spell slot than most spells. If you don&#8217;t want to pour spell slots\n\t\tinto replacing cannons, leave yours out of combat and it&#8217;s still effectively\n\t\tcasting False Life on your whole party before every encounter.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arcane Firearm<\/span>: Tempting, but for a full\n\t\tspellcaster this isn&#8217;t good enough to justify giving up two levels of your\n\t\tmain class&#8217;s spellcasting and the additional spell level which it\n\t\tgrants.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"artificer-battle-smith\">Battle Smith<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Battle Ready is the primary reason to multiclass into Battle Smith. It&#8217;s an\n\tinteresting option for Intelligence-based arcane\/martial subclasses (arcane\n\ttrickster, etc.), but it won&#8217;t always fix your MAD problems, and you need to\n\tconsider if giving up 3 to 4 levels in your primary class and postponing your\n\tclass&#8217;s high-level class features is worth having a better Intelligence bonus\n\tto back up your spells without sacrificing your attack bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Tool Proficiency, Battle Smith Spells, Battle Ready, Steel Defender<\/span>: There are two notable things here: Battle Ready and Steel Defender.\n\t\tBattle Ready is tempting for arcane tricksters, eldritch knights, and\n\t\tbladesingers who all typically need to balance their ability scores between\n\t\teither Strength or Dexterity and Intelligence. However, your Steel Defender\n\t\tis much less useful since its hit points are calculated based on your\n\t\tartificer class level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Arcane tricksters might\n\t\tdecide that 2 more levels to get Extra Attack is worth the cost, but I would\n\t\tthink long and hard about how desperate you are to make a second attack\n\t\tcompared to what you give up, especially since Booming Blade is an\n\t\toption.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"barbarian\">Barbarian<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Barbarian is a tempting class dip for martial characters or for other\n\tclasses which want to improve their martial capabilities beyond what their\n\tclass offers on its own. However, it can also be a difficult option because\n\tthere are so few boring levels in the class so it&#8217;s hard to pick a break\n\tpoint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rage, Unarmored Defense, 2 Rages<\/span>: Two\n\t\tgreat reasons to take a barbarian dip. Unarmored Defense is a great option\n\t\tfor many martial builds, though it won&#8217;t exceed the AC from armor until\n\t\tyou&#8217;ve acquired several Ability Score Increases. One level only gets Rage\n\t\ttwice per day, but when you need help with Strength checks or you just need\n\t\ta little extra damage it&#8217;s still a great combat buff.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reckless Attack, Danger Sense<\/span>: Reckless\n\t\tAttack is a great offensive option, but other classes may not be durable\n\t\tenough to risk constantly granting Advantage to hit them. Many rogues eye\n\t\tReckless Attack, but remember that it only works with melee attack rolls\n\t\tusing Strength. Danger Sense is similarly tempting if you combine it with\n\t\tthe Rogue&#8217;s Evasion, granting you near immunity to many AOE damage effects.\n\t\tDanger Sense is less useful for other classes, but AOE damage is still very\n\t\tcommon so it&#8217;s still very useful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Primal Path, 3 Rages, Primal Knowledge (Optional)<\/span>: Varies by Primal Path. You also gain a 3rd rage per day at this\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase<\/span>: Every class gets\n\t\tan Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you already took three levels\n\t\tin the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one more just to get the\n\t\tASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack, Fast Movement<\/span>: Extra Attack\n\t\tis a central feature of most martial classes, but by this level you should\n\t\tprobably think about making barbarian your primary class. Fast Movement is\n\t\tnice, too, and most marti classes don&#8217;t grant anything except Extra Attack\n\t\tat 5th level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Path Feature, 4 Rages<\/span>: Varies by Primal\n\t\tPath. You also gain a 4th rage per day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"barbarian-ancestral-guardian\">Path of the Ancestral Guardian<\/h4>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ancestral Protectors<\/span>: One of very few\n\t\t&#8220;taunt&#8221; mechanics in the game, this is a great way to force enemies to focus\n\t\ton you in combat. You also get 3 rages per day at this level, so you can\n\t\temploy this several times throughout the day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Shield (2d6)<\/span>: This is good, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s not good enough to justify multiclassing 6 levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"barbarian-battlerager\">Path of the Battlerager<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The AC lost when you compare Half Plate to Spiked Armor is likely not worth\n\tthe Bonus Action attack which you get in return. If you&#8217;re desperate for an\n\tadditional way to spend your Bonus Action, consider a level of Monk for\n\tMartial Arts or try two-weapon fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Battlerager Armor<\/span>: Battlerager Armor is bad\n\t\tmedium armor. It gets you a Bonus Action attack which sounds tempting, but\n\t\tif you want to use a two-handed weapon with a Bonus Action attack, take one\n\t\tmore level and get Polearm Master with the level 4 Ability Score\n\t\tImprovement.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Reckless Abandon<\/span>: Up to 5 temporary hit\n\t\tpoints every round when you decide to use Reckless Attack. This is a nice\n\t\tpad to your hit points, but it&#8217;s nowhere near good enough to take 6 levels\n\t\tof barbarian to get it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"barbarian-beast\">Path of the Beast<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>An excellent subclass on its own, but a dismal multiclass dip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Form of the Beast<\/span>: Good buffs to your\n\t\trage, but unless you abandon your manufactured weapons in favor of the\n\t\tnatural weapons you&#8217;re basically ignoring the benefits. At just three rages\n\t\tper day, you need to be comfortable fighting with your manufactured weapons\n\t\tand consider Rage an occasional combat buff, so it&#8217;s hard to build yourself\n\t\taround using claws or whatever a few times per day.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bestial Soul<\/span>: Absolutely not good enough to\n\t\tjustify 6 levels. Take a few levels in something that can cast spells and\n\t\tyou can handle these problems magically.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"barbarian-berserker\">Path of the Berserker<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Frenzy is the most likely reason why you might consider Path of the\n\tBerserker, but you&#8217;re unlikely to use it more than once per day, and if you do\n\tuse it you&#8217;re going to regret it for the rest of the day, so you&#8217;re spending 3\n\tlevels to get a class feature that you&#8217;re going to regret using.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frenzy<\/span>: Frenzy is a hard choice for the\n\t\tBarbarian because Exhaustion can be a serious problem due to its increasing\n\t\teffects as you add levels of Exhaustion. As your number of rages per day\n\t\tincreases, the temptation to take on more and more levels of exhaustion\n\t\tgrows, and since exhaustion only wears off one level per long rest, it can\n\t\tbe a multi-day endeavor to recover from a few uses of Frenzy. But if you\n\t\tonly go a few levels into barbarian and only have 2 or 3 rages per day,\n\t\tFrenzy is much less of a problem since it&#8217;s so much harder to rack up levels\n\t\tof exhaustion. If you just need a good combat buff once or twice a day,\n\t\tFrenzy is a viable option so long as you can handle having 1 or 2 levels of\n\t\texhaustion afterward. But if you just need a once per day combat buff, 3\n\t\tlevels in barbarian is a terrible way to get it.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Mindless Rage<\/span>: Charm and Fear effects are\n\t\tcommon and they&#8217;re great ways to take a martial character out of a fight\n\t\tsince martial characters typically have poor mental saves. But I don&#8217;t think\n\t\tit&#8217;s good enough to go this far into the Barbarian to get it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"path-of-the-giant\">Path of the Giant<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Path of the Giant is a lot of fun, but Giant&#8217;s Havoc can be replaced by casting Enlarge\/Reduce, so this isn&#8217;t a great class dip when you could just take one level of wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Giant&#8217;s Power<\/span>: Basicaly just for flavor.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Giant&#8217;s Havoc<\/span>: Both good buffs while raging.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Cleaver<\/span>: A good damage boost and the ability to change damage type, but not tactically impactful enough for a class dip this deep.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"barbarian-storm-herald\">Path of the Storm Herald<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Storm Aura is too dependent on barbarian class level to make it viable for a\n\tmulticlassed character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Storm Aura<\/span>: This is a really great class\n\t\tfeature, but the effects scale with barbarian class level so unless you&#8217;re a\n\t\tsingle-class barbarian the effects will gradually become less and less\n\t\tappealing as you gain levels.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Storm Soul<\/span>: Basically just damage\n\t\tresistance to one damage type. Not worth the levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"barbarian-totem-warrior\">Path of the Totem Warrior<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Three levels of Path of the Totem Warrior gets you the first totem ability,\n\twhich adds a powerful additional effect to your Rage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit Seeker \/ Totem Spirit<\/span>: Spirit\n\t\tSeeker is very situational, but that&#8217;s not why you&#8217;re here. Totem Spirit\n\t\tadds an additional effect to your rage, and with 3 rages per day that can be\n\t\ta big tactical option. Generally people will go for Bear for the additional\n\t\tdamage resistances, but in a party with other melee allies don&#8217;t overlook\n\t\tWolf.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Aspect of the Beast<\/span>: These abilities are\n\t\talmost entire &#8220;flavor&#8221; abilities with very little substance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"barbarian-zealot\">Path of the Zealot<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Path of the Zealot is already a niche option for death-prone players, and\n\tmulticlassing into it doesn&#8217;t make it better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Divine Fury, Warrior of the Gods<\/span>: Divine\n\t\tFury is too dependent on class level, and Warrior of the Gods is only\n\t\tappealing if you die frequently and don&#8217;t like building replacement\n\t\tcharacters.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fanatical Focus<\/span>: Great, but less useful\n\t\tsince you&#8217;re not going to continue to get additional rages per day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"barbarian-wild-magic\">Path of Wild Magic<\/h4>\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-gren\">Magic Awareness, Wild Surge<\/span>: Magic\n\t\tAwareness&#8217;s uses per day scale with your Proficiency Bonus, and Wild Surge\n\t\tis a great (though unpredictable) buff to Rage which works on anyone who\n\t\twould use Rage effectively.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bolstering Magic<\/span>: The benefits are good,\n\t\tbut not worth a 6 level dip. The bonus to attacks can be matched by effects\n\t\tlike Bless or Guidance, and you&#8217;ll restore at most 6 spell slots if you go\n\t\tthat route. If you instead took 3 levels of Cleric you would get 6 spell\n\t\tslots and you could cast Bless among numerous other benefits.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"bard\">Bard<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A tempting option for any Charisma-based character, especially spellcasters,\n\tthe Bard&#8217;s unique mix of spellcasting, skill mastery, and support features\n\tmakes them a great way to broaden your skillset without a big level\n\tinvestment. Bard subclasses are diverse, offering numerous ways to improve\n\tvarious capabilities depending on what you want from your class dip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even for non-Charisma characters, the Bard has a lot to offer between extra\n\tproficiencies, spellcasting (including ritual casting), and numerous powerful\n\tlow-level class features, many of which use your Bonus Action or work outside\n\tof combat so they won&#8217;t conflict with most of your other class features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting, Bardic Inspiration (d6)<\/span>: If\n\t\tyou have decent Charisma, a single level of bard gets you quite a bit. Light\n\t\tarmor (great for sorcerers), proficiency in any one skill and an instrument,\n\t\tplus some staple bard features.\n\t\t<p>Bardic Inspiration is just incredibly useful, and even if you never\n\t\t\timprove the die, increasing your Charisma will add more uses so it&#8217;s a\n\t\t\tgreat option for other Charisma-based spellcasters like paladins,\n\t\t\tsorcerers, and warlocks, as well other characters who might have high\n\t\t\tCharisma like some rogues.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The Bard&#8217;s spellcasting at 1st level isn&#8217;t going to be stunningly\n\t\t\tpowerful, but it includes some great healing and support options like\n\t\t\tHealing Word and Heroism, and you do get ritual casting with the handful\n\t\t\tof bard spells that you learn.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jack of All Trades, Song of Rest (d6), Magical Inspiration\n\t\t\t(Optional)<\/span>: Song of rest is always nice, but beyond low levels the extra d6 will\n\t\tquickly feel like an insignificant addition to other healing during a Short\n\t\tRest. It&#8217;s like sprinkles on top of a big bowl of ice cream: It looks nice\n\t\tand it feels nice, but it&#8217;s not really doing much at that point.\n\t\t<p>Jack of All Trades is why you&#8217;re really here. Ironically, it&#8217;s more\n\t\t\tuseful with skills if you have fewer skill proficiencies so it&#8217;s a great\n\t\t\toption for multiclassed characters who didn&#8217;t start as a bard or rogue,\n\t\t\tbut its benefits don&#8217;t stop with skills. I&#8217;ve found a long list of other\n\t\t\tcases where it applies and they&#8217;re listed on my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/#jack-of-all-trades\">Bard Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bard College, Expertise<\/span>: The benefits of\n\t\tyour bard college will vary by college. Expertise is useful on nearly every\n\t\tcharacter, and you get to pick two proficiencies. If you&#8217;re not sure,\n\t\tPerception is always a good choice.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase, Bardic Versatility (Optional)<\/span>: Every class gets an Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you\n\t\talready took three levels in the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one\n\t\tmore just to get the ASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bardic Inspiration (d8), Font of Inspiration<\/span>: If you&#8217;ve been enjoying Bardic Inspiration, this is a great level. Not\n\t\tonly does the die size increase, but your pool of dice resets on Short Rests\n\t\tso you can get as many as three times your Charisma Modifier per day\n\t\t(assuming that you&#8217;re using the Adventuring Day rules).<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Countercharm, Bard College Feature<\/span>:\n\t\tCountercharm is very situational, so you&#8217;re taking this level for your\n\t\tsubclass feature.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"bard-creation\">College of Creation<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re exploring the bard for Bardic Inspiration, College of Creation is\n\tthe best choice. Going to level 5 for Font of Inspiration will make Mote of\n\tPotential extremely effective, even without advancing your Bardic Inspiration\n\tdie&#8217;s size past d8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mote of Potential, Performance of Creation<\/span>: Mote of Potential is a big improvement to Bardic Inspiration, so if you\n\t\tplan to use Bardic Inspiration frequently College of Creation becomes an\n\t\teasy choice, but you&#8217;ll probably want to go to at least level 5 to get Font\n\t\tof Inspiration. Performance of Creation is an interesting utility, and even\n\t\tif you stop at level 3 60gp is enough to cover most of the items in the\n\t\tPlayer&#8217;s Handbook.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Animating Performance<\/span>: The item&#8217;s stats\n\t\tare based heavily on your class level, so it&#8217;s not going to be useful as a\n\t\tcombat pet.

Sure, your Bardic Inspiration die is only a d6, but the average\n\t\troll on a d6 is 3.5 and Disadvantage works out to a penalty slightly worse\n\t\tthan -3, which means that you can impose a penalty which is on average\n\t\tlarger than Disadvantage as Bonus Action, then follow it up with a spell as\n\t\tan Action.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Unfailing Inspiration, Universal Speech<\/span>:\n\t\tUnfailing Inspiration is a major improvement to Bardic Inspiration, and\n\t\tUniversal Speech is fantastic on any Face character.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"bard-glamour\">College of Glamour<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Mantle of Inspiration is an interesting option if you multiclassed into bard\n\tbut don&#8217;t want to invest in Charisma and Face skills to make College of\n\tEloquence&#8217;s features more appealing. Other than that, there&#8217;s very little here\n\tworth having.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantle of Inspiration, Enthralling Performance<\/span>: Mantle of Inspiration is an interesting tactical option, but I&#8217;ve always\n\t\tfound Enthralling Performance to be very difficult to use.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mantle of Majesty<\/span>: Absolutely not worth\n\t\tthis many levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"bard-lore\">College of Lore<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you need better Face skills, go for College of Eloquence.

Cutting Words offers a useful way\n\t\tto apply Bardic Inspiration defensively without spending the Bonus Action\n\t\tahead of time to give your ally an inspiration die.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Additional Magic Secrets<\/span>: The point of\n\t\tMagic Secrets is to enable the Bard to get access to other classes&#8217; spells\n\t\twithout multiclassing. If you&#8217;re taking 6 levels of bard to get 2 spells\n\t\tfrom another class, why not just take levels in that class?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"bard-spirits\">College of Spirits<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The most likely reason to take College of Spirits is for Spirit Session, but\n\tspending the same number of levels in a different spellcasting class like the\n\tSorcerer will likely get you more useful magical options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Tales from Beyond<\/span>: Tales from Beyond\n\t\tdepends heavily on advancing your Bardic Inspiration die size, so it&#8217;s not a\n\t\tgreat fit.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spirit Session<\/span>: This is a good feature,\n\t\tand the spell level advances based on your Proficiency Bonus so it works\n\t\twell as a multiclass feature. However, it&#8217;s limited to Divination and\n\t\tNecromancy spells, and with the number of levels you&#8217;re investing to get\n\t\there you can learn a big pile of spells either from the Bard or from some\n\t\tother class that you could put 6 levels into.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"bard-swords\">College of Swords<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>This is a really hard choice. You&#8217;ll get better proficiencies from the\n\tFighter with better Fighting Style options, and the Battle Master Fighter&#8217;s\n\tSuperiority Dice offer considerably more tactical options with a\n\tsimilarly-sized pool that recharges on a Short Rest right from 3rd level. If\n\tyou want spellcasting, other subclasses or even other classes offer better\n\toptions. If you need both martial proficiencies and spellcasting from one\n\tclass, I&#8217;m not sure what your base class is. Maybe rogue?

Blade flourish is thematically interesting, but it\n\t\teats your Bardic Inspiration dice so it&#8217;s hard to recommend using it unless\n\t\tyou go far enough to get Font of Inspiration.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Attack<\/span>: A level later than martial\n\t\tclasses on top of how long you may have postponed it to multiclass.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"bard-valor\">College of Valor<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The only reasons I can think of to pursue College of Valor on a multiclassed\n\tcharacter are for the armor and shield proficiencies without giving up the\n\tspellcasting progression.

It doesn&#8217;t offer anything that&#8217;s going to support a\n\tmulticlass build, and while the features aren&#8217;t directly dependent on class\n\tlevel they generally improve by being a higher-level cleric and increasing\n\tyour Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spells, Circle of Mortality, Eyes of the Grave<\/span>: The healing benefit of Circle of Mortality is nice because the most\n\t\timportant time to heal an ally is when they&#8217;re at 0 hit points. Hit them\n\t\twith Healing Word, and they&#8217;ll get a few more hit points than they usually\n\t\twould. This won&#8217;t be a big mathematical improvement, but it feels nice.\n\t\tSpare the Dying as a Bonus Action is neat, but rarely important since you\n\t\tshould be using Healing Word at that point. Eyes of the Grave is very\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave<\/span>: You\n\t\twant to follow this with the biggest single hit that your party can muster.\n\t\tThis will be much better if you make it to 6 levels and can use it twice per\n\t\trest, and unfortunately it&#8217;s very hard to capitalize on by yourself.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sentinel at Death\u2019s Door<\/span>: Few builds\n\t\twill have enough Wisdom to make this impactful.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"cleric-knowledge\">Knowledge<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Knowledge Domain doesn&#8217;t give you anything which you couldn&#8217;t find\n\telsewhere, and typically other options will have more to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spells, Blessing of Knowledge<\/span>:\n\t\tProficiency and expertise in two knowledge skills.

There may be some builds like Divine Soul Sorcerer which can benefit from Life Domain&#8217;s features, but even then I&#8217;m not sure why you would bother to multiclass instead of just playing a Life Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do go this route, I wouldn&#8217;t go more than one level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spells, Bonus Proficiency, Disciple of Life<\/span>: Heavy armor is great, but Disciple of Life is only a meaningful\n\t\timprovement to healing spells if you cast a lot of them or if you have\n\t\thealing spells which provide repeated healing like Healing Spirit or which\n\t\theal multiple creatures like Mass Healing Word. If your healing options come\n\t\tentirely from a few levels of cleric, Disciple of Life won&#8217;t have a\n\t\tmeaningful impact.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Divinity: Preserve Life<\/span>: While this\n\t\tis a big pile of healing from the Cleric, it scales based on class level, so\n\t\tit&#8217;s not a good option for multiclassed characters.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blessed Healer<\/span>: Similar to Disciple of\n\t\tlife, this is much less useful unless your primary class has abundant\n\t\thealing options to capitalize on the effects.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"cleric-light\">Light<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The only reason to consider the Light Domain is Warding Flare, and aside from\n\tclerics and druids no one has Wisdom high enough to justify it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spells, Bonus Cantrip, Warding Flare<\/span>: Warding Flare is a great defensive option, but the uses are limited and\n\t\tsince you get uses equal to your Wisdom modifier the characters most likely\n\t\tto use this are Wisdom casters. Unfortunately, there are only two Wisdom\n\t\tcasters and clerics are half of them. So: is Warding Flare and access to\n\t\t1st-level cleric spells worth taking a level away from Druid? Maybe. Clerics\n\t\tget a lot of great spells at 1st level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn<\/span>: Too\n\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Flare<\/span>: Fantastic, but not worth 6\n\t\tlevels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"cleric-nature\">Nature<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The primary reason to pursue Nature is to get heavy armor and a druid cantrip\n\tin one level. There are few other reasons to go this route.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Domain Spells, Acolyte of Nature, Bonus Proficiency<\/span>: In a lot of cases, Acolyte of Nature is going to be used to get\n\t\tShillelagh. Turning your Wisdom into your attack stat means that you can\n\t\teasily disregard Strength and focus on Wisdom so that you can be really good\n\t\tat spellcasting and melee attacks at the same time. Combine that with heavy\n\t\tarmor and shields, and one level of Nature Cleric can turn a high-Wisdom\n\t\tcharacter into a martial threat.\n\t\t<p>Unfortunately, there are few classes who can actually benefit from that\n\t\t\tcombination. Druids already get Shillelagh and generally can&#8217;t use heavy\n\t\t\tarmor since it&#8217;s all metal. Monks can&#8217;t wear armor, so they need high\n\t\t\tDexterity anyway so Shillelagh is a waste of a Bonus Action in most cases.\n\t\t\tRangers typically need high Dexterity to support Stealth, so heavy armor\n\t\t\tisn&#8217;t a great choice. The Ranger is probably the best use case for this\n\t\t\tfeature, but if you&#8217;re going to build a heavily-armored,e high-Wisdom\n\t\t\tranger, you&#8217;re essentially building a worse nature cleric. You could\n\t\t\tconsider Shillelagh for Polearm Master builds, but unless you&#8217;re going to\n\t\t\tdepend on Wisdom it doesn&#8217;t add much.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants<\/span>:\n\t\tToo situational. Plant and animal creatures stop appearing around CR 12, and\n\t\teven in the ranges where they exist, charming them doesn&#8217;t give you the\n\t\tability to speak to them.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dampen Elements<\/span>: Spectacular, especially\n\t\tsince there&#8217;s no usage limitation beyond your Reaction, but almost certainly\n\t\tnot worth 6 levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"cleric-order\">Order<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>For a spellcaster taking a 1-level dip into cleric, Order Domain is a\n\tfantastic choice. The Sorcerer&#8217;s Font of Magic feature can be easily abused to\n\tturn your high-level spell slots into 1st-level spell slots to power Voice of\n\tAuthority, allowing you to repeatedly give your party&#8217;s most deadly weapon\n\tuser additional attacks at an alarmingly low resource cost. You also get heavy\n\tarmor, which is really nice on a squishy character like a sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Domain Spells, Bonus Proficiencies, Voice of Authority<\/span>: A truly spectacular level for support casters. Heavy armor is great, and\n\t\tVoice of Authority allows you to give your allies a free weapon attack when\n\t\tyou target them with a spell (though only one ally gets the effect). If\n\t\tyou&#8217;re primarily a spellcaster, you&#8217;ll have enough spell slots to trigger\n\t\tthis repeatedly, and if you have allies who rely on small numbers of big\n\t\tattacks (barbarians, rogues, etc.) an extra attack can provide a massive\n\t\tamount of damage output. Look for inexpensive low-level spells which you can\n\t\tuse on your allies like Healing Word and Heroism. Abusing this ability will\n\t\teat your 1st-level spell slots, so consider some levels in Sorcerer to get\n\t\tFont of Magic so that you can turn higher-level slots into cost-efficient\n\t\t1st-level spell slots.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Order\u2019s Demand<\/span>: If you\n\t\thave sufficient Wisdom to back this up, it can be effective both in and out\n\t\tof combat. However, the duration is only until the end of your next turn so\n\t\tyou need to act quickly to capitalize on it.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Embodiment of the Law<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tbuilt around Wisdom (and very few characters are), you won&#8217;t be able to use\n\t\tthis frequently enough to justify this many levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"cleric-peace\">Peace<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>I recommend banning Peace Domain. We go into detail on why in our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses.html#peace-domain\">Cleric Subclasses Breakdown<\/a>, and I detail both my problems with the subclass and some changes which would make Peace Domain less problematic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do allow Peace Domain, a 1-level dip for Emboldening Bond is the most\n\tpowerful single-class dip in the game. To those of you thinking &#8220;but what\n\tabout Hexblade?&#8221;: Hexblade is one powerful character. Emboldening Bond makes\n\tthe whole party overpowered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Implement of Peace, Emboldening Bond<\/span>:\n\t\tImplement of Peace is one skill. Emboldening Bond is perhaps the single most\n\t\tpowerful 1-level class dip in the game. It progresses based on Proficiency\n\t\tBonus and requires absolutely nothing related to the Cleric (Channel\n\t\tDivinity, Wisdom, spell slots, etc.). It has no usage limitations and a\n\t\t10-minute duration. It stacks with Bless for +2d4 to attacks and saves,\n\t\ttrivializing combat in the vast majority of scenarios. Throw in Guidance for\n\t\tability checks, and basically nothing will ever be hard again.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace<\/span>: Great\n\t\ton a low-level single-class cleric, but for a class dip it may not be\n\t\tespecially impactful. It&#8217;s a great way to spend Channel Divinity if you have\n\t\tnothing else to do with it, and it can be a great way to save dying allies,\n\t\tbut hopefully you can use Healing Word to solve that problem.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protective Bond<\/span>: Use this to distribute\n\t\tdamage among the party &#8220;round robin&#8221; style to ensure that no one takes more\n\t\tdamage than they can handle.

If druids could use metal armor this would be great, but it&#8217;s\n\t\thard to think of other builds which would make this work.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath<\/span>:\n\t\tOther classes including the Bard, the Druid, the Sorcerer, and the Wizard\n\t\tall have access to spells which deal lightning or thunder damage. Storm\n\t\tsorcery sorcerers might find this especially tempting, and if you take\n\t\tMetamagic (Transmuted Spell), you can turn spells into lightning damage and\n\t\tthen maximize their damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderbolt Strike<\/span>: Interesting, but not\n\t\tworth 6 levels. If you&#8217;re really into Destructive Wrath you might want the\n\t\tsecond use of Channel Divinity, but 4 more levels in your primary class will\n\t\talmost certainly be more effective.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"cleric-trickery\">Trickery<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>This would be an interesting option for a rogue or a similarly stealthy\n\tcharacter looking to add some support capabilities and some magical\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blessing of the Trickster<\/span>: A great way\n\t\tto solve the challenge of noisy allies, but if you&#8217;re taking a level of\n\t\tcleric to keep your allies from ruining your Stealth checks you should spend\n\t\tmore time thinking about your tactics rather than spending a level just for\n\t\tthis ability.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity<\/span>: This\n\t\tis a fun, deceptive option but the ability to cast spells through the\n\t\tduplicate is a difficult prospect unless you already have enough\n\t\tspellcasting to make it an interesting option.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows<\/span>:\n\t\tDefinitely not worth 6 levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"cleric-twilight\">Twilight<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>An excellent class dip, and all the good stuff comes in the first two levels.\n\tIf your party likes to fight in the dark or likes ambushing enemies, this is a\n\tgreat option.

Fantastic in a party\n\t\twhich likes to fight at night or underground. Vigilant Blessing is a really\n\t\tfun buff, especially with an assassin rogue or an area control caster in the\n\t\tparty.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary<\/span>: An\n\t\tabsolutely spectacular defensive buff. Even if you never got beyond 2nd\n\t\tlevel, using this twice per short rest is enough to cover roughly two of\n\t\tevery three encounters. The temporary hit points scale with your cleric\n\t\tlevel, but 1d6+2 temporary hit points per round is still a ton of\n\t\tprotection. I recommend some fixes to Twilight Sanctuary (it&#8217;s absurdly\n\t\tpowerful) in our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses.html#twilight-domain\">Cleric Subclasses Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\twhich I still recommend using for multiclass characters.

War Priest is a great\n\toption even if you only have the required 13 Wisdom to multiclass into cleric,\n\tso the extra that you get on top of the proficiencies will still feel\n\tsatisfying even if your Wisdom isn&#8217;t great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Proficiencies, War Priest<\/span>: Martial\n\t\tweapons, heavy armor, and an extra attack a few times per day. If you need\n\t\tthe extra proficiencies, this is probably your best way to get it across any\n\t\tclass. War Priest&#8217;s usage count is Wisdom-based, but if you already have\n\t\tgood uses for your Bonus Action you should think of this as an occasional\n\t\tboost to your damage output rather than a tactical option which you can rely\n\t\tupon constantly. The fact that it&#8217;s just a normal attack means that even if\n\t\tyour Wisdom is awful the attack is still useful so you&#8217;re still getting\n\t\tsomething meaningful out of the ability.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Guided Strike<\/span>: This\n\t\tcan be really great if you only get one high-damage attack each round, but\n\t\twith only one use of Channel Divinity per short rest it&#8217;s not a big\n\t\timprovement to your capabilities.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Divinity: War God&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>:\n\t\tYou&#8217;ll have two uses of Channel Divinity, but you&#8217;re still more likely to\n\t\tsave this for yourself so this isn&#8217;t a big improvement.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"druid\">Druid<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Druids are a difficult choice as a multiclass option.

If it is dependent on character\n\t\tlevel, it&#8217;s a small, but consistent and reliable source of damage output.\n\t\tHowever, it&#8217;s also poison damage (which is commonly resisted) and the\n\t\t10-foot range is dangerous unless you&#8217;re built for melee.\n\t\t<p>Symbiotic Entity is heavily dependent on class level. Your pool of\n\t\t\ttemporary hit points is 4 times your druid class level, and symbiotic\n\t\t\tentity ends when those hit points go away. Unless you&#8217;re using a ranged\n\t\t\tweapon, you&#8217;re in melee drawing attacks and Symbiotic Entity could fall\n\t\t\toff at any point.

The bonuses are\n\t\tWisdom-based so it all works great for the Cleric. Archer for damage output,\n\t\tchalice when you desperately need healing, and dragon when you need to\n\t\tmaintain Concentration. Unfortunately other classes won&#8217;t gain much from\n\t\tthis. Ranges might give Stary Form (Archer) a look, but it doesn&#8217;t work with\n\t\tHunter&#8217;s Mark so your Bonus Action is better spent elsewhere.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Cosmic Omen<\/span>: School of Divination&#8217;s Portent\n\t\tfeature is better, works twice, and only takes 2 levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"druid-land\">Circle of the Land<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Land is great at being a single-class druid focused on\n\tspellcasting.

Fighter subclasses get excellent benefits at\n\t3rd level, too. You can frequently find something fancier from other classes,\n\tbut the Fighter is still an easy option to complement many builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighting Style, Second Wind<\/span>: Fighting\n\t\tStyle and the fighter&#8217;s proficiencies are a great reason to take a level of\n\t\tfighter, but generally you want to make that your first level so that you\n\t\tget heavy armor proficiency. Still, other martial classes which are already\n\t\thappy with their armor proficiencies will enjoy Fighting Style even if they\n\t\talready have one.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Action Surge (1\/rest)<\/span>: The ability to\n\t\ttake a second action and do something like casting a second spell in your\n\t\tfirst turn in combat offers a lot of really great tactical options. But it&#8217;s\n\t\tonly once per rest, and you need to weigh one additional Action one to\n\t\tthree times per day (assuming that you use the Adventuring Day rules) and\n\t\tyou need to weigh the ability to <em>sometimes<\/em> do an extra thing\n\t\tagainst abilities which might let you do something more effective. For\n\t\texample: is access to spells two levels higher better or worse than being\n\t\table to cast an extra spell a few times per day? Sometimes the answer is &#8220;it\n\t\tdepends&#8221; and you&#8217;ll need to figure out that balance.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Martial Archetype<\/span>: Varies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase, Martial Versatility (Optional)<\/span>: Every class gets an Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you\n\t\talready took three levels in the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one\n\t\tmore just to get the ASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Standard for most martial\n\t\tclasses at this level. Fighters eventually get more attacks than anyone\n\t\telse, but that doesn&#8217;t happen until 11th level.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase<\/span>: Fighters get more\n\t\tAbility Score Increases than any other class.

Arcane Shot is\n\t\twhy you&#8217;re here. On a character build arount archery (such as a ranger or\n\t\trogue) Arcane Shot can be tempting. You never get more than 2 uses per Short\n\t\tor Long Rest anyway, and the damage on the shots doesn&#8217;t scale until 18th\n\t\tlevel so all that you&#8217;re giving up is additional options to use your paltry\n\t\t2 shots. Grab Grasping Arrow because it&#8217;s insanely good and maybe Bursting\n\t\tArrow because it&#8217;s good for tightly-packed groups, but avoid everything else\n\t\tunless you have the Intelligence to keep your save DC really high.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"fighter-battle-master\">Battle Master<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you have a martial character and want to do something more exciting than just swinging your weapon, this is a great addition.

Combat Superiority is why people\n\t\tpick the Battle Master. The initial benefits give you 4 dice and 3\n\t\tmaneuvers, giving you some exciting tactical options for any martial\n\t\tcharacter. You can also take the Martial Adept feat to expand this a bit\n\t\twithout additional fighter levels. Keep in mind that while 4 dice can feel\n\t\tlike a lot, they recharge on a Short or Long Rest, so you&#8217;ll need to\n\t\tconserve them between fights rather than burning through them all in one\n\t\tturn.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"fighter-cavalier\">Cavalier<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re here for Unwavering Mark, and you don&#8217;t get to use it enough to\n\tjustify three levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Proficiency, Born to the Saddle, Unwavering Mark<\/span>: Three levels for a skill proficiency, the ability to be slighter better\n\t\tat getting into and out of a saddle, and Unwavering Mark which provides an\n\t\tattack as a Bonus Action with a damage bonus dependent on your class level.\n\t\tThis might be interesting on a paladin that really enjoys Find Steed or on a\n\t\tcharacter with Fighting Style (Protection), but even then it&#8217;s not great.\n\t\tYou don&#8217;t get to use Unwavering Mark enough to make it exciting, and that&#8217;s\n\t\tthe best part of this class dip.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"fighter-champion\">Champion<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Champion is somewhat bland since the improvements it provides are purely\n\tmathematical, but scoring twice as many critical hits can be a huge increase\n\tin your damage output, especially if you have a class feature which adds\n\tadditional effects or damage to critical hits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Critical<\/span>: Critical hits are\n\t\treally nice for martial characters, and since this doesn&#8217;t require the\n\t\tattack to hit normally it also guarantees a hit on a roll of 19 or 20.\n\t\tBarbarians with brutal critical, Paladins with divine smite, rogues with\n\t\tSneak Attack, and warlocks with Eldritch Smite can all benefit immensely\n\t\tfrom more frequent critical hits, and if you can get Advantage on attacks\n\t\tyou have a significant change to score a critical hit on any given\n\t\tattack.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"fighter-echo-knight\">Echo Knight<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Manifest Echo is insanely powerful.

You can&#8217;t wear\n\tarmor or use a shield or you lose many of your monk class features, and that\n\talone mandates a lot about your build.

Unarmored Movement is\n\t\tgreat for a class that&#8217;s as close to melee-only as you can get.\n\t\t<p>Dedicated Weapon probably doesn&#8217;t matter much, but it can open up some\n\t\t\toptions like using a rapier or whip for a Monk\/Rogue.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Monastic Tradition, Deflect Missiles, Ki-Fueled Attack (Optional)<\/span>: The benefits of your Monastic Tradition vary, but Deflect Missiles is\n\t\talmoste never useful unless you face an abundance of humanoid enemies.\n\t\t<p>Ki-Fueled Attack only matters for subclasses which spend their action and\n\t\t\tsome Ki to do something like casting a spell. Multiclass characters may\n\t\t\tnot need to worry about doing that since you&#8217;ll have so little Ki to\n\t\t\tspend.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase, Slow Fall, Quickened Healing (Optional)<\/span>: An Ability Score Increase is always welcome, but Slow Fall almost never\n\t\tmatters and it&#8217;s redundant with Feather Fall.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack, Stunning Strike, Focused Aim (Optional)<\/span>: Extra Attack is great, and Stunning Strike is a spectacular debuff if you\n\t\thave the Wisdom to keep the DC high.\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re using the Optional Class Features, Focused Aim is a powerful\n\t\t\t(though expensive) way to use your Ki to rescue important attacks like\n\t\t\tattacks with leveled spells.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ki-Empowered Strikes, Monastic Tradition Feature<\/span>: If you&#8217;ve come to rely heavily upon your additional attack from Martial\n\t\tArts, treating the attacks as magical means that you can handle foes with\n\t\tresistance to damage from non-magical attacks. Normally that requires a\n\t\tmagic weapon or a spell or something like that.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"monk-mercy\">Way of Mercy<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Too dependent on consuming Ki points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Implements of Mercy, Hand of Healing, Hand of Harm<\/span>: Two skills and two new ways to spend your tiny pool of Ki. The skills\n\t\taren&#8217;t good enough to justify three levels of monk, and you don&#8217;t have\n\t\tenough Ki to make Hand of Healing and Hand of Harm impactful.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Physician&#8217;s Touch<\/span>: This essentially adds\n\t\tLesser Restoration to your Hand of healing and a Poisoned condition to your\n\t\tHand of Harm. If you&#8217;ve made it to level 6 you have enough Ki that these\n\t\tadditions might be meaningful, but if you just want Lesser Restoration you\n\t\tcould have taken cleric levels.\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"monk-shadow\">Way of Shadow<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Way of Shadow is a tempting option for characters built for stealth,\n\tespecially if you don&#8217;t have Darkvision already.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Arts<\/span>: While you don&#8217;t have much Ki\n\t\tto work with, many of the listed spells have long durations so you can get a\n\t\tlot out of your limited pool of Ki.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadow Step<\/span>: Shadows and dim light are\n\t\tabundant almost everywhere except outside during the day, and the fact that\n\t\tyou can use this without a usage limitation means that it can be a go-to\n\t\ttactical option. Rogues will find this especially appealing as an easy way to\n\t\tget Advantage in order to deliver Sneak Attack.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"monk-astral-self\">Way of the Astral Self<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you want to dip into monk to get better at martial stuff, Way of the\n\tAstral Self is the way to do it (even though Way of the Open Hand is the\n\tlow-magic martial monk). Arms of the Astral Self provide a Ki-efficient way to\n\timprove your unarmed combat capabilities which works great for any character\n\twith the Wisdom to take advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Arms of the Astral Self<\/span>: Because the\n\t\tduration on the arms is 10 minutes and you get your Ki back on a Short or\n\t\tLong Rest, you can reasonably afford to use the arms in every fight without\n\t\tprogressing beyond level 3. That makes this a good class dip for characters\n\t\twho can make use of it effectively, but the difficulty is finding a class\n\t\tthat can do so.\n\t\t<p>The most obvious choices are the Cleric and the Druid. Monk is already an\n\t\t\tinteresting class dip for those classes because of the Wisdom synergy, and\n\t\t\tMonk is a popular class dip for Circle of the Moon druids to raise their\n\t\t\tAC while using Wild Shape (see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wildshape.html\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>). Much like a spell, the arms would persist after you activate Wild\n\t\t\tShape, so you could run around as a squirrel with floating magic arms and\n\t\t\tpunch things with them.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You might also be able to make this work for a fighter exploring Fighting\n\t\t\tStyle (Unarmed Fighting). Using Wisdom for your Strength checks makes it\n\t\t\teasy to build around Wisdom and still use grappling to benefit from the\n\t\t\tbonus grapple damage. You could still hang out in heavy armor and a\n\t\t\tshield, too, though you give up on Martial Arts. Of course, at that point\n\t\t\tit may be easier to play a monk and take Fighting Initiate to get Fighting\n\t\t\tStyle (Unarmed Fighting).<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Visage of the Astral Self<\/span>: The bonuses are\n\t\tall neat, but can be replicated by spells. Darkvision will fix a lack of\n\t\tDarkvision, Enhance Ability will cover the skill stuff, and the speech stuff\n\t\tcan be handled with Message and Thaumaturgy. You may be better served by 3\n\t\tlevels of cleric.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"way-of-the-ascendant-dragon\">Way of the Ascendant Dragon<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The features work reasonably well for single-class monks, but depend too heavily on advancing your Martial Arts die and on growing your Ki pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Disciple<\/span>: The reroll on Intimidation\/Persusasion is neat, but you care about Charisma-based skills you&#8217;ll get more from Eloquence Bard.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Breath of the Dragon<\/span>: Too dependent on advancing your Martial Arts die.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Wings Unfurled<\/span>: Too limited. If you want flight, learn to cast Fly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"monk-drunken-master\">Way of the Drunken Master<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Too dependent on Ki to make it viable for a multiclass dip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bonus Proficiencies, Drunken Technique<\/span>:\n\t\tDrunken Technique means never choosing between Flurry of Blows and Disengage\n\t\tagain, but with 3 Ki Points per Short or Long Rest it&#8217;s not a big\n\t\timprovement.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tipsy Sway<\/span>: Both effects are only\n\t\tsituationally useful, but by this level you have 6 ki points per Short or\n\t\tLong Rest so you can actually afford to use Redirect Attack frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"monk-four-elements\">Way of the Four Elements<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Way of the Four elements is all about turning Ki into spells. Multiclass\n\tcharacters don&#8217;t have enough Ki to make that viable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Disciple of the Elements<\/span>: You won&#8217;t have\n\t\tenough Ki to make this good.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Additional Elemental Discipline<\/span>: If you&#8217;ve\n\t\tgone this far you&#8217;ve made a terrible mistake.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"monk-kensei\">Way of the Kensei<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The only reasons I can think of to explore Wai of the Kensei is for either\n\tthe +2 AC from Agile Parry or because you want to get a d10 melee weapon and\n\tattack using Dexterity instead of Strength. But you can get similar functions\n\tfrom other places, and the damage difference between a rapier at 1d8 and a\n\tlongsword in two hands at 1d10 is not worth three levels unless you&#8217;re also\n\tadding Great Weapon Master to the mix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Path of the Kensei (2 weapons)<\/span>: Kensei\n\t\tWeapons allows you to attack with several non-Finesse weapons using\n\t\tDexterity instead of Strength, and use Martial Arts on top of that. You\n\t\tcould use a longsword two-handed to get a d10 damage die, which is the best\n\t\tthat the Monk can get. Unfortunately, Agile Parry requires that you make an\n\t\tunarmed strike as part of the Attack action, so until you get Extra Attack\n\t\tyour weapon is basically just a pointy decoration. Agile Parry is really\n\t\tgood, but the fact that you&#8217;re forced to use the Martial Arts damage of a\n\t\t3rd-level monk to get it means that you&#8217;re giving up the reason you&#8217;re\n\t\tprobably here. If you just want +2 AC, grab a shield. Kensei&#8217;s Shot is also\n\t\there, but the extra d4 damage is meant to make you feel better about giving\n\t\tup the extra Bonus Action attack from Martial Arts\/Flurry of Blows, and\n\t\tthat&#8217;s less important on a multiclass character.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">One with the Blade, Path of the Kensei (3 weapons)<\/span>: By this level you should have ample access to magic weapons either via\n\t\tpermanent magic items or spells like Magic Weapon. Adding a 3rd Kensei\n\t\tWeapon is probably useless.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"monk-long-death\">Way of the Long Death<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you want temporary hit points, there are better options than Touch of\n\tDeath. Hour of Reaping is really good, but it&#8217;s not worth 6 levels on its own\n\tso you&#8217;ll do best if you were primarily here for other monk features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch of Death<\/span>: Neat, but depends on\n\t\tyour class level. It&#8217;s not totally worthless if you go no further into monk,\n\t\tbut I wouldn&#8217;t take 3 levels just to get this.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hour of Reaping<\/span>: An absolutely stellar\n\t\tcrowd control effect if you have the wisdom to back it up. Potentially very\n\t\tuseful for classes with strictly limited resources between rests. But<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"monk-open-hand\">Way of the Open Hand<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Way of the Open Hand is great for single-class monks, but for multiclass\n\tcharacters it&#8217;s just not a good option since you won&#8217;t have the abundance of\n\tKi to make Open Hand Technique a meaningful part of your tactical options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Open Hand Technique<\/span>: While this is a great\n\t\toption for a monk with abundant Ki, multiclassing makes it a difficult\n\t\tprospect.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Wholeness of Body<\/span>: Absolutely not worth 6\n\t\tlevels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"monk-sun-soul\">Way of the Sun Soul<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Sun Soul adds a little bit of the Light Domain Cleric to the Monk. If you\n\twant to be a cleric, go take a level of cleric instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Radiant Sun Bolt<\/span>: Take a level of cleric\n\t\tand learn Sacred Flame.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Searing Arc Strike<\/span>: This already isn&#8217;t a\n\t\tfantastic ability, and the fact that you&#8217;ll have comparably poor Ki just\n\t\tmakes it worse.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"paladin\">Paladin<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Paladin has a lot to offer other Charisma-based classes like the Sorcerer\n\tand the Warlock. The Paladin&#8217;s excellent durability and offensive martial\n\tcapabilities are great, especially with a bigger pool of spell slots behind\n\tit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Sense, Lay on Hands<\/span>: Divine Sense\n\t\tis very situational, and Lay on Hands is heavily dependent on class level.\n\t\tYou can use it to remove diseases\/poisons, but doing so costs an entire\n\t\tclass level worth of points so you&#8217;re not going to do it often. The\n\t\tPaladin&#8217;s initial proficiencies are comparable to the Fighters, but unless\n\t\tyou plan to take a second level of paladin the Fighter is typically a better\n\t\tchoice.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Smite, Fighting Style, Spellcasting<\/span>: Two levels of paladin can turn the Sorcerer and the Warlock into serious\n\t\tmartial threats. Divine Smite with an abundant pool of spell slots behind it\n\t\tis a terrifying pile of damage output, especially if you can score critical\n\t\thits with some frequency. Fighting Style is great on any character,\n\t\tespecially martial ones, and the Paladin&#8217;s spellcasting includes several\n\t\texcellent options even among the 1st-level spells.\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re a Charisma-based spellcaster like a sorcerer or warlock\n\t\t\tmulticlassing into paladin and you&#8217;re using the Optional Class Features,\n\t\t\tconsider Fighting Style (Blessed Warrior) to get some Charisma-based Charisma leric\n\t\t\tspells like Guidance and Word of Radiance.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Divine Health, Sacred Oath<\/span>: Divine\n\t\tHealth is situationally useful. The benefits of your Sacred Oath vary, but\n\t\tsince every oath gets Channel Divinity at this level, you&#8217;re getting a\n\t\tpowerful ability that you can use once per Short or Long Rest.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase<\/span>: Every class gets\n\t\tan Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you already took three levels\n\t\tin the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one more just to get the\n\t\tASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Standard for most martial\n\t\tclasses, and an essential boost to most martial characters&#8217; damage\n\t\toutput.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Protection<\/span>: Possibly the best buff\n\t\tto saving throws in the game. If you have the Charisma to back it up, you&#8217;re\n\t\tsuddenly much more durable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"paladin-conquest\">Oath of Conquest<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>None of this will really define your build, but this is a good set of options\n\tfor a Sorcadin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Conquering Presence and Guided Strike, Oath\n\t\t\tSpells<\/span>: Guided Strike is a great option if you&#8217;re using Great Weapon Master or\n\t\tSharpshooter. Conquering presence is decent crowd control. The new spells\n\t\talso include Armor of Agathys, which is spectacular on front-line martial\n\t\tcharacters.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"paladin-devotion\">Oath of Devotion<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Sacred Weapon is a very tempting option for both Sorcadins and Hexadins.\n\tAdding your Charisma to your attack rolls (especially if you&#8217;re a Hexadin and\n\tyou already do that) is a significant mathematical improvement to your damage\n\toutput.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have feats like Great Weapon Master or Sharpshooter, Sacred Weapon\n\twill offset much of the attack penalty and significantly increase your\n\texpected damage output, allowing you to perform 1-minute surges of incredible\n\tweapon damage output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon and Turn the Unholy, Oath Spells<\/span>: Sacred Weapon is a huge mathematical boost to your attack rolls. Remember\n\t\tthat Advantage is worth roughly +3.25 on attacks, so if you have a +3\n\t\tCharimsa modifier or better you&#8217;re getting roughly the same thing. Plus,\n\t\tunlike Oath of Vengeance&#8217;s Vow of Enmity, the attack bonus applies to\n\t\teverything you attack rather than to a single target. Plus, you can add\n\t\tAdvantage on top of that to make it nearly impossible for you to miss. Turn\n\t\tthe Unholy is fine for handling groups of fiends and undead. However, you\n\t\tneed the Charisma to make it viable so it&#8217;s not as easy for multiclass\n\t\tcharacters to use as Oath of Vengence&#8217;s Vow of Enmity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"paladin-glory\">Oath of Glory<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A solid option for most Strength-based martial builds, especially if you like\n\tto Grapple or Shove.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Peerless Athlete and Inspiring Smite, Oath Spells<\/span>: Heroism is a good buff, especially if you can reliably pass the saves to\n\t\tmaintain Concentration. Peerless Athlete is great for characters that like\n\t\tto Grapple or Shove. Rage is easier if all that you want is occasional help\n\t\twith Strength (Athletics), but Rage is also limited to a number of rages\n\t\tper Long Rest which scales very slowly, while Channel Divinity works twice\n\t\tper Short Rest, so there&#8217;s room to say that this is better. Inspiring Smite\n\t\tis dependent on class level, but the base of 2d8 is very generous already,\n\t\tespecially if you put it all on a single creature.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"paladin-redemption\">Oath of Redemption<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Emissary of Peace is great for face characters, and Rebuke the violent is a\n\tgreat combat option. Overall a good option, but not so great that it will\n\tdefine your build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity: Emissary of Peace and Rebuke the Violent, Oath\n\t\t\tSpells<\/span>: Emissary of Peace provides a significant bonus to Charisma (Persuasion),\n\t\twhich is a rare non-combat use of Channel Divinity. Rebuke the Violent is a\n\t\tgreat way to respond to enemy critical hits. Neither option is\n\t\tlevel-dependent.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"paladin-ancients\">Oath of the Ancients<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you want nature-based crowd control, try some druid levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Nature&#8217;s Wrath and Turn the Faithless, Oath Spells<\/span>: Nature&#8217;s Wrath is a decent single-target crowd control option, and Turn\n\t\tthe Faithless is good for crowds of the affected creature types, but\n\t\tNature&#8217;s Wrath allows repeated saves and Turn the Faithless works on foes\n\t\twhich aren&#8217;t abundant in most campaigns. Between the two abilities you don&#8217;t\n\t\thave an easy go-to option in any given encounter, so you may go long\n\t\tstretches where you get little or nofor benefit from having this ability.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"paladin-crown\">Oath of the Crown<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Nothing new here which couldn&#8217;t be found elsewhere in a better form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Divinity: Champion Challenge and Turn the Tide, Oath Spells<\/span>: Champion Challenge is great, but redundant with Compelled Duel which is\n\t\talready on the Paladin&#8217;s spell list. Turn the Tide is basically Mass Healing\n\t\tWord, but it only affects creatures that hear you and if you want healing\n\t\tlike that you can get better options from the Cleric and the Druid.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"paladin-watchers\">Oath of the Watchers<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Two good Channel Divinity options if you have the Charisma to make them\n\twork.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Channel Divinity<\/span>: Watcher&#8217;s Will is an\n\t\tamazing defensive option for your allies, providing broad protection against\n\t\tmental effects for a brief period. In combat against enemies which use such\n\t\teffects (spellcasters, enemies with charm or fear effects, mind flayers,\n\t\tetc.) these defenses can dramatically change the outcome of an encounter.\n\t\tThe number of creatures affected is equal to your Charisma modifier, so this\n\t\tbenefit works best on Charisma-based characters like bards and sorcerers.\n\t\tAbjure the Extraplanar is an AOE solution to creatures which you can\n\t\ttypically target with Banishment. You&#8217;ll still need to actually kill them,\n\t\tbut causing part of an encounter to run away for a full minute makes it easy\n\t\tto kill whatever doesn&#8217;t flee, then clean up the rest later.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"paladin-vengeance\">Oath of Vengeance<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Vow of Enmity is why you&#8217;re here, and while it&#8217;s great you can get easy\n\tAdvantage from Reckless Attack, and Oath of Devotion&#8217;s Sacred Weapon is more\n\tmathematically effective if you&#8217;re increasing your Charisma. This isn&#8217;t a bad\n\toption, there are just better options with similar effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy and Vow of Enmity<\/span>: Abjure Enemy is hard to use since it&#8217;s easy to resist and many of the\n\t\tbest targets for it will be immune to it since immunity to fear is common\n\t\tamong fiends and undead. But Oath of Enmity is pretty good since you can use\n\t\tit against anything.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"paladin-oathbreaker\">Oathbreaker<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you want to control undead, you&#8217;re probably either a Cleric or a School of\n\tNecromancy Wizard. In either case, you can rely on spells instead of Channel\n\tDivinity both for handling undead and for making enemies Frightened. These are\n\tfine options for the Paladin, but for a multiclass dip they&#8217;re hard to\n\tjustify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Channel Divinity: Control Undead, Dreadful Aspect, Oath Spells<\/span>: The spells aren&#8217;t great for a typical paladin, but they&#8217;re more useful if\n\t\tyou have full spellcasting. Control Undead is nice, but full spellcasters\n\t\tcan typically do the same thing more effectively. Dreadful Aspect is decent\n\t\tcrowd control, but again spellcasters can do the same thing much better.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"ranger\">Ranger<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A single level in the Ranger gets you the same proficiencies as multiclassing\n\tinto the Fighter, plus an additional skill proficiency. But that&#8217;s generally\n\tnot what people multiclass into the Ranger for. Generally if you&#8217;re taking\n\tranger levels you&#8217;re going 2 levels for Fighting Style and Spellcasting or\n\tthree levels for a subclass. However, you can get similar benefits from other\n\tclasses like the Fighter or the Rogue, so the Ranger is rarely a go-to\n\tmulticlass option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Favored Enemy or Favored Foe (Optional), Natural Explorer or Deft\n\t\t\tExplorer(Optional)<\/span>: The Optional Class Features are a huge improvement for the Ranger&#8217;s first\n\t\tlevel. Favored Foe is similar in function to Hunter&#8217;s Mark (though not as\n\t\tgood) and the uses per day scale with Proficiency Bonus. Deft Explorer is\n\t\tExpertise in one skill and two free languages, which helps close the skill\n\t\tgap between the Ranger and the Rogue. If you&#8217;re not using the Optional Class\n\t\tFeatures, don&#8217;t stop at one level in ranger.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighting Style, Spellcasting<\/span>: Fighting\n\t\tStyle is always welcome, but most of the Ranger&#8217;s low-level spellcasting\n\t\tisn&#8217;t great. Hunter&#8217;s Mark is interesting, especially for builds which make\n\t\tnumerous attacks, but there are few other remarkable options.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Primeval Awareness or Primal Awareness(Optional), Ranger Archetype<\/span>: Primeval Awareness is hard to use. The benefits of your ranger archetype\n\t\twill vary.\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re using the Optional Class Features, Primal Awareness isn&#8217;t a big\n\t\t\timprovement over Primeval Awareness because you&#8217;re not going to advance\n\t\t\tfar into the Ranger to benefit from the additional spells.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase, Martial Versatility (Optional)<\/span>: Every class gets an Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you\n\t\talready took three levels in the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one\n\t\tmore just to get the ASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Standard for most martial\n\t\tclasses, and an essential boost to most martial characters&#8217; damage\n\t\toutput.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"ranger-\">Beastmaster<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Beastmaster is already a bad archetype, and your companion&#8217;s hit points\n\tdepend on your class level so multiclassing into Beastmaster is a profoundly\n\tpoor choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger&#8217;s Companion<\/span>: Bad and too dependent\n\t\ton ranger class level.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"ranger-fey-wanderer\">Fey Wanderer<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>An interesting choice for high-Wisdom characters who want to play a Face. Clerics and Druids are the most likely choices, but characters with high scores in both Wisdom and Charisma can achieve truly incredible bonuses with their Face skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Dreadful Strikes, Fey Wanderer Magic, Otherworldly Glamour<\/span>: Dreadful strikes is a small but occasionally effective damage boost, but\n\t\tsince it only applies once per turn per creature, if you have Extra Attack\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll want to spread your attacks around. Otherworldly Glamour is probably\n\t\twhy you&#8217;re here. The extra skill is nice, and adding Wisdom to your Charisma\n\t\tchecks allows a high-Wisdom character to easily function as a Face. The\n\t\tbonus applies to all Charisma checks, so spellcasters like the Bard will also\n\t\tbe able to use the bonus on things like Charisma checks made with\n\t\tCounterspell and Dispel Magic. However, generally characters will care more\n\t\tabout using the bonus with skills. While the bonus is nice, a level of Rogue\n\t\tto get Expertise is much less costly unless you already wanted the benefits\n\t\tof ranger levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"ranger-gloom-stalker\">Gloom Stalker<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Fantastic for any character planning to spend a great deal of time fighting\n\tin the dark or in places where artificial light is necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gloom Stalker Magic, Dread Ambusher, Umbral Sight<\/span>: This is a truly stellar level. Dread Ambusher is great for any martial\n\t\tcharacter, but Umbral Sight is just absolutely incomparable. If your party\n\t\tis fine with working in the dark (warlocks with Devil&#8217;s Sight are your\n\t\tfriend), Umbral Sight is a massive tactical advantage. Even if your party\n\t\tcan&#8217;t manage to fight in darkness, you can still hide just outside of the\n\t\trange of light sources and fight from afar very effectively.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"ranger-horizon-walker\">Horizon Walker<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Nothing that you need to have. Planar Warrior is probably why you&#8217;re here,\n\tbut if you just want extra damage Hunter with Colossus Slayer adds just as\n\tmuch damage without eating your Bonus Action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Horizon Walker Magic, Detect Portal, Planar Warrior (1d8)<\/span>: Detect Portal is very situational. Planar Warrior&#8217;s damage isn&#8217;t much\n\t\tbetter than Hunter&#8217;s Mark, but converting your damage to force damage makes\n\t\tit nearly impossible to resist which may be appealing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"ranger-hunter\">Hunter<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Hunter&#8217;s Prey offers options which work for a variety of builds and in\n\tseveral different scenarios, so it&#8217;s a good option for nearly any martial\n\tcharacter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Hunter&#8217;s Prey<\/span>: Enough options that almost\n\t\tany martial build will benefit, and the effects never scale so you get\n\t\teverything you need at 3rd level.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"ranger-monster-slayer\">Monster Slayer<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Nothing truly stunning here, but it&#8217;s a solid set of options for an ambush\n\tpredator like a ranger\/rogue multiclass build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Monster Slayer Magic, Hunter\u2019s Sense, Slayer\u2019s Prey<\/span>: Hunter&#8217;s Sense is neat, but you&#8217;ll need to sneak up on the creature if\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t want to spend an Action in combat staring at it. Slayer&#8217;s Prey is\n\t\tbasically Hunter&#8217;s Mark for free once per Short Rest, and they stack. If you\n\t\tare very stealthy and very good at sneaking up on enemies, you can give\n\t\tyourself a huge advantage before combat starts.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"ranger-swarmkeeper\">Swarmkeeper<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The benefits aren&#8217;t exactly bad, but I can&#8217;t figure out a way to use them\n\teffectively on anyone except the Ranger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gathered Swarm, Swarmkeeper Magic<\/span>: The\n\t\ton-hit effects from Gathered Swarm are interesting, but it&#8217;s hard to think\n\t\tof a build that will use them consistently. Maybe a monk? Or a fighter with\n\t\thigh Wisdom? Even then, the benefits aren&#8217;t good enough to justify the\n\t\tlevels. The Fighter and the Monk both have subclasses that can produce\n\t\teffects that solve the same problems, so there&#8217;s little incentive to\n\t\tmulticlass to get Gathered Swarm. Swarmkeeper Magic adds Misty Step to the\n\t\tRanger&#8217;s spellcasting, but you need 5 levels to get there and if you want\n\t\tteleportation a full caster will work much better.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"rogue\">Rogue<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Rogue&#8217;s first three levels are fantastic for a number of reasons. Rogues\n\tget more skill\/tool proficiencies at 1st level than any other class, and\n\tExpertise on top of that benefits a wide range of characters. Sneak Attack is\n\tdependent on class level, which makes it hard for multiclass characters, but\n\tno one is going to complain about a few extra d6&#8217;s of damage every turn even\n\tthough it&#8217;s not as much as a single-class rogue might get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expertise, Sneak Attack, Thieves&#8217; Cant<\/span>:\n\t\tEven though multiclassing into rogue only gets you one proficiency, you\n\t\tstill get Expertise in two things. Sneak Attack can be hard since it&#8217;s so\n\t\tdependent on scaling with class level, but even without a ton of Sneak\n\t\tAttack damage a few dice can still be a notable addition to your damage\n\t\toutput. Thieves&#8217; Cant is neat but rarely important.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cunning Action<\/span>: Versatile and reliable,\n\t\tmany other classes can benefit from the tactical options offered by Cunning\n\t\tAction.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Roguish Archetype, Steady Aim (Optional)<\/span>:\n\t\tThe benefits of your subclass vary.\n\t\t<p>If you&#8217;re using the Optional Class Features, Steady Aim is excellent.\n\t\t\tIt&#8217;s intended to solve the issue of ranged rogues attacking when they\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t have a conveniently-positioned ally, but it&#8217;s great for anyone\n\t\t\trelying on a single attack. Spellcasters who like spell attacks (ignoring\n\t\t\tEldritch Blast and Scorching Ray) will find this an easy substitute for\n\t\t\tTrue Strike.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase<\/span>: Every class gets\n\t\tan Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you already took three levels\n\t\tin the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one more just to get the\n\t\tASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Uncanny Dodge<\/span>: Useful on literally any\n\t\tcharacter, this can protect you from ta huge amount of damage over your\n\t\tcharacter&#8217;s career.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Expertise<\/span>: You probably already covered\n\t\tyour favorite proficiencies, but more Expertise is never bad.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"rogue-arcane-trickster\">Arcane Trickster<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If you just want wizard spellcasting, there are much better options\n\telsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Mage Hand Legerdemain, Spellcasting<\/span>: Mage\n\t\tHand Legerdemain is neat, but not very impactful for multiclassing. The\n\t\tspellcasting is basically just worse wizard spellcasting so generally if\n\t\tthat&#8217;s what you want you&#8217;ll do better with a level of Arcana Domain Cleric\n\t\tor Wizard.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"rogue-assassin\">Assassin<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Perfect for any ambush predator build. Pile on things like the Bugbear&#8217;s\n\tSurprise Attack, spells like Hunter&#8217;s Mark, effects like Divine Smite or\n\tEldritch Smite, Brutal Critical. Whatever you&#8217;ve got that makes for big\n\tcritical hits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Proficiencies, Assassinate<\/span>: The\n\t\tadditional proficiencies are nice, but they&#8217;re not why you&#8217;re here.\n\t\tAssassinate is a great tactical option even without a lot of Sneak Attack\n\t\tdamage. If you have additional abilities like the Barbarian&#8217;s Brutal\n\t\tCritical, the Paladin&#8217;s Divine Smite, or the Warlock&#8217;s Eldritch Smite you\n\t\tcan use Assassinate to start damage with a huge pile of damage.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Assassinate&#8217;s easy access to advantage and to possible critical hits (<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/subclasses\/assassin\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"18462\">surprsise is really hard<\/a>) is a huge force multiplier, allowing already high-damage builds to reach <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/bugbear-y-me-in-damage\/\">truly absurd amounts of damage output<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"rogue-inquisitive\">Inquisitive<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Not a great choice for multiclass builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Ear for Deceit, Eye for Detail, Insightful Fighting<\/span>: Ear for Deceit and Eye for Detail are only situationally useful, and\n\t\tInsightful Fighting is only meaningful if you have a lot of Sneak Attack\n\t\tdamage, which you won&#8217;t because you&#8217;re multiclassing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"rogue-mastermind\">Mastermind<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>There are better ways to get all of the benefits of the Mastermind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Master of Intrigue, Master of Tactics<\/span>:\n\t\tMaster of Tactics is neat, but if your party just needs someone to provide\n\t\tthe Help action in combat a familiar will suffice. Master of Intrigue is fun\n\t\tfor a campaign that&#8217;s heavy on roleplaying, but if you just want more tool\n\t\tproficiencies you can get them more easily from your background or from\n\t\tfeats.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"rogue-phantom\">Phantom<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Too dependent on advancing your Sneak Attack damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Whispers of the Dead, Wails From the Grave<\/span>:\n\t\tWhispers of the Dead is one skill or tool, and Wails From the Grave will\n\t\tdeal a miniscule amount of damage.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"rogue-scout\">Scout<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Mechanically interesting for ranged combat builds, and thematically\n\tinteresting for ranger\/rogue multiclass builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Skirmisher, Survivalist<\/span>: Skirmisher is a\n\t\tgood option for ranged combatants of all kinds. Survivalist is Expertise in\n\t\ttwo more skills, which is always welcome even if Survival is only rarely\n\t\tuseful.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"rogue-soulknife\">Soulknife<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A safe, effective choice, but it doesn&#8217;t do anything that&#8217;s going to define\n\tyour character. If you&#8217;re dipping into rogue for the core class features but\n\tdon&#8217;t need a specific subclass, this is a great addition to nearly any\n\tcharacter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Psionic Power<\/span>: Your pool of dice grows\n\t\twith your Proficiency Bonus, so it will grow as you gain levels. The\n\t\tbenefits of both effects are good, if you never improve your die size, and\n\t\tPsi-Bolstered Knack only consumes the die if you succeed so you can roll\n\t\tyour d6 for every applicable ability check without risk of wasting a\n\t\tdie.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"rogue-swashbuckler\">Swashbuckler<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A great option for any melee build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fancy Footwork, Rakish Audacity<\/span>: Fancy\n\t\tFootwork is the ultimate hit-and-run ability, and Rakish Audacity makes\n\t\tSneak Attack an easy option for any melee build, not to mention the bonus to\n\t\tInitiative. This is a great level for any melee build.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-orange\" id=\"rogue-thief\">Thief<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Fast Hands is neat, but it&#8217;s hard to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fast Hands<\/span>: The primary appeal of Fast\n\t\tHands is the ability to use items as a Bonus Action. Unfortunately, the list\n\t\tof items which work with Fast Hands is short so if you go this route you\n\t\tneed to really know what you&#8217;re doing with it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Sorcerer&#8217;s spellcasting offers a lot of great options for multiclass\n\tcharacters. Not only do you get more cantrips than most classes and access to\n\tseveral fantastic 1st-level options, but as you gain level Font of Magic and\n\tMetamagic offer a ton of utility to any spellcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting, Sorcerous Origin<\/span>: Sorcerer\n\t\tspellcasting is fine, and includes a lot of staple defensive options like\n\t\tAbsorb Elements and Shield, both of which are 1st-level spells that work at\n\t\tany character level so if you&#8217;re not going far into Sorcerer you&#8217;ll still\n\t\tget quite a bit from one level of spellcasting. Sorcerers also get more\n\t\tcantrips than most spellcasters, including great multiclass options like\n\t\tGreen-Flame Blade, and they get their subclass at first level so you have a\n\t\tlot of flexibility even with a 1-level class dip.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Font of Magic<\/span>: Font of Magic is great, and\n\t\tit works for any class that depends on casting spells. Font of Magic doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tcare where the spell slots come from, so even if you&#8217;re feeding it Pact\n\t\tMagic spell slots, you can still generate Sorcery Points. However, I haven&#8217;t\n\t\tseen confirmation that you can use Sorcery Points to generate Pact Magic\n\t\tspell slots, so I think that&#8217;s not allowed.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic<\/span>: Metamagic is one of the best\n\t\treasons to multiclass into the Sorcerer. Even warlocks can benefit\n\t\tsignificantly, especially if you use your sorcerer spell slots for nothing\n\t\tbut sorcery points.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase, Sorcerous Versatility (Optional)<\/span>: Every class gets an Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you\n\t\talready took three levels in the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one\n\t\tmore just to get the ASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Magical Guidance (Optional)<\/span>: If you&#8217;re\n\t\tusing the Optional Class Features, Magical Guidance provides an easy reroll\n\t\tmechanic for ability checks. It&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s so good that you\n\t\tshould multiclass to get it, but if you&#8217;re already here it&#8217;s a great way to\n\t\tspend a Sorcery Point.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Sorcerous Origin Feature<\/span>: Varies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"sorcerer-aberrant-mind\">Aberrant Mind<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A great primary class\/subclass, but as a multiclass dip it&#8217;s not\n\timpactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Psionic Spells, Telepathic Speech<\/span>: Psionic\n\t\tSpells is huge for the Sorcerer because it expands your tiny pool of spells\n\t\tknown. The problem you&#8217;ll face is that as a multiclass character your pool\n\t\tof spells known is less of a problem since<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Psionic Sorcery, Psychic Defenses<\/span>: Your\n\t\tSorcery Points won&#8217;t continue to scale because you&#8217;re not staying a\n\t\tsorcerer, so Psionic Sorcery is minimally useful. Psychic Defenses is good,\n\t\tbut if you want those benefits you can get them from your race instead of\n\t\tcommitting six levels to get them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"sorcerer-clockwork-soul\">Clockwork Soul<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Without advancing as a sorcerer, you lose what makes the Clockwork Soul\n\tpowerful.

You can use it to mitigate things\n\t\tlike Reckless Attack, making it a useful support option. But Clockwork Magic\n\t\tisn&#8217;t useful if you&#8217;re not committing to a lot of sorcerer levels, and\n\t\tRestore Balance isn&#8217;t good enough to justify the class dip.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Bastion of Law<\/span>: Eats too many Sorcery\n\t\tPoints.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"sorcerer-divine-soul\">Divine Soul<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Want access to the cleric spell list and the sorcerer spell list at the same time?

Favored of the Gods is just an incredible bonus on top of the already exceptionally good spellcasting benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Divine Magic, Favored by the Gods<\/span>: Divine\n\t\tMagic offers access to the cleric spell list, meaning that you can get\n\t\toptions like Guidance and Booming Blade in the same place. Staple options\n\t\tlike Bless are great additions to the Sorcerer&#8217;s already great spell list.\n\t\tThere are enough good options here that don&#8217;t rely on your spellcasting\n\t\tability that you can easily use up all of your limited spells known without\n\t\ttouching Charisma even once. Favored of the Gods is a great backup option\n\t\tfor import saving throws, and it&#8217;s useful on literally any character.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Empowered Healing<\/span>: Take a level of Life\n\t\tDomain Cleric instead.

Eyes of the Dark allows\n\t\tyou to create an area of darkness which you can see in, but no one else can\n\t\t(short of warlocks with Devil&#8217;s Sight and creatures with similar abilities).\n\t\tIt&#8217;s similar in many ways to Shadow of Moil.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hound of Ill Omen<\/span>: Spectacular for any\n\t\tspellcaster, especially if you like save-or-suck spells.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"sorcerer-storm-sorcery\">Storm Sorcery<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Tempestuous Magic is great for spellcasters afraid to be dragged into melee,\n\tbut that&#8217;s really the only thing of interest here so you won&#8217;t feel bad about\n\tstopping short of 6th level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wind Speaker, Tempestuous Magic<\/span>:\n\t\tTempestuous magic allows you to quickly and safely move out of melee range,\n\t\twhich is tempting for many spellcasters.

But Wild Magic Surge only occurs if you cast a sorcerer spell.\n\t\tConversely, Tides of Chaos allows you to give yourself Advantage at least\n\t\tonce per day whenever you need it, which is hard to pass up. Your DM can\n\t\tthrow a Wild Magic Surge at you any time after that to reset Tides of Chaos,\n\t\tso if you signed up for some extra chaos your DM gets to throw it at you\n\t\twhenever they want.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bend Luck<\/span>: Expensive, but very powerful.\n\t\tUnfortunately you&#8217;ll have a small pool of Sorcery Points so it may be hard\n\t\tto spend the Sorcery Points to power this.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"warlock\">Warlock<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A spectacular class dip for any martial character that can feasibly be built\n\taround Charisma. Pact Magic is difficult to combine with regular Spellcasting,\n\tbut it&#8217;s not impossible to do, and the fact that Pact Magic stops advancing at\n\t10th level makes multiclassing a tantalizing option for warlocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Otherworldly Patron, Pact Magic<\/span>: One\n\t\tWarlock spell slot, even though it recharges on a Short or Long Rest, is not\n\t\tgoing to be impactful. Unless you plan to take more warlock levels, you&#8217;re\n\t\tlikely here for the Otherworldly Patron features.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Invocations (2)<\/span>: There are a\n\t\tnumber of excellent and diverse Eldritch Invocation options so it&#8217;s easy to\n\t\tfind something useful for nearly any character, and if you take more warlock\n\t\tlevels you can retrain your invocations. You also get a second spell slot at\n\t\tthis level, which is great if you&#8217;ve got features like Divinite Smite which\n\t\tyou can use to turn spell slots into bursts of damage.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pact Boon<\/span>: The Pact Boon options have a\n\t\tlot to offer, and you can retrain one of your invocations to take advantage\n\t\tof your choice of Pact Boon. For example: If you took Pact of the Blade, you\n\t\tcould retrain an Invocation into Improved Pact Weapon to get easy access to\n\t\ta magic weapon with a +1 attack\/damage bonus. If you took Pact of the Tome,\n\t\tyou could retrain your 2nd-level invocation to get Book of Ancient Secrets\n\t\tand get some ritual casting without spending a feat.\n\t\t<p>Pact of the Tome has some additional utility for Charisma-based\n\t\t\tspellcasters like the Bard and the Sorcerer. You get access to cantrips\n\t\t\tfrom any class, and since they become Warlock spells they&#8217;re\n\t\t\tCharisma-based. Shillelagh is obsolete due to the Hexblade, but spells\n\t\t\tlike Sacred Flame, Vicious Mockery, and Word of Radiance, are great\n\t\t\toptions for warlocks to borrow.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"4\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Score Increase, Eldritch Versatility (Optional)<\/span>: Every class gets an Ability Score Increase at 4th level, and if you\n\t\talready took three levels in the class it&#8217;s often very tempting to take one\n\t\tmore just to get the ASI.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Eldritch Invocation (1)<\/span>: You already have\n\t\ttwo invocations, and it&#8217;s hard to think of builds where a third will add\n\t\tmuch. You can take something like Thirsting Blade to effectively replace\n\t\tExtra Attack, but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a great option on a multiclass\n\t\tcharacter.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-none\">Otherworldly Patron Feature<\/span>: Varies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"warlock-archfey\">The Archfey<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Archfey is a hard choice for multiclassing.

The short duration\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t help either.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Misty Escape<\/span>: A great way to get out of\n\t\tmelee in a hurry, and it&#8217;s not dependent on class level or Charisma or\n\t\tanything.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"warlock-celestial\">The Celestial<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Other classes offer similar but more effective options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Expanded Spell List, Bonus Cantrips, Healing Light<\/span>: There&#8217;s little reason to consider this over levels in the Cleric or\n\t\tDivine Soul Sorcerer. Healing Light is too dependent on class level, and the\n\t\ttiny number of cleric spells aren&#8217;t meaningful enough to justify this over\n\t\tother subclass options.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Radiant Soul<\/span>: Neat, but not worth 6\n\t\tlevels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"warlock-fathomless\">The Fathomless<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A solid 1-level dip, especially in an aquatic campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Tentacle of the Deeps, Gift of the Sea<\/span>:\n\t\tIf you&#8217;re playing in an aquatic campaign and you&#8217;re dead set on playing\n\t\tanything except an aquatic race, Gift of the Sea is one of the easier ways\n\t\tto solve the issues of breathing and swimming. Regardless of the location of\n\t\tyour campaign, Tentacle of the Deeps is an easy combat summon that works for\n\t\tany character who doesn&#8217;t have a good use for their Bonus Action. The uses\n\t\tper day scale with your Proficiency Bonus, which makes it an easy option for\n\t\ta class dip.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Oceanic Soul, Guardian Coil<\/span>: If you want\n\t\tcold resistance, cast a spell or play a race that gets it. If you want to\n\t\tspeak to creatures with swim speeds, play a triton. Guardian Coul is great,\n\t\tbut not worth six levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"warlock-fiend\">The Fiend<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Fiend&#8217;s features are great, but the spellcasting won&#8217;t add much since\n\tmuch of it is AOE damage that&#8217;s intended to benefit from your increasing spell\n\tslot level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Dark One&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: Dungeons and Dragons\n\t\tis a game that involves a lot of reducing enemies to 0 hit points, so for\n\t\tthe vast majority of characters this offers an easy way to get temporary hit\n\t\tpoints, especially on high-damage characters.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dark One&#8217;s Own Luck<\/span>: d10 is an average\n\t\troll of 5.5, which is a <em>massive<\/em> bonus in 5e. This can easily turn a\n\t\tfailed save into a successful one. But if you&#8217;re here for this, consider\n\t\tlevels in bard instead for Bardic Inspiration.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"warlock-genie\">The Genie<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A great choice if you want core warlock features but don&#8217;t need something\n\tfrom a subclass, the Genie offers more decision points than other warlock\n\tsubclasses so you can easily tailor what you get to your tastes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Genie\u2019s Vessel<\/span>: The Genie&#8217;s Wrath effect\n\t\tof your vessel is a nice damage boost for classes which rely on attacks but\n\t\tdon&#8217;t need something fancy like Hex Warrior. It scales with your Proficiency\n\t\tBonus, so it&#8217;s great for class dips. Rogues who want other warlock stuff\n\t\tlike Devil&#8217;s Sight may find this option appealing.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elemental Gift<\/span>: Permanent damage\n\t\tresistance is nice, and the flight is absolutely fantastic.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-red\" id=\"warlock-great-old-one\">The Great Old One<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Great Old One is primarily about spellcasting, so multiclassing doesn&#8217;t\n\tmake this a good choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Awakened Mind<\/span>: Great for a Face\n\t\tcharacter or for characters hoping to avoid notice while communicating, but\n\t\tI don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good enough to multiclass to get it.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Entropic Ward<\/span>: Great for front-line\n\t\tmartial builds, especially if you benefit a lot from Advantage like rogues\n\t\tdo. But it only works once per Short or Long Rest so it&#8217;s not a tactical\n\t\toption which you can rely on constantly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-blue\" id=\"warlock-hexblade\">The Hexblade<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>So effective that it single-handedly reset the character optimization meta.

Hex Warrior gives you medium\n\t\tarmor, shields, martial weapons, and you can use one weapon to fight with\n\t\tyour Charisma modifier in place of Strength or Dexterity, solving the MAD\n\t\tproblem for bards, paladins, and sorcerers who want to fight with\n\t\tweapons.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-red\">Accursed Specter<\/span>: Nowhere near good enough\n\t\tto even consider 6 levels.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading rating-green\" id=\"warlock-undead\">The Undead<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>An excellent option for a single-level class dip for martial characters, but the Undead needs to compete for space with the Hexblade. Hexblade can solve MAD issues for bards, paladins, and sorcerers looking to be effective with both weapons and spells, and while Form of Dread is good it doesn&#8217;t solve a fundamental challenge built into your class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Characters looking to add Eldritch Blast+Agonizing Blast as an easy offensive option might enjoy the Undead, but again Hexblade may be a more effective option for that build because Hex Warrior adds a damage boost to your attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most likely characters to dip into the Undead are conquest paladins,\n\tnon-charisma-based martial characters like fighters and monks who can make\n\tnumerous attacks to reliably trigger Form of Dread&#8217;s fear effect, and players\n\tsick of multiclassing into hexblade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Form of Dread<\/span>: In its initial form, Form\n\t\tof Dread is a decent combat buff which works for any class, and adds a\n\t\tpowerful and effective status debuff on top of any attacks which a character\n\t\tmight make. This is a great option for martial characters, especially those\n\t\twith numerous attacks (fights, monks) and those who are unusually accurate\n\t\t(Archery fighting style or easy access to Advantage). However, since the\n\t\tsave DC for the fear effect uses your warlock spellcasting DC, low Charisma\n\t\tmay make it unreliable.\n\t\t<p>If you have other features which capitalize on the Frightened condition,\n\t\t\tsuch as the Oath of Conquest Paladin&#8217;s Aura of Conquest, this is a\n\t\t\tfantastically easy way to trigger those features. The number of uses per\n\t\t\tday is tied to your Proficiency Bonus, so a single level in warlock gets\n\t\t\tyou a lot of usage.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Touch of the Grave<\/span>: The damage boost is\n\t\twhat you&#8217;re likely here for, and it&#8217;s not worth this many levels.

While that&#8217;s fine for single-class wizards, it&#8217;s not great for\n\tmulticlassed characters.

That can be useful in some\n\t\tsituations, but it&#8217;s a dangerous gamble if you&#8217;re not built for melee and\n\t\tyou try to use this in combat.

The obvious answers are the Arcane Trickster Rogue, the Battlesmith\n\tArtificer, and the Eldritch Knight Fighter. But those are the exact same\n\tcharacters that line up well for Bladesinging, and Bladesinging tends to get\n\tmore attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are still some standout builds where War Magic shines. Bladesinging only works in light or no armor, and it only works for 1-minute bursts, after which if you&#8217;re not also a good spellcaster you&#8217;re pretty useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, War Magic works as long as you have your Reaction so you can negate attacks and shrug off saving throws all day long. The bonuses won&#8217;t be as big as those from Bladesong once your Intelligence hits +5, but the fact that you can use them constantly may be worthwhile.

Sure, you can&#8217;t\n\t\tcast non-cantrips on your next turn, but for many multiclass characters that\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t matter even slightly.

This section details several examples of multiclass options which appeal to specific classes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already know the class that you want to focus on (your &#8220;primary class&#8221;) but want to explore multiclassing, this section offers several go-to multiclass options for each class which you can pick up without a ton of trouble and without adding a lot of complication to your build.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-artificer\">Artificer Example Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><strong>Fighter (Any) 1 \/ Artificer (Any) X<\/strong>: Starting with a level\n\tin fighter gets you heavy armor without giving up proficiency in Constitution\n\tsaves. For artificer subclasses which don&#8217;t already get heavy armor\n\tproficiency, this can be a significant boost to your AC and can reduce the\n\tneed for Dexterity so that you can focus on other ability scores. However, if\n\tyou don&#8217;t meet the Strength requirement you&#8217;ll face a persistent and annoying\n\tspeed penalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue (Thief) 3 \/ Artificer (Any) X<\/strong>: Do you like items?

On top of Expertise, three levels in rogue (thief) can get you\n\tFast Hands, allowing you to take the Use an Object action as a Bonus\n\tAction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wizard (Bladesinging) 2 \/ Artificer (Battlesmith) X<\/strong>: Bladesong is a fantastic buff for an Intelligence-based character, and the Battlesmith is an Intelligence-based front-line character so the combination is pretty obvious. Between Battle Ready and Bladesong you&#8217;re adding Intelligence to many of your most important stats so you can focus on Intelligence almost exclusively. However, Bladesong limits you to light or no armor, so you&#8217;ll need to invest heavily in Dexterity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-barbarian\">Barbarian Example Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><strong>Fighter (Champion) 3 \/ Barbarian (Any) X<\/strong>: Improved Critical\n\tsynergizes with Brutal Critical very well.

The overlap in\n\tspellcasting ability means that the spells gained from sorcerer levels will\n\tremain effective as you advance.

Access to medium armor and shields removes the need to pursue College of Valor, and cantrips like Booming Blade will close the damage gap between single attacks and Extra Attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get 14 Dexterity, a suit of half plate, and a shield and you&#8217;ll have 19 AC and you can focus on your Charisma and improve both your martial capabilities and your spellcasting at the same time. A second Warlock Level gets you invocations, and a third can get you both Pact of the Blade and Improved Pact Weapon. However, that second or third level means trading some spellcasting for more martial capabilities, so you need to decide what balance you want to strike with your character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wizard (School of Divination or Chronurgy Magic) 2 \/ Bard (College of Eloquence) X<\/strong>: Seize control of the outcome of rolls!

It also gets you heavy armor if your domain doesn&#8217;t provide it and a Fighting Style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two levels gets you Action Surge, allowing you to do things like casting two spells in the same turn without running into the limitation on Bonus Action spells. Action Surge only works once per Short or Long Rest, but it&#8217;s still noteworthy. You might go to three levels for a subclass, but that&#8217;s uncommon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monk (Any) 1 \/ Cleric (Any) X<\/strong>: Unarmored Defense and Martial Arts are interesting options for clerics that don&#8217;t get heavy armor proficiency. Grab a monk weapon and focus on Dexterity and Wisdom, and many domains which offer a version of Divine Strike can be considerably more effective in melee. The second attack from Martial Arts will be redundant for War Domain, but other domains like Grave Domain or Light Domain gain a reliable way to make more than one weapon attack per turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unarmored Defense also allows you to hit 20 AC (though this requires quite a few Ability Score Increases) without using armor or a shield, which means that you can keep a hand free to perform spellcasting components without rely on War Caster or juggling your weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paladin (Any) 2, 5, or 6 \/ Cleric (Any) X<\/strong>: Two levels of paladin offers Divine Smite, which combined with the cleric&#8217;s better spell progression (and therefore larger pool of spell slots) offers more smites and generally better martial options for the Cleric. You won&#8217;t get proficiency with Constitution saves like you would with a Fighter class dip, but If you can manage 6 levels Aura of Protection can help compensate or you can take Resilient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this build can be very MAD since paladins are already MAD and you&#8217;re adding a Wisdom requirement. Most likely, you&#8217;ll have better results attempting the same build with a Divine Soul Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue (Any) 1, 2, or 3 \/ Cleric (Trickery) X<\/strong>: The Trickery cleric makes sense in a stealthy party, but lacks the core proficiencies brought by a rogue, and doesn&#8217;t have access to finesse weapons better than a dagger. If you want to replace a rogue with a trickery cleric, starting with a level of rogue gets you all of the rogue&#8217;s proficiencies and a splash of Sneak Attack damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two levels gets you Cunning Action so you&#8217;ve always got a good use for your Bonus Action without pouring spell slots into Spiritual Weapon, and three levels gets you a bit more Sneak Attack and a subclass. Personally I would go for Arcane Trickster for the spellcasting or Mastermind for Master of Tactics to complement the cleric&#8217;s support capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full Example Builds:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/tetragrammaton-cleric-build-guide\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14387\">Tetragrammaton Cleric Build Guide<\/a> &#8211; Cleric\/Fighter\/Ranger.

Reckless Attack does, too, but it&#8217;s a big gamble since Wild Shape provides such a small pool of hit points before you&#8217;re knocked out of Wild Shape. And, while Unarmored Defense does work in Wild Shape it doesn&#8217;t necessarily work very well. We go into the math in our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wildshape.html#unarmored-defense\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monk (Any) 1, 2, or 3 \/ Druid (Circle of the Moon) X<\/strong>: Martial Arts works while using Wild Shape, as does the Monk&#8217;s Unarmored Defense. So long as your Wisdom is sufficiently high, you can improve the AC of many forms, though not all of them. We go into the math in our <a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wildshape.html#unarmored-defense\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>. And, while Martial Arts does work in Wild Shape you need to take the Attack action and make an attack an &#8220;unarmed strike&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Animals&#8217; natural weapon attacks are not unarmed strikes, so they don&#8217;t count. That means that you may be punching and kicking in favor of biting and clawing. 2 levels get you Ki and Unarmored Movement, both of which work in Wild Shape (and Unarmored Movements applies to your new form&#8217;s movement speeds). 3 levels gets you a subclass, but by this point you&#8217;re setting yourself really far behind on Wild Shape so the drawbacks are arguably offsetting the benefits of the class dip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monk (Any) 1 \/ Druid (Circle of Spores) X<\/strong>: I know, two monk\/druid builds seems redundant, but this is a really great combo that I can&#8217;t ignore. Circle of Spores is difficult to optimize and it has a bunch of mechanical challenges. Druids have terrible AC and bad martial options, and while Symbiotic Entity helps compensate for both there&#8217;s a ton of room for improvement. Unarmored Defense is a great option for the Circle of Spores Druid. Max out Dexterity and Wisdom and you can hit 20 AC without spells or a shield (though that will obviously take a while). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ou can use Dexterity to fight with either a spear or a staff, removing the need for Shillelagh which is typically difficult for spores druids to forgo. Martial Arts offers an additional attack, allowing you to apply your bonus poison damage more frequently on top of the extra damage output from making twice as many attacks as a druid normally can. You don&#8217;t need to go further into the Monk than level 1, which makes this an exceptionally powerful class dip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-122\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-fighter\">Fighter Example Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><strong>Barbarian (Any) 1, 2, or 3 \/ Fighter (Any) X<\/strong>: Rage is a really tempting buff, but it only works if you&#8217;re not in heavy armor. Unarmored Defense is similarly great, but maxing out the AC requires a ton of Ability Score Increases. The Fighter gets more Ability Score Increases than any other class, which presents an opportunity to get your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution all up to 20 for an AC of 20 totally naked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you start with 16 Strength, 14 Dexterity, and 16 Constitution you can hit 20 in each if you take only one level of barbarian then go straight fighter after that. But more likely you&#8217;re exploring barbarian for more than just the ability to fight unarmored, in which case options like Reckless Attack are extremely appealing for fighters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue (Any) 2 \/ Fighter (Any) X<\/strong>: 2 levels of rogue gets you\n\ta lot of skills and Cunning Action, which provides a powerful usage for your\n\tBonus Action on a class with very few built-in Bonus Action options. This\n\tcombines well with the Polearm Master+Sentinel combo because if enemies manage\n\tto get adjacent to you you can use Cunning Action to Withdraw safely then\n\tforce your enemies to charge into your reach again to get close enough to\n\tattack you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ranger 2 \/ Paladin 2 \/ Fighter (Champion) 10+<\/strong>: Do you like Fighting Style?

De-emphasizing Wisdom means that you can instead focus on Constitution, thereby raising the Monk&#8217;s relatively poor hit points compared to more durable from-lint martial classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two levels gets you Reckless Attack, which is a hard gamble for the Monk with d8 hit dice and low AC (until you gain enough ability score increases to raise it), but Advantage on 3-4 attacks (Extra Attack and Flurry of Blows) can yield a lot of damage output if you use it as an occasional damage boost rather than running Reckless Attack constantly like many barbarians do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue (Any) 1 \/ Monk (Any) X<\/strong>: Starting with a level in rogue\n\tadds a bunch of additional skills to the Monk. Monks are typically somewhere\n\tbetween a fighter-equivalent and rogue-equivalent, but since they don&#8217;t have\n\tthe durability to replace a fighter they&#8217;re typically filling the space\n\tnormally filled by a rogue. Starting with a level in rogue offers better\n\tskills and expertise, and if you want to enjoy the 1d6 of Sneak Attack damage\n\tyou can use a dagger or a short sword.

On top of the extra spell slots, sorcerers get access to great spells like Booming Blade which can be powerful assets for martial characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two levels gets you Font of Magic, which allows you to convert your spell slots into Sorcery Points and back, and it&#8217;s a common tactic to turn your spell slots into a pile of 1st-level slots because 1st-level slots have the best conversion rate from spell slot to Divine Smite damage dice. Personally I like a Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer with a Dexterity-based build; you can still hit 20 AC thanks to Draconic Resilience and there&#8217;s no additional tracking beyond the spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Warlock (Hexblade) 1, 2, or 3 \/ Paladin (Any) X<\/strong>: Warlock\/Paladin builds have been popular since 5e&#8217;s release. The promise of recharging spell slots on a Short Rest in conjunction with Divine Smite is hard to pass up. This combination was affectionately nicknamed the &#8220;Lockadin&#8221;, but gave way immediately to the &#8220;Hexadin&#8221; the moment that Hexblades were published.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to use Charisma for attack and damage with weapons made the Paladin considerably less MAD, so they could emphasize both their martial capabilities and their magical abilities by increasing the same ability score. If you go this route, there are good break points at levels 1, 2, and 3. Level 2 gets a second spell slot and an invocation, and level 3 gets you 2nd-level spells for bigger smites and you get Pact Boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Barbarian (Any) 1, 2, or 3 \/ Paladin (Any) X<\/strong>: Rage won&#8217;t work in heavy armor, so if you want Rage you&#8217;ll need to manage medium armor which will make the Paladin even more MAD than they already are.

Grab Shillelagh and\n\tyou can build a high-Wisdom ranger and still work great in melee. Of course,\n\tyou&#8217;ll need to give up metal armor so you&#8217;ll still need high Dexterity, and\n\tyou can get access to the spells you want by taking Magic Initiate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fighter (Any) 1 \/ Ranger (Any) X<\/strong>: If you want to build a Strength-based ranger, this is the way to do it. Starting with the Fighter gets you heavy armor, a Fighting Style, and proficiency in Constitution saves so that you can maintain Concentration more easily with spells like Hunter&#8217;s Mark and Guardian of Nature. This one-level class dip shifts the Ranger from a Rogue-equivalent to a high-damage Fighter-equivalent, allowing you to easily stand on the front lines to protect your allies. Since you get two Fighting Styles, consider making your second either Defense for the AC or Protection to keep your allies safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue (Any) 1, 2, or 3 \/ Ranger (Any) X<\/strong>: Rogue dips have been a favorite for rangers since at least 3rd edition. While rangers attempt to walk a line between the Druid, the Fighter, and Rogue, they&#8217;re typically filling the role in a party typically covered by the Rogue. Rogues get better skill\/tool proficiencies at first level, not to mention Expertise, so starting with a single level offers a great deal of extra non-combat options. You give up medium armor, but most rangers stick to light armor anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two levels gets you Cunning Action, which is great but may conflict with the Ranger&#8217;s spellcasting or with two-weapon fighting. Three levels gets you a subclass, but none of them offer anything that adds a lot to the ranger.

It&#8217;s high-risk, but fortunately you&#8217;ll get Uncanny Dodge to help reduce some of the damage you would take. It&#8217;s also easy to overlook Unarmored Defense for the Rogue, but it&#8217;s a surprisingly great option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rogues normally max out at 17 AC (short of spells and magic items) because light armor maxes out at 12+Dex. You can hit 12+Dex AC with the Barbarian&#8217;s Unarmored Defense and 14 Constitution, which is easily achievable as early as first level. Rogues also get an extra Ability Score Increase, so hitting 20 Dexterity and 20 Constitution is not only possible, it&#8217;s easy and it&#8217;s probably a good idea. That gets you 20 AC totally unequipped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue (Any) 6 \/ Bard (College of Eloquence) 10 \/ ?<\/strong>: As much\n\tExpertise as possible! you get Expertise in 4 things from Rogue, and 4 things\n\tfrom Bard, and College of Eloquence lets you treat rolls of 9 or below on\n\tCharisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) as a 10, similar to the Rogue&#8217;s\n\tReliable Talent feature, but we can&#8217;t get Reliable Talent without giving up\n\tthe Bard&#8217;s second round of Expertise of 10th level. Unfortunately, you may\n\tstruggle with anything except skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rogue (Any) 1 \/ Bard (Any) 2 \/ Rogue X<\/strong>: A more realistic version of the above build, you give up just 2 levels of rogue for an extra skill proficiency, Expertise in two more things, and the magnificent Jack of All Trades. You don&#8217;t get to say &#8220;I have Expertise in 8 things&#8221;, but you&#8217;re actually a decent rogue which is probably more important. You&#8217;ll want a bit of Charisma to fuel your limited spellcasting and Bardic Inspiration, but don&#8217;t go crazy since your rogue levels are doing most of the work here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full Example Builds:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/hexbuckler\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14124\">Hexbuckler of the Astral Seas<\/a>: Rogue\/Warlock.

Three levels gets you a subclass, which offers several interesting options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally I recommend the Eldritch Knight. You get a few more cantrips and some additional known spells, which is a big addition since the Sorcerer knows so few. However, since the spellcasting from Eldritch Knight is Intelligence-based, stick to spells which don&#8217;t require spell attacks or saving throws, like Booming Blade, Absorb Elements, Shield, and other defensive or utility options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paladin (Any) 2, 5, or 6 \/ Sorcerer (Any) X<\/strong>: The &#8220;Sorcadin&#8221; build isn&#8217;t always primarily a paladin. Just as the Sorcerer offers the Paladin additional spellcasting, the Paladin offers the Sorcerer extra durability. If you want to be better with weapons, you might go all the way to 5th level in paladin for Extra Attack, or you might go to 6 for Aura of Protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that&#8217;s a lot of spellcasting to give up, and sorcerers get proficiency in Constitution saves so it&#8217;s hard to give that up for heavy armor. The big gain here is Divine Smite which can pile on top of Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade for big melee hits at a low spell slot cost. If you just want heavy armor, consider the Fighter Instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Warlock 2 or 3 \/ Sorcerer<\/strong>: Font of Magic doesn&#8217;t care that warlock spell slots come from Pact Magic rather than from Spellcasting, and Eldritch Blast with Agonizing Blast is a powerful offensive option. 2 levels gets you Agonizing Blast and 2 spell slots, and three levels gets those spell slots up to level 2 so that they&#8217;re worth more Sorcery Points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-warlock\">Warlock Example Builds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><strong>Sorcerer (Any) 3 \/ Warlock (Any) X<\/strong>: Quicken Spell is really\n\ttempting with Eldritch Blast. Casting it twice in a single turn is a huge pile\n\tof damage, especially if you already have Hex and\/or Hexblade&#8217;s Curse\n\trunning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fighter (Any) 1 \/ Warlock (Any) X<\/strong>: Starting with a level of fighter gets you heavy armor and proficiency in Constitution saving throws, which are crucial for maintaining Concentration. This is probably most effective for the Hexblade, but it&#8217;s a tempting option for any warlock. The addition of Fighting Style is also very helpful regardless of your choice of weaponry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full Example Builds:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/hexadin\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"16436\">Hexadin: Suffer Not the Witch-Knight to Live<\/a>: Hexblade\/paladin &#8220;hexadin&#8221; multiclass build.

That&#8217;s a big increase in durability for any wizard. Bladesingers have\n\tespecially good synergy with the Battlesmith, and the combination works so\n\twell that you can favor either side of the class split and still be very\n\teffective depending on whether you want more spellcasting or more Infused\n\tItems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fighter (Any) 1 or 2 \/ Wizard (Any) X<\/strong>: Similar to the\n\tArtificer, the Fighter offers heavy armor and shields. However, the better\n\tarmor and Fighting Style come at the cost of a level of spellcasting so\n\tthere&#8217;s some cost\/benefit analysis to be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sorcerer (Any) 3 \/ Wizard (Any) X<\/strong>: All the versatility of\n\tMetamagic combined with the versatility of the Wizard&#8217;s spellbook.

If\n\tyou dump Charisma (and you probably should) you can still use your sorcerer\n\tspellcasting for utility spells and staple defensive options like Absorb\n\tElements and Shield which remain effective at every level but normally present\n\ta tax on your limited number of prepared spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full Example Builds:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/super-mario-jump-attack-build-guide\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"28844\">Super Mario Jump Attack Build Guide<\/a>: Barbarian\/Monk\/Wizard combine to turn jumping on enemies heads into a dubiously lethal attack action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Multiclassing is a powerful tool for character optimization. While individual classes work well on their own, sometimes exploring multiple classes can add some powerful new options to a character while also allowing you to explore interesting story ideas. However, multiclassing is also complicated. Building a character already involves a large number of complicated decisions, and adding multiclassing to the mix can make the process intimidating, especially for new players. This article is written with two purposes: first, to explain multiclassing in terms that are clearer and more specific than those in the Player&#8217;s Handbook; and second, to provide guidance
