These are typically intended to force enemies away from you, potentially breaking grapples or otherwise just forcing enemies out of melee. Nothing stops these effects from stacking, and that probably already tells you what this article is about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written previously in a few example builds about 5e&#8217;s refusal to use the phrase &#8220;directly away&#8221; when giving players the ability to push enemies away. &#8220;Away&#8221; simply requires that enemies end the movement further from you than when they started, but otherwise doesn&#8217;t indicate direction. This allows you to move enemies away from you at an angle, including upward, allowing you to drop them for free damage and to automatically knock them prone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>However, some features specify &#8220;horizontally away&#8221; instead of just &#8220;away&#8221;. While this is closer to the original intent of the rules text, it does create hilarious situations like hitting an enemy which is in the air above you and forcibly moving it several squares sideways. But that still lets us move enemies, so those options are going into the metaphorical soup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>In this article we&#8217;re going to see exactly how far away we can move a creature in one hit.

Very restrictive, but 10 feet of pushing is pretty good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crusher<\/span><sup>TCoE<\/sup>: 5 ft. of movement when we deal bludgeoning damage. This obviously works with weapons like war hammers, but it also works with unarmed strikes and with magical sources of bludgeoning damage like Magic Stone, or the Dao Genie Warlock&#8217;s bonus bludgeoning damage, or spells like Erupting Earth.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gift of the Chromatic Dragon<\/span><sup>FToD<\/sup>: The ability to add elemental damage to a weapon once per day works with the Tempest Cleric&#8217;s Thunderbolt Strike, but it&#8217;s still only once per day.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Martial Adept<\/span><sup>PHB<\/sup>: Push an enemy 15 feet with Pushing Attack. We&#8217;ll only get to use it once per Short or Long Rest, but for the purposes of this article we only need it to work once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes-and-subclasses\">Classes and Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>All that we want is a way to move enemies away from us. That&#8217;s all. Low-level options are preferred because it makes multiclassing easier, but we have 20 levels to work with, so I&#8217;m not super picky.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"artificer-artillerist\">Artificer (Artillerist)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We get two potential options from the Artificer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Level 2: Infusion (Repulsion Shield): When we&#8217;re hit we can push an enemy 15 feet away as a Reaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Level 3: Artillerist&#8217;s Force Ballista: On hit, the target is pushed 5 feet away from the ballista.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric-tempest\">Cleric (Tempest)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At level 6 the Tempest Cleric gains the Thunderbolt Strike feature. This allows you to push a creature 10 feet away from you when you deal lightning damage to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any build capitalizing on this feature will need to include lightning damage. Fortunately, clerics can cast Spirit Shroud to deal lightning damage on any attack against an enemy within 10 feet.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fighter-arcane-archer\">Fighter (Arcane Archer)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Forceful Shot lets us push an enemy 15 feet away from us if they fail a Strength save. It also doesn&#8217;t have a size cap, which is interesting. However, it only works when fired from a bow, which limits our combo options.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fighter-battle-master\">Fighter (Battle Master)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Pushing Attack lets us push an enemy 15 feet away from us if they fail a Strength save. We can also get this from the Martial Adept feat, but if we can afford the levels we&#8217;ll have considerably more dice to spend.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-way-of-four-elements\">Monk (Way of Four Elements)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fist of Unbroken Air lets us push a creature up to 20 feet away from us on a failed Strength save. However, it&#8217;s an Action to use, so we&#8217;ll have very few combo options.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-way-of-the-open-hand\">Monk (Way of the Open Hand)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Open Hand Technique allows us to push an enemy 15 feet away if we hit them with an attack from Flurry of Blows and then the target failed a Strength save. This is great, but gating it behind Flurry of Blows and limiting it to unarmed strikes gives us few combo options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We combine Open Hand Technique with the Crusher feat in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/subclasses\/open-hand\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"13825\">Way of the Open Hand Monk Handbook<\/a> in order to launch enemies 20 feet. It feels good, and it&#8217;s a fun predecessor to this article.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-swarmkeeper\">Ranger (Swarmkeeper)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Gathered Swarm allows us to move a creature 15 feet horizontally if they fail a Strength save on hit. Note that this limits us to horizontal movement. Not a problem for the purposes of this article, but important to remember if you have ambitions about falling damage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sorcerer-storm-sorcery\">Sorcerer (Storm Sorcery)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The 14th-level feature Storm&#8217;s Fury lets you push an enemy 20 feet away as a Reaction, provided that they fail a Strength save. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a very high-level feature and eats your Reaction.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warlock-genie\">Warlock (Genie)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The genielock offers three options for moving enemies. Unfortunately, they&#8217;re difficult to combine with other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Genie&#8217;s Wrath (Dao): Add +PB bludgeoning damage to one attack per turn, allowing you to trigger Crusher.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rebuke of the Talisman: When the wearer of your Talisman is hit by an attack, you can use your Reaction to push the attacker 10 feet away. Since it eats your Reaction, you can&#8217;t use it in conjunction with Repulsion Shield.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repelling Blast: A popular option for warlocks, Repelling Blast pushes your target 10 feet away and applies to all of your Eldritch Blast attacks. With as many as 4 attacks per casting, that&#8217;s a lot of pushing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wizard-graviturgy-magic\">Wizard (Graviturgy Magic)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The 6th-level feature Gravity Well allows you to move a creature 5 feet if the target is willing to move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wizard-order-of-scribes\">Wizard (Order of Scribes)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The ability to change damage types with spells potentially means switching spells to a damage type which triggers Crusher or Thunderbolt Strike.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Battering Shield<\/span><sup>EGtW<\/sup> (Rare): When you push a creature within your reach at least 5 feet away, you can spend 1 of the shield&#8217;s 3 charges to push it an additional 10 feet, knock it prone, or both. Note that, RAW, it specifically requires that you &#8220;push&#8221; the target, not &#8220;Shove&#8221; or &#8220;move&#8221;. Crusher would not apply, but effects like Pushing Attack would.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-\">Ring of the Ram<\/span><sup>DMG<\/sup> (Rare): Spend 1 or more of the ring&#8217;s charges to make a spell attack, dealing force damage and pushing your target 5 feet per charge on a hit. Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t make it deal bludgeoning or lightning damage, which limits our combo options severely.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; Home Run Contest World Champion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Look at our options above, we have several melee options that we can combine if we can deal both bludgeoning damage and lightning damage at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cleric (Tempest) 6 &#8211; Thunderbolt Strike: 10 feet away when dealing lightning damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fighter (Battle Master) 3 &#8211; Pushing Strike: 10 feet away on a failed Strength save with a Strength-based DC.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ranger (Swarmkeeper) 3 &#8211; Gathered Swarm: 15 feet away horizontally on a failed Strength save with a Wisdom-based DC.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Charger: Move target 10 feet away if we hit with an attack after we Dash and move 10 feet straight toward them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crusher: Move target 5 feet once per turn when you deal bludgeoning damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spirit Shroud: 3rd-level cleric spell. Add +1d8 damage of one type (we can pick lightning) to attacks against enemies within 10 feet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Battering Shield: Spend 1 charge to add +10 feet to the push distance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s 60 feet away in total, but we need to jump through some hoops to make it happen. We need Spirit Shroud running, which requires a Bonus Action and only lasts 1 minute. Then we need to Dash and hit our target with a melee attack which deals bludgeoning damage. That would normally take 2 turns, but we have Action Surge! The build takes a minimum of 12 levels and a rare magic item to accumulate all of the effects, and requires our target to fail two Strength saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of that 60 feet, just 15 needs to be horizontally away, allowing us to launch our target as much as 45 feet high, dropping them for 4d6 damage and automatically knocking them prone and putting them far enough away that they&#8217;ll need to Dash to get back into melee. That&#8217;s pretty great, especially if we can drop them on another enemy to knock both of them prone.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We need Strength and Wisdom for attacks and save DCs and we need multiple feats while multiclassing, so there&#8217;s little room for error here. Go 15\/15\/15\/8\/8\/8. Since we&#8217;re going for Custom Origin, we&#8217;ll put our racial +2 into Strength, then the +1 from Crusher into Strength to start with 18 Strength. At low levels we&#8217;re still just a Fighter, so this works fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Increased<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Custom Origin.
