They\u2019re just better at everything Clerics do than most other clerics. Prior to Tasha\u2019s, you had Clerics that were better than baseline at healing or preventing damage, Clerics that could wear heavy armor, and a few that were both. The primary one of these was, of course, the Life domain Cleric, a subclass that\u2019s so boring that its subclass capstone is barely usable because combat healing is a terribly inefficient proposition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Then we got the Twilight Cleric. It could do both of those, fly, give someone advantage on initiative checks literally forever, and it has one of the best expanded spell lists in the game. Every subclass ability is rated blue except for Divine Strikes which, even if your DM doesn\u2019t let you replace it with Blessed Strikes, is still green because you also get Martial Weapon Proficiency for free and can walk out with a warhammer and a shield and pretend you\u2019re a Paladin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, I\u2019m currently playing a Twilight Cleric in an Out of The Abyss campaign and it feels like cheating. Every feature is easy to use, there is only one combat trick, and you and your party are both very durable. This hasn\u2019t stopped two of my party members from turning into statues anyway, but at least that wasn\u2019t my fault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Twilight Domain Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#twilight-domain-ability-scores\">Twilight Domain Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#twilight-domain-races\">Twilight Domain Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#twilight-domain-feats\">Twilight Domain Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#twilight-domain-weapons\">Twilight Domain Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#twilight-domain-armor\">Twilight Domain Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-i-protect-my-friends-with-magic\">Example Build &#8211; I protect my friends with magic<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Sleep will stop\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing reliably useful after low levels, but Faerie Fire never stops\n\t\t\t\t\tworking.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: See Invisibility is\n\t\t\t\t\tanother excellent counter to invisibility, and having Faerie Fire\n\t\t\t\t\thandy allows you to easily spot invisible foes then reveal them to your\n\t\t\t\t\tparty without needing to have See Invisibility running on everyone.\n\t\t\t\t\tMoonbeam is a great combat option for the narrow window of levels 3\n\t\t\t\t\tand 4 before your cantrip damage increases and Sacred Flame will be\n\t\t\t\t\talmost as effective as a 2nd-level spell which requires Concentration.\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter that, you&#8217;ll never use it unless you meet a shapeshifter.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: \nEnormous quantities of slow healing balanced around being cast by a high-level Paladin,\n\t\t\t\t\tand a magical place to rest which doubles as a go-to option when\n\t\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re out in the open and need cover.\nAt medium levels, a single Aura of Vitality can effectively replace all the healing a party would get out of a short rest without feeling like a huge resource cost. If you\u2019re a group that doesn\u2019t have any other short rest-recharge resources, spending a minute walking and getting back up to full HP lets you easily roll over the\n<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/campaign_planning\/\">expected pacing<\/a>\nand become epic all the quicker.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: Aura of Life is\n\t\t\t\t\tgenerally only useful against certain types of undead like shadows,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut Greater Invisibility is one of the best buffs in the game.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-green\">9th Level<\/span>: Circle of Power is\n\t\t\t\t\tnormally a Paladin exclusive, and you get it long before the Paladin\n\t\t\t\t\tdoes. Mislead is neat, but very situational.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Proficiencies<\/span>: Perfect for a\n\t\t\tfront-line cleric.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eyes of Night<\/span>: Darkvision is great if\n\t\t\tyou don&#8217;t already have it, and the absolutely absurd 300 ft. range is\n\t\t\tunprecedented. 120 ft. would be <span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>. On\n\t\t\ttop of that, you can share it with your allies for an hour at a time and\n\t\t\tyou can refresh the ability by spending a spell slot of any level.\n\t\t\tConsidering that the Darkvision spell is 2nd-level, that&#8217;s phenomenal.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vigilant Blessing<\/span>: But wait, there&#8217;s\n\t\t\tmore! On top of the other amazing stuff that Twilight Domain gets at first\n\t\t\tlevel, you can give someone Advantage on their next Initiative roll. I\n\t\t\trecommend an Assassin Rogue if one is in your party, otherwise, go for one\n\t\t\tof the primary battlefield controller in your party even if that means you. The effect lasts\n\t\t\tuntil it expires, so you want to get this set up again the moment that\n\t\t\tcombat ends so that you&#8217;re never not benefiting from this.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary<\/span>: If\n\t\t\tthis were a fire-and-forget effect that granted temporary hit points or\n\t\t\tremoved charm\/fear once, I would rate it\n\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">blue<\/span>\n\t\t\tbecause the pool of temporary hit points is enormous. Instead, it\n\t\t\trefreshes every round for a minute. Remember that clerics can use Channel\n\t\t\tDivinity once per short rest at this level, going up to 3 times per short\n\t\t\trest. This makes your whole party incredibly difficult to kill, and makes\n\t\t\tthem all but immune to both charm and fear effects.\n\t\t\t<p>The light effect here is a bit unclear, as it doesn&#8217;t explain how it\n\t\t\t\tinteracts with other light sources. Does it reduce existing light\n\t\t\t\tlevels? How does it interact with magical light? What about spells like\n\t\t\t\tDaylight or Darkness? I&#8217;m honestly not sure and I&#8217;m hesitant to offer\n\t\t\t\tsuggestions. It&#8217;s possible that brighter light simply overrides the\n\t\t\t\tlight from Twilight Sanctuary, and if that&#8217;s the case I&#8217;m fairly\n\t\t\t\tconfident that that doesn&#8217;t cause you any problems\nexcept trying to activate your Steps of Night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p>This ability is exceptionally powerful. The amount of temporary hp is\n\t\t\t\thuge and the fact that it refreshes is terrifying. If it&#8217;s a problem in\n\t\t\t\tyour game (and it might be \nstarting in midgame when two per short rest doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s too precious to use often), there are\n\t\t\t\tseveral variations that you could try to address it with. If you try any of\n\t\t\t\tthese or if you have your own fixes,\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"mailto:RPGBOT@RPGBOT.net\">email me<\/a> and let me know what you\n\t\t\t\ttried and how it went.\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Fix A<\/strong>: The cleric must maintain Concentration as\n\t\t\t\t\tthough Concentrating on a spell. This prevents them from combining\n\t\t\t\t\tTwilight Sanctuary with the Cleric&#8217;s best spells, including things\n\t\t\t\t\tlike Bless and Spirit Guardians.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Fix B<\/strong>: Applying either of the two effects takes the\n\t\t\t\t\tcleric&#8217;s Reaction, so they&#8217;re only able to affect one creature per\n\t\t\t\t\tround.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Fix C<\/strong>: The temporary hit point option applies once\n\t\t\t\t\tper creature, and the temporary hit points disappear if the creature\n\t\t\t\t\texits the area of effect.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Fix D<\/strong>: Adjust the number of temporary hit points\n\t\t\t\t\tgranted. 1d6+level is a lot. Try 1d6+Wisdom (may be slightly higher\n\t\t\t\t\tthan intended at low levels, but will max out at 1d6+5 by level 8).\n\t\t\t\t\tYou might also try just a flat 1d6 or just the cleric&#8217;s Wisdom\n\t\t\t\t\tmodifier.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Fix E<\/strong>: Instead of automatically removing a\n\t\t\t\t\tCharm\/Fear effect, creatures can re-attempt their save against one\n\t\t\t\t\tCharm\/Fear effect currently affecting them at the original save DC. If\n\t\t\t\t\tthis feels like too much of a &#8220;nerf&#8221;, you might grant Advantage on the\n\t\t\t\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Fix F<\/strong>: The temporary hit points granted by Twilight\n\t\t\t\t\tSanctuary end when the effect ends or if the creature leaves the area\n\t\t\t\t\tof effect.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul>\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Steps of Night<\/span>: Magical flight is a\n\t\t\tcrucial tactical option, and activating it as a Bonus Action without\n\t\t\tspending spell slots is phenomenal. Granted, you can only trigger this in Dim Light and Darkness, but you can produce Dim Light with Channel Divinity:\n\t\t\tTwilight Sanctuary, or in a dark place you can hold a candle. \nThe ability also doesn&#8217;t require you to stay in those lighting conditions to keep using it.\nYou can use\n\t\t\tthis a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus every day, which is\n\t\t\tfrequently enough to get you through every occurrence where you&#8217;ll absolutely\n\t\t\tneed to be flying.<\/li>\n\t\t<li value=\"8\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Divine Strike<\/span>: Radiant damage is among\n\t\t\tthe most reliable damage types available.

You have a few tools spell-wise to aid that like Sleep for groups and Healing Word to stand back up whoever inevitably falls over while people are still very fragile. If things are more than 40 feet away, get closer and ask them for saves.<br><br>For starting equipment, take a warhammer, chain mail, a priest\u2019s pack, and a dagger to eat with.<br><br>Eyes of Night is already worth sharing from time to time. Probably don\u2019t spend any spell slots on it yet, but don\u2019t hesitate to share it with whatever party member didn\u2019t take racial Darkvision.<br><br>Ideally, you have a melee Rogue who\u2019s willing to ride around on your back and take advantage of the easy sneak attack you\u2019re providing them. Something else martial and melee works, too.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary<\/td><td>If it looks like a hard fight, pop this early and watch as all the damage things try to deal to your party is mitigated with little effort besides positioning. Fortunately, positioning is much easier for us because Centaur. <br><br>Optimal positioning really is the defining part of playing a Twilight Cleric well. You will often find yourself faced with the choice of optimizing group damage with Spirit Guardians or party defense with Twilight Bastion and the Aura spells. There is no one right answer here, and it&#8217;s really going to depend on the specifics of the fight and your party composition. Fortunately, the small purple dragonborn on your back solves one problem by moving with you, but if you two are the only melee characters, maximizing damage could leave your vulnerable strikers undefended if you&#8217;re not careful.<br><br>Tyler largely wrote the above subclass features breakdown, but I\u2019m of the opinion that the sphere around you is set to dim light, regardless of outside lighting conditions. When dealing with magical light levels, I would have it count as a spell of the highest level the Cleric can cast, countering light or darkness appropriately. This feels like the simplest way to interpret the rule and the closest to rules as intended.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Domain Spells:<br>&#8211; Moonbeam<br>&#8211; See Invisibility<\/td><td>Not much is going to be invisible at this point, so we\u2019re largely going to use spell slots for concentrating on damage over time.<br><br>Warding Bond becomes available at this level, and Twilight Clerics are an excellent use case for it. If you have something a little less durable like a shieldless polearm master as your Defender, throwing it on them while running Twilight Bastion effectively spreads the incoming damage out over two temp HP pools which drastically increases the target\u2019s survivability. This isn\u2019t crucial right now when you\u2019re short on spell slots, but keep this tactic in mind as you level.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Telekinetic (Wis)<\/td><td>Oh look, free <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/mage-hand\/\">Mage Hand<\/a>.

Aura of Vitality is excellent out of combat healing if your group doesn\u2019t have hit dice or time to spend on a short rest, and having Tiny Hut as a ritual is excellent.<br><br>One thing to note about Aura of Vitality is that Twilight Clerics always have access, even if your DM doesn\u2019t want to let you use any optional class features. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s the only way to get it as a Cleric, and it\u2019s good enough that it\u2019s frequently chosen by Lore bards for their early Magical Secrets.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Steps of Night<br><br>Channel Divinity 2\/rest<\/td><td>Now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kyd1j3mRsw4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can fly<\/a>, and, thanks to you being a Centaur, so can the friend on your back.<br><br>This is also the level our capacity to create Twilight Bastions doubles.
