Pathfinder 2e is no different. For players of most d20-based games, including D&amp;D, Pathfinder 2e\u2019s degrees of success can introduce some complications. But when we look under the covers, what we find is actually pretty straightforward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#success-etc\">Success, etc.<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#the-value-of-1\">The value of +1<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#extreme-values\">Extreme Values<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#advancement\">Advancement<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#progression-for-maximized-skills-using-key-ability-score\">Progression for Maximized Skills Using Key Ability Score<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor-class\">Armor Class<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#attacking\">Attacking<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#what-about-multiple-attack-penalty\">What about Multiple Attack Penalty?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#what-do-i-do-with-this-information\">What do I do with this information?<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"success-etc\">Success, etc.<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Pathfinder 2e, evolving from its roots in D&amp;D, uses a d20 roll to represent randomness and unpredictability when attempting something challenging. Unlike D&amp;D or PF1, PF2 uses \u201cdegrees of success\u201d. Understanding the math behind degrees of success and how that maps to your d20 rolls can offer helpful insights when considering the value of different bonuses and penalties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The possibility of critical success and critical failure further complicates this concept because a +1 bonus is more than just a 5% larger chance of success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Consider a roll on which we succeed on an 11. In that case we get a critical failure on a 1, a failure on a 2 through 10, a success on an 11 through 19, and a critical success on a 20. We have a 50% chance of some sort of success and a 50% chance of some sort of failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that failure and success both account for 9 possible die rolls, while critical success and critical failure are only possibly on a natural 1\/natural 20 because those rolls artificially alter your degree of success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>1<\/strong><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><strong>(11)<\/strong><\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>19<\/td><td><strong>(20)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now give your roll a +1 bonus, so instead of succeeding on an 11, you succeed on a 10. In this case, a natural 20 would beat the DC by 10 and would be a critical success. However, this doesn\u2019t <em>feel<\/em> different because the outcome of a natural 20 is the same. The only practical change here is that a die roll of 10 is now a success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>1<\/strong><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td><strong>(10)<\/strong><\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>19<\/td><td><strong>(20)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is somewhat misleading, and I chose to use this example specifically because this one case is misleading. It\u2019s very easy to look a this case and say \u201c+1 increases my odds of success by 5% and nothing more,\u201d which undervalues the effect of that +1 bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider another example: A character will commonly have an ability score of 18 in their Key Ability Score, and will hopefully be Trained in some skills attached to that ability score. Being Trained in something gives you a proficiency bonus of your level + 2, so a 1st-level character will often have a +7 bonus to skills to which they are well suited. As an example, a wizard with 18 Intelligence who is trained in both Arcana and Crafting will have a +7 bonus to use those two skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>With that bonus in mind, consider the <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Level-Based DC\u2019s table<\/a>. A level 1 DC is 15. With a +7 bonus, you succeed on a roll of 8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that target roll set, we can consider the spread on the d20. A natural 1 remains a critical failure. 2 through 7 remain a failure. 8 through 18 are our success range. 18, 19, and 20 all get us more than 10 points over the DC, so those results give us a critical success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>1<\/strong><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td><strong>(8)<\/strong><\/td><td>9<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><td><strong>(18)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>(19)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>(20)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-value-of-1\">The value of +1<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing the example of a level 1 wizard, above, the impact of a single +1 bonus is much more apparent and interesting. Our critical success range now goes as low as 17, giving us a 4 in 20 (20%) chance to critically succeed. Our success range also moves down to 7 through 16, shrinking our failure range to just 2 through 6. A natural 1 remains a critical failure, but a critical success is now three times as likely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>1<\/strong><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td><strong>(8)<\/strong><\/td><td>9<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><td><strong>(18)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>(19)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>(20)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Normal Number Scale<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>1<\/strong><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td><strong>(7)<\/strong><\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td><strong>(17)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>(18)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>(19)<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>(20)<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With a +1<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The +1 bonus changed the outcome of rolling a 7 and of rolling an 18, which means that there is a 1 in 10 (10%) chance of a +1 bonus improving your degree of success. It\u2019s not a massive difference, but it will make a difference over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not convinced, next time you play count every time someone fails a roll by 1 or falls short of a critical success by 1 during the session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extreme-values\">Extreme Values<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>In unusual situations, such as players attacking a high-level monster or a player facing a horde of low-level monsters, your chances of success might be so high or your chances of failure might be so low that one of the degrees of success is outright impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: Jo the level 1 champion finds themselves face to face with a lich, the inevitable big bad for their campaign. Jo decides to try their luck and attacks. They have a +7 attack bonus with their longsword, while the lich has an AC of 31. Jo needs to roll a 24 on the die to succeed on their attack roll. You will note that this is physically impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A roll of 20 would still be a failure for Jo, but a natural 20 increases your degree of success by 1. In this case, since a 20 would be a failure, Jo can still succeed on a natural 20. However, their failure range runs from 15 to 20, and everything below that is a critical failure. A critical success is entirely impossible for Jo in this case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advancement\">Advancement<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In D&amp;D 5e there\u2019s a clear curve where the game expects players to increase their primary ability score at levels 4 and 8, and then any increase in DC\u2019s occurs to coincide with levels 4 and 8 or a level at which Proficiency Bonus improves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathfinder 2e is no different, though the math is buried much more thoroughly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To unbury the math, we can look at the skill proficiency bonus progression, the <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Level-Based DC\u2019s table<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=1009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Armor Class<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/2e.aonprd.com\/Rules.aspx?ID=1017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Strike Attack Bonus<\/a> tables in the Gamemastery Guide\u2019s rules for creating monsters.

An enemy hitting you on a -6 is clearly insane, and even hitting on a 4 at level 1 is terrifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that tells us how much of a gap we need to close. The additional proficiency bonus on top of your level, your armor\u2019s item bonus to AC, and your Dexterity need to be up to the task. There\u2019s a ton of variation here because PF2 allows so much build versatility, but we can use some very simple examples to learn some things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll look at a wizard with 14 Dexterity in no armor, a rogue who is maxing their Dexterity in light armor (switching to gradually light armor or explorer\u2019s clothing when appropriate), a barbarian in medium armor with enough Dexterity to fill out the Dex Cap, and a fighter with 12 Dexterity starting in chain mail before upgrading to half plate and finally full plate. The Champion will be +2 AC better than the fighter for big chunks of the level range, but that doesn\u2019t add any additional learning to the table<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Lvl<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Monster Strike Bonus (Moderate)<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Wizard<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Hit #<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Rogue<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Hit #<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Barbarian<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Hit #<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Fighter<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Hit #<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Note<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>+7<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>Fighter in chain mail<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>+9<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>19<\/td><td><\/td><td>19<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>Fighter in half plate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>+10<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>Fighter in full plate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>+12<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>+13<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>Defense potency +1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>+15<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>+16<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>+18<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>+19<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>+21<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>9<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td>+22<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>Defense potency +2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>+24<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>+25<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td>+27<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td>+28<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td>+30<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>9<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td>+31<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>+33<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>Defense potency +3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td>+34<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td>+36<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>9<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at that scale is scary.

It\u2019s not like you need to boost Strength or Charisma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Light armor and medium armor have effectively the same AC, provided that you fill out the Dex Cap on your armor. Heavy armor comes out ahead by 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what armor you\u2019re wearingeapon, enemies matching your level with a moderate bonus to their strikes (the monster creation rules have a 4-tier scale and moderate is tier 2 of 4) will never need more than a 12 to hit you. Other bonuses (circumstance and status) are going to be very impactful, especially because a hit number below 11 means a growing likelihood of enemies scoring a critical hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attacking\">Attacking<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 11a - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve spent the past chunk of text scaring you, so it\u2019s time to go on the offensive.

Once you get into high levels, it\u2019s actually harder to hit than it was below level 10, so it\u2019s likely better to rely on saving throws unless you have other bonuses to your attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For martial characters, things stay roughly the same for the full level range, provided that you\u2019re buying potency runes for your weapon. Martials have roughly a +2 bonus to hit compared to spellcasters across most of the level range, meaning that attacks are consistently more effective for martial characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern of the hit numbers also reveals an interesting pattern: your hit number will get gradually more difficult over several levels before you get an improvement, then your hit number will drop by a couple points. This means that not only do you get the bonus to stay on track, but the game\u2019s math is actually engineered so that your upgraded attack bonus actually feels like an improvement rather than just keeping you perfectly on pace with the monsters\u2019 AC progression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-123\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-multiple-attack-penalty\">What about Multiple Attack Penalty?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Multiple Attack Penalties (MAP) are a major component of making tactical decisions in combat. Martial characters might rush to make as many attacks as possible, but the MAP intentionally makes additional attacks less effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the insights gained above, let\u2019s assume that a martial character will typically hit on a roll of 8 on the die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Attack #<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Regular Attack Hit #<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Hit %<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Crit %<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Agile Weapon Hit #<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Hit %<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Crit %<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>15%<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>15%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>40%<\/td><td>5%<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>45%<\/td><td>5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>15%<\/td><td>5%<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>25%<\/td><td>5%<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To be succinct: You\u2019re not going to hit with that third attack unless you\u2019re using an agile weapon, and even then the odds are poor.
