Your pool of Psionic Energy\n\t\tDice are your defining resource. You get a number equal to double your\n\t\tProficiency Bonus and the size goes from d6 to d12 over the course of your\n\t\tcareer. That sounds like a big pool, but they mostly recharge on a Long\n\t\tRest, and between long rests you can recharge just one die as a Bonus Action\n\t\tonce per Short Rest.\n\t\t<p>If your DM adheres to the Adventuring Day rules, that means you can\n\t\t\trecharge as many as three dice per day. Across a full day of adventuring\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s a small pool to work with and you need to be cautious about\n\t\t\tspending your dice rather than burning through them in the first\n\t\t\tencounter. The Soulknife&#8217;s Psionic Energy Dice are much easier to retain\n\t\t\tthan the Psi Warrior&#8217;s because they often aren&#8217;t expended if you fail a\n\t\t\troll, but even so at low levels you&#8217;ll need to be prudent about when\n\t\t\tsomething is worth a die.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psi-Bolstered Knack<\/span>: \nPsi-Bolstered Knack This feature is all about being the best skill monkey.\n If you fail\n\t\t\t\ta check you can roll a die even if the chances are incredibly slim\n\t\t\t\tthat it will make a difference. There\u2019s no waste if you still don\u2019t make it.\nEvery other ability like this requires you to gamble the\n\t\t\t\tresource on the possibility of success.\n<p>That said, there is the incredibly nebulous definition of &#8220;success&#8221; with regards to certain skills. If you&#8217;re making an Investigation check and you don&#8217;t find anything because there was nothing to find, did you succeed or did you fail? This is a conversation to have with your group and deciding the answer is beyond the scope of this article, but I have a suggestion for how to run it: because you choose to roll the Psi-die after you see what you rolled and the results of the initial d20 roll, my suggestion is that the Psi-die is only considered spent if the results are different after rolling it.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Whispers<\/span>: So what if your party always had walkie-talkies? Maybe you\u2019re scouting ahead, maybe your wizard wants to tell you where the fireball is going to be before she casts it. Rary&#8217;s Telepathic\n\t\t\t\tBond is a 5th-level spell, and you&#8217;re replicating its effects (mostly)\n\t\t\t\tat level 3. Rary&#8217;s Telepathic Bond also notably has a 1-hour duration,\n\t\t\t\tand you get 1d6 hours (up to 1d12 hours at 17th level). You&#8217;re limited\n\t\t\t\tto adding 2 allies when you get this (you&#8217;re in the group for free), but\n\t\t\t\tthe number increases with your Proficiency Bonus.\n\t\t\t\t<p>Don&#8217;t forget: you get this once per day for free, so there&#8217;s no\n\t\t\t\t\treason to not use it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Blades<\/span>: This is your primary\n\t\tcombat option. You can attack with the blades equally well in melee and at\n\t\trange, and with a range of 60 feet your range is much greater than that of a\n\t\trogue using daggers, and this is one of the best features if you want to be a ranged rogue. The fact that this deals psychic damage is great, too,\n\t\tsince it&#8217;s so rarely resisted and easily bypasses common resistances to\n\t\tnon-magical weapon damage. Oh, and it&#8217;s a d6 damage die instead of the\n\t\tdagger&#8217;s d4.\n\t\t<p>The ability to make a second attack as a Bonus Action if you have another\n\t\t\tfree hand is great. Two-weapon fighting is already a great fallback option\n\t\t\tand since you don&#8217;t need to draw daggers to repeatedly throw them you\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t need to strain your Free Item Interaction every turn to keep your\n\t\t\thands full of pointy things. But the benefits go further. The second\n\t\t\tattack applies your Ability Modifier to damage since you&#8217;re not actually\n\t\t\tusing the two-weapon fighting rules. Sure, the second blade uses a\n\t\t\tslightly smaller damage die, but who cares? That&#8217;s such a tiny,\n\t\t\tmeaningless difference that I&#8217;m surprised they bothered to print it.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>However, this feature does have some drawbacks. The blades only manifest when you take the Attack action, so you&#8217;ll be unarmed after\n\t\t\tattacking with both blades, which means that you can&#8217;t use Opportunity\n\t\t\tAttacks to get extra Sneak Attack on other people&#8217;s turns (unarmed strikes\n\t\t\tare still possible, but don&#8217;t qualify for Sneak Attack) and you won&#8217;t benefit\nfrom allies using things like a Battlemaster using Commander\u2019s Strike or Order Domain Clerics\u2019 Voice of Authority feature. Remember that Sneak Attack is once per turn, not per round, so you\u2019re giving up a substantial piece of rogue optimization. These also don\u2019t gain attack bonuses like a magic weapon, and you\u2019re locked into a damage type that some things (unintelligent creatures, especially) have unmitigatable resistance or even immunity to.<\/p>\n<p>You can mitigate\n\t\t\tthe off-turn attack limitations somewhat by drawing and stowing a dagger before or after attacking on\n\t\t\talternate turns, but that trades your Free Item Interaction every turn for\n\t\t\tthe ability to make meaningful attacks as a Reaction every other turn at most.\n\t\t\tThat&#8217;s a hard trade, not to mention how annoying it is. You could also get\n\t\t\tFighting Style (Thrown Weapon) which will allow you to draw a dagger as\n\t\t\tpart of the making the Opportunity Attack, but that may not be worth the\n\t\t\tcost to do so unless you&#8217;re really leaning into the ability to Sneak Attack with\nyour Reaction.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Also, since your Psychic Blades can only deal psychic damage, if you run\n\t\t\tinto something immune to it you lose half the functions of your subclass.\n\t\t\tYou&#8217;ll need to carry a dagger (ideally a magic one) as a backup.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Soul Blades<\/span>: Two ways to turn your Psychic\n\t\tEnergy Dice into solutions to frequent problems. This is also the first time where your psychic dice are consistently useful in combat.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Homing Strikes<\/span>: Use this on the last\n\t\t\t\tattack of your turn (maybe you don&#8217;t want to attack with both of your\n\t\t\t\tPsychic Blades every turn; Cunning Action also exists), provided that\n\t\t\t\tyou can deal Sneak Attack with that attack. If you miss the \n\t\t\t\tattack roll, you can try to turn a near miss into a hit. If you still miss,\n\t\t\t\tthis costs you nothing. If you do hit, you&#8217;re trading your Psionic\n\t\t\t\tEnergy Die for a Sneak Attack. That&#8217;s a very good trade a lot of the\ntime. Even so, you don&#8217;t want to use this constantly because it will deplete your psionic dice pool too quickly. Use it when you need it to land that crucial blow.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Teleportation<\/span>: A bonus action short ranged combat teleport. Even moving\n\t\t\t\tthe minimum of 10 feet is enough to get you out of grapples and many\n\t\t\t\tarea control effects, as well as through many tight openings like arrow\n\t\t\t\tslits. However, if you need to cross a large gap you&#8217;ll find that the\n\t\t\t\tunpredictable range is frustrating. Fortunately, you choose whether or\n\t\t\t\tnot you want to teleport <em>after<\/em> you roll the die so you never\n\t\t\t\tneed to worry about accidentaly teleporting yourself above a pit of acid\n\t\t\t\tor something, but you&#8217;re committing to spend the die before you roll it\n\t\t\t\tso look for other options if you&#8217;re not likely to get as far as you need\n\t\t\t\tto go.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"13\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Veil<\/span>: Invisibility for a full\n\t\thour, and you get it once per day for free. An hour is a long time, and you\n\t\tcan do a lot of things without breaking Invisibility, including things like\n\t\tdisarming traps and taking the Help action to help allies in combat. Combined with Psychic Whispers and Expertise, you&#8217;re an amazing scout.\n<p>You can\n\t\tspend a Psionic Energy Die to recharge it, but that&#8217;s an easy way to spend\n\t\tyour dice very quickly when mundane Stealth checks will often suffice.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rend Mind<\/span>: Note quite as good as Hold\n\t\tMonster, but about as close as you can get without casting it. Stunned takes\n\t\tthe target out of the fight and makes it very easy to kill them. Since the\n\t\tDC is Dexterity-based your DC will match that of spellcasters, and the one-minute\nduration is nice.\n<p>You get this\n\t\tonce per day for free, but spending a quarter of your Psionic Energy\n\t\tDice to recharge it is very costly, so you want to save this for powerful single\nfoes rather than using this in every encounter.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optional-class-features\">Optional Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Tasha\u2019s introduced optional features for the base classes. Some classes received more than other classes, but Rogue received a single ability at level 3, Steady Aim. This is a great tool for us as a Soulknife because it requires standing still to gain Advantage and we can simply throw our Psychic Blade as a ranged attack. We have to give up the off-hand attack, but that\u2019s a fair trade if aiming gives us Sneak Attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If for some reason you\u2019re not able to use this feature, it\u2019s not the end of the world. We still have plenty of uses for the bonus action. Again, you could simply use the bonus action second psychic dagger. Mathematically, this is the same odds as aiming to gain Advantage on one attack, with the bonus of getting more damage if both rolls are good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback is that we can\u2019t just have Advantage for a free Sneak Attack. Or can we? With Cunning Action, we can Hide as a Bonus Action, which is not completely free and we do need some way to actually Hide, but assuming we can have the right conditions we\u2019ll gain Advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"soulknife-ability-scores\">Soulknife Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The thing about being a skill monkey is that you have some options here.

We assume you are using the Customize Your Origin rules. The reason for this assumption is that all races published post-Tasha\u2019s Cauldron have had this rule baked in for ability scores. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, however, we are taking advantage of the second part of those rules: that you may freely trade the default skill proficiencies granted to a race for other skill proficiencies of our choosing. The main reason this is important is that not every skill is on the Rogue&#8217;s class list, so even though we get four proficiencies from our class,&nbsp;we can still benefit from a race which expands our skill options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Races Lacking a Skill Proficiency<\/span>: I\u2019m just putting this blanket note here as a catch-all for anything I don\u2019t call out in particular later in the section.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Races with a Skill Proficiency<\/span>: Same as above.

Depending on your campaign, you might find these useful. For example, Sea Vehicle proficiency in a nautical game.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Half-Elf<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: We want to take advantage of Psi-Bolstered Knack, so why not have two more skill proficiencies to put wherever. The other unique advantage here is the stat spread, +2\/+1\/+1. If you\u2019re point buying, turning your pair of 14s into a 13 and a 15 allows the pair of +1s to become a 16 and a 14. Half-Elf also grants access to the Prodigy feat later on, a source of further proficiency as well as an extra Expertise, as well as the Elven Accuracy feat for doubling down on Advantage.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">V. Human<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: You really can\u2019t go wrong with a bonus feat. We\u2019ll discuss feats in depth below, but like Half-Elf above, Humans also have access to Prodigy. Note however, that a Hybrid feat (a feat that grants +1 to a stat) stacked upon your +1\/+1 is a generally solid plan.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Kenku<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">MMoM<\/a><\/sup>:We gain two skill proficiencies and PB times per day we can give ourself Advantage on a skill we\u2019re proficient in.

However, we will want some backup magic weapons just in case we come across something resistant or immune to our Psychic damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to do some two-weapon fighting with your Psychic Blade and a dagger, the important thing to remember is that the bonus action follow-up Psychic Blade can only follow an Attack with the primary Psychic Blade, meaning the dagger has to be swung second and unless you acquire the Two-Weapon Fighting style (first level Fighter, second level Ranger, or Fighting Initiate feat) that attack will not add your Dexterity modifier to damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"soulknife-armor\">Soulknife Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>See our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#armor\" data-type=\"page\">Rogue Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"soulknife-multiclassing\">Soulknife Multiclassing<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Most of what was said in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#rogue\" data-type=\"page\">rogue handbook<\/a> applies, but we have a few extra things to consider. Because of the limitations of Psychic Blades, dipping into a caster to gain a weapon cantrip like Booming Blade doesn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Bard<\/span>: As explained in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/rogue\/#multiclassing\">rogue handbook<\/a>, three levels in Bard for College of Eloquence does get you expertise in two skills and puts a rolling floor of 9 on Deception and Persuasion if you&#8217;re playing a Face. Keep in mind though that 11 levels in Rogue gives the same floor to all skills you&#8217;re proficient with.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ranger<\/span>: For less of an investment than Bard, one level in Ranger will give you one Expertise (if you&#8217;re using the Ranger&#8217;s Optional Class Features) and a skill from the class list, as long as you choose to take the Deft Explorer Optional Class Feature from Tasha&#8217;s. Take a second level if you want a fighting style. Blind Fighting or Thrown Weapon Fighting would both be good choices, leaning more towards Blind Fighting so you can Sneak Attack things you can&#8217;t quite see, especially if your party can cast Fog Cloud or otherwise block line of sight.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-soul-knife-rogue-build-halfelf-skill-monkey\">Example Soul Knife Rogue Build &#8211; Half-Elf Skill Monkey<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - Mid_content 12c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to use point buy and go for an Intelligence skills heavy build. A real educated Detective type. We\u2019re not the most damaging Rogue, but we bring a wide skill assortment to a party. I recommend this build if your party lacks a Scholar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your party has a Scholar caster and lacks a Face, you could easily adapt this build towards Charisma skills by just swapping the ability scores and choosing the Charisma skills in place of the Knowledge skills, while not changing any of the Wisdom choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those are both covered, or you want a little more damage and a little less skill, consult the feats section below for suggestions on what to alter for a little more in-combat oomph.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re customizing the ability scores to move the +2 to Dexterity, and putting our other +1s in Intelligence and Wisdom. For this example I\u2019m going to pick Intelligence as the highest of our three mental ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you\u2019re not picking Wisdom as your highest mental ability score, we still like Perception or Insight, so don&#8217;t dump Wisdom to 8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Half-Elf. We gain two skills, Darkvision, and an extra +1 to an ability score over functionally every other race. For the skills, we grab 2 of Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion because they do not appear on the Rogue list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re taking a customised background for flexibility (remember that the PHB allows you to do that). We opt for two skills and two tools. For the skills we\u2019re going to pick the other two of Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion that we didn\u2019t take as Half-Elf skills. For tools, we take Cartographer\u2019s Tools and Navigator\u2019s Tools because your choice of tools is mostly flavour, but now we can both read and write maps.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As a Rogue, we\u2019re granted Thieves\u2019 Tools, and we choose from our class list Acrobatics, Investigation, Perception, and Stealth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, for skills we start with basic Proficiencies in History, Arcana, Religion, Nature, Acrobatics, and Perception, while we have Expertise with Investigation and Stealth. For tools, we took Proficiencies in Cartographer\u2019s, Navigator\u2019s, and Thieves\u2019 Tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative start for more scouting and combat but less investigation and knowledge would move the Expertise from Investigation to Perception and replace a Knowledge skill of your choice with Survival.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Starting with a seventeen in Dexterity allows us to hybrid feat at fourth level, and push to twenty at eighth. As a Rogue however, we can choose to take a feat at tenth, sooner than most other classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those feats, because this build is about being the best at half of the skill challenges in the game, we\u2019re taking some non-traditional feats, sacrificing a few more combat-focused options in favour of skill boosting feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fourth we\u2019re taking Skill Expert, giving us proficiency in Survival and Expertise in Perception. If instead we\u2019re going with the more scouting and combat setup detailed in the skills section above, we would choose Elven Accuracy here at 4th to add a little more consistency with every Advantageous attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth we just take two points in Dexterity. We want that 20 in our primary stat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tenth Skulker expands on our ability to Hide, but also improves our Perception in poor lighting. I need to point this out, Darkvision is not Night Vision. In Darkness, Darkvision lets you see as if it was Dim Light. Dim Light gives Disadvantage to sight Perception, and Skulker removes this Disadvantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth we take Skilled for Animal Handling, Insight, and Sleight of Hand, but if you\u2019re looking for more combat options, Mobile or Alert are fine choices. If you want to focus more on the scouting skills, Observant is a good choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth we take Prodigy, something we couldn\u2019t take if we weren&#8217;t a Half-Elf, Human, or Half-Orc. If you took Elven Accuracy at fourth, but are still leaning into the Skills, this would be a fine place for Skill Expert instead, especially if you took Observant at twelvth as both are Hybrid Feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Sneak Attack<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Expertise<br>Thieves\u2019 Cant<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>For starting equipment, just take the rapier as the highest damage option and the rest of the starting package can be your choice.<br>We\u2019ll put Expertise into Stealth and Investigation which gives us a +7 to both of those skills.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Cunning Action<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>At this level, the war for our Bonus Action begins.
