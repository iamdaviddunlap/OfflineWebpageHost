At the expense of some of the Alchemist&#8217;s healing and support capabilities, the Master Chymist uses Mutagen to play a Defender and a Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like a Barbarian, the Master Chymist has issues with AC due to their light armor. Unlike the Barbarian, the Master Chymist doesn&#8217;t have a d12 hit die to fall back on when their AC falls short. Be sure to invest in your AC and your Constitution bonus to be sure that you have enough hit points to survive melee combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Infuse Mutagen is fine, but not nearly as useful as Feral Mutagen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Master Chymist Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hit Points<\/span>: d10 hit points is standard for\n\tmelee classes but remember that you&#8217;ll be starting from the Alchemist&#8217;s d8 hit\n\tpoints.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: Full BAB.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Saves<\/span>: Good Fortitude and Reflex saves, but\n\tWill saves will be a problem and Greater\/Grand mutagen will add a penalty to\n\tWisdom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Proficiencies<\/span>: None, but you get everything\n\tyou need from the Alchemist.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: 2+ skills, and the skill list doesn&#8217;t\n\tdirectly match that of the Alchemist. The Master Chymist doesn&#8217;t even get\n\tCraft, which is weird, but since you already have the class skill bonus from\n\tyour Alchemist levels, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. Spread some ranks around to\n\tpick up the class skill bonuses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Extracts per Day<\/span>: The Master Chymist gives\n\tup some of the Alchemist&#8217;s Extracts, but progresses 7 levels over the course\n\tof the class&#8217;s 10 levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bomb-Thrower<\/span> (Ex): Bombs really don&#8217;t\n\tmatter to the Master Chymist, but it&#8217;s nice that they aren&#8217;t completely\n\tabandoned. If your GM is nice, this might work to advance Sneak Attack if you\n\ttook the Vivisectionist archetype. Even if you GM isn&#8217;t that nice,\n\tVivisectionist is still a great idea.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"\">Mutagenic Form<\/span> (Ex): This is almost entirely for\n\tflavor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mutate<\/span> (Su): This allows you to go in and\n\tout of your mutagen multiple times per day, which means that you can change\n\tyour mutagen much more easily, and that Ragechemist Alchemists can recover\n\tfrom their penalties more than once per day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Advanced Mutagen<\/span> (Su): The Master Chymist\n\tgets some mutagents which aren&#8217;t accessible to anyone else. They play very\n\twell into the Master Chymist&#8217;s concept, and a few of the options are really\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Burly<\/span> (Ex): Essential for grapple builds,\n\t\tbut otherwise worthless.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Disguise<\/span> (Ex): Buy a hat of disguise.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Draconic Mutagen<\/span> (Su): The energy\n\t\tresistance is tempting, but a single-use breath weapon with such poor damage\n\t\tis worthless at such high level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dual Mind<\/span> (Ex): Excellent for\n\t\tRagechemists, but not particularly important for anyone else. The reroll\n\t\tagainst Enchantment spells can be very useful against scary effects like\n\t\tDominate Person, but it&#8217;s situational.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Fantastic on any character\n\t\tat any level.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Extended Mutagen<\/span> (Ex): By the time you\n\t\tcan get this, your Mutagen lasts at least 90 minutes, and you can do it\n\t\tthree times per day without stopping to make an extra mutagen. 4.5 hours per\n\t\tday probably plenty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Feral Mutagen<\/span> (Ex): If you have any sense\n\t\tat all you took this as a prerequisite for the class.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Furious Mutagen<\/span> (Ex): Sounds tempting,\n\t\tbut the difference between 1d6\/1d8 and 1d8\/2d6 damage is only about 4\n\t\tpoints. If you are enlarged (either by Enlarge Person or Growth Mutagen),\n\t\tthe total increase gives you 2d6\/3d6 natural weapons, which is a slightly\n\t\tbetter payoff.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grand Mutagen<\/span> (Ex): Essential.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greater Mutagen<\/span> (Ex): Essential.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Growth Mutagen<\/span> (Ex): Being enlarged is\n\t\tfantastic for many melee characters, but by 16th level the gold to be\n\t\tpermanently enlarged is pocket change.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Night Vision<\/span> (Ex): Darkvision is great,\n\t\tbut you can make a Darkvision extract with hours\/level duration.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nimble<\/span> (Ex): A bonus to natural armor\n\t\tequal to half your class level is fantastic for a feat equivalent, but the\n\t\tbonus also applies to CMD (fantastic for grapple builds), and Dexterity\n\t\tchecks and Dex-based skill checks.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Restoring Change<\/span> (Su): Spontaneous Healing\n\t\tis miles better, or you could make Extracts of Cure Light Wounds.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Scent<\/span> (Ex): Great for locating hidden and\n\t\tinvisible enemies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Brutality<\/span> (Ex): The damage isn&#8217;t a huge\n\tboost, but it&#8217;s guaranteed to see use, and it closes the damage gap between\n\tsimple\/natural weapons and martial weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"base-classes\">Base Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Master Chymist&#8217;s big class requirement is access to Extracts, which severely limits our options. Only the Alchemist gets both Extracts and Mutagen, so it&#8217;s really the only decent option. This guide assumes that you will be using Alchemist as your base class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Alchemist<\/span>: The obvious choice, and the\n\t\talchemist&#8217;s Mutagen ability stacks with the mutagenic abilities provided by\n\t\tMaster Chymist.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Investigator<\/span>: The investigator gets access\n\t\tto Extracts, but without Mutagen they make for a very poor Master\n\t\tChymist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compatible-archetypes\">Compatible Alchemist Archetypes<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a class=\"rating-blue\" href=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/ultimateCombat\/classArchetypes\/alchemist.html#beastmorph-%28archetype%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beastmorph<\/a>: The Beastmorph adds some extra buffs to the Mutagen, and because you can\n\t\tchange them every time you mutate it removes the need for the Night Vision\n\t\tand Scent Advanced Mutagen options.

If you still want to use medium armor, Mithral Kikko is your\n\t\tbest bet. However, in the long term this will only amount to a +1 to AC, so\n\t\tDodge will be a better option at high levels. If your GM allows you to use\n\t\tthe retraining rules, retrain this into something more useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Multiattack<\/span>: Feral Mutagen gives you three\n\t\tnatural attacks, but all three of them are primary attacks so Multiattack\n\t\twon&#8217;t do anything for you.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power Attack<\/span>: With ridiculous Strength and\n\t\tthree natural attacks, Power Attack is a fantastic choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shield Proficiency<\/span>: The alchemist doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thave to worry about arcane spell failure, so picking up a shield can be a\n\t\tconsiderable improvement to the Alchemist&#8217;s AC. However, you can use a\n\t\tbuckler or light shield, remember that the masterwork ACP will be 0, so\n\t\tthere is no need for proficiency, making Shield Proficiency essentially a +1\n\t\tbonus to AC, in which case Dodge is a better choice.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Toughness<\/span>: With at least 7 levels of\n\t\tAlchemist providing only d8 hit points, Toughness can provide a lot of very\n\t\twelcome hit points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dagger<\/span>: Excellent for a variety of\n\t\tpurposes, including stabbing people and throwing.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Natural Weapons<\/span>: Feral Mutagen is a great\n\t\toption for getting natural weapons, and three attacks is more than you can\n\t\thope for from weapons.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crossbow, Light<\/span>: Considerably better\n\t\trange than Bomb, but the damage is poor. A nice backup weapon at low\n\t\tlevel.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Javelin<\/span>: An excellent way to apply your\n\t\tMutagen-enhanced Strength bonus to damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longspear<\/span>: The alchemist&#8217;s only option\n\t\tfor a reach weapon, and mutagen-enhanced strength can make it passably\n\t\tdangerous.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Armor is presented in the order in which you should acquire it, rather than alphabetical order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Studded Leather<\/span>: Your starting gear.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Masterwork Buckler<\/span>: A masterwork buckler\n\t\tis one of the cheapest and easiest AC bonuses available, but it won&#8217;t work\n\t\twhile you&#8217;re using your claws from Feral Mutagen. Fortunately, the Alchemist\n\t\tcan take the Vestigial Arm discovery to get a third hand in which to hold a\n\t\tshield.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mithral Shirt<\/span>: If you stick to light\n\t\tarmor, this is your best option for your whole career.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Breastplate<\/span>: If you pick up medium armor\n\t\tyou will use a breastplate until you pick up Greater\/Grand Mutagen and a\n\t\tbelt which increases your Dexterity, at which point you should spend the\n\t\tmoney to upgrade to Mithral Kikko.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mithral Kikko<\/span>: If you use medium armor\n\t\tand use the +4 Grand Mutagen bonus for Dexterity, Mithral Kikko will allow\n\t\tyou use a +6 belt of physical perfection to bring your Dexterity to 24 and\n\t\tjust hit the Maximum Dexterity Bonus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Permanent Magic Fang<\/span>: Feral Mutagen gives\n\t\tyou natural weapons, but they are non-magical, making them bad at bypassing\n\t\teven the most basic DR. Magic Fang provides bonuses to attack and damage,\n\t\tand you can bypass DR\/magic. If the enhancement is good enough, you can also\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/glossary.html#damage-reduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bypass other forms of DR<\/a>. A permanent +5 enhancement bonus costs 8100 gp (600 for a level 20 caster\n\t\tto cast magic fang, and 7500 for permanency), less than the cost of a +2\n\t\tweapon, and can bypass all forms of DR. Be sure that your GM is comfortable\n\t\twith you having a 20th-level caster handy to cast spells for you. If not,\n\t\tyou can<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiclassing\">Multiclassing and Prestige Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>A one-level dip into other classes can grant a lot of useful proficiencies, feats, and abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Barbarian<\/span>: Rage is tempting, but you\n\t\twon&#8217;t have enough Rage rounds to make a Barbarian dip worthwhile..<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Brawler<\/span>: One level gets you Improved\n\t\tUnarmed Strike and Martial Flexibility. You won&#8217;t make use of the Brawler&#8217;s\n\t\tother 1st-level abilities, and even Martial Flexibility won&#8217;t be\n\t\tparticularly useful.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Fighter<\/span>: Bonus combat feats are always\n\t\tgreat for melee monsters, and the Mutation Warrior&#8217;s archetype&#8217;s Mutagen\n\t\tstacks with the Alchemist&#8217;s and the Master Chymist&#8217;s.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monk<\/span>: You get Improved Unarmed Strike,\n\t\tbonuses to all three saves, Stunning Fist, and a bonus feat which you can\n\t\tuse for Improved Grapple. However, your the Master Chymist is unlikely to\n\t\tmake use of Flurry of Blows or the Monk&#8217;s AC Bonus, and your BAB doesn&#8217;t\n\t\tincrease.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ranger<\/span>: The Natural Weapon combat style\n\t\tseems tempting, but it&#8217;s not worthwhile. Fighter levels will be considerably\n\t\tmore useful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example\">Example Build &#8211; The Mutagenic Strangler<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>SURPRISE!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a grapple build intended to capitalize on the Master Chymist&#8217;s insane Strength and on Vivisectionist&#8217;s Sneak Attack damage. While the Master Chymist lacks the BAB of traditional grapplers (Brawlers, Fighters, Monks), the raw Strength can make up for much of the deficit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build honestly isn&#8217;t that great, but I really wanted a way to use Strangler, and this is the best way I could think to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We will assume the 25-point buy abilities suggested above, but the other suggested abilities can also use this build without any problems.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Half-Orc. We&#8217;re going to use the Ragechemist archetype, so the Orc&#8217;s Sacred Tattoo is a big help for overcoming our Will save problem. The flexible ability bonus will go into Strength.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes\">Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Alchemist will be our entry class, and we will use both the Ragechemist and Vivisectionist archetypes. Beastmorph would work in place of Ragechemist, but I think that Strength will be more helpful for this build than the Beastmorph&#8217;s abilities. I will assume that Master Chymist will increase Sneak Attack the same way it increases bombs, but be sure that you consult with your GM to be sure, as this build depends heavily on that assumption.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Skills aren&#8217;t particularly important to the build. Take whatever you need to help your party.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fate&#8217;s Favored and Indomitable Faith.

Rely on your Infusions to buff yourself a bit, and try to bring Sneak Attack into play as much as possible by using thrown javelins. With Mutagen your Strength will be 22, which is great, so you might get into melee with a two-handed weapon like a Spear or Longspear. Remember that Mutagen adds +4 natural armor, so even in studded leather your AC will be a perfectly respectable 19.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Alchemist 2<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Discovery: Feral Mutagen<\/li>\n<li>poison resistance +2<\/li>\n<li>Rage Mutagen<\/li>\n<li>Torturer&#8217;s Eye<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Feral Mutagen allows you to start using natural weapons. With 24 strength, you get three attacks dealing 1d6+7 or 1d8+7, which puts many two-weapon fighters to shame.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rage Mutagen improves the Mutagen Strength bonus to +6, but at the cost potentially losing Intelligence and Will Save bonus every time that you take damage. Between abilities, traits, and class bonuses you have a total +5 to Will saves at this level, which is only enough to succeed 50% of the time. Be sure to pick up a Cloak of Resistance as soon as possible, and enhance your AC so that you won&#8217;t take damage frequently.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Alchemist 3<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Sneak Attack +2d6<\/li>\n<li>swift alchemy<\/li>\n<li>Cruel Anatomist<\/li>\n<li>Feat: Improved Grappler<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Improved Grappler is fundamental to this builds long-term strategy, but don&#8217;t feel compelled to start grappling if three natural attacks is working better for you. With +2d6 Sneak Attack damage, three attacks can be a big pile of damage while you&#8217;re flanking. If you do choose to grapple, you can apply natural weapon damage (such as your 1d8 bite) when you take a standard action to maintain a grapple. Grapple also has the added benefit of making it difficult for grappled enemies to deal damage to you.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Alchemist 4<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Discovery: Vestigial Arm<\/li>\n<li>Ability Increase: Strength<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Vestigial Arm isn&#8217;t particularly exciting, but it allows you to pick up a shield. a +1 Buckler is 1165 gp, and provides a very welcome +2 to AC. Coupled with Chain Shirt and the natural armor from Mutagen you should have at least 22 AC. By this level you can probably also afford a Ring of Protection and\/or an Amulet of Natural Armor. Get as much AC as you can manage. It&#8217;s doubly important with only d8 hit points.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Alchemist 5<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Sneak Attack +3d6<\/li>\n<li>poison resistance +4<\/li>\n<li>Feat: Strangler<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Strangler dramatically improves the effectiveness of grappling, but if you can flank you will probably still have better damage output with your three natural attacks.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Alchemist 6<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Discovery: Spontaneous Healing<\/li>\n<li>Sturdy Rage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Spontaneous healing allows you to heal yourself a bit every round as a free action. This dramatically improves your pool of hit points for the day, and makes you able to quickly counter bleed effects.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sturdy rage adds another +4 natural armor, making your AC truly impressive. However, you are still extremely vulnerable to touch attacks regardless of how little damage they deal.

If you fail to maintain the grapple, you can try again in the same round. If you succeed both times, you get extra damage. Don&#8217;t forget to use your swift action to use Strangler. 5d6 damage is nice, even once per round.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Burly adds a nice scaling bonus to CMB\/CMD which will make grappling easier.<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Master Chymist 3<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>+1 level of alchemist<\/li>\n<li>Brutality +2<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<p>Brutality will improve your natural weapon damage, including on grapples.
