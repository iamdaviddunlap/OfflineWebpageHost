As the name implies, this subclass is themed around time manipulation. It manages to do a good job of sticking to the theme with its features without going too far off the rails. It\u2019s not going to start time traveling or anything like that. Instead, it causes little shifts, like rewinding a single moment by forcing a d20 to reroll. Or acting slightly earlier in a fight by adding the Intelligence modifier to initiative checks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>These features are all well and good, but they also happen to be on a Wizard. Maybe the reroll you force is the successful save against one of your spells. Maybe that bonus to initiative is the edge you need to put down a key spell. I\u2019m sure you can see why this subclass is so widely praised.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because chronurgists get access to dunamancy by default, be sure to see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/dunamancy\/\">Dunamancy Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Chronurgy Magic Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#chronurgy-magic-ability-scores\">Chronurgy Magic Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#chronurgy-magic-races\">Chronurgy Magic Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#chronurgy-magic-feats\">Chronurgy Magic Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#chronurgy-magic-weapons-and-armor\">Chronurgy Magic Weapons and Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#chronurgy-magic-multiclassing\">Chronurgy Magic Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-chronurgy-magic-build-hare-today-gone-tomorrow\">Example Chronurgy Magic  Build &#8211; Hare Today, Gone Tomorrow<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

The target can be you, an\n\t\tally, or an enemy, so you can use this to divert critical hits, to offer\n\t\tanother attempt on failed saves, or if you&#8217;re not worried about your own\n\t\tsafety you could use this to let allies reroll missed attacks. Generally you\n\t\tshould save this to be used defensively. Rerolling one ally&#8217;s missed attack\n\t\twill rarely save a life, but rerolling saves will save lives constantly.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Temporal Awareness<\/span>: A sizable bonus to\n\t\tInitiative. Going first is incredibly useful for spellcasters who can place\n\t\tarea control effects to shape the rest of the fight.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Momentary Stasis<\/span>: Taking a creature out\n\t\tof a fight for a turn is great, but Constitution saves tend to be high, and\n\t\tthe effect only lasts until the end of your next turn so you&#8217;re giving up\n\t\tyour Action on your turn to <em>possibly<\/em> deny the target their own\n\t\tturn. It&#8217;s a fine trade if your party outnumbers your enemies, but if you&#8217;re\n\t\toutnumbered you should be fireballing things rather than trading turns with\n\t\ta single enemy.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Abeyance<\/span>: I see four ways to use\n\t\tthis:\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>You can have an ally cast a spell which typically affects the caster so\n\t\t\t\tthat you can share powerful effects like Shadow Blade.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>You can have an ally cast a concentration spell and hold the\n\t\t\t\tconcentration for you. This is especially useful for familiars who can\n\t\t\t\tcast the spell then run and hide without cutting into your party&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\teffectiveness significantly.\n<p>If you\u2019re especially cheeky and have access to the Ravnica backgrounds, being Orzhov and handing Spirit Guardians to your fighter is pretty fun.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>You can use it to let another creature cast a spell for you so that you\n\t\t\t\tcan get an extra spell off in a hurry. A familiar is a fantastic choice\n\t\t\t\tin this case. They&#8217;re prohibited from making attacks, but nothing stops\n\t\t\t\tthem from casting Fireball.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li>Cast a spell with a long casting time, then freeze it upon completion.\n\t\t\t\tCarry the bead around for a bit, then activate it to deliver the\n\t\t\t\tspell.<\/li>\n<li>Give every member of the party their own Familiar. Give your Familiar a Familiar. Give that Familiar a Familiar.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Convergent Future<\/span>: Rerolls are great, but\n\t\tthey&#8217;re still a roll. Take the risk out of it and just decide that a roll\n\t\tsucceeds or fails. The cost is high, however, and it gets worse the more\n\t\ttimes you use this in a day. Few creatures can give you levels of\n\t\texhaustion, so it&#8217;s usually not a problem, but the one time you encounter an\n\t\tenemy which inflicts Exhaustion you&#8217;re in serious trouble if you&#8217;ve used\n\t\tthis at all that day. Also avoid things like starving, sleep deprivation,\n\t\tand forced marches. Dying at level 14 because you&#8217;re tired is hardly the way\n\t\tyou want to go out.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chronurgy-magic-ability-scores\">Chronurgy Magic Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re a Wizard and we do Wizard things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Nah, don\u2019t need Strength.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Yeah we like having AC and getting better Initiative checks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: We really like having HP and making Concentration saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Need those spell save DCs and spell attack rolls.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Saves against some nasty effects.

We have options.<br><br>We\u2019ll want to pick up Find Familiar at some point as Familiars are very useful, especially alongside Arcane Abeyance at Wizard 10.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3-Wizard 2<\/td><td>Arcane Tradition: Chronurgy Magic<br><br>Chronal Shift<br><br>Temporal Awareness<\/td><td>We get our subclass, Chronurgy Magic, the focus of this guide.<br><br>Chronal Shift allows us to force a reroll on any d20 we see. It\u2019s like Silvery Barbs except we can use it on failed rolls we want to succeed as well, so save it for those and use Silvery Barbs when we want something to fail instead.<br><br>Temporal Awareness is just a simple adding Intelligence modifier to Initiative checks.<br><br>This puts our Initiative modifier right now at +7 before adding anything like Vigilant Blessing or Gift of Alacrity.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4-Wizard 3<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-2nd-level Wizard spells<br>\u2013Invisibility<br>\u2013Knock<br>\u2013Shadow Blade<br>\u2013Vortex Warp<br>\u2013Web<\/td><td>A level later than a single-classed Wizard, which is going to be our life from now on but that\u2019s fine, we get our 2nd-level spells.<br><br>Web is a fairly strong spell, especially when cast by someone who basically always goes first.<br><br>Invisibility is good for sneaking around and surprising foes, getting to go even more first. Or for just sneaking around.<br><br>Knock, on the other hand, is not sneaky at all because of how loud it is. But it does let us go wherever we want.<br><br>Vortex Warp means that when we go first, which is all the time, we can decide where an ally gets to start. Perhaps our Barbarian gets to start by standing on top of a slow enemy Wizard who gets to go last.<br><br>Shadow Blade is not really something we want to cast personally, but instead something we might want to use with Arcane Abeyance later.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5-Wizard 4<\/td><td>ASI: Intelligence +2 (16=&gt;18)<br><br>Spellcasting<br>-Wizard Cantrip<br>\u2013Prestidigitation<\/td><td>Better spell attacks, higher save DCs and Boosted Initiative.<br><br>Speaking of which, our Initiative modifier is now +9.<br><br>Prestidigitation is a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/prestidigitation\/#prestidigitation\">fairly useful<\/a> utility cantrip.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6-Wizard 5<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-3rd-level Wizard spells<br>\u2013Counterspell<br>\u2013Dispel Magic<br>\u2013Fly<br>\u2013Hypnotic Pattern<\/td><td>More spells. 3rd-level this time.<br><br>Counterspell and Dispel Magic are staple spells that should be in somebody\u2019s pocket.<br><br>Fly is Fly. Flying is tactically superior to walking.<br><br>Hypnotic Pattern has a similar use case to Web, but instead of leaving a lingering zone of hindrance it just Charms and Incapacitates everything in the area on initial cast. Use this spell over Web when Web would get in your party\u2019s way.<br><br>Because we now have 3rd-level spells, I\u2019ll shout out the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#summon-undead\">Tasha-style Summon spells<\/a>. With our staggered spell slots from the one Cleric level, having something that upcasts amazingly well like those Summon spells will give us great mileage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7-Wizard 6<\/td><td>Momentary Stasis<\/td><td>Momentary Stasis is sort of like a bad single-target version of Hypnotic Pattern. It does have one use case, though:<br><br>If an enemy is Concentrating and breaking their actual Concentration is hard for some reason, such as War Caster, this will break Concentration through inflicting the Incapacitated condition.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8-Wizard 7<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-4th-level Wizard spells<br>\u2013Banishment<br>\u2013Black Tentacles<br>\u2013Greater Invisibility<br>\u2013Sickening Radiance<\/td><td>4th-level spells. More save-or-sucks.<br><br>Banishment takes a target away for up to a minute with one failed Charisma save. Great when there are two big foes to deal with in a fight that we want to fight one at a time.<br><br>Black Tentacles is just the Web spell, but it beats people up when they get stuck. Pretty funny looking, too.<br><br>Greater Invisibility can be a pretty useful buff spell if we just want to have an ally beat down the battlefield with Advantage. Maybe a Rogue with sneak attack, maybe a Fighter with Action Surge.<br><br>Sickening Radiance just microwaves the battlefield. If you manage to trap creatures inside the effect, eventually the Exhaustion will just kill them no matter how many HP they have.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9-Wizard 8<\/td><td>ASI: Intelligence +2 (18=&gt;20)<\/td><td>The best spell attacks and highest of save DCs, as well as more initiative.<br><br>That Initiative modifier is now +11.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10-Wizard 9<\/td><td>Spellcasting<br>-5th-level Wizard spells<br>\u2013Hold Monster<br>\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/wall-spells\/#wall-of-force\">Wall of Force<\/a><br>\u2013<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/wall-spells\/#wall-of-stone\">Wall of Stone<\/a><\/td><td>Hold Monster is like Hold Person, but for everybody.

As the name implies, this subclass is themed around time manipulation. It manages to do a good job of sticking to the theme with its features without going too far off the rails. It\u2019s not going to start time traveling or anything like that.
