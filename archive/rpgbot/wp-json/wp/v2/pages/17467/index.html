They aren\u2019t quite clerics and they aren\u2019t quite rangers, but rather somewhere in between. And, like Clerics, they seem to be pigeon-holed into one archetype: the nature-loving hippy who would rather commune with the trees than solve human problems. There also seems to be this clear divide between what Druids consider the natural order and what they believe is civilization. It&#8217;s a very black and white way to look at things. Trees and animals good, cities bad because it turns out humans are the real monsters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This is such a limiting perspective. Humanity is just as much a part of nature as trees and animals are. We came from nature, after all, and we exploit it to create our own living space. Nature should not be at war with humanity and neither should Druids. Rather than being San from Princess Mononoke, we should be more like Ashitaka. As druids, our duty is to act as a bridge between humanity and the natural world. We are educators and mentors, guiding both humanity and nature into a sort of equilibrium. To quote <em>Movies With Mikey<\/em> \u201cHey, don\u2019t kill the thing you live on, idiot!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>When making a druid, it is important to focus on two things: <strong>What do you value about your circle\u2019s beliefs <\/strong>and <strong>what is your relationship to the natural world?<\/strong> Circles are a lot like small wilderness cults. Or a book club that takes itself way too seriously. Like cults and that annoying book club run by your office co-worker Susan, circles have structures of power. They have rules, rites, traditions, and someone to enforce them. The subclasses keep descriptions of circles somewhat vague and, as a result, most druids don\u2019t engage with their circle through the course of a campaign. While this can be the fault of a DM who doesn\u2019t know how to engage with that backstory, there are still steps which you as a player can take to make your circle more interesting. A circle is a druid\u2019s family, and how we relate to our families tells us a lot about our characters. Families disagree and argue, but they also support each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>It is also important to understand how your druid relates to the natural world. Do they feel it is something to be protected? Something that needs to be tamed? Do they see it as merely a tool to accomplish something greater? Since a druid\u2019s very identity is tied to their relationship with nature, this can\u2019t just be something you occasionally pay lip service to when you\u2019re traveling. Nature is everywhere, even in cities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A question that pops into my mind is \u201cwhy don&#8217;t we ever really see evil druids?\u201d The answer is that we are taught from a young age that the natural order is aligned with goodness. The people who guide it are good people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Nature can be brutal, however. There are natural disasters, famine, disease, decay, the predator-prey dynamic, etc. Rot and disease are as vital to nature as a pretty flower. So when making a druid, think about what aspect of nature is most important to you. Is it its brutality? Its penchant for change and growth? Its adaptability? Knowing this will tell you a lot about your druid and what they value; more than those tables you roll on for your bonds and flaws anyway. We don\u2019t have to do this alone, however. As with all classes, Druids have some great subclasses that give us a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-land\">Circle of the Land<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#what-do-you-value-about-your-circle\">What do you Value About your Circle?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-your-relationship-to-the-natural-world\">What is your Relationship to the Natural World?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-character-concept\">Example Character Concept<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#circle-of-the-moon\">Circle of the Moon<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#what-do-you-value-about-your-circle\">What do you Value About your Circle?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-your-relationship-to-the-natural-world\">What is your Relationship to the Natural World?<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-character-concept\">Example Character Concept<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-land\">Circle of the Land<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>On first glance, circle of land druids feel like the OG druid, the classic nature lover. And it can seem hard to find different concepts outside of the old cliches. Nothing could be further from the truth, however. Land offers a lot of flexibility and possibilities for your druid just based on which biome you are connected to. A druid of the desert is going to look a lot different from a druid of the mountains, and not just in the clothes they wear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-do-you-value-about-your-circle\">What do you Value About your Circle?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The lore for land druids describes them as advisors or religious leaders that help locals find harmony with nature. If all druids are mentors of some sort, land druids are the ones who teach the mentors. You can consider them as the elders of druidic teachings. They hold the secrets and traditions that guide other druids. So if you want to make a land druid, you must consider what drew your druid to join this circle in particular. A lot of that will depend on your associated land. Each land subsect under the circle at large will have different rites, different values, and different aesthetics. Let\u2019s look at some examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><em>Arctic<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An arctic circle might be a conclave of wise shamans, helping to guide their vikingesque or Goliath people to survive in the harsh wilderness up north.

You\u2019re a wood elf priest. In all seriousness though, these are classic druids. The kind from history that served as spiritual leaders for the ancient Celtic tribes. The woods provide food, shelter and medicine for all society. Forest druids could be the ones that are closest to their city kin, acting as ambassadors of the wild and medicine men\/women to their local populace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grassland<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nomadic peoples of the steppe or savannah, constantly following the herds.

They could be guardians of the swamp, gaining an infamous reputation as purveyors of hexes and curses or they could be benevolent hedge witches that the villagers seek for aid from the many illnesses that plague swamps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><em>Underdark<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is full of fascinating possibilities.You could be a hermit or a member of an old order of primitive dwarves or drow.

When talking about land druids we must ask ourselves, \u201cis that land title literal?\u201d Do land druids only care about the physical land such as plants and minerals, or do they care about the creatures in them as well? In addition to answering this question, you must also decide how your biome shapes what aspect of nature you value most. Let\u2019s take a look at some more examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><em>Arctic<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you revere nature\u2019s isolation. The arctic is very inhospitable and offers little protection from the elements. Snow storms, avalanches and much more devastating conditions are present here. Maybe the arctic is a reflection of a perfect environment unspoiled by human hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><em>Coast<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may revere nature\u2019s wrath and the life-giving properties of water.

Only when we are deprived of everything can we truly appreciate nature\u2019s humble offerings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><em>Forest<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you cherish the untamed qualities of the wild.

Moon Druids are very powerful and the ability to turn into wild beasts and elementals to embody nature\u2019s wrath is super awesome. Moon Druids offer us a lot of possibilities as their lore is pretty vague. Another question to consider when making a Moon Druid is what is your favorite animal form and why? Obviously you will pick whatever has the best stats, but on days without combat, think about what animal you retreat to for relaxation. How does it connect with you? And how does it change your perspective of the world? Someone who connects most with a tiger is going to be very different from one who enjoys the form of a rabbit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-do-you-value-about-your-circle\">What do you Value About your Circle?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Moon Druids are described as \u201cchangeable as the moon\u201d. This implies a lot of adaptability and wanderlust within the circle. Moon Druids have no need to protect one area like Land Druids might. They embody the power, the fury, and the vengeance of nature itself. Moon Druids are constantly on the move, seeking out places that require most of their attention. Their ability to turn into elementals only adds to this idea of nature\u2019s wrath. Perhaps you were angry at the destruction of the natural world, maybe you are a part of a circle of lycanthropes, or perhaps you yearn to run free with the wildcats through the savannah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-your-relationship-to-the-natural-world\">What is your Relationship to the Natural World?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As stated previously, Moon Druids value the freedom and ferocity of nature untamed.

But not all the beasts you may value will be big furry mammals. You might admire the tenacity of the dung beetle, the cunning of the water snake or the ferocity of the crocodile. Cultures throughout history personified animals and made them embodiments of certain virtues. The animals you have seen and connected to should be examined by their virtues and how they inform your worldview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-character-concept\">Example Character Concept<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Hual Hadi, Medjai<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Since time immemorial, the Medjai have stood as guardians of the desert and keepers of the ancient civilization that dwelt there millenia ago.

While no class should ever make you feel pigeonholed into one specific playstyle, Druids\u2019 versatility provides even more opportunities for exploration than most classes. A connection to nature is really the only guiding principle when it comes to Druids. Within that framework, however, we have a lot of room for expression. Nature takes many forms, not just the forest trees. It is perhaps even more complex than most humans. We often take nature for granted, but we need it more than it needs us. Consequently, we as a society need druids. Perhaps now more than ever.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Druids are a tough nut to crack.
