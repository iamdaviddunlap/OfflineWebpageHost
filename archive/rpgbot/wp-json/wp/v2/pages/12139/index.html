Each of them gives you a hybrid option for increasing a physical stat, an option to do something once per turn when you hit something with the associated damage type, and a unique bonus when you perform a critical hit with the associated damage type. The actual benefits of each feat are more and less useful, but each one does make a certain amount of thematic sense which is aesthetically pleasing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>During research for the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/genie\">Genie warlock handbook<\/a>, we found a really odd use case for one, and it got us thinking \u201chow can we optimize <em>all<\/em> of these feats?\u201d I already made a pretty good case for Piercer in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/gloom-stalker\/\">Gloom Stalker ranger handbook<\/a>, but there are definitely other great things to do with each of them that we\u2019re going to explore in this article.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Since I don\u2019t really have a better place to put this, I\u2019m going to call out something that applies to each of these feats: they say once per <em>turn<\/em> not once per <em>round<\/em>. This means that, like Sneak Attack, if you can get additional attacks outside of your turn you can apply the effects again. This includes things like the Voice of Authority feature from Order clerics, the Commander\u2019s Strike maneuver, or someone casting Haste on you, letting you attack once during your turn with the Haste action and then preparing your real action to do an attack outside of your turn. Just make sure to be so vague about the condition as to guarantee it triggers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#crusher\">Crusher<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-build-options\">Other build options:<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#piercer\">Piercer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-build-options\">Other build options:<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#slasher\">Slasher<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#other-build-options\">Other build options:<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"crusher\">Crusher<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Tyler likes things in alphabetical order, we immediately start with the strangest of the feats in this list. First off, it\u2019s the only one that offers Con instead of Dex for its hybrid ability score increase. The once per turn ability to move people is one of the few things that doesn\u2019t mention what direction you\u2019re allowed to move them in, which means that you can move them up. Moving someone 5 feet up is, by itself, not an issue. However, if you combine that with another ability that lets you move people away from you, now \u201caway from you\u201d can be further up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the single best use I can think of for this is to put it on an Elf Tempest cleric. Put Elemental Weapon (lightning) on, hit someone with the stereotypical mace, and send them 15 feet into the air. This will deal an extra d6 falling damage, which then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/basic-rules\/adventuring#Falling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">makes them prone upon landing<\/a>. This is supported by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/xgte\/dungeon-masters-tools#SimultaneousEffects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this section of Xanathar\u2019s<\/a>, which says we can choose what order to stack simultaneous effects in. Now that they\u2019re prone and next to you, you have advantage on any additional attacks you make against them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suggest a 3, 5, or 11 level multiclass into Champion Fighter to capitalize on that with extra attacks, trying to crit them so that everyone has advantage to attack them. The advantage from the feat and disadvantage from prone will cancel out for ranged attackers, leaving them no worse off than if the target was standing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The combining of simultaneous effects like that also works on a Dao genie warlock applying bludgeoning damage through their Genie\u2019s Wrath ability. That can combine with Repelling Blast for the same \u201c15 feet up\u201d trick if you start 10 feet away from them to knock them first up with Crusher and then away upward at an angle. That Dao genie feature can also add bludgeoning damage to any attack that hits, allowing them to be the only player character option I can find that will deal more than one type of physical damage on the same attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>You might be tempted to say \u201cwell that kind of makes the warlock dip an expensive opportunity cost for my martial character just to accomplish this gimmick,\u201d given that it\u2019s going to put you a level behind on your fundamental math and martial characters usually dump charisma. The one exception is a multiclass hexblade\/paladin, but you can\u2019t be both a hexblade warlock and a Dao genie warlock, much to my frustration. With that said, spell attacks are also attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Now, by default, there actually aren\u2019t any spells that require an attack roll and do slashing damage. But that sure doesn\u2019t stop a multiclassed Dao Warlock\/Scribe Wizard from making one. Scorching Ray and Cloud of Daggers are both second level spells. Scorching Ray gives you 3 attack rolls to try to hit. If any of them do, you can move the target 5 feet thanks to Crusher and apply the speed penalty from Slasher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you had difficult terrain around, perhaps from an Erupting Earth you cast in the area, you could functionally prevent most things that can\u2019t fly from moving unless they took the Dash action. If you had a friend who could also apply a movement penalty, perhaps with Ray of Frost, you could actually just make most things completely unable to move on the ground. The <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/rune-knight\/\">Rune Knight Handbook<\/a> also talks about another good use case where you grapple them so their speed is 0 and then move them around with Crusher.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>You can also, of course, use it to force people into\/through damaging area effects like spells. Since the duration of this effect from the feat is instantaneous (unlike the effect that happens on critical hits) you can even get multiple people with Crusher in one party and have them all do the same thing to one target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating an area that is hazardous to move into is already good. Creating an area that\u2019s more hazardous depending on how <em>much <\/em>you move can be very good, especially if you have multiple people in your party with this feat. Spike Growth requires concentration, but the difficult terrain from Erupting Earth doesn\u2019t. Make it very hard for people to escape and then move them back and forth over a cheese grater and enjoy dealing caltrop damage with actual plastic caltrops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to remember is that, unlike the Tempest Cleric ability which cares about absolute size, Crusher cares about relative size which is part of what makes it so good on said Rune Knight. If you are going to try to use it, look for ways to make yourself bigger so you can wrestle more things into harm\u2019s way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, remember that, in 5e, grid movement is always in discreet 5-foot increments. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s orthogonal or diagonal, moving one square is always 5 feet. Let&#8217;s pretend we have two foes standing next to each other. A and B. A and B are adjacent to each other. Therefore, if we hit A with Crusher, the square five feet above B is adjacent to A. A falls on B and they are now squeezing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/tcoe\/dungeon-masters-tools#FallingontoaCreature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B has to make a DC 15 Dex save or fall <\/a><font color=\"#2271b1\"><u>prone<\/u><\/font> because A landed on B\u2019s head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-build-options\">Other build options:<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Thor, God of hammers. Throw light hammers with strength to apply the effects at range. For added benefit, do it as a Battle Smith artificer so you can use Intelligence to attack instead and therefore add both the returning weapon infusion so you only need your one magical hammer and, also, now it\u2019s a viable choice for Elven Accuracy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>David. Do the same thing but with a sling. Since that\u2019s dex, it could also be used with Elven Accuracy and\/or Champion Fighter to good effect.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elf Monk. No melee weapons that deal bludgeoning damage have the finesse tag (which makes sense) so this is the only way to get a melee attack that works with Crusher and uses Dex to hit (to once again combine with Elven Accuracy and\/or Champion Fighter).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"piercer\">Piercer<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s relatively little to say about Piercer except that it\u2019s the mathematically best feat on this list and also the most boring. If you can fit it into a Cavalier Fighter you absolutely should because getting to reroll d12\u2019s on your lance is pretty great. You should also definitely fit it into any Assassin Rogue build. It would, in fact, be my recommendation that this be the first feat you take on such a character. It doesn\u2019t really interact with anything else in any way, although you can use the reroll portion even on dice that aren\u2019t piercing damage thanks to the wording.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>I call this out in that gloom stalker build when I say to save the reroll for the d8 from dread ambusher. That means that it will also work on, for instance, the thunder damage from a Booming Blade applied by a piercing weapon (only the initial damage, not the triggered secondary damage). Do also note that the extra die you roll on the crit doesn\u2019t specify that it has to be a weapon damage die so it, too, can be something larger if you have it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-build-options\">Other build options:<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Any rogue. While Assassin rogues are called out above, most rogues rely on piercing damage and roll a big pile of dice, and the more dice you roll the more likely it is that one of them will be a 1 in need of rerolling.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Really anything that does piercing damage, especially if it also cares about critical hits. There are many options for Dex-based attack rolls with piercing damage which makes the Elf Champion Fighter very good here too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"slasher\">Slasher<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Slasher has definitely the best on-crit effect and, if optimized for, the strongest solo effect. This is very definitely one where you\u2019d want to be an advantaged Elf Champion with accuracy and a scimitar. Or, amusingly, a whip if you want to do it with reach and don\u2019t care about damage too much. If you crit, it\u2019s actually better than the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/ancestral-guardian\/\">Ancestral Guardian<\/a> taunt or even the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/artificer\/armorer\/\">Armorer Artificer<\/a> taunt because it applies to attacks made against you as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the ability to slow something by 10 feet, when combined with other similar effects like Ray of Frost as discussed above can provide a very effective battlefield control technique. If you\u2019re able to stack that with difficult terrain then, again, perhaps even without Crusher it may be possible to hold something still just through raw movement cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Now, unfortunately, if you remember the part where I talked about attacking again out of turn to trigger the feat more than once, this one is the least good version. The speed penalty won\u2019t stack and will functionally be wasted thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dmg\/running-the-game#CombiningGameEffects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this section of the DMG<\/a>. What you <em>can<\/em> still do though is apply it to two different targets. That by itself is powerful, but it also means that, unlike the interesting things we talked about above that can happen when a whole party has the feat, in this case there\u2019s no benefit apart from being able to more easily apply it to more targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-build-options\">Other build options:<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Glaive Fighter. Apply the speed penalty from outside of their reach and then walk to a second target before waiting for something to trigger you to attack outside of your own turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kord, God of axes. Thrown handaxes can also apply the penalty, and if you do the same 3 level dip into Artificer mentioned above now you\u2019re attacking with Intelligence again and eligible for Elven Accuracy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fine, I\u2019ll do both myself. The Eldritch Knight and the Bladesinger both get the ability to make weapon attacks and cast a cantrip in the same turn. Grab a whip and cast Ray of Frost and you can apply two 10 ft. speed penalties from outside of many creatures\u2019 reach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Introduced in Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything, Crusher, Piercer, and Slasher brought a new collection of options for people who consistently do a physical damage type to add some utility when they do.
