In addition to the Barbarian&#8217;s normal rage features, you also gain the ability to grow natural weapons and eventually to gain passive adaptations like the ability to breath water and jump terrifying distances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Path of the Beast is a perfect balance of durability and damage output, allowing the Barbarian to serve as a front-line Defender without falling into the &#8220;Tank Fallacy&#8221; which plagues many other barbarian subclasses. Like the Path of the Totem Warrior, the Path of the Beast includes several decision points to customize your build, but unlike totem barbarians the Path of the Beast can change these choices either every time they rage or every time they rest, allowing the Barbarian to rapidly adapt to situations rather than just gritting their teeth and raging through whatever comes their way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Path of the Beast relies heavily on natural weapons which they produce while raging, there&#8217;s very little reason to use a two-handed weapon. Expect to spend a lot of time wearing a shield, and grab a melee weapon like a longsword to use when you&#8217;re not raging. However, since you&#8217;re going to spend most of your time attacking with natural weapons there&#8217;s typically little motivation to look for magic weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this adaptability, the Path of the Beast isn&#8217;t especially complicated and there is little fluctuation in complexity between options within the subclass. Thanks to the unusual viability of shields without cutting into damage output they&#8217;ll enjoy good damage output, high hit points, and high AC. Taken as a whole, the subclass is both easy and effective to play, making it an enticing option for both newcomers and for veterans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Path of the Beast Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-beast-ability-scores\">Path of the Beast Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-beast-races\">Path of the Beast Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-beast-feats\">Path of the Beast Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-beast-weapons\">Path of the Beast Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#path-of-the-beast-armor\">Path of the Beast Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-wrathful-leaps\">Example Build &#8211; Wrathful Leaps<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#jump-around\">Jump Around<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#jumping-now-with-damage-output\">Jumping, now with damage output<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

They are all good, but\n\t\tthey&#8217;re all good for different things at different times, so knowing which\n\t\tone to use in any given situation is important.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bite<\/span>: Bite is technically the least\n\t\t\t\timportant of the three available options, but if anyone is going to hang\n\t\t\t\tout at less than half hit points it&#8217;s the Barbarian. You can use this\n\t\t\t\twhile both of your hands are full, which makes it easy to use with a\n\t\t\t\tshield. Still, if you&#8217;re not guaranteed to benefit from the healing in\n\t\t\t\tyour current fight, go for a different option. Remember that the healing\n\t\t\t\tonly works once on each of your turns, so if you want to switch to a\n\t\t\t\tweapon for your second attack (once you get Extra Attack), that may be a\n\t\t\t\tgood idea if you have a cool magic weapon to use.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Claws<\/span>: Your go-to option for damage\n\t\t\t\toutput. The wording here is easy to miss, so let me spell it out: If you\n\t\t\t\ttake the Attack action and attack with the claws once, you get an\n\t\t\t\tadditional attack with the claws as part of the same action. You don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tneed to spend your Bonus Action to do it, so you can get the extra\n\t\t\t\tattack in the same turn that you rage. You can make all of your claw\n\t\t\t\tattacks with one hand, so there is no reason to forgo a shield.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Tail<\/span>: Longsword damage, reach, and\n\t\t\t\tboost your AC as a Reaction. The AC bonus averages to 4.5, which is\n\t\t\t\tenough to negate a lot of attacks. Unfortunately attackers need to be\n\t\t\t\twithin 10 ft. so you won&#8217;t be able to block ranged attacks typically.\n\t\t\t\tLike the other options you can use this with a shield.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bestial Soul<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to rely on\n\t\tnatural weapons, you need them to count as magical or you&#8217;re going to have a\n\t\tlot of trouble dealing damage.\n\t\t<p>This level also lets you take on some animal traits that allow you to\n\t\t\tfunction in some unusual scenarios which typically require magic. These\n\t\t\tbenefits notably work outside of your rage, so you don&#8217;t need to get angry\n\t\t\tto breath water or climb on the ceiling.<\/p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Swim Speed<\/span>: Situational, but the\n\t\t\t\tfact that you also get to breath water is really helpful. Take a nap and\n\t\t\t\tdream about weresharks, and you&#8217;ll wake up with gills and webbed toes\n\t\t\t\t(it doesn&#8217;t actually say that in the rules, but it feels like that\n\t\t\t\tshould happen).<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Climb Speed<\/span>: Climb speeds are the next\n\t\t\t\tbest thing to fly speeds, and this is basically Spider Climb, which is\n\t\t\t\tthe gold standard of climb speeds. Climb on the ceiling and hit people\n\t\t\t\twith your tail or throw javelins at them.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Jump<\/span>: Jumping is very rarely useful,\n\t\t\t\tand situations which require jumping can typically be handled better by\n\t\t\t\tclimbing or flying. Still, of all the jumping-related abilities in 5e,\n\t\t\t\tthis one is among the best. It works both vertically and horizontally,\n\t\t\t\tso you can jump incredibly high. However, it notably doesn&#8217;t address\n\t\t\t\tfalling, so if you leap 30 feet into the air you&#8217;re going to regret that\n\t\t\t\tdecision unless you grab onto something before falling since 5e doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tnegate falling damage just because you jumped.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Infectious Fury<\/span>: Tying the DC to your\n\t\tConstitution is great. Even if you started at 16 Constitution and haven&#8217;t\n\t\tgotten a chance to increase it, your DC will be decent. Using this a number\n\t\tof times per day equal to your Proficiency Bonus is enough that it can be\n\t\ttactically impactful, but it&#8217;s not something that you can afford to use\n\t\tevery turn.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Forced Attack<\/span>: Forcing enemies to\n\t\t\t\tattack their allies is great, but the benefits don&#8217;t stop there. Since\n\t\t\t\tthis forces the target to use their Reaction, they can&#8217;t perform an\n\t\t\t\tOpportunity Attack and they can&#8217;t do annoying things like cast\n\t\t\t\tCounterspell so if your target&#8217;s melee attacks are pitiful you could\n\t\t\t\tforce them to attack you for whatever measly damage they might do in\n\t\t\t\torder to prevent spellcasters from doing cast shenanigans.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Damage<\/span>: 2d12 damage is enough\n\t\t\t\tto match a single attack from many creatures, but as you reach higher\n\t\t\t\tlevels you&#8217;ll face many enemies which can do considerably more so you&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\tget more out of the forced attack. However, the forced attack doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\thelp in single-enemy encounters, and even in multi-enemy encounters you\n\t\t\t\twon&#8217;t always have another enemy nearby which you can target with the\n\t\t\t\tforced the attack. The damage is psychic, and very few creatures are\n\t\t\t\tresistant or immune to psychic damage, so this is a safe, reliable\n\t\t\t\tdamage boost, but remember that this has a daily usage limit so don&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tburn through it too quickly. The damage is also from a separate source\n\t\t\t\tfrom your attack, so it&#8217;s not multiplied on a critical hit.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Call of the Hunt<\/span>: The benefits to you\n\t\tscale based on the number of creatures that accept the benefit. There is no\n\t\tdownside to the effect, so assume that your party is going to accept. The\n\t\tmaximum number of creatures is your Constitution Modifier, which can get up\n\t\tto +7 at level 20, so you need to somehow get 7 creatures to accept the\n\t\teffect. A typical party of 4 can&#8217;t do that unless you add familiars, pets,\n\t\tsummons, or a bag full of angry rats. The pile of temporary hit points on\n\t\ttop of the damage resistances provided by Rage will make you incredibly\n\t\tdurable, and the d6 bonus damage for your allies will be a nice boost to\n\t\tdamage output for anyone who relies on attack rolls (fighters, monks, and\n\t\twarlocks are ideal).\n\t\t<p>The wording on the damage bonus is strange, but the effect is actually\n\t\t\treally simple. Affected creatures deal +1d6 damage when they hit with an\n\t\t\tattack. It doesn&#8217;t specify a type, so they add bonus damage of the same\n\t\t\ttype which their attack deals. If their attack deals multiple types, the\n\t\t\tattack can typically decide which type to add but the DM might choose to\n\t\t\thave it divide evenly between the multiple damage types. The weird wording\n\t\t\tof the damage bonus seems to mean that the d6 isn&#8217;t multiplied on a\n\t\t\tcritical hit since they gain a bonus equal to a roll of the d6 rather than\n\t\t\tadding 1d6 as &#8220;extra damage&#8221; like Hunter&#8217;s Mark or Divine Smite do.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You can only use this a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus\n\t\t\teach day, but by the time you get this your Proficiency Bonus and your\n\t\t\tnumber of rages per day match, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about tracking\n\t\t\tthis unless you somehow gain additional rages per day.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"path-of-the-beast-ability-scores\">Path of the Beast Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Path of the Beast&#8217;s ability score needs match those of other barbarians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: Hit stuff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dex<\/span>: Don&#8217;t get hit by stuff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Con<\/span>: Survive getting hit by stuff.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Int<\/span>: Dump.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Wisdom saves are common, so don&#8217;t\n\tdump it, but don&#8217;t put a ton of effort into improving it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cha<\/span>: Charisma only matters for a couple of\n\tthe Barbarian&#8217;s skills, but it&#8217;s fine to dump this, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Point Buy<\/th><th>Standard Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"path-of-the-beast-races\">Path of the Beast Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Path of the beast&#8217;s race needs are fairly typical for the Barbarian, so the advice provided in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11724\">Barbarian Races Breakdown<\/a> should suffice.

Three levels gets you a subclass (long death or mercy are your best options), and 4 levels gets you an ASI and Slow Fall so you can jump crazy distances into the air and get hurt less. You do get something good at each of those levels, but level 1 is by far the most impactful.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-wrathful-leaps\">Example Build &#8211; Wrathful Leaps<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This build is going to be somewhat silly.

Weird. We can also get two more from the Primal Knowledge Optional Class Feature and we&#8217;ll get on more when we take Skill Expert, giving us a total of 7 skills (9 with Optional Class Features).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get proficiency in two musical instruments and a language. This is a weird setup for a barbarian.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll take Skill Expert to get Expertise in Athletics and proficiency in Insight. If you&#8217;re not planning to grapple and aren&#8217;t enjoying all this jumping nonsense, the advice on feats in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/#feats\" data-type=\"page\">Barbarian Handbook<\/a> should help. This also gets us a +1 to an ability score, allowing us to stay on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2691\">Fundamental Math<\/a> by raising our odd-numbered Strength score.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also take the Tough feat. <\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"jump-around\">Jump Around<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Crash course on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/adventuring#Jumping\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/adventuring#Jumping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jumping<\/a>: How high or far you can jump is based purely on your Strength. No Athletics, no height, nothing. If you move 10 feet immediately before jumping, you can go further\/higher, but that&#8217;s basically all. Technically your height can extend how high you can reach, but that&#8217;s rarely important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most characters the only things that will improve your ability to jump are magic items and spells. The spell Jump (potentially cast from a Ring of Jumping) and Boots of Striding and Springing are your most likely choices. Either will triple your jump distance. Both together will multiply your jump distance 9 times because they&#8217;re coming from different sources and 5e doesn&#8217;t have rules around multiplicative stacking like previous editions did. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two magic items which require attunement (Ring of Jumping and boots of Striding and Springing) is a big commitment of resources for a gimmick, so you&#8217;re likely only going to use one. Given the choice, get the boots because you don&#8217;t have to constantly spend a Bonus Action to cast a spell (which you couldn&#8217;t do while raging anyway).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we add what makes Path of the Beast so good at jumping: Bestial Soul (Jumping) allows us to add the result of an Athletics check to our jump distance or height. Normally your jump height is 3+Strength mod (max of 8 for most characters) with a running jump. Add the result of an Athletics check in feet and you can go pretty high. Like, high enough that falling damage becomes a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, just to make things crazier, add the Satyr&#8217;s Mirthful leaps. That gives us another d8. Then triple all of that from our magic item. Nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that gets us into a weird situation where we may actually run out of movement. You can only jump as far as you have movement, so if your speed is 30 feet you can only jump 30 feet in one turn before landing or falling. If you Dash, you can double your pool of movement and therefore how far you can jump. Increases to your speed (such as the Barbarian&#8217;s Fast Movement) will also improve how far you can jump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s set an objective: We want to be able to jump our full move distance vertically as a standing jump on the worst possible dice rolls. That allows our satyr barbarian to jump their full 40 ft. move speed vertically, potentially allowing us to do silly things like grabbing enemies out of the air, jumping atop castle walls, redecorating ceilings, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start from a standing high jump. With 18 Strength, that gets us 3.5 feet off the ground as our base. Add the minimum of 1 from Mirthful Leaps. Add +1 for the d20 +7 for our Athletics modifier (at level 6 we&#8217;ll have +4 Str, +3 Proficiency), and that gets us to a minimum of 12.5 feet of vertical jumping. Adding Expertise adds another +3, getting us to 15.5 feet minimum standing high jump distance. With a magic item tripling that, we immediately hit our cap, but even without an item we&#8217;ll hit 30.5 feet on average rolls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s at level 6. We probably don&#8217;t even need that item, so you might look for a Ring of Feather Falling instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we take those same assumptions, you can standing long jump 9 feet with 18 Strength. Add the minimum of 1 for Mirthful Leaps and 1 for the d20 on your Athletics check, then add +10 for our Athletics modifier thanks to Expertise, and we&#8217;re at 21 feet. That&#8217;s easily enough to get over most pits and most difficult terrain. With average rolls on the dice, that&#8217;s 34 feet, already almost maxing out our jump distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we&#8217;re lucky enough to reach level 20, we&#8217;ll have a Proficiency Bonus of +6 and a +7 Strength modifier. With Expertise in Athletics, our minimum jump height is 26 feet, more than doubling our minimum standing high jump height at level 6. Average rolls get us to 39 feet, almost exactly maxing out our jump distance without dashing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize: If you take Skill Expert to get Expertise in Athletics, a satyr beast barbarian can almost max out their high and long jump distances on average dice rolls before applying a magic item. If you do find an item you don&#8217;t need to roll unless you&#8217;re going to Dash because tripling your minimum roll will max out your movement.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"jumping-now-with-damage-output\">Jumping, now with damage output<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The rules for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/phb\/combat#Grappling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moving a grapple<\/a> state that \u201cwhen you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved.\u201d This certainly applies to walking, flying, swimming, and climbing, so I see no reason why you couldn\u2019t do it with grappling. If you halve your speed, I\u2019m reasonably certain that you can jump while grappling, drop your target mid-air, then both fall to the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With halved speed, that gets you 20 feet into the air and allows you to drop your target for 2d6 damage. They\u2019ll take damage and fall prone, but you\u2019ll release the grapple to pull this off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also take damage from this, and creatures that take falling damage fall prone. You\u2019ll halve this damage thanks to Rage, but if you roll 2d6 falling damage you\u2019re still taking a minimum of 1 damage. If you find a Ring of Feather Falling, this suddenly stops being a problem. The spell Enhance Ability (Dexterity) prevents damage from falling up to 20 feet, which is enough for our purposes but might be a hard ask from your party\u2019s spellcasters. You could take 4 levels in monk for Slow Fall, but if you\u2019re multiclassing into monk for Slow Fall your life has gone <em>far<\/em> off the rails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Rage<br>Unarmored Defense<\/td><td><p>For your starting gear, take a warhammer (use it two-handed for now), two handaxes, and the explorer&#8217;s pack and javelins.
