However, the presence of the Cantrip True Strike allows you to focus on Intelligence, which supports your spellcasting at the cost of anything related to Dexterity, including your AC. The advice in this article will attempt to cater to both Dexterity-focused and Intelligence-focused builds, but be sure to read the individual spell assessments rather than blindly picking blue-rated options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Arcane Tricksters can only replace a single prepared spell each time that you\n\tgain a Rogue level, and you can prepare a maximum of 13 spells at level 20.\n\tThis means that choosing effective spells is crucial, especially late in your\n\tcareer when you&#8217;ll have little time to correct a poor choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This article primarily caters to Arcane Trickster Rogues, but other martial\n\tcharacters with the Magic Initiate feat may also find it helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#shillelagh\">Rogues and Attack Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells\">Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#arcane-trickster-rogue-cantrips\">Arcane Trickster Rogue Cantrips<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-1\">Level 1 Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-2\">Level 2 Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-3\">Level 3 Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-4\">Level 4 Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

This means that Cantrips\n\tlike Fire Bolt don&#8217;t work, but spells which call for a Weapon Attack like\n\tBooming Blade and True Strike all work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martial spellcasters often need to choose between using attack Cantrips or\n\tusing Extra Attack, and the math there can become complicated. However, Rogues\n\tdon&#8217;t get Extra Attack. Unless you&#8217;re relying on fighting with two weapons,\n\tusing a Cantrip is an easy boost to your attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Rogue&#8217;s damage output comes primarily from Sneak Attack, missing a single attack can be devastating. Rolling a second d20, either from Advantage or from a second attack roll, boosts your average damage per round (DPR) by as much as 50%. Using a Cantrip means that you can&#8217;t use a Nick weapon to make a second attack during your Attack action. Instead, consider Vex weapons like hand crossbows and rapiers, and use stealth or Steady Aim to get Advantage on your first attack against a new target.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Arcane Trickster Rogue Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcane-trickster-rogue-cantrips\">Arcane Trickster Rogue Cantrips<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul id=\"Cantrips\">\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Acid Splash<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Rogues are\n\t\tat their best when they&#8217;re focused on dealing big damage to single targets.\n\t\tAcid Splash won&#8217;t help you with that.
