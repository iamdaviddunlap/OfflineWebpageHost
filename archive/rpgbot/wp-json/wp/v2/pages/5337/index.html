Over two years after publishing Occult Adventures, the Spiritualist class has a number of extremely obvious errors in its text. They&#8217;ve been pointed out on the Paizo forums, and the designers have apparently publicly discussed corrections, but there has been no errata made to formally correct the issues. Because of these issues, several mechanics make it unclear how to determine the Phantom&#8217;s armor class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phantoms are the central mechanic of the Spiritualist class. They share a lot of concepts and mechanics with similar creatures like Animal Companions and Eidolons, but they have a handful of unique mechanics which can make them difficult to understand and difficult to optimize.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"where-is-my-phantom\">Where is my phantom?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Phantom can exist in a number of states. Moving the phantom between states is an important mechanic, and it&#8217;s important to know where your Phantom is at all times.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"banished-to-the-ethereal-plane\">Banished to the Ethereal Plane<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>If the Phantom is slain or hit with a spell like Banishment, it can be banished to the Ethereal Plane. The only way to return the Phantom is to spend one minute performing the ritual to manifest the Phantom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain circumstances, such as the Phantom being destroyed or the Spiritualist being slain, add a 24-hour timer before the Phantom can be manifested again. This is a scary time for the Spiritualist, so avoid it whenever you can.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"confined-in-your-consciousness\">Confined in Your Consciousness<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>A Spiritualist can confine their Phantom using a standard action while the Phantom is manifested. Being confined in this way protects both the Spiritualist (See the &#8220;Shared Consciousness&#8221; class feature) and the Phantom. The Spiritualist gets some helpful mental defenses, and the Phantom can&#8217;t be banished, destroyed, or otherwise harmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you reach 3rd level, Bonded Manifestation lets you partially manifest your confined Phantom for a few rounds per day.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"manifested\">Manifested<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Your Phantom is most useful while Manifested, so expect to spend most of your time in this state or trying to get to it. For more, see &#8220;Full Manifestation Forms&#8221;, below.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"full-manifestation-forms\">Full Manifestation Forms<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your phantom can manifest as Ectoplasmic or Ethereal. Each is useful for different things. Ectoplasmic is your primary combat option, and includes useful things like DR for your Phantom. Ethereal is better for sneaking, spying, and delivering touch spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole list of differences between options is spread throughout the Spiritualist class description, so I&#8217;ve compiled a summary into the table below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>Class Feature<\/th><th>Ectoplasmic<\/th><th>Ethereal<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><th>Etheric Tether<\/th><td>50 ft., but can stretch to 100 ft. by concentrating as a full-round action<\/td><td>50 ft. and line of effect, but can leave for 1 round per Spiritualist level<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Spiritual Interference<\/th><td>+2 shield bonus to her Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on her saving throws<\/td><td>+2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects<\/td><\/tr><tr><th>Greater Spiritual Interference<\/th><td>each ally gains a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws.

See the table below for Small or Large phantoms.<\/td><\/tr><\/tfoot><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"size\">Size<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Phantoms are the same size as their Spiritualist by default, but small Spiritualists can also have medium Phantoms. You want the biggest spirit possible to get as much slam damage as possible, so you almost always want a medium Phantom.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"starting-statistics\">Starting Statistics<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>All phantoms start from this basic stat block, much like animal companions each start from an animal-specific stat block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong>Starting Statistics: Type<\/strong> Outsider (phantom); <strong>Size<\/strong> As spiritualist or one size category smaller (or one size category larger, if the spiritualist is Small or smaller); <strong>Speed<\/strong> 30 ft.; <strong>AC<\/strong> +2 dodge (in incorporeal form) or +2 natural armor (in ectoplasmic form); <strong>Attack<\/strong> 2 slams (1d6 or 1d4 if size Small); <strong>Ability Scores<\/strong> Str 12, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 13.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You may notice that the AC section lists &#8220;+2 dodge (in incorporeal form)&#8221;. This is the base AC bonus your Phantom gets, and the &#8220;Armor Bonus&#8221; which the Phantom gains as you gain levels (see the table above) adds to this base bonus. Your Phantom starts with a AC of just 14, so it&#8217;s going to extremely vulnerable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also take note of the Phantom&#8217;s ability scores. With the exception of Anger Phantoms, they don&#8217;t have enough Strength for Power Attack. Expect to spend your Phantom&#8217;s first Ability Increase (Spiritualist level 5) on Strength so that you can get Power Attack and do some damage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"phantom-skills\">Phantom Skills<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Phantoms get two skill ranks per hit die, and since they don&#8217;t get hit dice every level I strongly recommend picking two skills and sticking to them as much as possible. Phantoms also get free ranks in two other skills depending on your choice of Emotional Focus, so your Phantom can have four maxed-out skills in total.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bluff<\/span> (Cha): Phantoms don&#8217;t get enough\n\t\tranks to keep it relevant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Fly<\/span> (Dex): One rank is plenty.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Phantoms don&#8217;t get enough\n\t\tranks to keep it relevant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (Planes)<\/span> (Int): With 7\n\t\tIntelligence your Phantom isn&#8217;t going to do much good.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): The most-rolled skill in\n\t\tthe game.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sense Motive<\/span> (Wis): 10 Wisdom isn&#8217;t a\n\t\tgreat basis for Sense Motive and Phantoms don&#8217;t get enough ranks to keep it\n\t\trelevant.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stealth<\/span> (Dex): Sending your Phantom to\n\t\tsneak around can be a really good idea since it can move through walls.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"emotional-focus\">Emotional Focus<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your choice of Emotional Focus is a bit like choosing an animal for an animal companion, in that it defines the Phantom&#8217;s appearance and capabilities. But unlike animal companions, Phantoms develop new capabilities as you increase in level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-green\">Anger<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Anger is a great baseline against which to measure other Emotional Foci options. It&#8217;s a great offensive option, and its emphasis on Strength and Power Attack makes it easy to build and play in a manner that will contribute meaningfully to the party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Your Phantom isn&#8217;t a face, so\n\tIntimidate won&#8217;t see a lot of use unless you plan to have your Phantom\n\tDemoralize things. Survival might be useful situationally.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Good Saves<\/span>: The two most important saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Strength Focus<\/span>: Strength is better for\n\tdamage, but your Phantom&#8217;s AC is going to be a problem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Powerful Strike<\/span> (Ex): The size difference\n\twon&#8217;t matter much until you&#8217;ve got enough levels for the damage gap to widen,\n\tbut Power Attack for free is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Fury<\/span> (Su): The basic abuse case for\n\tthis is to turn it on as a swift action, have your Phantom attack, then end\n\tthe effect as a free action at the end of your turn. But if your party\n\toutnumbers your enemies, or if your enemies have problematically high AC,\n\tleave this running.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ferocious Mien<\/span> (Su): Making your Phantom\n\tbigger and adding Rage will be a big boost to damage, but its AC is going to\n\tdrop by a total of 4, so be prepared for it to take a lot of damage at the\n\tsame time.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Furious Wail<\/span> (Su): AOE save-or-die once per\n\tday as a spell-like ability. By 17th level your Phantom will have 20 Charisma,\n\tso the save DC starts at a respectable 21 and and maxes out at 22 at 18th\n\tlevel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-orange\">Dedication<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Dedication is a sort of defensive support option. It has almost nothing to boost its offensive options, most of its abilities are passive, and all together it&#8217;s a fairly bland option. Still, the combination of Defending Aura and Greater Spiritual Interference can provide an excellent set of defensive bonuses to the Spiritualist and their party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Your Phantom isn&#8217;t likely to serve\n\tas your party&#8217;s Face, so I don&#8217;t see these skills getting use much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Good Saves<\/span>: Will is the most important\n\tsaving throw, and Iron Will will further supplement it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Iron Will<\/span>: A nice improvement to your\n\tPhantom&#8217;s defenses, but it won&#8217;t help you actively accomplish anything.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dutiful Strike<\/span> (Su): Some bonus to hit and\n\tsome extra damage, but it requires enemies to target the Spiritualist first.\n\tYou should generally do as much as possible to avoid being targeted, which can\n\tmake this difficult.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Defending Aura<\/span> (Su): +2 Deflection bonus to\n\tAC is great, but that +2 typeless bonus to saving throws is spectacular. This\n\tshould never be turned off.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Devoted Servant<\/span> (Su): The Phantom stays\n\tmanifested as long as you are unaware, which means that it goes away once the\n\tsurprise round ends or you wake up or whatever.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Steadfast Devotion<\/span> (Su): The listed\n\teffects are all extremely rare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-green\">Despair<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On its own, Despair doesn&#8217;t do much. It&#8217;s good add applying debuffs to enemies (especially their saving throws), but can&#8217;t follow that up in any meaningful way. Paired with a spellcaster, especially a dedicated save-or-suck caster, Despair is a truly horrifying problem for your enemies. Aura of Despair and Despairing shout can apply a total of -4 to enemies saving throws which can stack with Shaken, Sickened, and other debuffs to make enemies extremely vulnerable to even the weakest spells DCs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Sneak up on enemies and demoralize\n\tthem so you can benefit from Power of Despair.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Good Saves<\/span>: The two most important saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Power from Despair<\/span>: Fear stacking is a\n\tgreat strategy, but the Despair Phantom don&#8217;t get a way to trigger these\n\tbonuses until 7th level. It may be a good idea to invest Intimidate so that\n\tyour Spiritualist can demoralize enemies before your Phantom attacks them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Miserable Strike<\/span> (Su): This will help keep\n\tyour Phantom alive.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Aura of Despair<\/span> (Su): Automatically trigger\n\tPower of Despair, and -2 to saving throws makes enemies more vulnerable to\n\tsave-or-suck effects. Combine this with Shaken and enemies become extremely\n\tvulnerable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Despairing Shout<\/span> (Su): All the penalties of\n\tShaken, but targets aren&#8217;t actually Shaken. That&#8217;s useful because the two sets\n\tof penalties will stack, but it also means that you can&#8217;t move Shaken\n\tcreatures down the Fear progression. The DC scales as you gain levels, which\n\tmeans that it will remain useful.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Inescapable Despair<\/span> (Su): Nice, and it will\n\tcut down on rolls at the table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Fear<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fear, to no one&#8217;s surprise, emphasizes fear mechanics. Fear Stacking is a great strategy, and the Feat Phantom is a great way to use it. Expect to spend a lot of time chasing down fleeing enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: Ambushing enemies is great, but\n\tdon&#8217;t expect to use Intimidate much.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Good Saves<\/span>: Will is the most important\n\tsave.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Stealthy<\/span>: Your Phantom will be really good\n\tat Stealth, but not much else.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Horrifying Strike<\/span> (Ex): Going straight to\n\tShaken is great, and sets up the Spiritualist and the rest of their party to\n\ttake advantage of Fear Stacking. This effect won&#8217;t stack with itself, but\n\tshould stack with other fear effects such as Increase Fear.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Increase Fear<\/span> (Su): A great follow-up to\n\tHorrifying Strike.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Frightful Attack<\/span> (Su): Combined with\n\tIncrease Fear you can take enemies to Panicked in a single turn.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shelter Allies<\/span> (Su): By this level fear\n\timmunity can be achieved by a long list of other methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-green\">Hatred<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hatred emphasis single-target damage. It&#8217;s more complicate than Anger, but it fills the same role in the party. Hatred eventually gets Sneak Attack, so it&#8217;s most useful in a party where it has someone to flank with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Skills<\/span>: Perception is always good.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Good Saves<\/span>: Fortitude is good, but as good\n\tas Will.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: Phantoms increase in\n\tDexterity, but not Strength, so Weapon Finesse is a great feat for your\n\tPhantom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hated Target<\/span> (Su): Using your move action\n\tis hard because you won&#8217;t get the Phantom&#8217;s second slam on the round you do\n\tit, but the bonuses are good and scale with level. Switching to a Swift action\n\tat 7th level makes this much better.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Hateful Aura<\/span> (Su): This won&#8217;t be a ton of\n\tdamage, but it&#8217;s a nice deterrent.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sneak Attack<\/span> (Su): If you have someone to\n\tflank with your Phantom, this could be a significant damage boost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shared Hatred<\/span> (Su): A nice boost, and it\n\tgets better if you have more allies in the party or if you have allies who\n\trely on large numbers of attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-blue\">Jealousy<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Jealousy is your best option for a Defender Phantom. Phantoms have terrible AC and their hit points won&#8217;t keep up with a real fighter, but Jealousy includes some great taunt mechanics which compel enemies to focus their attacks on the Phantom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Appraise? Really?<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Good Saves<\/span>: Will is the most important\n\tsave.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Deceitful<\/span>: Your Phantom is not your party&#8217;s\n\tFace.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jealous Combatant<\/span> (Su): Taunt mechanics are\n\trare, and this will really help your Phantom hold enemies&#8217; attention.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Resentful Aura<\/span> (Su): This is a really neat\n\tability. At low levels, staggering a foe won&#8217;t do much because relatively few\n\tcreatures rely on full attacks. But as you increase in level it will become\n\tmore important. It also builds on the jealousy theme to serve as a secondary\n\tmechanic to force enemies to focus on your Phantom.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Retribution<\/span> (Su): 2d8 is a nice damage\n\tboost, but you should do your absolute best to never need this ability.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mine to Take<\/span> (Su): Once per day you can\n\tredirect something that&#8217;s probably going to kill you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"rating-green\">Zeal<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Zeal is an offensive support option. Aside from Ruthless Combatant it doesn&#8217;t have any directly offensive options, so it fits best into a party that can already deal damage reliably on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Skills<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Good Saves<\/span>: Fortitude is good, but as good\n\tas Will.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Tracking<\/span>: Too situational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Ruthless Combatant<\/span> (Su): Two attacks with\n\t19-20 (and eventually x3) crits is nice, but it&#8217;s not going to make a huge\n\tdifference. If your Phantom takes Improved Critical, 17-20&#215;3 could be really\n\tscary.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Determination Aura<\/span> (Su): Competence bonuses\n\tto attack rolls are fairly common (though not as common as Morale) so they may\n\tnot stack if you have support characters in the party, but competence bonuses\n\tto saving throws are very rare.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Steadfast Servant<\/span> (Su): Without this you&#8217;re\n\tbasically worthless overnight, and your Phantom goes away if you&#8217;re hit with\n\tSleep or something along those lines.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Zeal&#8217;s Resolve<\/span> (Su): Rerolls are always\n\tfantastic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Phantoms Before you read further, a warning: Prepare to be frustrated. Over two years after publishing Occult Adventures, the Spiritualist class has a number of extremely obvious errors in its text. They&#8217;ve been pointed out on the Paizo forums, and the designers have apparently publicly discussed corrections, but there has been no errata made to formally correct the issues. Because of these issues, several mechanics make it unclear how to determine the Phantom&#8217;s armor class. Phantoms are the central mechanic of the Spiritualist class. They share a lot of concepts and mechanics with similar creatures like Animal Companions and Eidolons,
