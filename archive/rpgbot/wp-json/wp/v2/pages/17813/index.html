The Aberrant Mind subclass is on the stronger end of Sorcerers, behind Clockwork Soul and close to Lunar Sorcery, while distinctly ahead of the rest of the choices that lack bonus known spells. Their powers derive from Aberrations and the homeland of these bizarre creatures: the Far Realm. This is expressed in one of their later features, Revelation in Flesh, which directly borrows the physiological traits of several Aberrations. When you put these together, you get an incredibly versatile, unsettling, and powerful Sorcerer, capable of being equally at home as a highly-tuned Striker or a strong battlefield Controller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Released as part of the trio of Psionic subclasses, WoTC didn\u2019t want to give Sorcerers yet another resource to manage (considering spell slots and sorcery points to already be enough), so, rather than try to stuff a psychic die in somewhere, they just gave them the power to cast spells <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/EMBb_tPPA8E?t=22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">by will alone<\/a>. This makes them incredibly resource-efficient on an already very efficient class, and, depending on your interpretations of some of the rules of the subclass, able to take these powers and use them on even more powerful spells than were originally given to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Aberrant Mind Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#aberrant-mind-ability-scores\">Aberrant Mind Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#aberrant-mind-races\">Aberrant Mind Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#aberrant-mind-feats\">Aberrant Mind Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#aberrant-mind-weapons\">Aberrant Mind Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#aberrant-mind-armor\">Aberrant Mind Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-akorian-herald-of-the-abolithid\">Example Build &#8211; Akorian, Herald of the Abolithid<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Not everything on the list is a\n\t\t\tgem, of course, and be sure to check my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/spells\">Warlock Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\t\tand my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/spells\">Wizard Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor details on the spells borrowed from other spell lists.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Slightly less obvious: this adds a total of 10 known leveled spells to\n\t\t\tyour sorcerer (Mind Sliver is buried in the 1st-level spells on the table,\n\t\t\tand it&#8217;s a cantrip). A 20th-level sorcerer typically knows just 15 spells,\n\t\t\tso this is a massive increase. Even at level 1, you know twice as many\n\t\t\tspells as a typical sorcerer, plus you get an additional cantrip.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Third, and easiest to overlook, is the retraining mechanic. The Sorcerer\n\t\t\tcan already retrain one known spell every time they gain a level, but\n\t\t\tPsionic Spells also allows you to retrain the spells granted by the\n\t\t\tfeature. Surprisingly, you can choose from the sorcerer, warlock, and\n\t\t\twizard spell lists, though you&#8217;re limited to divination and enchantment\n\t\t\tspells. Of course, there are plenty of excellent divination and\n\t\t\tenchantment options (Hex is tempting at early levels), so that&#8217;s not a\n\t\t\tproblem. Trade in spells that you&#8217;re not benefiting from as you gain\n\t\t\tlevels, especially since divination options are often useful long after\n\t\t\ttheir spell level stops being defining in combat.<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: Two decent low-level\n\t\t\t\tdamage options, and the absolutely phenomenal Mind Sliver. I recommend\n\t\t\t\tretraining Arms of Hadar after a few levels, but you might enjoy\n\t\t\t\tDissonant Whispers as an inexpensive way to force enemies to remove\n\t\t\t\tthemselves from grapples and\/or to provoke opportunity attacks.\n<p>Replacing either of these spells with Silvery Barbs makes that spell eligible for Psionic Sorcery. Even though it would cost a reaction, using it on our own save-or-suck spells would be like getting to use Heighten for only 1 Sorcery Point.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">3rd Level<\/span>: Two options with\n\t\t\t\tsituational uses. Detect Thoughts is difficult for spellcasters that\n\t\t\t\taren&#8217;t Intelligence-based, so consider retraining it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: Hunger of Hadar is an\n\t\t\t\texcellent AOE damage and area control option, and I&#8217;ve eyed it jealously\n\t\t\t\tfrom other spellcasting classes since 5e&#8217;s initial release. Sending is\n\t\t\t\tneat but not crucial, so you might retrain it, especially once you have\n\t\t\t\tlong-distance teleportation available at higher levels.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">7th Level<\/span>: Black Tentacles is a good\n\t\t\t\tspell, but it does less damage and has a smaller AOE than Hunger of\n\t\t\t\tHadar, and also doesn&#8217;t scale with spell level, so there&#8217;s a lot of\n\t\t\t\tredundancy between the two that the Sorcerer can&#8217;t justify. I recommend\n\t\t\t\tpicking one of the two to keep and retraining the other. Summon\n\t\t\t\tAberration is one of the new summon options presented in Tasha&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tCauldron of Everything, and it&#8217;s pretty good, offering three very\n\t\t\t\teffective choices to suit your needs.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Two excellent utility\n\t\t\t\toptions. Rary\u2019s Telepathic Bond feels like a weird choice since you get\n\t\t\t\tTelepathic Speech at first level, but Telepathic Speech is extremely\n\t\t\t\tlimited so Rary\u2019s Telepathic Bond is a big upgrade.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Telepathic Speech<\/span>: A useful utility, but\n\t\tvery limited compared to most forms of telepathy. You can communicate, but\n\t\tyou still need to share a language, the duration is short, and you can only\n\t\tconnect to one creature. That&#8217;s enough to send your party&#8217;s Scout off on\n\t\ttheir own with a way to remain in contact, but beyond stealth and subtlety\n\t\tthere are few meaningful ways to use this.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Psionic Sorcery<\/span>: This saves you one or\n\t\ttwo Sorcery Points (depending on the spell level) when you spend Sorcery\n\t\tPoints to get extra spell slots. You also don&#8217;t need to spend the Bonus\n\t\tAction to convert Sorcery Points into spell slots first. You also get to\n\t\tcast the spell without verbal or somatic components (and some material\n\t\tcomponents), so you get the benefits of Subtle Spell for free.\n\t\t<p>It&#8217;s not perfectly clear how this works if you retrained the spells from\n\t\t\tPsionic Spells. This definitely applies to the default spells that you\n\t\t\tget, but I&#8217;m not sure otherwise. I think RAW it works with retrained\n\t\t\tspells since you still get those spells from the feature, but keep an eye\n\t\t\tout for Sage Advice or Errata, and check with your DM until then.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Defenses<\/span>: Psychic damage is rare,\n\t\tbut charm and fear effects are very common.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Revelation in Flesh<\/span>: For a single Sorcery\n\t\tPoint, every one of these effects is excellent. Replicating any of these is\n\t\tat least a 2nd-level spell, so the effects aren&#8217;t just good, they&#8217;re very\n\t\tcost-efficient. Note that since the fly and swim speeds are based on your\n\t\twalking speed, it&#8217;s easy to boost your new movement speed with buffs like\n\t\tLongstrider or Haste.\n\t\t<p>Personal note: Tyler finds the term &#8220;writhing sensory tendrils&#8221; upsetting.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warping Implosion<\/span>: Great for setting up\n\t\tcombos with Quicken Spell. Follow this with a quickened AOE damage spell\n\t\tlike Meteor Swarm or area control spell like Force Cage and you can\n\t\teliminate whole encounters in one turn even at this high level. The saving\n\t\tthrow is Strength, though, and with the exceptions of enemies who rely on\n\t\tmagic in combat many enemies will have high Strength saves.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"aberrant-mind-ability-scores\">Aberrant Mind Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Identical to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#ability-scores\">Sorcerer Handbook<\/a>.

Other than that, typical tactics apply: hang near the edge of fights, cantrip most of the time, throw a Sleep as needed, and survive for a few levels.<br><br>For equipment, take whatever you like that includes a focus.&nbsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Retrain Spell:<br>Arms of Hadar -&gt; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\">Silvery Barbs<\/a><br><br>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Shield<br><br>Font of Magic<\/td><td>This guide has already talked at length about why Silvery Barbs is excellent on this subclass and particularly by acquiring it through Psionic Spells and its option to retrain the listed spells.

Counterspell is tempting, but we\u2019re often going to be spending our Reaction on Silvery Barbs, so hesitate a moment before picking it up. Haste could be good, but we didn\u2019t pick up Twinned Spell, so now is not the time. Our preference, then, is to take Fly if we\u2019re allowed the freedom.&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, the DM-aggravating magical cell phone (Sending) gets turned into a pseudo-Dominate.<br><br>All of these pale in comparison to the big thing at this level: directly spending Sorcery Points for spellcasting. We\u2019ve gone on at length about how good it is with one spell already, but it\u2019s also great for the fact that they require no verbal or somatic components as if we\u2019d used Subtle (but can still be modified by other metamagic). Putting a Hold Person on someone with just the power of your thoughts means they\u2019ll have no way of knowing it was you if they pass the save.

Their powers derive from Aberrations and the homeland of these bizarre creatures: the Far Realm.
