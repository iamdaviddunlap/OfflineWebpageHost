They are durable, have great armor, and provide plenty of damage\n\toutput. Fighters get more Ability Score Increases than any other class,\n\tallowing them to easily explore feats without sacrificing crucial ability\n\tscores. They also notably get more attacks than any other class, which can be\n\ta lot of fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Fighters are a great example of &#8220;opt-in complexity&#8221; in DnD 5e. The core of the class is very simple, but the complexity of the subclasses varies significantly. The <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/champion\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"18413\">Champion<\/a> adds almost no complexity, while subclasses like the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/eldritch-knight\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"15923\">Eldritch Knight<\/a> can add quite a bit. This makes the Fighter a great choice for players of all experience levels and for players with a broad range of preferences, allowing you to build a character that you find mechanically appealing but without making it more work than you might like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For players totally new to DnD or to tabletop RPGs in general, the Champion Fighter is among the simplest characters in the game and is a great way to learn if you&#8217;re nervous about learning the game&#8217;s mechanics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Feats and class options allow for Fighters to fill a variety of roles, including as a Defender and a Striker, and Fighters work with a variety of interesting builds. A bit of work allows the Fighter to also serve as a Face (Purple Dragon Knight) or Librarian, (Eldritch Knight, Psi Warrior) though they won&#8217;t excel in those roles as much as a Bard or a Wizard whose ability scores are more tailored to those functions. You can also explore a role as a Scout if you&#8217;re built around Dexterity, allowing you to succeed with skills like Stealth and with tools like Thieves&#8217; Tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our other supporting\n\tarticles:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"11727\">Fighter Races Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\">Fighter Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/spells\">Eldritch Knight Fighter Spells Breakdown<\/a> (if you plan to play an Eldritch Knight)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/martial-excellence-how-to-rp-your-fighters-archetype\/\">Martial Excellence: How to RP Your Fighter&#8217;s Archetype<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/fighters-unleashing-your-inner-warrior-steps-for-building-the-iconic-class-rpgbot-podcast-s4e6\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast: 5e Fighter Optimization<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

Your choice of\n\tFighting Style can determine which weapon options work best for you and\n\twhether or not it makes to use a shield. If you&#8217;re totally uncertain, Defense\n\tis always a good choice.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The options below include the optional fighting styles introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything. Check with your DM before assuming that those styles are allowed, and while you&#8217;re having that discussion, be sure to discuss the Martial Versatility Optional Class Feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more detailed advice on Fighting Styles, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fighting-styles\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"24309\">Practical Guide to Fighting Styles<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Archery<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: The obvious choice for ranged builds. +2 to hit is a big deal in a game\n\t\twhere a 20th-level character can expect a maximum of +11 to hit. The math of\n\t\tthe game gives you a roughly 65% chance to hit when attacking a\n\t\tCR-appropriate creature with average AC, and raising that to 75% feels very\n\t\tsatisfying. If you want to take the Sharpshooter feat, this is an absolute\n\t\tmust.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Blind Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): This one is\n\t\thard. Blindsight, even at just 10-foot range, is extremely useful. It solves\n\t\tissues of invisible enemies, it helps make up for lack of magical options\n\t\tfor Darkvision, and it addresses effects which block line of sight like fog,\n\t\tmagical darkness, or other stuff. But those effects don&#8217;t appear in most\n\t\tencounters, so this is only situationally useful. When it works it&#8217;s great,\n\t\tbut the rest of the time it&#8217;s useless. Unless you have allies in the party\n\t\twho plan to frequently use magical darkness or other options to obscure\n\t\tvision I would skip this.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Races which suffer from Sunlight Sensitivity might consider this as a\n\t\t\tsolution to their sunlight issues. If you don a blindfold (or close your\n\t\t\teyes), your DM may allow you to overcome the effects of Sunlight\n\t\t\tSensitivity by willingly blinding yourself. The text of Sunlight\n\t\t\tSensitivity isn&#8217;t perfectly clear if it only applies to attacks which rely\n\t\t\ton sight, so this may not work RAW, but the idea makes sense.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Defense<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Not very exciting, but since AC scales so little in 5e a +1 can be a big\n\t\tdifference. Defense also doesn&#8217;t lock you into using one type of weapon, so\n\t\tif you like to change weapons to suit the situation Defense can be a great\n\t\tchoice.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dueling<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Note that this works while using a shield. 2 damage closes the damage gap\n\t\tbetween a longsword and a two-handed weapon like a greataxe or greatsword\n\t\t(4.5-&gt;6.5 vs. 6.5\/7), so you can have the damage of a two-handed weapon\n\t\twith the AC of sword-and-board.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Great Weapon Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: This adds\n\t\t<a\n\t\t\thref=\"\/\/rpg.stackexchange.com\/questions\/47172\/how-much-damage-does-great-weapon-fighting-add-on-average#answer-47173\"\n\t\t\t>an average of just over 1 damage per attack on average<\/a\n\t\t>, and even then only with a greatsword. If you&#8217;re using a greatsword, the\n\t\taverage increase in damage per round is roughly equivalent to Archery, but\n\t\tif you plan to use two-handed weapons other than a greatsword (greataxe,\n\t\tpolearms, etc.), pick up Defense instead to compensate for lack of a shield.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Interception<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional): Conceptually similar to Protection, but there\u2019s some nuance in how the two styles protect your target. Protection imposes Disadvantage, so if there\u2019s a good chance that the attack would miss, it\u2019s the better choice. Interception reduces the damage and always works, but for big attacks it won\u2019t negate the whole attack.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Protection<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Tempting for Defender builds, but allies need to remain adjacent to you\n\t\tfor this to work. Being adjacent to the front line tank is generally a bad\n\t\tplace to be unless you can do so safely without someone defending you. This\n\t\talso appeals to mounted combat builds because you can use it to compensate for\n\t\tyour mount&#8217;s relative fragility, but if you&#8217;re going that route you really\n\t\tneed the Mounted Combatant feat which lets you retarget attacks at yourself\n\t\tinstead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Superior Technique<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional) If you&#8217;re\n\t\tgoing for Battle Master and just can&#8217;t wait for level 3, this is really\n\t\ttempting. But numerically this isn&#8217;t a great choice. You&#8217;ll get much more\n\t\tmileage out of a style which adds to all of your attacks like Dueling, and\n\t\tif you&#8217;re desperate for Superiority Dice you can go for Custom Lineage or\n\t\tVariant Human and take the Martial Adept feat to get two maneuvers and one die at\n\t\tfirst level. If you&#8217;re high level and happy with your ability scores, you\n\t\tcan take both Martial Adept and Fighting Initiate (Superior Technique) to\n\t\tget a total of three maneuvers known and two dice on top of the normal\n\t\tBattle Master progression.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Thrown Weapon Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional) Finally a way\n\t\tto make thrown weapons workable in 5e! Unlike a bow or crossbow, you can use\n\t\tthrown weapons one-handed and some even work effectively with two-weapon\n\t\tfighting since thrown weapons are usually melee weapons with the Thrown\n\t\tproperty. If you&#8217;re using magic weapons you may have some trouble since\n\t\tyou&#8217;re repeatedly throwing your weapons away, but you&#8217;ll be able to recover\n\t\tthem after combat.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Thrown Weapon Fighting has some unique interactions with other fighting\n\t\t\tstyles. If you use a melee weapon with the light and thrown property like\n\t\t\thandaxes, you can benefit from the Two-Weapon Fighter style. If you take\n\t\t\tthe Dual Wielder feat, you can upgrade to Javelins. If you instead use\n\t\t\tranged weapons with the thrown property like darts, you can benefit from\n\t\t\tthe Archery style, adding +2 to both attacks <em>and<\/em> damage. That\n\t\t\tallows you to match the average damage of a longbow while still holding a\n\t\t\tshield.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>To summarize: This is probably the most complex Fighting Style because\n\t\t\tyou need to combine it other options (feats and\/or another Fighting Style)\n\t\t\tto make it as truly effective, but those complex interactions also allow\n\t\t\tsome really fun combinations. I don&#8217;t recommend this for new players, but\n\t\t\tan experience player could build a very interesting character around\n\t\t\tthis.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: One of the biggest issues with two-weapon fighting is that you don&#8217;t get\n\t\tto add your ability modifier to your off-hand attack without this Fighting\n\t\tStyle. While this resolves that issue, TWF is still suboptimal for Fighters\n\t\tbecause they get more attacks than anyone else in the game and don&#8217;t have an\n\t\ton-hit damage boost effect like Hunter&#8217;s Mark or a crucial once-per-turn\n\t\tdamage boost like Sneak Attack which requires you to attack as many times as\n\t\tpossible to guarantee at least one hit.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Consider that one attack with your off-hand will likely deal something\n\t\t\tlike 1d8+5 damage at most (assuming 20 in your attack stat and the Dual\n\t\t\tWielding feat) compared to 1d6, 2d6, 3d6, or 4d6 additional damage from\n\t\t\tusing a Greatsword on your normal attacks (each d6 representing one\n\t\t\tadditional attack, up to the Fighter&#8217;s maximum of 4 with Extra Attack).\n\t\t\tIt&#8217;s 9.5 vs. 3.5, 7, 10.5, or 14 damage depending on how many attacks you\n\t\t\tget.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>By the time you get two attacks it&#8217;s close, but by the time you get 3\n\t\t\tit&#8217;s clear that a two-handed weapon is the better choice. On top of that,\n\t\t\ttwo-weapon fighting eats your Bonus Action. Any time you want to use that\n\t\t\tfor anything else (Second Wind, Battlemaster Maneuvers, etc.) you lose\n\t\t\t20-50% of your damage output for the round. Effects like Haste and\n\t\t\tOpportunity Attacks widen the gap even further, putting Two-Weapon\n\t\t\tFighting further behind other weapon configurations in terms of damage\n\t\t\toutput. Unless you&#8217;re going for the Champion archetype to fish for\n\t\t\tcritical hits or you&#8217;re multiclassing, this is a mistake.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmed Fighting<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup> (Optional) Unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tbenefiting from the bonus grapple damage, this is worse than just using a\n\t\twarhammer, so if you take this style, expect to lean heavily into the\n\t\tAthletics skill and the Grapple+Shove combo. Get Expertise in Athletics\n\t\t(either from the Skill Expert feat or from a class dip into rogue), build\n\t\tyourself around Strength, and see if there&#8217;s a way to get Advantage on\n\t\tAthletics checks, such as from the Enlarge\/Reduce spell or from the Rune\n\t\tKnight&#8217;s Giant&#8217;s Might feature.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For feats, consider the Tavern Brawler feat. Allowing you to Grapple as a\n\t\t\tBonus Action will improve your action economy, though you may prefer to\n\t\t\tstart with a Shove so that you can attack at Advantage and follow that\n\t\t\tattack with your Bonus Action Grapple. You still don&#8217;t need the Grappler\n\t\t\tfeat, though.

In terms\n\tof game balance, this is right where you want things to be: more options, more\n\tdiverse concepts, but no actual power creep.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing the new Fighting Style options on all fighters. Players\n\tstill only get one (champions get two, and now there&#8217;s a feat to get another),\n\tso more choices won&#8217;t make the Fighter any stronger.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Martial Versatility<\/span> (Addition): The fact\n\tthat fighters are forced to pick their fighting style at level 1 and can never\n\tchange it has been a huge problem for years. If your fighter has the Dueling\n\tstyle and picks up a magic two-handed weapon, they&#8217;re forced to either ignore\n\tthe weapon or ignore their Fighting Style. The inability to adapt to changing\n\tneeds within the party or changing externalities (buffs from the party,\n\tsubclass features, magic items, etc.) means that players are encouraged to\n\ttake options like Defense because they&#8217;re the safest choice. Allowing the\n\tFighter to retrain their Fighting Style encourages players to explore other\n\toptions, which means more interesting characters.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>The second bullet only applies to the Battle Master, but they face the same\n\tconcern: since you can&#8217;t change your choices, players will always go for the\n\tsafest and most reliable options so many options will never be selected.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t>I recommend allowing Martial Versatility on all fighters. Like with other\n\tretraining mechanics, players still can&#8217;t have more options at the same time\n\tthan they could get if they didn&#8217;t retrain, so players will be more satisfied\n\twith their character but won&#8217;t actually be any stronger than they could be.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Fighters can be built in many ways.

Generally, bonuses to physical ability scores are\n\tkey: a Strength or Dexterity increase is almost required, and a Constitution\n\tincrease is helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond your ability scores, access to Darkvision, Flight, and innate\n\tspellcasting can all be very helpful. Most fighters can&#8217;t produce any of those\n\teffects without items, so your race can give you a lot of capabilities which\n\tgo beyond what the class can provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>For help selecting a race, see our\n\t<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/races\/\" data-type=\"page\">Fighter Races Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>For a classic fighter feel, consider the Variant Human (human fighters are\n\tthe most popular character and have been for several editions).

Fighting Style (Thrown Weapon Fighting) only works with weapons with the Thrown property, and while the shield allows you to make a weapon attack, it does not have the Thrown property.

The\n\t\tFigurine of Wondrous Power presents a convenient solution to that problem,\n\t\toffering you a way to conjure up a powerful mount for a few hours. If it\n\t\tdies, it just turns back into the figure (which it was going to do anyway)\n\t\tand after a few days it&#8217;s ready for more adventures. This admittedly trades\n\t\tthe issue of permanent death for a cooldown period which can often be\n\t\tfrustratingly long, but compare a multi-day cooldown to the time it takes to\n\t\traise and train a griffon from an egg.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Bronze Griffon<\/span>: Good fly speed and\n\t\t\t\tit&#8217;s more durable than a warhorse.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ebony Fly<\/span>: Basically a flying riding\n\t\t\t\thorse with Darkvision.

Champion Fighters have very few decision points,\n\tand almost all of their abilities are numerical increases of some kind. If\n\tyou&#8217;re looking for a mechanically interesting build, this is not it. If you\n\twant something easy to play and you just want to swing a sword, this is a good\n\toption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important decision point for the Champion Fighter is Fighting Style.\n\tThis build will look at two combinations: Dueling+Defense and Great Weapon\n\tFighting+Defense. You might trade out GWF or Defense for Protection if you\n\twould like to place more emphasis on protecting your allies, but we&#8217;ll ignore\n\tthat option for this build so I can more clearly emphasize the numeric\n\tdifferences between the two builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve listed Damage Per Round (DPR) in the level entries below for each build, which presents us with an objective, numerical comparison between Dueling and GWF.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more optimized build, see our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/champion\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"18413\">Champion Fighter Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We will assume the point buy abilities for Strength-based melee suggested\n\tabove, but we&#8217;ll switch Wisdom and Charisma so we can be better at\n\tIntimidation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;<\/th><th>Base<\/th><th>Increased<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Half-Orc. Relentless Endurance and Savage Attacks work really well for the\n\tfighter, and Savage Attacks combines well with Improved Critical and the\n\tFighter&#8217;s high number of attacks. Strength and Constitution is a perfect\n\tspread for a simple melee fighter, which is exactly what we&#8217;re shooting\n\tfor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also considered Dwarf for this build, but the Basic Rules and the SRD\n\tinclude the Hill Dwarf. The Hill Dwarf works fine as a fighter, but without\n\tthe Mountain Dwarf&#8217;s Strength increase the Hill Dwarf feels like a step down\n\tin effectiveness offensively. Staple Builds are intended to serve as an\n\teffective base line and as a go-to simple build for new players, and starting\n\twithout a +3 Strength modifier can feel like a significant handicap.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Half-orcs get Intimidation for free, so we&#8217;ll pick up Athletics and\n\tPerception. Athletics is used for grappling and shoving, both of which add\n\tuseful options to the Champion, which is helpful when you&#8217;re otherwise a ball\n\tof numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Soldier makes the most sense thematically, and since we get two redundant\n\tproficiencies you can pick any two skills you want. Since we&#8217;re starting with\n\t12 Charisma, you might consider Deception and Persuasion to make yourself a\n\tpassable Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s room for customization here. By switching around your mental ability\n\tscores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma), you can set yourself up for success\n\twith different sets of skills. If you emphasize Intelligence, you could take\n\tthe Sage archetype. If you emphasize Wisdom, you could take the Acolyte\n\tarchetype.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Staple builds intentionally don&#8217;t use feats so that I can focus on simplicity\n\tand limit the build to the Basic Rules and the SRD. But the Fighter gets more\n\tAbility Score Increases than any other class, and only needs two good ability\n\tscores, so 7 Ability Score Increases leaves us with a ton of resources that we\n\tsimply can&#8217;t use. If you&#8217;re willing to go beyond the confines of this build,\n\tfeats are a really good idea. If you still want to keep things simple, look at\n\tsimply feats like Durable, Resilient, and Tough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just occurred to me that those are all synonyms. No wonder I can never\n\tremember which is which without checking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feat(s) and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Fighting Style (Dueling or Great Weapon Fighting)<br>Second\n\t\t\t\t\tWind<\/td><td>For your starting equipment, take chain mail, a longsword and shield\n\t\t\t\t\tor a greataxe and a warhammer, two handaxes, and either &#8220;pack&#8221;\n\t\t\t\t\toption.<br><br>In chain mail you&#8217;ll have an AC of 16.
