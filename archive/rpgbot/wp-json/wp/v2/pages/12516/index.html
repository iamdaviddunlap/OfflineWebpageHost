Pick the skill. Languages can be solved magically.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fighting Spirit<\/span>: Making this require a\n\t\tbonus action means that you can&#8217;t use two-weapon fighting in the same round,\n\t\tso building around two-handed weapons is your best bet. Guaranteed Advantage\n\t\ton all of your attacks means that feats like Great Weapon Master and\n\t\tSharpshooter become extremely tempting. The temporary HP also makes it easier\n\t\tto go without a shield. However, at just three uses per day you can&#8217;t expect\n\t\tto use this in every fight until you get Tireless Spirit at level 10.\n<p>If your table is using the optional flanking rules, this is less important for melee\nbuilds because it&#8217;s so much easier to get Advantage, but it remains excellent for fighting\nat range.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elegant Courtier<\/span>: Allowing you to use\n\t\tWisdom in addition to Charisma on Charisma (persuasion) checks means that\n\t\tyou can function as a face without having high Charisma. An additional\n\t\tsaving throw proficiency is even better, as most characters never get more\n\t\tthan two saving throw proficiencies.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"10\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tireless Spirit<\/span>: Once you have this, you\n\t\tshould plan to begin every fight with Fighting Spirit. Come out swinging,\n\t\tand do a lot of damage up front.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"15\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Rapid Strike<\/span>: Advantage is nice because\n\t\tyou get to roll twice and keep the higher. Rapid Strike lets you keep\n\t\t<em>both<\/em>, so if you get lucky and both rolls are high you can hit\n\t\ttwice. You only get to do this once per turn, but this means that you can\n\t\tget four attacks in a single turn (5 once you hit 20th level, more if you\n\t\thave Haste, use Two-Weapon Fighting, activate Action Surge, etc.).\n\t\t<p>Fighting Spirit&#8217;s guarantee Advantage is an easy way to trigger Rapid\n\t\t\tStrike, but remember that Fighting Spirit only works three times per day.\n\t\t\tA more reliable tactic is to Shove your opponent prone before attacking\n\t\t\tthem, or if an ally can land Hold Person\/Monster then all attacks have advantage and all melee attacks are automatic critical hits.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Strength before Death<\/span>: An entire turn.\n\t\t<em>An entire turn.<\/em>. Drink a potion, use Second Wind. Anything to get\n\t\tyou some hit points and keep you conscious. Otherwise, take the Attack\n\t\taction and get revenge! If you\u2019re close to 0 on your own turn and have some way to give yourself enough falling damage to trigger this with just your movement you could in theory take a full turn with action surge and Fighting Spirit fueled Rapid Strike, fall to trigger Strength Before Death, and then do it all again, in the same round. And fun fact, if we do this during our own turn and we&#8217;ve already used Fighting Spirit then Fighting Spirit is still active (it says &#8220;interrupting the current turn&#8221;) because the turn that we used it on hasn&#8217;t ended yet. Even crazier, you could activate Action Surge again during this mid-turn bonus turn. If you can&#8217;t find a way to fall you can always use your last attack on yourself if you&#8217;re close enough to 0.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"samurai-ability-scores\">Samurai Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>As a Fighter, we have options.

Yes, Firearms don\u2019t exist in every campaign. Yes, this build works exactly the same if you use a bow (even the Gunner feat). But we\u2019re using a Kobold so it\u2019s stuck with a 1d6 Shortbow because the Heavy property is dumb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/feats\/gunner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m giving the Kobold a gun.<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to be building a gunslinging ranged attack Fighter.

Because point buy gives us enough points to work with three stats, we\u2019re going to put some into Wisdom as well to really benefit from that Wisdom save proficiency Samurai get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we put a 10 in Intelligence instead of 15 into Wisdom is that we\u2019re not planning anything that would even out the 15. Might as well remove a -1. You could just as easily move that to Charisma.

We gain Stealth and Perception proficiency. For our tool we have to take Playing Card Set proficiency. It\u2019s just required. We\u2019re good at playing cards.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Nothing from our Race. From Fighter we take Survival and Acrobatics. Samurai grants an additional choice and 3rd level so we take Insight because we have some Wisdom. As mentioned above, our Background grants Stealth and Perception as well as Playing Card Set.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fighters have more ASIs than other classes and we\u2019re taking all twenty levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fourth, we take Gunner. As discussed above, if our campaign doesn\u2019t allow guns we\u2019re going to use this with a Shortbow anyway because this lets us just be up close and personal with our opponents so we can use Draconic Cry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixth, we take Resilient (Dexterity). Fighter having extra ASIs means that we can sneak in extra Hybrid feats at 6th and 8th unlike other classes that need to take a +2 at 8th. We\u2019re picking Resilient Dex because Fighter gets Con and Samurai get Wis so why not have the big three?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, Skill Expert would work if you wanted some other skill and some expertise for your Samurai. Elven Accuracy would also go well here if you chose to be an Elf instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth, we\u2019re taking Piercer to bring Dexterity to 20 and give us damage die rerolls. Also, since we\u2019re using a Musket with a 1d12 damage die, we get 3d12 when we happen to crit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At twelvth, Sharpshooter gives us a great damage boost as well as squeezing a bit more range out of our Musket. Even with this, our Musket\u2019s maximum range is 30 feet less than what a Longbow can do without this feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fourteen, sixteen, and nineteen, we take +2 Constitution twice and the Tough feat in whatever order we want. For this build we took Tough last so we could square up Constitution saves. Doing this has us finish with 264 Hit Points at level 20. Alternatively, we could look at feats like Lucky which fit easily into any build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Fighting Style=&gt;Archery<br>Second Wind<br>Darkvision<br>Draconic Cry<br>Kobold Legacy<br>-Draconic Sorcery=&gt;Blade Ward<\/td><td>At this level we\u2019re a basic Archery fighter.

We can use these abilities in different situations so it\u2019s great to have both.

The difference is if we\u2019re doing something shenanigans to activate Strength before Death in the middle of our own turn or not. Because of the exact timing of everything you have to pull off to get the maximum power from that without dying, we won&#8217;t use that during our full power turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resources used: Action Surge and either Draconic Cry or Fighting Spirit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will assume that we do not have a +X magic weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin the turn by activating either Cry or Spirit depending on range to the target. Declaring the attack action, because we have Advantage, we can trade one of our attacks for two attacks without Advantage thanks to Rapid Strike.<br>We have Archery fighting style and Sharpshooter feat, so following <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math<\/a>, we need to roll 11 on the d20 to do 1d12+5+10. Additionally, because of the Piercer feat we do an extra 1d12 if we crit. We have two attacks with neither Advantage or Disadvantage, and three attacks with Advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Dice<\/td><td>Rapid Strike<\/td><td>Advantage<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1d12+5+10<\/td><td>11.08*2<\/td><td>17.39*3<\/td><td>74.33<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We can then Action Surge to take another Attack action. However, we have already used Rapid Strike this turn. Our second Attack action will instead be four attacks with Advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Dice<\/td><td>Advantage<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1d12+5+10<\/td><td>17.39*4<\/td><td>69.57<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Together this totals 143.9. Because we get two Action Surges per Short Rest, and we always get at least one Fighting Spirit per fight, assuming a typical adventuring day (6-8 combat encounters lasting roughly 3 rounds each with 2 Short Rests interspersed) we can do this six times a day as we will have that many Action Surges across the day\u2019s rests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is a theoretical solo DPR. D&amp;D is less often Yojimbo and more often The Magnificent Seven. If teamwork allows us to get Advantage then we can save Draconic Cry and Fighting Spirit for when we need them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The Samurai. A Title.
