Nearly nothing is beyond\n\tthe Wizard&#8217;s ability, provided that they have the right spell available.\n\tWizards can prepare more spells than any other class (not counting things like\n\tspells which are automatically prepared from your subclass), and can even\n\tchange prepared spells on a Short Rest with their Memorize Spell feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Wizards are also the uncontested master of ritual casting. Any character can\n\tcast a spell as a Ritual if they have the spell prepared, but Wizards can cast\n\tany spell in their spellbook as a Ritual, offering them even more options on\n\ttop of their unusually large number of prepared spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Wizard&#8217;s spellcasting philosophy is to have a tool for every situation.\n\tWhen selecting spells, look for diverse options which can handle a variety of\n\tchallenges both in an out of combat. You&#8217;ll have more spells in your spellbook\n\tthan you can prepare in a day, but you can access situationally useful spells\n\twhen you need them with Memorize Spell or by creating Spell Scrolls.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells\">Wizard Spells by Level<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#Cantrips\">Wizard Cantrips<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-1-wizard-spells\">Level 1 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-2-wizard-spells\">Level 2 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-3-wizard-spells\">Level 3 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-4\">Level 4 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-5-wizard-spells\">Level 5 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-6-wizard-spells\">Level 6 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-7-wizard-spells\">Level 7 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-8-wizard-spells\">Level 8 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#level-9-wizard-spells\">Level 9 Wizard Spells<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

This gives you a lot of room to experiment, and makes it easy to select\n\tCantrips which may only be useful for a narrow level window, or which you\n\tmight only need temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<!--\n\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-\"><\/span> <sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>:\n\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t-->\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Acid Splash<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you have allies\n\t\tusing Push weapons, you may be able to use this to reliably hit multiple\n\t\tenemies.

Druidcraft and Prestidigitation both grant the ability to light or\n\t\tsnuff out small flames. Control Flames will let you spread flames,\n\t\textinguish them, change their color, etc., but if you want to light a torch\n\t\tyou need to use flint and tinder like a commoner. You can use this to\n\t\tdramatically improve the effectiveness of torches, or to snuff out enemy\n\t\tlight sources at a distance, but those are situational uses that you can\n\t\taddress with better light sources like the Daylight spell or by using water.\n\t\tNeither function is frequent or useful enough to justify a Cantrip with so\n\t\tlittle functionality.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Bonfire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: A low-budget area\n\t\tcontrol spell. It does as much initial damage as most Cantrips, but the\n\t\tongoing damage only applies when a creature enters the area or ends their\n\t\tturn there, so you can only get extra damage if you can force an enemy into\n\t\tthe space or if you cast it on them and they remain in their space. If you\n\t\thave an ally who likes to grapple enemies, or if you need to block a narrow\n\t\tspace like a hall or doorway, this is extremely useful if you&#8217;re not already\n\t\tcommitting Concentration to something else.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, Create Bonfire&#8217;s reliance on Concentration can become a problem\n\t\t\tas you gain levels because Concentration is such a precious resource, and\n\t\t\tmany of the best spells require Concentration.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dancing Lights<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An amusing distraction,\n\t\tbut you can usually accomplish the same thing using Mage Hand and a candle\n\t\tor torch.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Encode Thoughts<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">GGtR<\/a>)<\/sup>: Interesting, but\n\t\tinsanely situational. The only way to consume the thought strand is to cast\n\t\tthis spell within the 8-hour duration, so this isn&#8217;t even a great option for\n\t\tcommunicating over long distances.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fire Bolt<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Great range and solid\n\t\tdamage. A good go-to option when all you need is damage. Toll the Dead will\n\t\tdo more damage and has a better damage type, but Fire Bolt has twice the\n\t\trange. At low levels, True Strike with a crossbow will be more\n\t\teffective.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Friends<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: High risk, high reward.\n\t\tThis is great for dealing with brief social interactions with NPCs that\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll never see again or that have no way to cause trouble for you, or who\n\t\tyou might end up attacking anyway for whatever reason. There&#8217;s no Verbal\n\t\tcomponent, so you can safely use this while hidden.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Frostbite<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Low damage for\n\t\ta Cantrip (d6-based), but the big appeal is Disadvantage on the target&#8217;s\n\t\tnext weapon attack. Unfortunately, it works on Constitution saving throws,\n\t\tand those tend to be relatively high compared to other saving throws. If\n\t\tsomeone in your party is using Sap weapons, don&#8217;t take this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Green-Flame Blade<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG<\/a>)<\/sup>: Excellent for\n\t\tBladesingers, but most Wizards should never be in a position to use\n\t\tthis.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Gust<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: If this scaled\n\t\tsomehow, I would be interested. If it had more options, I would be\n\t\tinterested. If it had better range, I would be interested. But, as it\n\t\tstands, this spell is almost totally useless.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Infestation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Low damage,\n\t\tunpredictable, and it targets Constitution saves.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Light<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Disposable magic light\n\t\tis fantastic, but you&#8217;ll do fine with torches if you don&#8217;t have room for the\n\t\tCantrip.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Lure<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational,\n\t\tbut potentially useful for Bladesingers to pull enemies into melee or if\n\t\tyou&#8217;re running Yolande&#8217;s Regal Presence. If you&#8217;re flying, you may even be\n\t\table to pull enemies into the air to cause a small amount of falling\n\t\tdamage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Hand<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ability to move\n\t\tobjects at a safe distance is profoundly useful. Use it to pull levers, open\n\t\tdoors, sort your laundry, and all manner of other important but potentially\n\t\thazardous tasks where you wouldn&#8217;t want to risk your own hands.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mending<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too situational. Short\n\t\tof Rust Monsters and a few oozes, nearly nothing in 5e deals damage to your\n\t\tequipment. If you&#8217;re playing Spelljammer, this is essential, but otherwise\n\t\tyou can skip it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Message<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational. Use this\n\t\tto send messages without revealing your position. Of course, the spell\n\t\trequires Verbal components, which need to be spoken in a loud, clear voice,\n\t\tso take precautions if possible.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mind Sliver<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE \/ PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Psychic damage\n\t\ton an Intelligence save is spectacular on its own. Intelligence saves are\n\t\tconsistently among the lowest, and psychic damage resistance\/immunity is\n\t\trare (though it does exist, especially on mindless enemies like zombies).\n\t\tThat alone makes Mind Sliver arguably the most reliable Cantrip damage in\n\t\t5e, but it gets better from there.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>With only Verbal components, Mind Sliver works while you&#8217;re tied up or\n\t\t\thave your hands full, making it a great option for War Caster. It also\n\t\t\timposes a -1d4 penalty on the target&#8217;s next saving throw making them an\n\t\t\teasier target for save-or-suck spells, or you can just repeatedly hit them\n\t\t\twith Mind Sliver and watch enemies try to beat your spell save DC with a\n\t\t\t+0 save bonus and the -1d4 penalty from your previous hit.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Minor Illusion<\/span>:<sup\n\t\t\t><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Room for plenty of creative, deceptive uses. The 5-foot cube is easily\n\t\tenough to create something to hide behind, provided that your enemies don&#8217;t\n\t\tsee you create the illusion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Mold Earth<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: You know what\n\t\telse can do this? A shovel. Sure, shoveling will take a long time, but you\n\t\tget at most 4 Cantrips, and, if you can replace a Cantrip with a mundane\n\t\titem, it&#8217;s probably a bad Cantrip. The only important function is to create\n\t\tdifficult terrain, but you&#8217;re limited to two ongoing effects, which means\n\t\tyou only get two 5-foot squares. And, again, you could do that with a\n\t\tshovel. You&#8217;re about as likely to use this in combat as you are to use a\n\t\tshovel, too.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Poison Spray<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Excellent damage on a\n\t\tspell attack, but the range isn&#8217;t great, and resistance\/immunity to poison\n\t\tis common, so it can&#8217;t be your only attack option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prestidigitation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Whenever you want to do\n\t\tsomething small and magical that&#8217;s not covered by another spell, it&#8217;s\n\t\tusually covered by prestidigitation. This spell is exceptionally versatile.\n\t\tFor suggestions on how to use Prestidigitation to its fullest, see our\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/prestidigitation\"\n\t\t\t>Practical Guide to Prestidigitation<\/a\n\t\t>.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Ray of Frost<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Stacking speed\n\t\tpenalties is easy and very powerful in the 2024 DnD rules thanks to the\n\t\taddition of the Slow Weapon Mastery. By teaming up with an ally with a Slow\n\t\tweapon and Slasher, you can drop many creatures&#8217; speeds to 0, leaving\n\t\tentirely unable to move.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shape Water<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is as\n\t\tabusable and versatile as Prestidigitation. Freeze a solid 5 foot cube of\n\t\twater and drop it on someone. Pour water into a lock, freeze it, and allow\n\t\tthe ice expansion to break the lock. Put a dome of ice over something you&#8217;re\n\t\tprotecting. Build a small bridge in 5-foot segments. Block a hallway. Freeze\n\t\ta door in place.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The uses are numerous and fantastic. If you have a barrel of water and\n\t\t\tthis Cantrip, you have a solution to most problems. Honestly the fact that\n\t\t\tthis spell is so much better than its other elemental equivalents (Control\n\t\t\tFlames, Gust, and Mold Earth) is a good indication of just how awful those\n\t\t\tspells are. See our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/shape-water\">Practical Guide to Shape Water<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor more on how great Shape Water is.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Shocking Grasp<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Touch range,\n\t\tdisappointing damage, unimpressive secondary effect.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sword Burst<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you are in a\n\t\tposition where it makes sense to use this, you should probably be running\n\t\taway unless you&#8217;re a Bladesinger. For the Bladesinger, this is a fantastic\n\t\tway to handle crowds while you&#8217;re in melee. Other Wizards should avoid\n\t\tthis.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderclap<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Thunder damage\n\t\tis worse than Sword Burst&#8217;s force damage, and Thunderclap uses Constitution\n\t\tsaves, which tend to be high.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Toll the Dead<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE \/ PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: 60 ft. range,\n\t\tthe damage is measured in d12&#8217;s most of the time, and almost nothing will\n\t\tresist it since it&#8217;s Necrotic damage.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">True Strike<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Your go-to attack\n\t\tCantrip until at least level 5, but possibly until level 11. A crossbow with\n\t\tTrue Strike will do more damage and have better range than most damaging\n\t\tCantrips until their damage has scaled at least once. If you increase your\n\t\tspellcasting modifier to +4 at level 4, a crossbow with True Strike will\n\t\tdeal more damage (average 12) than d10-based Cantrips like Fire Bolt\n\t\t(average 11).<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"level-1-wizard-spells\">Level 1 Wizard Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Absorb Elements<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: A fantastic\n\t\tdefensive option at any level, this will save your life when you encounter\n\t\tan unpredictable source of elemental damage like a trap or a spell.

If you spend an Action and a spell slot to cast this\n\t\t\tand a target spends their Action to remove the effect, you have traded\n\t\t\tyour Action for theirs and probably also did a bunch of damage. In\n\t\t\tencounters where your party outnumbers your enemies, that&#8217;s a winning\n\t\t\ttrade for you. In encounters where your enemies outnumber your party,\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re in a target-rich environment and may be able to hit 3 or more\n\t\t\ttargets, in which case trading your own Action for one Action from several\n\t\t\tenemies is a great way to offset your enemies&#8217; numerical advantage.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Lines are a difficult AOE because it&#8217;s often difficult to catch more than\n\t\t\ttwo enemies in a straight 5-foot wide line.

This requires\n\t\t\tConcentration, so if you don&#8217;t affect multiple targets you may need to\n\t\t\tweigh the benefits of whatever ongoing damage you&#8217;re getting against the\n\t\t\tability to spend your Concentration on a different spell instead.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tasha&#8217;s Hideous Laughter<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: A great low-level save\n\t\tor suck, but generally you want to use this on a creature then leave it\n\t\talone until you&#8217;ve dealt with anything else in the encounter. The best\n\t\tcomparison at this level is to Sleep. Sleep is an AOE (though a small one),\n\t\tand if your target fails the second save, they fall Unconscious.

For example: Create\n\t\tan illusion of the floor beneath the target sprouting teeth, rising up\n\t\taround the creature, and eating it like a venus fly trap. The creature\n\t\t&#8220;treats the phantasm as if it were real&#8221;, and, unless they know to use\n\t\tIntelligence (Investigation) to disbelieve the illusion, they&#8217;ll spend 10\n\t\trounds struggling against a non-existent trap which is slowly killing them.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>An ally might try to convince your target that something is amiss, but\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s time that your enemies are trying to get their act together while\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re hitting them with other spells.

Scorching Ray deals a total of\n\t\t\t6d6 damage (avg. 21), and 605% of that is 13.65 expected damage\n\t\t\t(disregarding critical hits, which are more common because you&#8217;re making\n\t\t\tmultiple attacks).<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">See Invisibility<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Easy, reliable counter\n\t\tto invisibility.

The most obvious is preventing Opportunity Attacks, which\n\t\tallows you and your allies to move away from the target(s) safely at the\n\t\tsame spell slot cost of Misty Step. Misty Step will, of course, get you\n\t\tfurther and do more than just avoiding Opportunity Attacks, but Tasha&#8217;s Mind\n\t\tWhip&#8217;s benefits don&#8217;t stop there. Limiting the target&#8217;s actions on their\n\t\tturn to <em>one thing<\/em> from their choice of movement, Action, and Bonus\n\t\tAction means that enemies who can&#8217;t attack at range basically spend their\n\t\twhole turn walking. Enemies stuck in melee who don&#8217;t want to be there may be\n\t\tstuck there. Enemy spellcasters or creatures with lots of special abilities\n\t\twill lose big chunks of their turn.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>On top of all of that, Tasha&#8217;s Mind Whip targets Intelligence saves,\n\t\t\twhich are consistently one of the lowest saves across the full level\n\t\t\trange. In 5e, Intelligence doesn&#8217;t do a lot, so unsurprisingly most\n\t\t\tadventurers and most monsters are idiots. Capitalize on that. This is a\n\t\t\tgreat way to force enemies to expend Legendary Resistances.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Tasha&#8217;s Mind Whip also upcasts very effectively, allowing you to reliably\n\t\t\tdebuff several enemies at the same time.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Vortex Warp<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Basically Misty Step\n\t\tbut for anyone but you. The tactical benefits of teleporting an ally\n\t\tadjacent to a frail enemy or teleporting a frail enemy into a dangerous\n\t\tlocation are numerous.

The big draw here is the difficult\n\t\tterrain to deter melee enemies and Disadvantage to deter ranged attackers.\n\t\tThis competes conceptually with Blur since both options impose Disadvantage,\n\t\tbut there are some trade-offs. Blur only lasts 1 minute, but the\n\t\tDisadvantage applies to all attacks rather than just ranged attacks. Warding\n\t\tWind lasts 10 minutes and makes it hard for enemies to move near you,\n\t\tpotentially keeping them from reaching you in melee. I&#8217;m not sure which\n\t\tspell is better, but given that Warding Wind lasts longer and can handle\n\t\teffects that normally require Gust of Wind, I think Warding Wind may be\n\t\tslightly better.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Web<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fantastic crowd\n\t\tcontrol, but with some complications. This competes for space with Hold\n\t\tPerson and Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp. Compared to Earthen Grasp, Web can\n\t\taffect more than one creature and has a much better duration, but Web may be\n\t\teasier to escape. Web requires an initial Dexterity saving throw, then\n\t\tcreatures can make Strength (Athletics) checks to escape on later turns.\n\t\tMany creatures will have either high Strength or high Dexterity, so your\n\t\tideal targets are creatures which are bad at both like many spellcasters.\n\t\tEven so, proficiency in Athletics is rare, so high-Strength creatures may\n\t\tstill struggle to escape.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The webs can also be burned away, so any creature that can deal fire\n\t\t\tdamage or which is carrying something like flint and steel or a lit torch\n\t\t\tcan easily escape without struggling through a series of Strength checks.\n\t\t\tBeing Restrained doesn&#8217;t prevent creatures from taking such actions. Given\n\t\t\tall of the comparisons, I think Web is a better option for handling groups\n\t\t\tof foes, but Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp is better against single foes.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Wither and Bloom<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCoC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Wizards can&#8217;t provide\n\t\tmagical healing, so the ability to heal other creatures (even if it&#8217;s by\n\t\tspending a hit die) is very exciting.

For example: If you use Hypnotic Pattern, you\n\t\t\tcan trivialize and entire encounter, greatly reducing the danger to your\n\t\t\tentire party and reducing the amount of resources that your party needs to\n\t\t\tspend to succeed.

This doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tscale with spell level, but it really doesn&#8217;t need to. A 30-foot cube is\n\t\t\tenough to hit several creatures, and so long as your Spell Save DC is\n\t\t\tdecent you&#8217;ll do fine. Even if enemies spend an Action to break their\n\t\t\tallies out of the spell, you&#8217;ve spent one Action to incapacitate them and\n\t\t\tthey&#8217;re spending more than that just to fix it without actually harming\n\t\t\tyou or your allies.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Incite Greed<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">AI<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is a gamble.

You could walk your full speed away (affected\n\t\ttargets can do nothing but move toward you, so they can&#8217;t take Reactions to\n\t\tperform an Opportunity Attack), drop Concentration, then hit them with a\n\t\tFireball.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Intellect Fortress<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Technically\n\t\tsituational, but an absolutely spectacular defense against enemies which\n\t\trely on spells or common effects like charm and fear effects.

You also get resistance to\n\t\tpsychic damage, which is nice if you&#8217;re fighting mind flayers, aboleths, or\n\t\tbards who enjoy Vicious Mockery. With a 1-hour duration, the Concentration\n\t\trequirement can be problematic, but it also means that you can carry this\n\t\tthrough multiple encounters at low cost, so in situations where you need\n\t\tthis it&#8217;s not going to eat all of your spell slots.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Leomund&#8217;s Tiny Hut<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: With an 8-hour duration\n\t\tand the ability to cast it as a Ritual, Leomund&#8217;s Tiny Hut is useful both as\n\t\tan option for resting, and as a surprising utility and combat option.

Since it&#8217;s opaque, most low-level\n\t\tteleport effects like Misty step can&#8217;t be used to get inside it. Your allies\n\t\tcan use it for cover, then dart in and out to attack or cast spells.

The best\n\t\tuse case is generally to invert the effects and use a spell to summon a\n\t\tcreature so that you can bargain with it without risk of the creature\n\t\tescaping.

Each meteor deals 2d6 damage, so\n\t\tat 6 meteors you can deal a total of 12d6 damage, beating Fireball by half.\n\t\tHowever, the 5-foot radius on the meteors is tiny so you&#8217;re lucky if you can\n\t\thit just two creatures. Fortunately, you have 10 minutes to find good\n\t\ttargets if you don&#8217;t mind dedicating Concentration to keeping this running\n\t\tas your pool of meteors gradually depletes.

Divination spells include things like See Invisibility, so if you\n\t\tor your party relies on invisibility of any kind this protects from several\n\t\tmagical countermeasures to both stealth and invisibility. However, most\n\t\tenemies aren&#8217;t spellcasters and won&#8217;t have access to those divination\n\t\toptions, so you can&#8217;t justify casting this every day. The spell also has an\n\t\texpensive material component specifically to deter you from casting this all\n\t\tthe time.

With\n\t\ta total casting time of 11 minutes as a ritual, you can have at most 5\n\t\thorses up and running at a time before the 1-hour duration starts to wear\n\t\toff and you lose a horse. If your party is larger than that, consider\n\t\tsharing horses, getting a wagon, or just buying a horse. If you have an ally\n\t\tin the party who is built for mounted combat but doesn&#8217;t have a way to get a\n\t\tmagical mount, this is a great way to keep them mounted despite 5e&#8217;s utter\n\t\topposition to the survival of horses in combat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Protection From Energy<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An important, staple\n\t\tdefensive option, but it&#8217;s single-target and requires Concentration so you\n\t\tcan&#8217;t afford to keep it running constantly.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Remove Curse<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational, but\n\t\tirreplaceable.

The area of effect is excellent, and combining difficult\n\t\tterrain, possibly falling Prone, breaking Concentration, and making the area\n\t\tHeavily Obscured makes it difficult for creatures to act effectively while\n\t\tin the area. They&#8217;re effectively blind, so they can&#8217;t easily attack or cast\n\t\tspells at targets outside of the area. They&#8217;ll likely need to move to exit\n\t\tthe storm, which may require them to Dash or to move over multiple turns.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, beyond inconveniencing creatures within the area, this doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tget you much. You can&#8217;t see into the area to target creatures within the\n\t\t\tarea with others spells since spells typically require line of sight, and\n\t\t\tHeavily Obscured blocks line of sight (though some spells, like fireball,\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t require you to be able to see), so unless you have an ally who\n\t\t\tdropped an ongoing damage effect within the area, the best you can do is\n\t\t\twait or run away.

Hypnotic Pattern&#8217;s targets can&#8217;t act\n\t\tat all until they&#8217;re released from the effect, but it&#8217;s also a Charm effect\n\t\twhich some creatures are immune or resistant to.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The 25% chance to fail casting spells with Somatic components is\n\t\t\tinteresting, but unreliable.

Two types of\n\t\tdamage, which makes sense but is still annoying to track. Compare this to\n\t\tErupting Earth: ice Storm&#8217;s AOE is much bigger (20 ft. cube vs. 20 ft.\n\t\tradius cylinder), but it does an average of just 5 more damage, and the\n\t\tdifficult terrain only lasts until the end of your next turn, so it&#8217;s nearly\n\t\tpointless.

Against big burly foes which often have\n\t\tpoor mental stats, the save will be hard to pass and the debuff will make\n\t\ttheir attacks and ability checks much less effective. Because casting\n\t\tPhantasmal Killer increases the damage by a d10 every time it deals damage\n\t\t(rather than just the on the first damage roll like many spells), this\n\t\tremains an effective option well beyond its spell level.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Polymorph<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fantastic and\n\t\tversatile, but also very complicated.

The save is\n\t\tIntelligence, and those tend to be among the lowest saves, even at very high\n\t\tlevels, and the target is Incapacitated on a failed save, robbing them of a\n\t\tturn, so despite it being single-target with lackluster damage it&#8217;s a\n\t\tpowerful tool against single foes. Even better, if you know the target&#8217;s\n\t\tname (often easy for named antagonists), you can cast this without line of\n\t\tsight, allowing you to hide behind walls, in areas of magical darkness, or\n\t\tsomewhere else safe.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sickening Radiance<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: This spell is very\n\t\teasy to overlook.

The 4d10 damage is fine, and negating invisibility is\n\t\t\tgreat, but the real appeal is the levels of Exhaustion. The stacking\n\t\t\tpenalty to checks and saves will make it harder for targets to resist the\n\t\t\tsave, plus it will be easier to hit them with other effects to keep them\n\t\t\tinside the area of effect.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spirit of Death<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a>)<\/sup>: Summon Undead is\n\t\tgenerally better, but the spirit gets guaranteed Advantage, which is worth a\n\t\tlot.

Huge creatures are the most efficient usage, but huge objects\n\t\t\tare often hard to find, and they&#8217;re too big to haul around on your own.\n\t\t\tSmall or medium objects will still fill a space, so you may be able to use\n\t\t\tbarrels or crates or something like that.

The damage from both Clenched Fist and\n\t\tGrasping Hand is great, and scales well with spell level. By this level you\n\t\thave plenty of ways to handle single targets, but generally once the target\n\t\tpasses a save they&#8217;re free of the effect. Bigby&#8217;s Hand sticks around for the\n\t\tspell&#8217;s duration, allowing you to repeatedly harass a target and move on to\n\t\ta new target once the previous one falls.

The simple fact\n\t\tthat the effect moves away from you makes the spell difficult to keep in\n\t\tplace, and RAW it&#8217;s unclear if the effect stops if it hits a solid barrier\n\t\tor if it&#8217;s happy to roll straight through solid objects like castle walls.\n\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The spell moves away from you rather than from your original position\n\t\t\twhen casting the spell, so you may be able to pilot the effect by running\n\t\t\taround it, but with a 20-foot radius you may need more than the typical\n\t\t\t30-foot speed most humanoid races have if you want to make more than\n\t\t\tslight adjustments to the cloud&#8217;s direction every round. If you want to\n\t\t\trun fully around to the opposite side of the cloud, you need to move\n\t\t\tupwards of 60 feet (half the circumference of a circle with 40-foot\n\t\t\tdiameter is roughly 62.5 feet, but that doesn&#8217;t account for positioning on\n\t\t\ta grid).<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Cone of Cold<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Despite the larger\n\t\ttotal area of effect, I think this is worse than Fireball.

Cone of Cold&#8217;s 8d8 damage only slightly exceeds\n\t\tFireballs 8d6 damage (just 8 points more damage on average), and, if you\n\t\tcast Fireball as a Level 5 spell, Cone of Cold does just 1 point more damage\n\t\ton average while targeting a much less reliable save.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Conjure Elemental<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Unlike a typical summon\n\t\tspell, this conjures an immobile elemental that restrains your enemies.

The Monster Manual contains only a handful of skeleton and zombie\n\t\tstat blocks, and if you do something silly like raise a bunch of zombie\n\t\twolves your DM is going to need to generate a new stat block for them in the\n\t\tmiddle of a game session. At some point I might write a &#8220;Big Book of\n\t\tSkeletons&#8221; and &#8220;Big Book of Zombies&#8221; to convert every living creature in the\n\t\tMonster Manual, but that&#8217;s a long way off if it ever does happen. I think\n\t\tthe intent is that you should use the generic &#8220;Zombie&#8221; stat block used for\n\t\thumanoid zombies, but it never explains what to do if players use this on\n\t\tany other kind of corpse.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>With that out of the way, the spell is just not very good. Creating 5 CR\n\t\t\t1\/4 creatures for up to an hour is not going to have a huge impact unless\n\t\t\tyou just need five lukewarm bodies to carry stuff around. There&#8217;s\n\t\t\tsomething to be said for the Zombie&#8217;s Undead Fortitude since most\n\t\t\tcreatures can&#8217;t deal radiant damage, but the DC for the save is going to\n\t\t\tbe high, so your zombies are still going to die quickly.

Dawn&#8217;s single saving grace is that is specifically says &#8220;this\n\t\tlight is sunlight&#8221;, which means that it hurts vampires very badly.

Even then, the 2024 rules\n\t\tdramatically shrunk the number of humanoids, changing th Still, there&#8217;s no\n\t\tbetter off-switch for a humanoid than Dominate Person. Upcasting the spell\n\t\tincreases the duration, allowing you to drag the target through a bunch of\n\t\tfights. However, the creature taking damage allows additional saves, so be\n\t\tsure to keep it out of harm&#8217;s way until you can conveniently do away with\n\t\tthem at minimal risk to yourself and your allies.

Enervation is the same idea: you hit once,\n\t\tthen you spend every Action for a while dealing automatic damage. It&#8217;s a\n\t\tfine concept, but at just 4d8 damage it&#8217;s going to take a profoundly long\n\t\ttime to kill any single target worthy of a Level 5 spell slot. Sure, the\n\t\tdamage is guaranteed, but spells like Hunger of Hadar and Sickening Radiance\n\t\twill do similar damage in an AOE along with other benefits.

Sure, Far Step lets you go twice as far and you couldn&#8217;t teleport 10\n\t\ttimes in a row with Misty Step without spending a huge number of spell\n\t\tslots, but situations where you need to teleport once every round should\n\t\tprobably be addressed by things like flying or invisibility.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Geas<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This spell is\n\t\tsituational by design. It has a 1-minute casting time and Verbal components,\n\t\tso you&#8217;re not going to break this out in combat or while sneaking around in\n\t\ta dungeon. You&#8217;re going to restrain the subject, and stand around chanting\n\t\tfor a full minute and hope that they fail the save. Once that&#8217;s done, you\n\t\tneed to give them a suitable command (read the spell description). Generally\n\t\tyou&#8217;ll want it to be something that benefits you, but will also take the\n\t\ttarget most of the duration to keep them from becoming a problem for you.\n\t\tAlso remember that the base effect of the Charmed condition makes it easier\n\t\tfor you to talk the creature into doing things with Charisma checks, so a\n\t\tGeased creature may be a useful ally for the duration of the effect even if\n\t\tthe original order isn&#8217;t directly related to what you want them to do.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Increasing the spell level extends the duration, but weirdly the damage\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t increase. 5d10 is a nice pile of damage, but it doesn&#8217;t scale with\n\t\t\tspell level and at some point the target will get smart enough to wake up,\n\t\t\ttrigger the 5d10 damage, take a short rest, then go about their business.\n\t\t\tIf the damage scaled this would be less of a problem, but damage is so\n\t\t\teasily repaired in 5e outside of combat that without further penalties\n\t\t\tGeas is more a tax on hit dice than the magical shackles it&#8217;s intended to\n\t\t\tbe.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you want a homebrew fix, add a level of fatigue each day that the\n\t\t\ttarget is out of compliance, or make the damage impossible to heal until\n\t\t\tthey go a day without taking it.

With the exception of undead, this works on any\n\t\tcreature type, and paralysis takes a creature out of a fight almost as much\n\t\tas killing them. If you have an ally who fights in melee, send them to\n\t\tfollow up with melee attacks. Automatic critical hits are too hard to pass\n\t\tup many melee allies.

But it&#8217;s also a slow way to kill the sort of\n\t\thigh-CR creature which you typically want to use this on, and for the same\n\t\tspell slot you could cast Fireball and deal 10d6 damage to everything in an\n\t\tAOE rather than 8d6 to one target and <em>maybe<\/em> more damage the next\n\t\tround.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Infernal Calling<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: If Summon Greater\n\t\tDemon was a frustrating gamble, Infernal Calling is even more difficult.

Casting Summon Greater Demon will get you a\n\t\tcreature of the same CR, which will likely be sufficient, and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire so much real-world work. There&#8217;s an option to summon individual\n\t\tdevils using their talisman, but getting one of those would be a plot point\n\t\twhich the DM would need to include, so don&#8217;t gamble on that happening.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Jallarzi&#8217;s Storm of Radiance<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The AOE isn&#8217;t amazing,\n\t\tand the damage isn&#8217;t very good, but the debuffs are great, and the scaling\n\t\tis excellent. By comparison, Fireball scales at 1d6 per spell level (average\n\t\t3.5), Circle of Death scales at 2d6 (average 7), and Jallarzi&#8217;s Storm of\n\t\tRadiance scales at 2d10 (average 11), so Storm of Radiance will do more\n\t\tdamage than Fireball when you upcast both to Level 7. Even better, you can\n\t\tforce enemies into the area to repeatedly take the damage. However, this\n\t\ttargets Constitution saves, which tend to be high. In a fight in a small\n\t\tspace where you can easily push enemies back into the area, such as by using\n\t\tthe Push Weapon Mastery, this is great.

Compare it to Hold Monster against a single\n\t\ttarget, which is the same level. Hold Monster allows additional saves every\n\t\tround, though admittedly Paralyzed is more lethal than Incapacitated. The\n\t\ttarget is unaware of its surroundings, so you can reasonably get Advantage\n\t\ton attack rolls against it, but, as long as it isn&#8217;t damaged, you could also\n\t\tfully restrain the target before the spell&#8217;s duration expires. However, the\n\t\ttarget gets Advantage on their save if you&#8217;re fighting it, so you need to\n\t\thit them with this before fighting starts. That typically means before\n\t\tInitiative is rolled, unfortunately.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you need to incapacitate a creature in an encounter with multiple\n\t\t\tenemies, your enemies likely won&#8217;t know how to break the effect (except by\n\t\t\tkilling you), and once you&#8217;ve defeated everything else you can use Modify\n\t\t\tMemory to convince the target that the other creatures attacked them and\n\t\t\tyou came to their rescue.

Very few creatures are good at\n\t\tintelligence saves, so expect most creatures to fail the save. The 8d6\n\t\tdamage feels underwhelming at this spell level, but subtracting a d6 from\n\t\tattack rolls and ability checks for a full minute is a significant debuff.\n\t\tThis is a good option to start a fight with a large number of martial\n\t\tenemies because they&#8217;ll be impacted most by debuff and most martial enemies\n\t\thave poor Intelligence saves.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Telekinesis<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fantastically\n\t\tversatile.

It&#8217;s perfectly fine to hold them 30 feet off the ground roughly 30\n\t\t\tfeet away from you horizontally. The target falls prone if they take\n\t\t\tdamage from the fall, which should slow most creatures enough that they\n\t\t\tcan&#8217;t get into melee with you without dashing. Then you can attempt to\n\t\t\tpick them up again on your next turn because the spell lasts 10 minutes\n\t\t\tand you can use it every turn without limit.

Now that\n\t\tcombination is specifically prohibited, but transmuting rock to mud is still\n\t\ta decent combination. Adventuring frequently takes you to places with stone\n\t\tfloors and ceilings like caves and castles, and even if you don&#8217;t use this\n\t\tto restrain enemies, you can use it for things like walking through walls,\n\t\tcollapsing structures, or generally just ruining anything made of stone.

Creatures are only blinded if they&#8217;re in the wall when you create it,\n\t\tand creatures can move through the wall totally unaffected. The save is\n\t\tConstitution-based and Constitution saves tend to be high, and since\n\t\tcreatures get another save every round you can&#8217;t count on the blindness to\n\t\tlast more than a round or two. Even the ability to short rays from the wall\n\t\tis disappointing, dealing the same 4d8 damage and not re-applying\n\t\tblindness.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wall of Stone<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: While it certainly\n\t\tisn&#8217;t glamorous, it&#8217;s difficult to overstate how effective a solid stone\n\t\tbarrier can be at solving problems. Walling off some of the enemies an\n\t\tencounter can take one challenging counter and make it two very easy\n\t\tback-to-back encounters. You do need to maintain Concentration, but that\n\t\talso means that when you&#8217;re ready to deal with whatever you decided to wall\n\t\toff temporarily you can just drop Concentration rather than breaking down\n\t\tyour own wall. Outside of a life of adventure, this spell is powerful enough\n\t\tthat you could make a decent living in construction based on this spell\n\t\talone.

You&#8217;ll be able to get more total damage from a normal AOE damage\n\t\tspell because you&#8217;ll likely be able to hit more targets, but that misses the\n\t\tprimary appeal of Chain Lightning. Chain Lightning is good because you can\n\t\tcast into a crowded area which might include your own allies without any\n\t\trisk of friendly fire. The spell level scaling adds additional targets\n\t\trather than additional damage, so you can easily cast this at a level that\n\t\thits exactly as many targets as you feel the need to hit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Circle of Death<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very slightly less\n\t\tdamage than a level 6 Fireball. The big improvements are Circle of Death&#8217;s\n\t\tdamage type and its absolutely massive 60-foot radius area of effect. With\n\t\tsuch a large area and a target-rich environment you could easily deal more\n\t\ttotal damage than with Fireball. The scaling is also unusually good, adding\n\t\t2 dice per spell level rather than 1 like most spells do, including\n\t\tFireball. However, it also targets Constitution saves, which are\n\t\tconsistently high, so Fireball may continue to be a safer go-to area damage\n\t\toption. Reserve this for exceptionally large groups of enemies.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Circle of Death competes for space on the Wizard&#8217;s spell list with\n\t\t\tFreezing Sphere, which has more range and deals comparable damage but has\n\t\t\ta worse damage type.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Contingency<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is the ultimate\n\t\tinsurance policy. The material component is very expensive, but this spell\n\t\tis phenomenally useful. If you&#8217;re unsure what to pick, go for conditions and\n\t\tspells which will keep you alive like &#8220;when I fall to 0 hit points,\n\t\tpolymorph me into a giant eagle&#8221;, or &#8220;when I fall below half hit points but\n\t\tnot to 0, cast Invisibility&#8221;. Remember that you actually cast your\n\t\tcontingent spell when you cast Contingency, so you need to provide any\n\t\tmaterial components (potentially consuming them), and there&#8217;s no guarantee\n\t\tthat your contingent spell will be triggered, so avoid spells with an\n\t\texpensive material component unless they&#8217;re a really good option for some\n\t\treason. Once you get access to Wish, you can use it to make most spells in\n\t\tthe game available, so don&#8217;t shy away from cleric options like Revivify.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Create Homunculus<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you don&#8217;t mind the\n\t\t1,000gp component cost for a fancy dagger, this is a nice way to get another\n\t\tpermanent pet. The homunculus has some advantages over familiars:\n\t\tdarkvision, flight, a telepathic bond with you, and the ability to attack on\n\t\tits own. However, it&#8217;s still very frail and the only way to address that is\n\t\tto give it part of your hit points maximum. Wizards are notoriously frail,\n\t\twhich makes that a terrifying gamble, especially considering that you can\n\t\tjust recreate your homunculus by casting the spell again so long as you\n\t\thaven&#8217;t lost your fancy dagger. Most likely, your homunculus will serve\n\t\tbasically the same role as a familiar: a scout, a courier, and occasionally\n\t\ta vehicle for Dragon Breath. If your familiar or someone else in the party\n\t\tcan fill those roles already, you might skip this spell and spend that\n\t\t1,000gp elsewhere.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>I&#8217;d also like to take a moment to call out the new homunculus art:\n\t\t\thomunculi are typically depicted as grotesque human-like things resembling\n\t\t\ta partially-melted baby doll with wings, but the new official art\n\t\t\tresembles a somewhat-cute bat-frog-squirrel thing. I think that&#8217;s an\n\t\t\tartistic improvement, but if you still want a flying nightmare baby you&#8217;re\n\t\t\tfree to imagine your homunculus however you like so long as you don&#8217;t draw\n\t\t\tme a picture of it.<\/p\n\t\t><\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Create Undead<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you just need\n\t\tsomething to ride around on or a minion to carry your treasure, use Animate\n\t\tDead. If you want to have an intelligent thrall to handle complex tasks or\n\t\tto act as a bodyguard, use Create Undead. But remember: undead are evil and\n\t\twill murder you at the first opportunity, and generally DMs don&#8217;t like\n\t\tplayers dragging an undead army around behind them.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Disintegrate<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Among the most damaging\n\t\tsingle-target damage spells in the game, Disintegrate&#8217;s single-target damage\n\t\tis roughly equivalent to 21d6 (total average of 75). On a Dexterity save\n\t\tit&#8217;s tempting to use this against big, bulky foes who tend to have a lot of\n\t\thit points to burn though. Ideally you can save-or-suck those sorts of\n\t\tcreatures, but sometimes things like legendary resistances make that hard.\n\t\tYou can also use disintegrate to remove problematic things like walls of\n\t\tforce (or of anything else), allowing you to do things like toppling\n\t\tstructures or bursting through walls to surprise enemies on the other\n\t\tside.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Drawmij&#8217;s Instant Summons<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Very situational, and\n\t\t<em>very<\/em> expensive. But for important items (your spellbook, favorite\n\t\tmagic items, etc.) you might still want to use this.

A save-or-suck\n\t\tto put targets to sleep every turn is hard to beat, and the fact that you\n\t\tcan do it every turn is spectacular. Sure, targets only remain asleep until\n\t\tthe spell ends, but that&#8217;s plenty of time for someone else in your party to\n\t\twalk over and deliver a guaranteed critical hit. When the target wakes from\n\t\ttaking damage they&#8217;ll still be prone, and on your next turn you&#8217;re free to\n\t\tput them to sleep again.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Fizban&#8217;s Platinum Shield<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">FToD<\/a>)<\/sup>: Fantastically\n\t\tversatile, this is a great defense against common area damage effects like\n\t\tbreath weapons and fireballs.

Once this is up,\n\t\tenemies can&#8217;t even cast Counterspell because it targets you and you&#8217;re\n\t\tinside the sphere, and Globe of Invulnerability cares about the spell&#8217;s base\n\t\tlevel rather than the level of the spell slot used to cast it. Even in\n\t\tfights with spellcasters who can cast Level 9 spell slots, you can cast this\n\t\tas a Level 9 spell and use Counterspell against any Level 9 Wizard Spells\n\t\twhich they cast (though they&#8217;ll still get a save).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>This spell also uniquely cripples enemy Warlocks, since their spell slots\n\t\t\tcap at 5th level and they&#8217;re heavily reliant on Cantrips.

The 30-foot cube area is enough to fill a\n\t\tdecently large stage, allowing you to script entire plays (albeit short\n\t\tones). The triggering condition is flexible enough that you can use a\n\t\tseparate casting of Programmed Illusion to trigger it. There&#8217;s a 10-minute\n\t\tcooldown on each performance, but you could have three spells overlapping to\n\t\ttrigger a perpetual 15-minute loop. Just to mess with people, you could add\n\t\tanother Programmed Illusion that triggers when another one is either\n\t\tdispelled or discovered to be an illusion.

First, while you gain\n\t\tproficiency in armor and shields and weapons, you probably don&#8217;t just have\n\t\tdecent armor and stuff laying around, and donning full plate takes longer\n\t\tthan the spell lasts. Second, if you lose Concentration, you&#8217;re now in armor\n\t\tin which you&#8217;re likely not proficient, so you can&#8217;t cast spells. If you&#8217;re\n\t\tnot already decent with a weapon, this won&#8217;t help.

Advantage with your attacks and a bonus 2d12\n\t\t\tforce damage on top of all of that is a huge pile of damage output, easily\n\t\t\toffsetting the damage lost from Booming Blade.

Upcasting Minute Meteors gets you a total of 14\n\t\tmeteors for a total of 28d6 damage (assuming that nothing passes the save,\n\t\tof course). Crown of Stars will deal a total of 28d12 at the same spell\n\t\tlevel, and it&#8217;s delivered much faster over considerably fewer projectiles.\n\t\tIf we ignore the possibility of critical hits from Crown of Stars, you would\n\t\tstill need to hit two targets per meteor with Melf&#8217;s Minute Meteors to\n\t\texceed Crown of Stars&#8217; average damage, and considering you need to do it 14\n\t\ttimes in the span of 10 minutes that seems incredibly unlikely. If you&#8217;ve\n\t\tbeen relying on minute meteors, it&#8217;s time to upgrade. Crown of Stars doesn&#8217;t\n\t\trequire Concentration, and with a 1-hour duration you get six times as long\n\t\tto spend half as many projectiles. This may not be a go-to option for every\n\t\tspellcaster, but if you can set it up before you walk into a fight and if\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t normally have many uses for your Bonus Action, it&#8217;s a great boost\n\t\tto your damage output.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Delayed Blast Fireball<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational and\n\t\tpotentially very hard to use to its full effect, but if you can make it work\n\t\tthe maximum of 22d6 damage (avg. 77) is hard to beat.

With a 20-foot radius, most creatures can easily walk out of\n\t\t\tthe cloud.

While damage\n\t\tis fantastic and it certainly does plenty of it, if you don&#8217;t outright kill\n\t\tyour targets you&#8217;ll still need to deal with them the next round. Also, keep\n\t\tin mind that targets can only be affected once, so don&#8217;t both making the\n\t\tspheres overlap.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Power Word Kill<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Outright kill the\n\t\ttarget, and their only way to resist is to have more than 100 hp (or\n\t\tCounterspell or something). Unfortunately, without a ton of metagaming it&#8217;s\n\t\tvery difficult to know if the target has less than 100 hit points. And, even\n\t\tif they do, Power Word Kill isn&#8217;t necessarily your best option. Meteor Swarm\n\t\tdeals an average of 140 damage, so, if the target is at less than 100 hit\n\t\tpoints, they&#8217;re in trouble anyway. Granted, you can&#8217;t Meteor Swarm someone\n\t\tacross a dinner table, but I think Meteor Swarm (or any other damage spell,\n\t\treally) will be more reliable in most situations where you need to end a\n\t\tlife in the space of a few seconds. The damage inflicted if the target\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t die is a disappointing consolation prize.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Prismatic Wall<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ultimate area\n\t\tcontrol spell. 10-minute duration with no Concentration, you and your allies\n\t\tcan pass through it unharmed, and if enemies move through it they can take\n\t\tup to 50d6 damage, be turned to stone, and be sent to another plane. The\n\t\twall can be destroyed, but the process to do so is so laughably obnoxious\n\t\tthat I doubt anyone would actually try it (it&#8217;s a relic of early editions of\n\t\tDnD). Drop a spell like Maddening Darkness or Sickening Radiance, then\n\t\tencircle your enemies in a spherical Prismatic Wall. They&#8217;ll either die from\n\t\tongoing damage, or they&#8217;ll die from touching the wall. Or if you don&#8217;t want\n\t\tto waste two spell slots, forcibly moves enemies through the wall using\n\t\tthings like Telekinesis or by having allies grapple or shove enemies through\n\t\tthe wall.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>It&#8217;s possible to cast the wall horizontally, which allows you to do\n\t\t\tthings like knocking enemies into the air by any number of means, causing\n\t\t\tthem to pass through the wall on the way up and again on the way down.\n\t\t\tThis is incredibly effective, but so is having an ally grapple an enemy\n\t\t\tand then walk them back and forth through the wall several times in one\n\t\t\tturn.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Scream<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Up to 10 creatures\n\t\twithin 90 feet of you in any direction. Intelligence saves are the weakest\n\t\tsave on average, even for high-CR monsters, so in many cases you can Stun\n\t\tenemies and keep them stunned for an incredibly long time. There&#8217;s no\n\t\tduration on the stun effect, so enemies with poor Intelligence may be\n\t\t<em>permanently stunned<\/em>. The damage is fine, but that&#8217;s absolutely an\n\t\tafter-thought compared to the stun effect.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Shapechange<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ability to change\n\t\tforms while still under the effects of a single casting makes you\n\t\tfantastically versatile, allowing you to change forms to suit the situation\n\t\tat a moment&#8217;s notice. However, it takes an action to change forms, so you\n\t\twant to avoid doing so in combat.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because you retain your ability to cast spells, casting this in yourself\n\t\t\tmostly adds your form&#8217;s special abilities on top of your incredible\n\t\t\tspellcasting ability. If the creature you polymorph into can cast spells,\n\t\t\tyou gain their spellcasting, though you&#8217;ll likely need to recalculate\n\t\t\ttheir spell attack and spell save DCs since you retain your own mental\n\t\t\tability scores.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>It&#8217;s very important to remember that you <em>do not<\/em> gain the\n\t\t\tcreature&#8217;s proficiencies. If you turn yourself into something using armor\n\t\t\tor weapons that you don&#8217;t know how to use, you&#8217;re going to have some\n\t\t\tproblems.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Polymorph spells grant Temporary Hit Points in the 2024 rules, but you\n\t\t\tcan still change into a creature with Regeneration, such as a troll, if\n\t\t\tyou need to recover some hp between fights without resorting to resting.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, Shapechange only grants you THP for the first form, so you\n\t\t\twant your first form to have a ton of hit points, then switch to a more\n\t\t\toffensively powerful form.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Because this spell involves quite a bit of math and modifications to a\n\t\t\tstat block, I recommend planning your favorite forms well ahead of time.\n\t\t\tWrite down any changes to the creature&#8217;s stat block so that you&#8217;re not\n\t\t\tcalculating them in the middle of combat.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Time Stop<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: 1d4+1 turns in a row\n\t\tlets you do a lot to trivialize an encounter. If you want to be extra mean\n\t\tabout it, you could drop a Delayed Blast Fireball, wall off the area with\n\t\tsomething like Stone Shape, then teleport away.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">True Polymorph<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you want to use this\n\t\tto turn yourself into a creature and fight in that form, Shapechange is\n\t\tobjectively better. True Polymorph&#8217;s advantage is that it can affect other\n\t\tcreatures.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Turning a creature into another creature can be used to turn yourself or\n\t\t\tan ally into a big scary monster or you can use it to turn an enemy into\n\t\t\tsomething harmless. The target gets Temporary Hit Points equal to the new\n\t\t\tform&#8217;s max hp, so you can turn them into something like a frog to give\n\t\t\tthem a pittance of THP. The spell doesn&#8217;t end when the THP is depleted, so\n\t\t\tyou now have 1 hour to smash your way through your target&#8217;s hit points\n\t\t\twhile they&#8217;re using frog stats for everything except AC and alignment.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The second option lets you turn an object into a friendly creature.\n\t\t\tYou&#8217;ll want to spend some time research CR 9 creatures, then look for\n\t\t\tpowerful options that are as small as possible so that you can use them in\n\t\t\tas many situations as possible. A summon spell will likely be just as good\n\t\t\tin combat, but creating something that can cast spells can get you access\n\t\t\tto a bunch of useful spellcasting without worrying about things like\n\t\t\texpensive spell components.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The spell&#8217;s final option allows you to turn a creature into an object.\n\t\t\tTurn them into a flower pot, then either throw them into a demiplane,\n\t\t\tplane shift them to Carceri, or dispose of them in some other permanent\n\t\t\tand irrevocable fashion like a bag of devouring. There is no rules text on\n\t\t\twhat happens when you break the object, unfortunately, so you&#8217;ll need to\n\t\t\tdiscuss that with your DM.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For more, see our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/true-polymorph-and-shapechange\/\">Practical Guide to True Polymorph and Shapechange<\/a\n\t\t\t>.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weird<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Like Phantasmal Killer\n\t\tfor every creature in a 30-foot radius.
