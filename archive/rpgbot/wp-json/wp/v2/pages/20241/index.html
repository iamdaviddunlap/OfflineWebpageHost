However, the reality of playing a bard is typically much different. With excellent skills, full spellcasting, and a roster of useful buffs, the Bard is a jack of all trades capable of filling a variety of roles within the party, making them simultaneously the easier character to add to any party and also one of the best options for your own player characters. I played a bard on my first playthrough, and found that I could talk my way through many situations and magic my way through the others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Since they&#8217;re almost universally built around Charisma and Dexterity, bards can serve as your party&#8217;s Face and your party&#8217;s Scout. Throw in their save-or-suck offensive spellcasting, and they can also serve as a Controller, debuffing or entirely eliminating enemies. Still better, they can learn Healing Word, allowing them to replace a cleric in the vast majority of cases. The Bard&#8217;s subclasses also allow them to play a front-line martial character (or at least pretend convincingly), but that is arguably the class&#8217;s weakest capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Bards rely primarily on spell slots, so at a glance they appear to fit well\n\tinto a party that leans on long rests. However, their Song of Rest feature and\n\tFont of Inspiration both pull them toward parties which favor short rests. A\n\tbard that manages their resources well can thrive in either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Bard Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#subclasses\">Bard Subclasses<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#college-of-lore\">College of Lore<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-valour\">College of Valour<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-swords\">College of Swords<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Bard Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Bard Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#dwarf\">Dwarf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dragonborn\">Dragonborn<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#drow\">Drow<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#elf\">Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#gnome\">Gnome<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#githyanki\">Githyanki<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfelf\">Half-Elf<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halforc\">Half-Orc<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#halfling\">Halfling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#human\">Human<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#tiefling\">Tiefling<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Bard Skills<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Bard Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Bard Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Bard Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Bard Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Bard Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example\">Bard Example Build &#8211; Lore Bard Jack of All Trades<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skill-proficiencies\">Skill Proficiencies<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses a color coding scheme to rate individual character options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Hand crossbow proficiency\n\tmeans that you can dual-wield hand crossbows for the sole purpose of having an\n\teasy way to spend your Bonus Action. College of Valour adds proficiency in\n\tmedium armor, shields, and martial weapons.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Bard&#8217;s primary function.\n\tBards get very few direct damage spells, but they get a lot of powerful\n\tsave-or-suck spells, great utility spells, and excellent buffs. Bards learn\n\ttheir spells permanently, so you are locked into whatever spells you choose to\n\tlearn, and you can only replace one known spell every time you gain a level.\n\tSee our\n\t<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/video-games\/baldurs-gate-3\/classes\/bard\/spells\/\">Bard Spells Breakdown<\/a\n\t>\n\tfor help choosing spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Bardic Inspiration<\/span>: A wonderful buff, and\n\tit improves as you gain levels. This is great to throw on an ally before they\n\tattempt to Shove an enemy, before they make a saving throw (ongoing saves\n\tagainst spells like Hold Person are easy to predict), or when an ally is\n\tmaking a skill check outside of combat. You notably can&#8217;t use it on yourself,\n\twhich is annoying.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic items available throughout the game can further improve your Bardic\n\tInspiration, adding rider effects like healing and temporary hit points, as\n\twell as expanding your number of uses per rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Song of Rest<\/span>: Great in parties that depend\n\theavily on short rests, but the abundance and easy availability of food to\n\tfuel long rests means that resting isn&#8217;t difficult, just time-consuming. If\n\tyou&#8217;re relying on buffs which last until your next long rest, especially via\n\tcamp casting, this extends how much play time you can get between rests. It\n\tdoesn&#8217;t make you any more effective, but it does somewhat reduce the tedium of\n\tcamp casting.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jack of All Trades<\/span>: Excellent for your own\n\tcharacter. It&#8217;s difficult and costly to be proficient in all skills, and this\n\twill cover skills that you haven&#8217;t taken proficiency in so you have a chance\n\tto succeed when those weird skills pop up.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Expertise<\/span>: Excellent for skills that you&#8217;ll\n\tuse frequently, such as Sleight of Hand and Persuasion.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Font of Inspiration<\/span>: Recharging Bardic\n\tInspiration on a short rest instead of a long rest is a huge boost in\n\teffectiveness.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Countercharm<\/span>: Only situationally useful,\n\tand the fact that it eats an Action and only lasts three turns makes it hard\n\tto justify using in nearly any encounter.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Secrets<\/span>: Extremely powerful. It&#8217;s\n\tnot as flexible as the tabletop version, but it&#8217;s still amazing. We&#8217;ll have a\n\tguide for just this feature very soon.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subclasses\">Bard Subclasses<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-lore\">College of Lore<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Do you like bards? Do you want to be the bard-est bard that ever did bard? Well, you\u2019ll have to play College of Lore instead of College of Eloquence because that&#8217;s not in the game. It leans into the core concepts of the class and makes them even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Cutting Words<\/span>: Use your Bardic\n\tInspiration as a Reaction to prevent enemies from succeeding on rolls. The\n\tgame will automatically use this by default, quickly eating both your\n\tReactions and your Bardic Inspiration uses, so be sure to set this to &#8220;Ask&#8221; in\n\tthe Reactions menu (K on your keyboard). When prompted, the game will tell you\n\tboth what the creature rolled and what they need to succeed. Choose whether or\n\tnot to use Cutting Words based on how likely it is that you&#8217;ll change the\n\toutcome. Turning a narrow success into a failure can make your spells more\n\treliable and make enemies less threatening.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Skill Proficiencies<\/span>: 3 skills is a\n\tlot. Bards already get 3 (rather than the standard 2 from your class), giving\n\tyou a total of 6 skills without considering your race. Of course, this makes\n\tJack of All Trades much less interesting, but don&#8217;t let that stop you.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>6: <span class=\"rating-blue\">Magical Secrets<\/span>: 2 additional Magical\n\tSecrets options is a massive improvement to your versatility.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-valour\">College of Valour<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>College of Valour adds some durability and improved weapon options to the\n\tBard. Unfortunately, much of what you get is outright worse than what&#8217;s\n\toffered by other subclasses or by the core class features or by race\n\tfeatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering College of Valour, you need to ask yourself &#8220;could I get\n\tthese benefits elsewhere at a lower cost?&#8221; The answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;, and those\n\tplaces include githyanki, half-elf, human, and many multiclass dips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Proficiencies<\/span>: Medium armor,\n\tshields, and martial weapons are intended to improve your ability to fight\n\tlike a martial character. In the tabletop rules, medium armor gets largely\n\tignored since martial bards need to be built around Dexterity, but there are\n\tarmors in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 which allow you to add your full Dexterity bonus to\n\tAC. Shields are an easy and excellent improvement to your durability. Martial\n\tweapons will be largely ignored since you already get hand crossbows and\n\trapiers.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Inspiration<\/span>: The easy\n\tavailability of attack bonuses from items or positioning makes it hard to\n\tjustify using Bardic Inspiration on an attack roll, but adding it to AC could\n\tprevent a big hit.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>6: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Even with this, the Bard\n\tsimply isn&#8217;t good enough at using weapons to justify using weapons instead of\n\tcasting spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-swords\">College of Swords<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>College of Swords abandons College of Valor&#8217;s foolish ideas of durability and\n\tleans harder into weapon use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting your build with a single level of fighter is a great addition here.\n\tConstitution saves, shields, and a second Fighting Style is a huge\n\timprovement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-green\">Extra Proficiencies<\/span>: In the tabletop\n\trules, medium armor gets largely ignored since martial bards need to be built\n\taround Dexterity, but there are armors in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 which allow you to\n\tadd your full Dexterity bonus to AC. Proficiency in scimitars adds another\n\tmelee weapon option that works for the Bard, but it&#8217;s not especially\n\timpactful.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>3: <span class=\"rating-green\">Blade Flourish<\/span>: Blade Flourish is fun\n\tand allows you to attack with a rider effect in place of one attack during\n\tyour Action. However, it uses charges of Bardic Inspiration, and it will\n\trarely be more impactful than helping an ally succeed on a crucial skill check\n\tor saving throw. It&#8217;s also completely unusable with your off-hand attack.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that Blade Flourish works at range, so dual-wielding hand crossbows is absolutely a viable choice. You still can&#8217;t use flourishes with your off-hand attack, but don&#8217;t let that stop you from fighting at a distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Defensive Flourish<\/span>: Great if you&#8217;re\n\t\texpecting to draw several attacks before your next turn, but don&#8217;t use it\n\t\tevery turn or it will eat all of your Bardic Inspiration uses too\n\t\tquickly.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mobile Flourish<\/span>: This is a huge push. Use\n\t\tthis to knock enemies off of cliffs and to push them into area control\n\t\teffects.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Slashing Flourish<\/span>: A good way to handle\n\t\tmultiple enemies. Since you can use this once per attack, once you get Extra\n\t\tAttack you can hit four enemies with one Action.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>3: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Fighting Style<\/span>: Only two choices,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dueling<\/span>: The damage boost will feel\n\t\tminor once you start finding magic items, and when you spend your Action to\n\t\tcast a spell you won&#8217;t benefit at all.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: The ability to\n\t\tattack with an off-hand weapon as a Bonus Action while still casting a spell\n\t\tas an Action means that you&#8217;ll benefit from this damage boost\n\t\tfrequently.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t>6: <span class=\"rating-orange\">Extra Attack<\/span>: Even with this, the Bard\n\tsimply isn&#8217;t good enough at using weapons to justify using weapons instead of\n\tcasting spells.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Bard Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump stat.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: AC and weapon attacks if you choose to\n\tuse them.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Hit points, saves, Concentration.<\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: A few skills that you can live\n\twithout.

Sometimes you have enemies close together, so you have an ally throw a bottle of water at them and then you drop a cold damage glyph on them. Sometimes you&#8217;re surrounded and stuff is going poorly, so you drop a sleep glyph since it doesn&#8217;t affect your allies and tip-toe past the sleeping enemies while your party enjoys some free crits on said sleeping enemies.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Greater Invisibility<\/td><td>Put Greater Invisibility on your party&#8217;s rogue and stand back.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Feat: Ability Score Increase (Charisma 18 -&gt; 20)<br>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Hypnotic Pattern<\/td><td>We&#8217;re dipping back to 3rd-level spells because your 4th-level options aren&#8217;t great.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>&#8211; Dominate Person<\/td><td>Why yes, I love having new friends!

However, the reality of playing a bard is typically much different. With excellent skills, full spellcasting, and a roster of useful buffs, the Bard is a jack of all trades capable of filling a variety of roles within the party, making them simultaneously the easier character to add to any party and also one of the best options for your own player characters. I played a bard on my first playthrough, and found that I could talk my way through many situations and magic my way through the others.
