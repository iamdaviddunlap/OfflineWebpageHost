Spells which might be\n\tweak or too expensive for other spellcasters like the Wizard are frequently\n\tbetter options for the Warlock since spells are always cast at the same spell\n\tlevel. This often makes it easier to directly &#8220;upgrade&#8221; from one spell known\n\tto another when other spellcasters will typically stick to lower-level\n\t&#8220;inexpensive&#8221; options to solve the same problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a comprehensive guide to every available spell, as that would be\n\tan exercise in madness.

In exchange, you get a better damage type and the\n\t\ttarget can&#8217;t regain hit points for a turn which can be a big help against\n\t\tenemies with regeneration or enemy clerics. This also imposes Disadvantage\n\t\ton the next attack if the target is undead, but many undead also have\n\t\tresistance to necrotic damage so Chill Touch isn&#8217;t always a good option\n\t\tagainst undead. Still, if you need a staple, go-to damage cantrip that isn&#8217;t\n\t\tEldritch Blast, Chill Touch is a great option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Create Bonfire<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Passable are control,\n\t\tespecially for a cantrip, but it requires Concentration which is often a\n\t\tproblem because many of the Warlock&#8217;s best leveled spells (including options\n\t\tlike Hex and Hunger of Hadar) typically require Concentration.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Blast<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The second highest\n\t\tdamage of any cantrip in the game (at least base damage; Agonizing Blast\n\t\tputs Eldritch Blast well ahead of everything else), and it deals Force\n\t\tdamage, so almost nothing is immune to it. Since you get multiple attacks\n\t\tit&#8217;s more reliable than other cantrips which are hit-or-miss, but you&#8217;re\n\t\talso more likely to only deal partial damage compared to single-attack\n\t\tcantrips. Be sure to pick up Agonizing Blast for a spectacular damage\n\t\tboost.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Friends<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: This is hard to use. 1\n\t\tminute is not a lot of time, and you generally need to put distance between\n\t\tyourself and the subject of the spell before they turn hostile. You could\n\t\tuse this to intimidate a creature into fleeing, but in most cases you&#8217;ll\n\t\tprobably be using this quickly talk your way past a creature blocking your\n\t\tway like a guard at a gate. You generally won&#8217;t need this; between high\n\t\tCharisma and skill proficiencies it&#8217;s easy to cover all of the Face\n\t\tskills.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Frostbite<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Low damage for\n\t\ta cantrip (d6-based), but the big appeal is Disadvantage on the target&#8217;s\n\t\tnext weapon attack. Unfortunately, it works on Constitution saving throws,\n\t\tand those tend to be relatively high compared to other saving throws.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Green-Flame<\/span>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Blade<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): If\n\t\tyou are a Hexblade and you don&#8217;t take this, you are making a mistake. Until\n\t\tyou get Thirsting Blade, this is a straight damage boost. Even when you get\n\t\tThirsting Blade, Green-Flame Blade may do more damage in some circumstances,\n\t\tand Green-Flame Blade will continue to scale in damage long after you stop\n\t\tgetting additional weapon attacks.

The damage is low\n\t\tbut tolerable, and the forced movement is enough to make it useful by\n\t\tforcing enemies to move around in dangerous places or move out of a grapple\n\t\tdespite your lack of control over the direction.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lightning Lure<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tSituational, but potentially useful for hexblades to pull enemies into\n\t\tmelee. Despite the 15-foot range, this can be a great option for melee\n\t\twarlocks. Against enemies with poor Strength (like many enemy spellcasters),\n\t\tyou can use this to drag them into melee with you and force them to teleport\n\t\tor Disengage in order to get away from you unharmed. If you&#8217;re flying, you\n\t\tmay even be able to pull enemies into the air to cause a small amount of\n\t\tfalling damage. Since it only has Verbal components, you can easily use this\n\t\twithout juggling your weapon. poor save DC you&#8217;ll only be successful with\n\t\tthis against physically weak foes.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mage Hand<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: The ability to move\n\t\tobjects at a safe distance is profoundly useful. Use it to pull levers, open\n\t\tdoors, sort your laundry, and all manner of other important but potentially\n\t\thazardous tasks where you wouldn&#8217;t want to risk your own hands.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Magic Stone<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Eldritch Blast\n\t\tis similar, more effective, less work, and can be improved with invocations.\n\t\tThere is a tiny window at level 1 where Magic Stone may deal one more point\n\t\tof damage on average, but the Warlock can&#8217;t replace their cantrips (unless\n\t\tyou&#8217;re using Optional Class Features) and dealing one extra point of damage\n\t\tat level 1 isn&#8217;t worth being saddled with this for your whole career.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>That said, there is a small niche where Magic Stone may be useful. Pact\n\t\t\tof the Chain allows your familiar to attack, but few familiars have a\n\t\t\tranged attack option (literally only sprites), often forcing them to move\n\t\t\tinto melee to attack. You can cast Magic Stone and gives the stones to\n\t\t\tyour familiar for them to use in order to attack at range.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Taking the Attack action to have your familiar attack this way is a huge\n\t\t\twaste compared to casting a cantrip, but using Investment of the Chain\n\t\t\tMaster to command your familiar to take the Attack action essentially\n\t\t\tmeans that you spend a Bonus Action to throw a stone for 1d6+Charisma\n\t\t\tdamage without the risk of your familiar diving into melee and hoping to\n\t\t\tmake it back out alive despite single-digit maximum hp. The biggest\n\t\t\tchallenge is managing your Bonus Actions, but if you can manage one or two\n\t\t\trock attacks per encounter without changing any of your other tactics,\n\t\t\tMagic Stone becomes an easy source of additional damage output.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mind Sliver<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional): Psychic\n\t\tdamage on an Intelligence save is spectacular on its own. Intelligence saves\n\t\tare consistently among the lowest, and psychic damage resistance\/immunity is\n\t\trare (though it does exist, especially on mindless enemies like zombies).\n\t\tThat alone makes Mind Sliver arguably the most reliable cantrip damage in\n\t\t5e, but it gets better from there. With only Verbal components, Mind Sliver\n\t\tworks while you&#8217;re tied up or have your hands full, making it a great option\n\t\tfor War Caster. It also imposes a -1d4 penalty on the target&#8217;s next saving\n\t\tthrow making them an easier target for save-or-suck spells, or you can just\n\t\trepeatedly hit them with Mind Sliver and watch enemies try to beat your\n\t\tspell save DC with a +0 save bonus and the -1d4 penalty from your previous\n\t\thit.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Minor Illusion<\/span>:\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Room for plenty of\n\t\tcreative, deceptive uses. The 5-foot cube is easily enough to create\n\t\tsomething to hide behind, provided that your enemies don&#8217;t see you create\n\t\tthe illusion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Poison Spray<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Use Toll the Dead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Prestidigitation<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Whenever you want to do\n\t\tsomething small and magical that&#8217;s not covered by another spell, it&#8217;s\n\t\tusually covered by prestidigitation. This spell is exceptionally versatile.\n\t\tFor suggestions on how to use Prestidigitation to its fullest, see my\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/prestidigitation\"\n\t\t\t>Practical Guide to Prestidigitation<\/a\n\t\t>.\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Sword<\/span>\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Burst<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SCAG \/ TCoE<\/a>)<\/sup> (Optional):\n\t\tDealing with crowds of enemies is often difficult for weapon users, and the\n\t\tHexblade is no exception. Even with Thirsting Blade, Sword Burst will deal\n\t\tconsistently more damage any time you&#8217;re facing three or more adjacent\n\t\tenemies. See my article on\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/melee_cantrips\"\n\t\t\t>Melee Cantrips vs. Extra Attack<\/a\n\t\t>\n\t\tfor a breakdown of the math comparing melee cantrip spells to normal martial\n\t\tattacks. Other warlocks should avoid needing this.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Thunderclap<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC<\/a>)<\/sup>: Thunder damage is\n\t\tworse than Sword Burst&#8217;s force damage, and Thunderclap uses Constitution\n\t\tsaves, which tend to be high.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Toll the Dead<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Enemies spend most of\n\t\ttheir time in an encounter with less than full hit points, so the d12 damage\n\t\tscaling will occur more often than the d8 scaling. Between that and\n\t\ttargeting Wisdom saves instead of consistently high Constitution saves, Toll\n\t\tthe Dead is already a massively better spell than Poison Spray. Of course,\n\t\tAgonizing Blast will make Eldritch Blast do considerably more damage, but\n\t\tEldritch Blast suffers Disadvantage while you&#8217;re adjacent to an enemy, so\n\t\tToll the Dead is a good backup option.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">True Strike<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Typically you&#8217;ll get\n\t\tbetter results from attacking twice rather than using this then attacking\n\t\tonce.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Armor of Agathys<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Exclusive to warlocks\n\t\tand a truly excellent defensive option, this both protects you and harms\n\t\tenemies. The scaling is fantastic, too, so it remains powerful and effective\n\t\tat every spell level. At high levels this may do more damage than casting\n\t\toffensive spells, especially against foes that make numerous attacks with\n\t\trelatively low damage. However, it requires that you be attacked and damaged\n\t\twith melee attacks, so if your AC is too high or if you fight at range it\n\t\twon&#8217;t work, and if you&#8217;re standing behind a defender it won&#8217;t matter.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Arms of Hadar<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: It&#8217;s more fun than\n\t\ttaking the Disengage action, but otherwise it&#8217;s unremarkable. The damage\n\t\tscaling is passable, but I wouldn&#8217;t consider this a go-to combat option. It\n\t\tmay be worth consideration if you&#8217;re a non-hexblade with a bad habit of\n\t\tgetting dragged into melee, but otherwise skip it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Cause Fear<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: A decent low-level\n\t\tcrowd control option, but it has some drawbacks and it becomes obsolete as\n\t\tother options come online. Frightened foes can&#8217;t move toward you, which is\n\t\tgreat for melee enemies which tend to have poor mental stats like many\n\t\tbeasts and many non-caster humanoids at low levels. Still, targets are able\n\t\tto attack (albeit with Disadvantage) and cast spells, and\n\t\tresistance\/immunity to fear is common.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Charm Person<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: If you can cast this on\n\t\ta target outside of combat without them noticing, this can be a great way to\n\t\tdefuse a potentially hostile situation. However, the spell has some\n\t\tcomplications. Charm Person has no visual effect like a ball of fire, so\n\t\tthere&#8217;s no visual indication that the spell succeeded or failed. The target\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;ve been targeted by the spell if they succeed on the\n\t\tsaving throw, but you don&#8217;t know if they succeeded or failed unless your DM\n\t\tdecides to tell you (and they are under no obligation to do so). So\n\t\tgenerally your best bet is to cast this and hope for the best before\n\t\tpresenting yourself to your target.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Comprehend Languages<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: You can&#8217;t learn every\n\t\tlanguage in 5e. It&#8217;s simply not possible. Replace this with Tongues as soon\n\t\tas possible. You&#8217;re using the same slot either way.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Distort Value<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">AI<\/a>)<\/sup>: If your DM allows you to\n\t\ttrade magic items, this might be incredibly useful. However, your DM might\n\t\talso find this incredibly annoying and punish you for using it by having\n\t\tangry traders track you down after an unfair trade. Discuss this spell with\n\t\tyour DM before you consider learning it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Expeditious Retreat<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Situational and poorly\n\t\tnamed. Expeditious Retreat is great for chases and for running long\n\t\tdistances, but those situations aren&#8217;t common enough to justify learning\n\t\tthis unless you know it&#8217;s going to happen. The duration is good and Dash as\n\t\ta bonus action offers a lot of extra speed, but since this requires\n\t\tConcentration you&#8217;ll almost always want a different buff instead.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hellish Rebuke<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Warlocks don&#8217;t get\n\t\tenough spell slots to devote one to this. The damage is decent and the\n\t\tscaling is good, but Armor of Agathys is better by a massive margin. For the\n\t\tWarlock, Hellish Rebuke&#8217;s only redeeming quality is that it is cast as a\n\t\treaction, but again Armor of Agathys is better because the damage is\n\t\tautomatic.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Hex<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: An excellent damage\n\t\tboost, especially once you get multiple rays with Eldritch Blast.

The effects are complicated, and the 4d10 damage looks\n\t\tunderwhelming, but don&#8217;t let that deter you. This is a great spell to cast\n\t\tinto a room then shut the door, but even if that&#8217;s not an option it&#8217;s a\n\t\tfantastic way to handle crowds. With a 30-foot radius you can hit a huge\n\t\tnumber of targets, and with a 10-minute duration you can easily kill\n\t\tanything stuck in the area for an extended period. The 4d10 damage is fine,\n\t\tand negating invisibility is great, but the real appeal is the levels of\n\t\tExhaustion. One level makes targets less able to resist grappling or other\n\t\tcrowd control spells like Maximilian&#8217;s Earthen Grasp or Web which your\n\t\tallies could cast to keep enemies in the area. Two levels halves targets&#8217;\n\t\tspeed, making it harder for them to move out of the area. Three levels\n\t\timposes Disadvantage on saves so their condition will deteriorate even\n\t\tfaster. If targets somehow survive until 5 levels of exhaustion (they&#8217;ll\n\t\thave taken 20d10 radiant damage by now, which is a lot), their speed drops\n\t\tto 0 so you no longer need to do anything to prevent escape. Just wait for\n\t\tthem to hit 6 levels of Exhaustion, which results in death if a total of\n\t\t24d10 radiant damage somehow hasn&#8217;t killed them.

The Monster Manual contains only a handful of skeleton and zombie\n\t\tstat blocks, and if you do something silly like raise a bunch of zombie\n\t\twolves your DM is going to need to generate a new stat block for them in the\n\t\tmiddle of a game session. At some point I&#8217;ll write a &#8220;Big Book of Skeletons&#8221;\n\t\tand &#8220;Big Book of Zombies&#8221; to convert every living creature in the Monster\n\t\tManual, but that&#8217;s probably a long way off. I think the intent is that you\n\t\tshould use the generic &#8220;Zombie&#8221; stat block used for humanoid zombies, but it\n\t\tnever explains what to do if players use this on any other kind of corpse.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>With that out of the way, the spell is just not very good. Creating 5 CR\n\t\t\t1\/4 creatures for up to an hour is not going to have a huge impact unless\n\t\t\tyou just need five lukewarm bodies to carry stuff around. There&#8217;s\n\t\t\tsomething to be said for the Zombie&#8217;s Undead Fortitude since most\n\t\t\tcreatures can&#8217;t deal radiant damage, but the DC for the save is going to\n\t\t\tbe too high so your zombies are still going to die quickly.

First, Enervation requires a Dexterity saving\n\t\tthrow rather than attack roll, and Dexterity saving throws tend to be poor\n\t\tfor both big tanky creatures and small squishy casters. Second, it does\n\t\tnecrotic damage, which is objectively more useful than lightning damage.\n\t\tThird and finally, Enervation heals you for half the damage it deals, so you\n\t\tcan cast this at the beginning of a fight, spend the whole fight using it to\n\t\tdeal automatic damage, and walk out at full hit points. The biggest issue I\n\t\tsee is that the ongoing damage will probably be lower than what you can get\n\t\tout of Eldritch Blast with Agonizing Blast. You get three rays not long\n\t\tafter you get this spell, and 3d10+15 (avg. 31.5) is higher than 4d8 (avg.\n\t\t18).

The target can&#8217;t see or hear outside\n\t\tof the mental prison, but you&#8217;re free to shoot them to death while they&#8217;re\n\t\trestrained. It&#8217;s not quite as restrictive as being paralyzed by Hold\n\t\tMonster, but it&#8217;s considerably more reliable and the target doesn&#8217;t get\n\t\tadditional saves every round. The target can technically still see and hear,\n\t\tbut only within the illusion, and most offensive spells require line of\n\t\tsight so the best that most enemies can do is cast buffs on themselves or\n\t\tpotentially shoot blindly through the illusion.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Scatter<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Too situational to be\n\t\tlocked into it permanently.

You\n\t\tcan also banish a creature to a plane where they&#8217;ll be really unhappy, like\n\t\ta living creature banished to the plane of fire, or a demon banished to\n\t\tCelestia.

You can do a lot with perfect control over a\n\t\tcreature for such a long period of time. Using the target as a thrall in\n\t\tcombat is obviously tempting, but the target gets to repeat their saving\n\t\tthrow every time that they take damage, so be very cautious if you choose to\n\t\tdo so.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Feeblemind<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Casters are extremely\n\t\tvulnerable to Feeblemind.

Could a character\n\t\t\tuse class features other than spellcasting? What are they smart enough to\n\t\t\tdo in combat? There&#8217;s a lot of room for the DM to interpret how this works\n\t\t\tand which abilities creatures can still use. While that could be fun and\n\t\t\tvery effective, it also makes the spell&#8217;s effect totally dependent on the\n\t\t\tDM and their interpretation of what an affected creature is mentally\n\t\t\tcapable of doing.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Glibness<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: In many cases you&#8217;ll\n\t\tknow that conversations will take place ahead of time, which makes\n\t\tglibness&#8217;s hour-long duration fantastic. By this level your Charisma should\n\t\tbe 20 already, so you&#8217;re effectively rolling 20+proficiency bonus on every\n\t\tCharisma check.

But Wish isn&#8217;t on\n\t\tthe Warlock spell list, so take Foresight instead. It&#8217;s difficult to\n\t\toverstate how effective this buff is on literally any character. You do\n\t\teverything for 8 hours with Advantage, and every attack against you is made\n\t\twith Disadvantage. Unless someone hits you with Dispel Magic, you&#8217;re\n\t\tbasically unstoppable.

This is easy to abuse by going to plane where you know\n\t\t\t\tthey aren&#8217;t (pocket dimensions work great for this, but there are so\n\t\t\t\tmany planes that it&#8217;s hard to accidently be on the same one), then\n\t\t\t\tforcibly summon them. You could summon your biggest antagonist after\n\t\t\t\tspending a bunch of time setting up traps, buffs, and readied actions,\n\t\t\t\tthen have your party stomp them into the dirt. If you&#8217;re extra clever,\n\t\t\t\tyou can use Astral Projection to fight whatever you&#8217;re summoning whiel\n\t\t\t\tprojected so if something goes wrong you won&#8217;t actually die and you\n\t\t\t\tcould try again later. I think the intent of this function was to summon\n\t\t\t\tan ally to help you in a fight, but I think my idea is more useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t>One-way cover: You can only enter the portal from the front, but it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\tunclear what the back looks like or how it functions.

It&#8217;s also not totally\n\t\tclear to me what happens to the material component when you cast the spell.\n\t\tSince nothing is specified, I presume that you&#8217;re left holding the\n\t\tcomponent. That means that you&#8217;re now responsible for ensuring that no one\n\t\tever casts a 9th-level Dispel Magic on that component, and you&#8217;re also not\n\t\tallowed to use that component again for fear of releasing the previous\n\t\ttarget. If you weren&#8217;t locked into this spell permanently, it would be fine,\n\t\tbut for the Warlock who gets just one 9th-level spell, it&#8217;s simply too\n\t\trestrictive and too expensive.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Word Kill<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: 100 hit points is a\n\t\tvery low cap, but it&#8217;s hard to argue with how effective it is to outright\n\t\tslay a creature with no rolls involved. As an example, a 20th-level wizard\n\t\twith 12 Constitution will have 102 hit points (6+19*4+20), so basically\n\t\tnothing which is scary at this level will be immediately vulnerable, but if\n\t\tyour allies can deal a bunch of damage quickly you may be able to use this\n\t\tin round 1 of a fight.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Psychic Scream<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">XGtE<\/a>)<\/sup>: Up to 10 creatures\n\t\twithin 90 feet of you in any direction.

There&#8217;s no\n\t\tduration on the stun effect, so enemies with poor Intelligence may be\n\t\t<em>permanently stunned<\/em>.

This is a spell that really rewards thorough knowledge\n\t\tof 5e&#8217;s monsters, so go sit down with the Monster Manual etc. and do some\n\t\treading. You&#8217;ll want a go-to combat form at CR 17, 18, 19, and 20 for when\n\t\tyou need to turn yourself or an ally into a monster, but you should also\n\t\tlook for a good CR 9 in case you need to polymorph an object into a pet.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Remember that the spell becomes permanent if you keep it running for an\n\t\t\thour, so you can also use this to permanently turn yourself or someone\n\t\t\telse into a monster or a dragon or something. You&#8217;ll lose all of your\n\t\t\tclass stuff because you assume the creature&#8217;s statistics, but honestly a\n\t\t\tCR 20 dragon is much more powerful anyway.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The spell&#8217;s final option allows you to turn a creature into an object\n\t\t\t(which allows a Wisdom save). Turn them into a flower pot, then either\n\t\t\tdrop them from high enough to deal maximum fall damage (the extra damage\n\t\t\tcarries over to their regular hit points when they revert), throw them\n\t\t\tinto a demiplane, plane shift them somewhere unpleasant, or dispose of\n\t\t\tthem in some other permanent and irrevocable fashion like a bag of\n\t\t\tdevouring.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>For more, see our\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/true-polymorph-and-shapechange\/\">Practical Guide to True Polymorph and Shapechange<\/a\n\t\t\t>.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Weird<\/span>\n\t\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup>: Like Phantasmal Killer\n\t\tfor every creature in a 30-foot radius.
