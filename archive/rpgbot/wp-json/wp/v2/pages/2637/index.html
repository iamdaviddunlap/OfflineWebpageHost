Between their available archetypes, they&#8217;re able to serve mixed roles as scouts, strikers, blaster, support casters, and controllers. Their spell list has a lot of unique options. There is a strong emphasis on area control spells, and most of the Druid&#8217;s best spells require Concentration. By spellcaster standards, the Druid is relatively simple to play because you so rarely need to track more than one ongoing effect, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t make them less fun or less powerful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Druid is primarily a spellcaster, and fills a role in the party similar\n\tto the Cleric, serving as a Healer, Support, and Utility caster. However,\n\ttheir capabilities don&#8217;t end there. Several subclasses also allow the Druid to\n\tserve as an effective Defender or Striker in an impressively broad and unique\n\tnumber of ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Druids experience a dramatic power spike at 2nd level when they gain their subclass, and the Circle of the Moon Druid remains among the most powerful builds at level 2 several years after the publication of the core rules. However, despite their strengths, the Druid is not without challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Druid subclasses vary wildly in complexity, and some druid subclasses like Circle of Spores are exceptionally hard to build and play effectively, while some subclasses like Circle of the Land are extremely simply to play so long as the player is comfortable managing their spells. Beyond the fluctuating complexity, druids also have notoriously poor AC due to their inability to wear metal armor, and with only d8 hit points they can be frail compared to similar classes like the Cleric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all of that, the Druid can be a lot of fun to play, and if you stick to one of the low-complexity subclasses, the Druid is among the easiest spellcaster classes to play. For new players looking to try their first spellcaster, Circle of the Land can be a great introduction to the complexities of managing spellcasters. Beyond that, the ability to turn into an animal is always a recipe for fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reading this handbook, I encourage you to read our supporting content for the Druid:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\">Druid Subclasses Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/spells\">Druid Spell List Breakdown<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/playing-druids-naturally\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"17467\">Playing Druids Naturally<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/druids-levels-1-4-druidic-is-just-elvish-for-hipsters-rpgbot-podcast-s4e73\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27928\">DRUIDS Levels 1 \u2013 4 \u2013 Druidic is just Elvish for Hipsters \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E73<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/druid-levels-5-20-summoning-cows-to-fall-from-the-skies-onto-our-enemies-rpgbot-podcast-s4e74\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27965\">DRUID Levels 5 \u2013 20: Summoning Cows to Fall from the Skies onto our Enemies \u2013 RPGBOT.Podcast S4E74<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is for the 2014 rules.

If\n\tyou summon creatures with spells, some of the spells specify that your summons\n\tunderstand languages that you speak, so you may be able to use this to\n\tcommunicate with your summoned creatures in a language which noone else\n\tunderstands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Druid&#8217;s spell list\n\tincludes a lot of really fantastic options which are only available to the\n\tDruid (and a handful which are only available to Druids and Rangers). The\n\tDruid has many of the best area control effects, like Entangle and Spike\n\tGrowth, and a lot of unique damage spells like Call Lightning. However, Druids\n lack many utility options\n\tavailable to Clerics and Wizards, and their approach to problems like raising the dead is often different from other spellcasters.<\/p>\n<p>For help selecting spells, see our\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/spells\">Druid Spell List Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wild Shape<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re a Circle of the\n\tMoon druid, Wild Shape is a utility option. Any druid can turn into an animal\n\tto scout or to avoid notice, but turning into an animal to go into melee is\n\tnot likely to end well since your available forms are so weak. See my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/wild-shape\">Practical Guide to Wild Shape<\/a>\n\tfor specifics on how to make the best use of Wild Shape.<\/p>\n<p>Some druid subclasses make use of your Wild Shape uses to fuel other\n\tabilities, such as the Circle of Spores&#8217; Symbiotic Entity feature. In a lot of\n\tways, the Druid&#8217;s pool of Wild Shape uses has become the Druid&#8217;s go-to\n\texpendable resource pool for anything beyond spells, so even if you never use\n\tWild Shape many druids can still make good use of the limited resource.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Druid Circle<\/strong>: Druid subclasses are briefly summarized below.\n\tSee my\n\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\">Druid Subclasses Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor help selecting your subclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/#circle-of-dreams\" data-type=\"post\">Circle of Dreams<\/a><\/strong>: A tricky mix of healing, support, and teleportation options.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/#circle-of-stars\">Circle of Stars<\/a><\/strong>: Draw on the power of magic constellations to change your capabilities,\n\t\tchoosing to attack your foes, support and heal your allies, or withstand\n\t\tyour foes attacks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/#circle-of-spores\">Circle of Spores<\/a><\/strong>: A poison-themed master of fungi and mushrooms, you gain the ability to\n\t\tadopt a powerful symbiotic form and to deal huge amounts of poison\n\t\tdamage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/#circle-of-wildfire\">Circle of Wildfire<\/a><\/strong>: Tame a powerful wilfire spirit which serves you as an ally in combat, and\n\t\tuse magic fire to defeat your enemies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/#circle-of-the-land\">Circle of the Land<\/a><\/strong>: Emphasize your connection to the natural world by adding extra\n\t\tspellcasting related to specific natural environment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/#circle-of-the-moon\">Circle of the Moon<\/a><\/strong>: Master Wild Shape, gaining access to more powerful wild shape forms\n\t\tsuitable to combat.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/#circle-of-the-shepherd\">Circle of the Shepherd<\/a><\/strong>: A powerful summoner with useful abilities to buff and support their\n\t\tallies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-none\">Timeless Body<\/span>: Almost certainly no effect on\n\tthe game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Beast Spells<\/span>: Fly around as a bird and shoot\n\tspells at unsuspecting foes. A great way to use spells like Call Lightning,\n\tbut keep an eye on which spells have a visible effect which originates from\n\tyou. If you&#8217;re flying around as an owl and someone notices, you&#8217;re going to\n\tget attacked and anything past the owl&#8217;s 1 hit point goes straight to your\n\tregular pool of hp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Archdruid<\/span>: For the base druid and for druid\n\tsubclasses that don&#8217;t make use your Wild Shape uses, this has limited\n\tbenefits. Combined with Beast Spells, it&#8217;s often a good idea to turn into a\n\tbeast outside of combat in order to pad your hit points and gain access to\n\tflight, darkvision, and other benefits. But if you take enough damage to fall\n\tout of your best form, you lose those benefits and if the best thing you can\n\tdo with your Action in combat is turn into a low-CR beast, something is super wrong (out of\n\tspell slots, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second benefit of Achdruid is easy to overlook. Ignoring Verbal, Somatic,\n\tand some inexpensive material components means that you don&#8217;t need to hold a\n\tfocus, you can cast spells without issue while restrained and in areas of\n\tsilence, and in many cases creatures will have no way to determine that spells\n\tare coming from you so you can easily run around as an inconspicuous animal\n\t(small birds and rodents are great for avoiding notice) and enjoy most of your\n\tusual capabilities (spellcasting, etc.) without drawing attention which might\n\tresult in something attacking you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For druid subclasses like Circle of Spores and Circle of the Moon which use\n\tthe Wild Shape uses more heavily, this is much more impactful. Circle of the\n\tMoon can switch back into an animal form at the beginning of every turn,\n\tthereby making themselves extremely difficult to damage. Circle of Spores can\n\treactivate Symbiotic Entity at no cost beyond spending an Action to do,\n\tallowing them to remain in their combat form almost perpetually and allowing\n\tyou to refresh your pool of temporary hit points (which is 80 points at this\n\tlevel) whenever you have a moment to do so, allowing you stand still and shrug\n\toff upsettingly large quantities of damage at no cost beyond your Action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optional-class-features\">Optional Class Features<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduced in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of Everything, Optional Class Features offer ways to add additional features or replace existing ones. These rules are optional, and you should not assume that your DM will allow these features without consulting them first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessments and suggestions for specific Optional Class Features are presented here, but for more information on handling Optional Class Features in general, see my <a href=\"\/dnd5\/dungeonmasters\/optional-class-features\/\">Practical Guide to Optional Class Features<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Additional Druid Spells<\/span> (Addition): Almost\n\teverything on this spell list makes sense on the Druid&#8217;s spell list.\n\tProtection From Evil and Good seems like a bit of a stretch, but since the\n\tactual effect of the spell is protection from extraplanar creatures it makes\n\tsense. Divination is perhaps the least logical addition to the spell list\n\tsince it puts the caster in touch with a god or their servants, and druids\n\tdon&#8217;t have any other direct relationship with deities. Other notable additions\n\tinclude Revivify, allowing the Druid to truly replace the Cleric as the\n\tparty&#8217;s healer without any loss of healing capability, as well as Cone of Cold\n\tand Incendiary Cloud, filling some gaps in the Druid&#8217;s directly offensive\n\toptions.<\/p>\n\n<p>I recommend allowing the expanded spell list for all druids. Nearly all of\n\tthe new spells are an excellent fit for the Druid, and the additional\n\tcapabilities close the gap between the Cleric&#8217;s spell list and the Druid&#8217;s\n\tspell list so there&#8217;s less of a capability discrepency there, and parties are\n\tless likely to find themselves staring in frustration at their party&#8217;s cleric\n\tand wondering why their spells are so weird and limited compared to the\n\tCleric. There&#8217;s still a ton of dependence on Concentration here, though, so\n\tdon&#8217;t expect a bunch of these spells to be used in combinations or\n\tsomething.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wild Companion<\/span> (Addition): Access to a\n\tfamiliar is great on any character, and I really like the way this was\n\timplemented. Rather than just granting a familiar for free, the Druid spends a\n\tuse of Wild Shape (thereby making use of an existing resource pool), and only\n\tgets to keep the familiar for a few hours. This allows the Druid to call up a\n\tfamiliar when they need one, but means that the Druid won&#8217;t have a familiar\n\tall the time like many wizards will.<\/p>\n\n<p>Allowing the Druid to easily call up a new familiar several times per day\n\tallows them to choose a type of familiar which fits situational needs rather\n\tthan always defaulting to an owl like everyone else using a familiar. Call up\n\ta bat to help navigate caves, or a quipper to help explore bodies of water.\n\tRemoving the material component also makes it less costly to treat the\n\tfamiliar as an expendable pet, allowing you to use it in combat with\n\tabsolutely no regard for its safety.<\/p>\n\n<p>I recommend allowing Wild Companion on all subclasses which I&#8217;ve rated\n\t<span class=\"rating-red\">red<\/span> or\n\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">orange<\/span>, and consider allowing it on\n\tsubclasses which I&#8217;ve rated <span class=\"rating-green\">green<\/span> on a\n\tcase-by-case basis. I specifically recommend allowing this on Circle of the\n\tLand because, while it&#8217;s plenty effective the subclass lacks mechanical\n\tcomplexity and Wild Companion adds a useful tool that will make it more fun to\n\tplay without making it too powerful.<\/p>\n\n<p>I do not recommend allowing it on multiclass characters who dip into the\n\tDruid because characters who only take two or three levels in druid will find\n\tthat it&#8217;s too effective as a way to spend their Wild Shape uses. Druids who\n\ttake class dips into other classes may be able to use Wild Companion without\n\tcausing balance issues, but be cautious. If a druid is taking class dips into\n\tother classes they may be running a build that&#8217;s powerful and complex enough\n\tthat Wild Companion will add a problematic amount of complexity to the\n\tcharacter that could cause problems at the table.<\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cantrip Versatility<\/span> (Addition): Retrain one\n\tcantrip every few levels. Sometimes a cantrip doesn&#8217;t work out how you hope it\n\twould, or maybe as you gain levels you&#8217;ve found that your leveled spells can\n\tfill needs which previously required cantrips (attack options, etc.).<\/p>\n\n<p>I recommend allowing Cantrip Versatility on all druids. You can&#8217;t get\n\tanything which you couldn&#8217;t already have, so it doesn&#8217;t make your character\n\tmore powerful. Hopefully it will make your character more satisfying to\n\tplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Wisdom is everything for the Druid.

Fighting Style does appear to work while using Wild Shape, but\n\t\tremember that natural weapons don&#8217;t qualify for Dueling or Great Weapon\n\t\tFighting, so offensively your best options is Unarmed Fighting if you plan\n\t\tto use forms that are good at grappling.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Gift of the Chromatic Dragon<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">FToD<\/a><\/sup>: Chromatic Infusion should be shared with allies unless you&#8217;re going for Circle of Spores, and even then your allies with Extra Attack will benefit more.

Circle of Spores Druids are the best\n\t\tcandidate for Magic Initiate: Adding Booming Blade (or Green-Flame Blade),\n\t\tSwordbust, and Mage Armor or Shield from either the Warlock or the Wizard\n\t\tspell lists will provide a significant boost to your capabilities in melee\n\t\tcombat. Other clerics might enjoy options from the Cleric&#8217;s spell list like\n\t\tSacred Flame (druids don&#8217;t have radiant damage on a cantrip) and 1st-level\n\t\tbuffs like Bless or Shield of Faith.\n\t\t<p>For more advice on Magic Initiate, see my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/spellcasting-feats#magic-initiate\">Spellcasting Feats Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Martial Adept<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Not useful enough with only one superiority die.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Metamagic Adept<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Excellent on any spellcaster.

However,\n\t\tsince Shillelagh also consumes your Bonus Action you&#8217;ll want to cast it\n\t\tahead of time to make sure that your Bonus Action is available to hit\n\t\tthings.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Resilient<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: Proficiency in Constitution saves is really helpful for a class with a\n\t\tlot of really great spells which require Concentration and notoriously\n\t\tterrible AC. If you care primarily about Concentration it&#8217;s easy to compare\n\t\tthis to War Caster. Advantage works out to a little more than +3, so once\n\t\tyour Proficiency Bonus hits +4 Resilient becomes the more effective option\n\t\tof the two.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Savage Attacker<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a><\/sup>: This is a bad feat.

Circle of Spores could\n\t\tabsolutely benefit, but I think there are other feats which are more\n\t\tbeneficial, and you need too many Ability Score Increases to have room for a\n\t\tlot of feats.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shadow Touched<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">TCoE<\/a><\/sup>: Invisibility isn&#8217;t available to most druids, and the 1st-level spells are\n\t\tmostly new options, too.

Despite proficiency in medium\n\tarmor, the best armor you can actually wear is Studded Leather, at 12+Dex.\n\tWith a shield and high Dexterity that may be enough, but Druids benefit very\n\tlittle from Dexterity so it may be hard to justify investing your Ability\n\tScore Increases. Most druids can realistically expect to have an AC of at most\n\t16 with 14 Dex, Studded Leather Armor, and a shield, while druids that get a\n\tracial Dexterity increase might hit 17.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have someone in the party who can cast Mage Armor, beg them to do cast it on you. A 1st-level spell for a +1 to AC over your best armor is a big difference, and the spell&#8217;s effects persist while using Wild Shape so many low-AC forms will be considerably more durable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The text of the Druid&#8217;s proficiencies states that &#8220;druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal&#8221;. Nothing in the rules explicitly says they can\u2019t and nothing breaks if they do, the proficiencies entry simply asserts that they <em>won&#8217;t<\/em> and gives no justification for why. The rest of this site assumes that you&#8217;re adhering to this restriction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, nothing in the rules says you can\u2019t ask your DM nicely if your Half Plate can be made of chitin from a giant scorpion or the shell of a giant crab. Eberron: Rising from the Last War describes Bronzewood and Leafweave, which are used in place of metal for equivalent armors. WotC has stated several times that this imposition wasn&#8217;t a balance decision, but was left in place to respect the history of druids within DnD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had explicit rules for unusual materials in 3rd edition but it doesn&#8217;t need to be complicated.

Unarmored Defense is\n\t\tnice, but the Monk&#8217;s version is more effective and the introduction of the\n\t\tBarrier Tattoo provides a way to get access to a reliable AC option without\n\t\tspells or multiclassing. For a single-level class dip, you only get two\n\t\trages per day and +2 damage, which isn&#8217;t a lot for the cost of a level. Two\n\t\tlevels won&#8217;t get you much because many Wild Shape forms have access to\n\t\tabilities which grant you Advantage such as Pack Tactics. Three levels is\n\t\ttempting for Primal Path and a third Rage per day, but you&#8217;re giving up an\n\t\tentire CR step in Circle of the Moon&#8217;s Wild Shape progression, which will\n\t\tprovide considerably more damage than Rage.

Like the Moon Sickle, it\n\t\tserves as a spellcasting focus and adds +2 to your spell attacks&#8217;s, but\n\t\tnotably the Staff of the Woodlands doesn&#8217;t add to your spell save DC&#8217;s so\n\t\tyou still want a Moon Sickle for the majority of your spells if you can\n\t\tmanage to find both items.\n\t\t<p>The spellcasting provided by the staff convenient allows you to skip\n\t\t\tseveral druid spells which are too situational to prepare on a daily\n\t\t\tbasis, but which feel so thematically appropriate to the Druid that it\n\t\t\tfeels weird to not have them ready. You also get Pass Without Trace\n\t\t\twithout spending a charge, so your party has a functionally permanent +10\n\t\t\tbonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Since this is is a quarterstaff, it&#8217;s a really great option for Circle of\n\t\t\tSpores druids who are using Polarm Master.<\/p><\/li>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Sun Staff<\/span\n\t\t><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">BoMT<\/a><\/sup\n\t\t>: Works with Shillelagh.

Easily missed but very important: It&#8217;s not &#8220;the first damage roll&#8221; like most similar effects. You simply don&#8217;t roll damage. That means that this works with spells that do repeated or ongoing damage such as Dragon Breath, Fire Shield, Hex, Illusory Dragon, Scorching Ray, Spirit Shroud, and Wall of Fire. Yes, it&#8217;s only once per day, but you can get a ton of mileage out of that single use. Not all of those are on your spell list, but I really want you to understand the possibilities here.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shield, +3<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: +3 AC, no attunement. Nothing fancy, but very effective.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Staff of Fire<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Druids don&#8217;t normally get access to Burning Hands or Fireball, and access\n\t\tto those spells offers some powerful go-to damage options. You&#8217;ll likely get\n\t\tthis long after wizards are able to cast fireball, but even at high levels a\n\t\t3rd-level fireball is often an excellent area damage option.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Staff of Ice<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Cone of Cold for quick AOE damage and Wall of Ice for a combination of\n\t\tdamage, area control, and utility. Wall of Ice is a good spell that&#8217;s\n\t\tnormally exclusive to the Wizard&#8217;s spell list, and it can be a useful\n\t\tutility in situations where Wall of Stone doesn&#8217;t work.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Staff of Thunder and Lightning<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Great for Circle of Spores Polearm Master builds, this is effectively a\n\t\t+2 quarterstaff with some active abilities. It&#8217;s more complicated than a +3\n\t\tquarterstaff, but if you can make good use of the active abilities it&#8217;s\n\t\tworth the loss of a +1 bonus to attack and damage.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tome of Understanding<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Permanent Wisdom bonus and raises your cap by 2.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon, +2<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: For Circle of Spores, a +3 Quarterstaff is very beneficial, but you might\n\t\talso enjoy a Staff of Thunder and Lightning.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-137\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 12b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items-legendary\">Legendary Magic Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Belt of Giant Strength (Cloud, Storm)<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Still great, and it still works while using Wild Shape.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Invisibility<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">DMG<\/a><\/sup>: Invisibility is extremely powerful in 5e.

Attacks, saves, skills, etc. all benefit. However, most druids rely\n\t\tmostly on spells which require saving throws so it&#8217;s not as beneficial as it\n\t\twould be for other characters.

This feels very tempting, but it&#8217;s just not good enough for this rarity. By this level, 300gp is a pittance, and you have access to magical options that make magical darkness much less of a problem.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ring of Amity<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">GotG<\/a><\/sup>: Hit yourself with Heal or Mass Heal and automatically heal a friend for the same amount.
