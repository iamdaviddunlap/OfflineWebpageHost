Playing a Storm Sorcerer is difficult and risky, constantly forcing you to put yourself in harm&#8217;s way to apply class features which only work at short range while providing essentially no protection from inevitable counterattacks. This is a hard subclass to build and play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout this handbook, I&#8217;ll repeatedly voice my frustrations with elements\n\tof the subclass. I want to be extremely clear about where the problems lie,\n\tand by highlighting those pain points I hope to provide some insight into\n\twhere the subclass falls short and where you as the player will need to\n\tcompensate. Knowing your weaknesses will keep you alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of the new Metamagic Transmuted Spell in Tasha&#8217;s Cauldron of\n\tEverything is perhaps the single greatest addition to the subclass, allowing\n\tyou to expand your spell options beyond the pitifully small number of spells\n\twhich already deal lightning and thunder damage, but it does present a\n\tfrustrating tax on your sorcery points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a fix for Storm Sorcery, you need to solve one of two problems:\n\tSpells known, and Tempestuous Magic.\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/blog\/dnd-5e-expanded-spell-lists-for-non-tashas-sorcerer-subclasses\">Giving the Storm Sorcerer some spells known<\/a>\n\tthat will trigger Heart of the Storm makes the subclass functional at a bare\n\tminimum because players can&#8217;t accidently negate an entire subclass feature.\n\tYou could also adjust Tempestuous Magic to work with cantrips which deal\n\tlightning or thunder damage (currently only Booming Blade, Shocking Grasp, and\n\tThunderclap), which allows the Storm Sorcerer to use Tempestuous Magic more\n\tfrequently so that they can practice the hit-and-run tactics built into the\n\tclass right from level 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">Storm Sorcery Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races\">Races<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#lineages\">Lineages<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#races-of-eberron\">Races of Eberron<\/a>\n\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#multiclassing\">Multiclassing<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items\">Magic Items<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#magic-items-common\">Common Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-uncommon\">Uncommon Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-rare\">Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-very-rare\">Very Rare Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#magic-items-legendary\">Legendary Magic Items<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#spells\">Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-1\">2nd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-1\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-1\">4th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-1\">6th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#spells-1\">7th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-aarakocra-storm-sorcerer\">Example Build &#8211; Aarakocra Storm Sorcerer<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#example-build-storm-sorcerertempest-cleric\">Example Build &#8211; Storm Sorcerer\/Tempest Cleric<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

Any leveled spell will suffice to trigger Tempestuous Magic,\n\tbut to get the full intended effect of Storm Sorcery, you want to trigger\n\tHeart of the Storm as often as possible.

This is\n\tfrustrating, but also accurate. Spells like Dragon&#8217;s Breath, True Polymorph,\n\tsummon spells, etc. don&#8217;t deal the suitable damage types as part of the\n\tspell&#8217;s effects (Dragon&#8217;s Breath&#8217;s effect is to grant a breath weapon, True\n\tPolymorph&#8217;s effect is to change your form, etc.), so they don&#8217;t qualify to\n\ttrigger Heart of the Storm. They&#8217;re still great spells, but they don&#8217;t meet\n\tthe criteria for this list.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Absorb Elements<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">EEPC \/ XGtE<\/a><\/sup>: An absolutely essential spell, but I&#8217;m not certain if it triggers Heart\n\t\tof the Storm.

As a DM I would rule that it doesn&#8217;t\n\t\ttrigger Heart of the Storm, but Jeremy Crawford has ruled that Dragon&#8217;s\n\t\tBreath qualifies, so maybe this qualifies if you use it to resist lightning\n\t\tdamage.

The AOE for both is 10 feet, so\n\t\tthey perfectly overlap, allowing you to deal some decent damage as you\n\t\tteleport away.

Your go-to tactic for a single turn is to rush into range,\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrigger Heart of the Storm (casting Chromatic Orb is enough, but any\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof your damage spells work thanks to Transmuted Spell), use\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTempestuous Magic to fly out of reach, then use whatever movement\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou have left to retreat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>All of that just to trigger Tempestuous Magic, which deals a truly\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstunning 3 points of damage per target.

Still, it&#8217;s guaranteed damage with no save, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you can hit multiple targets that will add up quickly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And since someone will ask me: No, twinning a spell does not\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttrigger Heart of the Storm twice.

Support and utility spells like\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClairvoyance, Counterspell, Dispel Magic, and Haste are all good\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchoices. Ashardalon&#8217;s Step is a good choice offensively because it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tboosts your speed, provides another source of damage output, and\n\t\t\t\t\t\tremoves the need to rely on Tempestuous Magic. If you transmute it,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou can even trigger Tempestuous Magic with it, leaving your Action\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a cantrip.
