Powered by Wisdom, these Monks are able to push their Attack stat and Stunning Strike DC early on, giving an advantage over other Monks who must push Dexterity first to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">keep up with the fundamental math of the game<\/a> while their DC atrophies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe you\u2019re still undecided, so ask yourself this? Should a master of unarmed martial arts be able to grapple an opponent and wrestle them to the ground? Well most Monks end up dumping Strength and can\u2019t Grapple their way out of a paper bag. Or well, they usually can escape the Grapple with Dex and Acrobatics. But with the Way of the Astral Self, Wisdom is used in place of Strength for Grappling, and anything else you could possibly use Athletics for. Is that portcullis the only thing between your party and freedom? Lift it, with Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps though, you\u2019re not here to be a Monk. Perhaps you\u2019re just perusing multiclass options. Good news, we have a couple suggestions down in that section about leveraging the Wisdom-first way this subclass handles things.

Keep in mind that the state of the meta periodically changes as new source materials are released, and the article will be updated accordingly as time allows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"rating- wp-block-heading\" id=\"features\">Way of the Astral Self Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-140\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arms of the Astral Self<\/span>: The subclass&#8217;s\n\t\tsignature feature, managing Arms of the Astral Self is the core of Way of\n\t\tthe Astral Self&#8217;s combat tactics. Turning this on puts you into your\n\t\tpreferred combat mode, and while it does consume a precious Ki Point the\n\t\t10-minute duration can easily carry you through one or two combats if you&#8217;re\n\t\tquick. The ability is complex despite a fairly small amount of rules text,\n\t\tso bear with me through the following pile of text.\n\t\t<p>When and where to activate Arms of the Astral Self is an important\n\t\t\tchoice. When you activate it, you get an AOE damage effect against targets\n\t\t\tof your choice within 10 feet. The damage is roughly equivalent to one\n\t\t\tunarmed strike (double your martial arts die is roughly equal to one die\n\t\t\tplus your modifier), and with a 10-foot radius you should be able to hit\n\t\t\tseveral foes if you move between them.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>It may be worthwhile to spend your Action to Disengage so that you can\n\t\t\tmove without provoking Opportunity Attacks so that you can position\n\t\t\tyourself in the middle of a group of enemies. But there&#8217;s a risk\/reward\n\t\t\tconsideration here: your AC and hit points need to be able to hold up to\n\t\t\tbeing surrounded by enemies and since you&#8217;re using your Bonus Action to\n\t\t\tactivate Arms of the Astral Self you can&#8217;t also use it for Patient\n\t\t\tDefense. You might also try spending your Action to Dodge since\n\t\t\tDisadvantage on attacks against you will apply to both Opportunity Attacks\n\t\t\tagainst you and any other attacks made against you until the start of your\n\t\t\tnext turn.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Once active, Arms of the Astral Self provides several benefits which\n\t\t\tshould be discussed individually.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Using Wisdom in place of Strength for Athletics checks helps with\n\t\t\tgrapples, both ones that you start and ones that are forced upon you. You\n\t\t\tcan always use Dexterity (Acrobatics) to escape a grapple (typically the\n\t\t\tbest way for the Monk to do so), but this reduces the need for Acrobatics.\n\t\t\tMaking Athletics viable in combat means that you can use the Grapple+Shove\n\t\t\tcombo to force enemies prone and hold them there without investing\n\t\t\tStrength.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The second benefit allows you to make unarmed strikes. Like I said above:\n\t\t\t&#8220;punch ghost&#8221;. While this isn&#8217;t flashy, it&#8217;s arguably the primary reason\n\t\t\tfor this ability to exist. You can&#8217;t use weapons with your astral arms,\n\t\t\tunfortunately, so using your arms during your Attack action will mean\n\t\t\tslightly less damage than other monks until your Martial Arts die\n\t\t\tscales.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The third benefit adds reach for your unarmed strikes. Reach is a huge\n\t\t\tbenefit for the monk because you can fight from outside the reach of many\n\t\t\tenemies then use your high movement speed to move out of range of their\n\t\t\tmovement. It also helps with targeting multiple foes who might not be\n\t\t\tconveniently adjacent to you. However, this only applies to your Unarmed\n\t\t\tStrikes, so you can&#8217;t use this reach to Grapple or Shove.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The final benefit allows you to use Wisdom in place of Strength\/Dexterity\n\t\t\tfor your Unarmed Strikes and makes them deal Force damage so you&#8217;re no\n\t\t\tlonger crippled by resistance\/immunity to bludgeoning damage. If you forgo\n\t\t\tweapons, raising Wisdom to 20 before switching to Dexterity can be a great\n\t\t\tidea for the Way of the Astral Self Monk. This also helps to capitalize on\n\t\t\tStunning Strike because the DC is Wisdom-based. However, when you run out\n\t\t\tof Ki and can&#8217;t summon your astral arms, you&#8217;re going to be in trouble.\n\t\t\tManage your Ki very carefully and try to keep a point in reserve in case\n\t\t\tyou&#8217;re surprised by combat before your next rest.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Visage of the Astral Self<\/span>: Situational\n\t\tby design, Visage of the Astral Self costs a Ki Point to activate and can be\n\t\tused separately or in conjunction with Arms of the Astral Self. You won&#8217;t\n\t\tneed this in every combat, but when you need it you can turn it on without\n\t\tcutting into your action economy any further than you would by activating\n\t\tArms of the Astral Self.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Astral Sight<\/span>: Darkvision by any means\n\t\t\t\tis great, and though the 10-minute duration won&#8217;t match permanent\n\t\t\t\tDarkvision or the Darkvision spell, neither of those allow you see in\n\t\t\t\tmagical darkness and neither allow you to see 120 ft. (Superior\n\t\t\t\tDarkvision gives 120 ft. range but it&#8217;s not a common racial trait). This\n\t\t\t\talone is the most likely reason to activate Visage of the Astral\n\t\t\t\tSelf.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Wisdom of the Spirit<\/span>: Time to take\n\t\t\t\tyour magical punch ghost into a social situation? Here you go. Insight\n\t\t\t\tis likely the only contribution you&#8217;ll be making to conversations since\n\t\t\t\tnearly every monk dumps Charisma. Monks are too MAD to invest any\n\t\t\t\tserious resources outside of Dex\/Con\/Wis.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Word of the Spirit<\/span>: Roughly mimics\n\t\t\t\tthe effects of Message for whispering and Thaumaturgy for shouting.\n\t\t\t\tNeat, but not very impactful.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"11\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Body of the Astral Self<\/span>: One good\n\t\tdefensive option and one good offensive option. You need to summon both your\n\t\tarms and your visage, so you&#8217;ll need to adjust to spending two Ki Points\n\t\teach time you get ready for combat, but the benefits are frequently worth\n\t\tthe expense.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deflect Energy<\/span>: Damage of these types\n\t\t\t\tcomes up all the time, and the list of affected damage types includes\n\t\t\t\tthunder, which is a rarity. The damage reduction won&#8217;t match Resistance\n\t\t\t\tin most cases, but the amount of damage you prevent will add up quickly.\n\t\t\t\tFor comparison: The average damage you&#8217;ll prevent (1d10+Wis) will exceed\n\t\t\t\tthe amount of hit points you gain when you gain a level (1d8+Con) unless\n\t\t\t\tyour Constitution is really high compared to your Wisdom, and retaining\n\t\t\t\ta level&#8217;s worth of hit points at the cost of Reaction is a great trade.\n\t\t\t\tPlus, if you need this once in an encounter you&#8217;re going to need it\n\t\t\t\tseveral times.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Empowered Arms<\/span>: A small damage boost,\n\t\t\t\tbut it will add up reliably, and after applying twice (once on each of\n\t\t\t\tyour turns, so two turns worth of attacks) it will offset the action\n\t\t\t\tcost of activating Arms of the Astral Self instead of using Martial Arts\n\t\t\t\tfor one turn.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"17\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Awakened Astral Self<\/span>: This is expensive,\n\t\tbut remember that it&#8217;s 5 Ki Points instead of the 2 which you&#8217;ve become\n\t\taccustomed to spending normally thanks to Body of the Astral Self. The\n\t\teffects are excellent, providing both the additional attack and the AC bonus\n\t\tprovided by Haste, which are the most important parts of the spell in most\n\t\tcases. With a 10-minute duration and your Ki Points recharging on a Short\n\t\tRest you could use your Ki for this and literally nothing else and do very\n\t\twell in combat.\n<p>When considering the cost, remember that for 1 Ki point, we can attack twice as a Bonus Action with Flurry of Blows, so for 3 Ki points above our previous cost of 2, we could have made 6 attacks. Instead, we can make an extra attack on every round for ten minutes, and we can still use our Bonus Action for a single standard Martial Arts attack. When looking at it that way, this is basically the same as removing the Ki cost of using Flurry for ten minutes.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>This also stacks with Haste, so if you have somone in your party who can\n\t\t\tcast Haste on you, you can get up to 6 attacks per turn with Flurry of\n\t\t\tBlows and enjoy an AC of 24 (+5 Dex, +5 Wis, +2 Awakened Astral Self, +2\n\t\t\tHaste) without magic items.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"astral-grapplemancy\">Astral Grapplemancy<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Arms of the Astral Self allow us to use Wisdom for Athletics, for all Strength Checks and Strength Saves really, we have better access to Grappling than other Monks.

We could always read the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">Practical Guide to Grapple<\/a>, and, while that is a great place to start, we can be more Monk specific.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming our arms are already active from a previous turn and we are high enough level for an Extra Attack, we declare the Attack Action. We then replace our first attack to make an opposed Athletics Check to Shove and we choose Target is Prone. We then replace our second attack with another Athletics Check to Grapple. For most classes, we\u2019re out of attacks, but we are Monk and we made the Attack Action on our turn. Flurry of Blows doesn\u2019t care what our Attack Action did, Flurry gonna punch twice regardless, and our target is Prone next to us, so we have Advantage. We may not be <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/rune-knight\/\">the best at grappling<\/a>, but we\u2019re in the top five at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-144\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"way-of-the-astral-self-ability-scores\">Way of the Astral Self Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Way of the Astral Self builds much like any other Monk.

Optionally a race like Warforged or Simic Hybrid have a +1 to AC that we could very much use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Simic Hybrid<\/span>: Our first adaptation can be whichever would work for the campaign, swimming in an aquatic or seafaring campaign, climbing in a dungeon crawl, and the gliding adaptation can be used for interesting tricks since our Athletics is Wisdom based so we can jump with ghost power to give us an unusual trick of jumping and gliding. For our second adaptation, Acid Spit is a novelty, but Grappling Appendages or Carapace could both benefit our abilities. Mentioned above, Athletics is Wisdom for us and that gives us a reason to try Grappling which we can do as a Bonus Action with the grapple arms, and that would be useful if we didn\u2019t already have the ability to use Martial Arts to make an attack as a Bonus action to make up for a Grapple attempt replacing one of our attacks. Carapace on the other hand is +1 AC and that\u2019s just really good to have as a Monk.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warforged<\/span>: Decent protections from Constructed Resilience and +1 AC. Just solid for not getting killed.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Duergar<\/span>: If your size goes up, the number of targets you can fit within 10 feet of you goes up and Duergar have access to Enlarge\/Reduce.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Fizban&#8217;s Dragonborn Variants<\/span>: While we have respectable damage from our attacks, being able to pepper in a Breath Weapon in place of one attack is great, and because this is still the Attack Action we can still use Flurry of Blows even if the only thing we do with our Attack Action is a breath weapon.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shifter<\/span>: A Wildhunt Shifter has Advantage on Wisdom checks while shifted, but read Arms of the Astral Self very carefully. Using our Wisdom modifier in place of our Strength modifier does not turn a Strength check into a Wisdom check.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Giff<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SJAiS<\/a><\/sup>: As mentioned right above, because the check is still a Strength check even though it&#8217;s replacing Strength with Wisdom, Hippo Build will apply Advantage to the check. Also Firearm Proficiency is good to add to any monk, especially because Astral Spark doesn&#8217;t apply to Unarmed Strikes.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Plasmoid<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">SJAiS<\/a><\/sup>: Now, even if your table wants to read Arms of the Astral Self in such a way that the Strength check does become a Wisdom check, the Amorphous trait is the answer by providing Advantage on all Grapple related checks. Also you can flavor the ghost punches as pseudopod punches.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dhampir<\/span>: You know why this is on this list. Ok, but seriously, we start with an extra 5 move speed before we add Monk speed, and we get a ridiculous spider climbing ability.

If we\u2019re some sort of race with a free Martial Weapon proficiency we could even have a Hand Crossbow to get that Bonus Action attack. It\u2019s kind of a low priority because we\u2019re likely pumping Wisdom first, but we don\u2019t <i>have<\/i> to build that way, using Wisdom for our ghost punching is an option, not a requirement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"way-of-the-astral-self-weapons\">Way of the Astral Self Weapons<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Eldritch Claw Tattoo<\/span>: Not really a weapon, but because we can&#8217;t use weapons with our punch ghost this is the closest thing to a +1 weapon for unarmed strikes and the Eldritch Maul power is sorta like an extra use of punch ghost once a day with slightly longer range.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crossbow, Light<\/span>: If it&#8217;s our dedicated weapon, holding it won&#8217;t interfere with using the Arms of the Astral Self so we can remain armed against long range combatants.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shortbow<\/span>: While a Light Crossbow has a d8 right out of the gate, we don&#8217;t need a feat to have Extra Attack function with a Shortbow.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Darts and Slings<\/span>: The primary issue with Darts is the 20 foot short range and the 60 foot maximum range.

Our Astral Self is going to cost us 1-2 Ki per fight for most of our career, which limits the benefits of our Wisdom primary Sunning Strike DCs if we cut our Ki pool too short.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Astral 8\/Cleric X<\/span>: For example, we could leave the class at eighth level with our 8 Ki and 20 Wisdom and start taking Cleric levels, being some kind of SAD Melee Cleric. Eight Ki is plenty to always keep some around to activate Wisdom attacks in every fight and maybe attempt a Stun every now and then.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Astral 8\/Moon Druid 12<\/span>: Similar to the Cleric above, leaving at 8 leaves us enough Ki to have Astral Arms in most fights if we want, but unlike Cleric, Druids have the right to Bear Arms.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Astral 18\/Stars Druid 2<\/span>: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/circle-of-stars\/\">Circle of Stars Druid<\/a> gives laser attacks that run off of Wisdom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-161\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-nbspyes-this-is-a-jojos-reference\">Example Build &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2vT0xYDdyoo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yes, This <strong><em>IS<\/em><\/strong> A Jojo\u2019s Reference<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m going to level with you, the best Monk is still less impressive than most middle of the road builds. We\u2019re somewhat hamstrung by our Ki pool being so shallow and the costs being somewhat high for some mediocre effects. But that\u2019s not important. We\u2019re here because we want cool Astral Arms that can punch dudes from slightly farther away. We\u2019re here to have fun. You expected the most optimized DPR build with tons of math to back it up, but it was me, DIO!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"playstyle-and-tactics\">Playstyle and Tactics<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At lower levels, we\u2019re going to mostly rely on our Monk weapon to do some reasonable damage. When we take the subclass at third level, we have the option to stand at 10 feet with 1d4+Wis damage or close to 5 feet for 1d8+Dex damage if we\u2019re using Quarterstaff or Spear. Having that kind of flexibility is great. As we level up and prioritize Wisdom, the Astral Arms will get stronger, being 1d6 at fifth level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason we do use Wisdom over Dexterity in this build is that our Athletics becomes a Wisdom skill, allowing us the option to Grapple. Should we go into every combat and expect to start wrestling monsters to the ground? No, we should be expecting to evaluate the combat and if we need to grapple a target then we have the option where other Monk subclasses just can\u2019t even try. When we\u2019re not grappling, we\u2019ve still got another advantage over the other subclasses by having Force damage fists, a very reliable damage type.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re going to use point buy to get three 15s, and then from Dhampir we take three +1s to have three 16s at the start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Point Buy<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>No, we didn\u2019t just pick Dhampir because memes. Dhampir has a couple of nice racial features we like. First off, we get 35 feet base move before Monk speed is added, and all of that also contributes to our Climb speed. But we don\u2019t just have regular Climb, Dhampir have Spider Climb, allowing us to traverse any surface.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that we have a strange Bite attack. Unlike many natural weapons, these cannot make unarmed attacks, and they use Constitution for attack rolls and damage. It does count as a simple melee weapon lacking the Heavy or Two Handed Property so they are a Monk Weapon by default, though there is some debate on whether or not being a Monk weapon allows us to use Dexterity with the bite because Martial Arts states \u201cuse Dexterity instead of Strength.\u201d We would still get to have an increased damage die from Martial Arts when biting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"background\">Background<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Round out Skills or Tools at your preference.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Dhampir gives us any two skills, so we take Insight and Perception, while Monk gives us another two, where we take Athletics and Stealth. From our Background, Survival and Sleight of Hand would be fine choices since our mixture of Stealth and Climb Speed are great for infiltration tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>At Fourth level, we\u2019ll be putting our ASI into Wisdom, because <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">math<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Eighth, we\u2019ll be taking Skill Expert so we can have Athletics Expertise. This works well with our Astral Arms giving us Wisdom to Athletics. We\u2019ll also gain Proficiency in Investigation for improved scouting. Our Hybrid stat point goes into Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Twelfth we take Observant to improve our Passive Perception and Investigation. Put the Hybrid stat into Wisdom, raising it to 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Sixteenth and Nineteenth levels we grab Dexterity ASIs to bring both our Dexterity and AC to 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Feats and Features<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Unarmoured Defense<br>Martial Arts (1d4)<\/td><td>As we start our Monkhood, we don\u2019t have much at first level, but our AC is 16, which is about the most a starting character would have in either Breastplate or Chain Mail.<br><br>Starting out, picking up a quarterstaff or a spear and using it two-handed will give us a d8 to work with while we get through these early levels. We\u2019ll also want to have a Shortbow on hand because doing something against long ranged flying targets is better than doing nothing. Far too many melees just forget to have any backup weapons.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>Unarmoured Movement (10ft)<br>Ki<\/td><td>Alright, we get extra speed, which applies to our climb speed, and we have a Ki pool now which will always equal our Monk level.<br><br>At this level we struggle a bit like most melee in early levels.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Deflect Missiles<br>Way of the Astral Self<br>Arms of the Astral Self<\/td><td>Now we have our Astral Arms and we can finally use Wisdom as our attack stat.

We\u2019re taking Wis ASI here for a few reasons.<br><br>First off, we want to keep on the math curve for now. We could in all honesty take the Skill Expert and Observant feats at fourth and eighth then take the ASI at twelvth, but then we\u2019re behind on math for eight levels instead of only four.<br><br>Secondly, there\u2019s far less feat support for Monk\u2019s traditional unarmed fighting style than for anything else, so we don\u2019t have many good options to take instead.<br><br>We also get Slow Fall. Spend reaction while falling to take Monk level times five less damage. Not dying is great.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>Extra Attack<br>Stunning Strike<br>Martial Arts (1d6)<\/td><td>More punching, harder punching.<br><br>We get the standard extra attack at fifth level common to most martial classes, but we also get Stunning Strike.<br><br>Stunning Strike is one of the nicer things with Astral Self, since making attacks with Wisdom allows us to keep the DC up for Stunning Strike.<br><br>That said, we have to beat AC, then beat the enemy saving throw, and spend a point of Ki. We\u2019ll want to be specific with this and look for threatening foes that might fail a Constitution check, like a Wizard or something.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Ki Empowered Strikes<br>Visage of the Astral Self<br>Unarmoured Movement (15ft)<\/td><td>Our unarmed attacks count as magic to beat resistances.<br><br>We now have the second part of our Astral Self. This is mostly a utility upgrade. Advantage on Intimidation and Insight is okay and Super Whispering and Shouting is comical but also has useful applications.

At this level if we activate both the Arms and Visage, we gain the Body as well for no additional cost, giving us a bit more damage and some energy resistance.<br><br>At this level, our Ki pool is 11 between short rests. Assuming we have 3 fights between short rests and have the worst timing so we can\u2019t fit two fights inside 10 minutes, if we budget 6 Ki to our astral form, we have 5 to spend on Flurry of Blows or Stunning Strike across three fights. That\u2019s not great and we have to be strategic about how we spend the Ki or improve our time management skills.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td>ASI: Feat<br>Observant<br>+1 Wisdom<\/td><td>We take Observant to improve our scouting capabilities and push our Wisdom to 20.<br><br>This helps us catch back up with the one point we\u2019ve been behind on math while also raising our Stunning Strike DC another point.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td>Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/td><td>Speak and understand in all languages.

We like this. Getting a second chance to save at the cost of 1 Ki. We\u2019re ok with this too.

At the cost of 5 Ki when activating all the parts together, we gain +2 AC and a second Extra Attack. From a cost analysis, if we fight for six rounds in the next ten minutes, we already make back the extra 3 Ki that we could have spent using Flurry of Blows.<br><br>Going back to our budget, now we have 17 Ki per rest, if we spent 5 Ki turning this on in three fights, while that leaves us with only 2 Ki, we can just not Flurry anymore and still find something to Stunning Strike.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td>Empty Body<\/td><td>Spend 4 Ki, become invisible for a minute. Not invisible as the spell, the invisible condition. In addition we have resistance to everything but Force damage during this time.<br><br>We would have to weigh our budget very carefully, but this is one of the best survival tools available. If we\u2019re fighting something that lacks Blindsight, True Sight, or other similar traits we have Advantage on all attacks and attacks against us have Disadvantage and we have Resistance.<br><br>Also for 8 Ki we can cast Astral Projection.
