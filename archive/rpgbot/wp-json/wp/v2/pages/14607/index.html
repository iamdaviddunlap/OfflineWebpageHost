While the pet, called a Dancing Item, is capable of fighting, the main benefit is that it radiates an aura of walking speed manipulation, either increasing or decreasing the walking speed of anything that begins its turn close to the construct. If you\u2019re looking to try this odd spin on pet-support-job, maybe give the College of Creation a try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of having a pet, this college also does something fun with Bardic Inspiration. In a twist on most Bardic Colleges, instead of a new way to spend inspiration dice, the College of Creation adds new rider effects to the basic feature. Each effect is specific to the kind of d20 roll the Bardic Inspiration die was added to, and each one is great because they don\u2019t take away from the original use of the die. Additionally, the Creation Bard can nebulously conjure basically anything of increasing complexity and value as they gain levels in this class. This feature is of course ripe for abuse, which you can read about below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our example build, \u201cAutognomes, Roll Out!\u201d, is an easy to follow way to provide support to your team. Additionally, by using Autognome for the race, the build is a Construct that animates Constructs, for that extra dash of flavor and theme. We\u2019ll also be discussing ways to utilize Dancing Item as more than just a combat pet that swings for some damage, so read on if you want to see the unique support opportunities it can provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#features\">College of Creation Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-creation-ability-scores\">College of Creation Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-creation-races\">College of Creation Races<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-creation-feats\">College of Creation Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#college-of-creation-weapons-and-armor\">College of Creation Weapons and Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-college-of-creation-build-autognomes-roll-out\">Example College of Creation Build &#8211; Autognomes, Roll Out!<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#abilities\">Abilities<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#race\">Race<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#background\">Background<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills-and-tools\">Skills and Tools<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#levels\">Levels<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks, which is simple to understand and easy to read at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

All three work well in the right situations, but don\u2019t let this ability dictate how you use Bardic Inspiration. It\u2019s mostly a bonus on top of the primary function.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ability Check<\/span>: If you&#8217;re using Bardic\n\t\t\t\tInspiration on an Ability Check it&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t afford to fail.\n\t\t\t\tRolling a 1 on that die hurts, so rerolling and using the better result\n\t\t\t\tis great insurance.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Attack Roll<\/span>: The damage is fairly\n\t\t\t\tminor, but if you have an ally attacking into a crowd the total damage\n\t\t\t\tcan add up quickly. Think of this like the Ranger&#8217;s Hail of Thorns spell\n\t\t\t\t(except that you get to pick targets so you can&#8217;t hurt allies) and use\n\t\t\t\tit wherever you would use Hail of Thorns.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saving Throw<\/span>: Using Bardic Inspiration\n\t\t\t\ton saving throws is one of the best ways to use it, and adding temporary\n\t\t\t\thit points on top of that benefit is excellent because the target is\n\t\t\t\teither going to take damage from the effect (which the temporary hit\n\t\t\t\tpoints will mitigate) or something else nasty is going to happen to them\n\t\t\t\tand the temporary hit points will help protect them while they\n\t\t\t\trecover.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Performance of Creation<\/span>: This is a great\n\t\tway to solve problems that require large, bulky, or expensive non-magic items that you\n\t\tmight not want to haul around with you all the time, as well as to get\n\t\taccess to expensive single-use nonmagical items. You might create an anvil\n\t\tor a block of stone if you need something extremely heavy, a row boat to\n\t\tcross a stream, or a battering ram to break down a door. Limiting the item&#8217;s\n\t\tsize to medium is mildly annoying, but the size quickly increases to large at\n\t\t6th level so most items in the Player&#8217;s Handbook will be available within a\n\t\tfew levels. The 20gp\/level cost will cover most things in the player&#8217;s\n\t\thandbook with the exception of some heavy armor (which can be very pricey).\n\t\tYour DM may also let you go beyond the player&#8217;s handbook, allowing you to\n\t\tcreate things like walls to hide behind, bridges to span chasms, columns to\n\t\tprop up falling ceilings, or pieces of furniture to flip over in a fit of\n\t\trage. Check with your DM to see what they&#8217;ll allow.\n\t\t<p>This notably doesn&#8217;t require materials like the Fabricate spell, doesn&#8217;t\n\t\t\trequire any tool proficiencies, and doesn&#8217;t specify how detailed or\n\t\t\tintricate the item can be. You may be able to create valuable items like\n\t\t\tpoisons, blocks of gold, or jewelry, and you may be able to create\n\t\t\tcomplex, moving items like crossbows, wagons, or siege engines (cheap\n\t\t\tones). You may even be able to produce items made of special materials\n\t\t\tlike adamantine weapons. Again, check with your DM to see what they&#8217;ll allow.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You can use this once per day for free and can refresh it by spending a\n\t\t\t2nd-level slot, but remember that you can only have one item at a time.\n\t\t\tYou may want to wait to use Performance of Creation until you need it in\n\t\t\torder to avoid paying the spell slot cost to use it a second time, but on\n\t\t\tdays when you&#8217;re not adventuring definitely use it to create something\n\t\t\tsmall, portable, and useful like an expensive poison.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>The option to refresh Performance of Creation means that you can compare\n\t\t\tany given item you might create to the benefits of a second-level spell.\n\t\t\tFor example: If you use this to create expensive disposable nom-magic items\n\t\t\tlike poisons, explosives, and things like alchemist&#8217;s fire, compare the\n\t\t\teffects of that item to casting a spell like Shatter.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animating Performance<\/span>: Similar in many\n\t\tways to summoning a creature for an hour. Your Dancing Item will have a\n\t\tdecent number of hit points, and gets one attack that deals a reasonable\n\t\tamount of force damage. Since it&#8217;s an object, it&#8217;s not very smart but it&#8217;s\n\t\talso immune to poison, psychic damage, and some mental status effects like\n\t\tcharm. It&#8217;s a decent combat pet, and it&#8217;ll keep your Bonus Action busy every\n\t\tturn that it attacks (though you can share that action with granting Bardic Inspiration), but the Dancing Item&#8217;s Irrepressible Dance aura still slows down or speeds up nearby creatures, so don\u2019t worry if you have to miss a few pet attacks by casting a bonus action spell or something.\n\t\t<p>The expectation is that you&#8217;ll cast this on something like a statue, but\n\t\t\tdon&#8217;t let that limit your choices. The item needs to be large or smaller,\n\t\t\tso you&#8217;re allowed to cast this on small things like a tankard or a necklace,\n\t\t\tas well as large things like a cart or even a carpet which might be large\n\t\t\tenough to carry you and your allies with the dancing item&#8217;s 30-foot fly\n\t\t\tspeed. At 18 Strength a large dancing item has a carrying capacity of 540\n\t\t\tpounds, allowing it to comfortably accommodate 2 medium creatures and their\n\t\t\tequipment. This becomes even easier if you and your party are mostly small\n\t\t\traces like halflings, and, since it&#8217;s immune to exhaustion, you can ride it\n\t\t\tas long as you&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>You can use this once per day for free, but you can also refresh the\n\t\t\teffect by spending a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, essentially making\n\t\t\tthis equivalent to a third-level spell. Considering that the spell Fly is\n\t\t\t3rd-level, has a duration of just 10 minutes, and requires Concentration;\n\t\t\tusing your Dancing Item as a combination flying mount and combat pet is an\n\t\t\textremely effective use of a spell slot.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Animating performance received errata to specify that it doesn&#8217;t work on attended\n\t\t\tobjects, so sadly you can no longer use this on enemy&#8217;s clothes or armor\n\t\t\tand cause them to be held aloft by their own pants. But you can simply take off your own pants, animate them, then put them back on to fly by the seat of your pants.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Creative Crescendo<\/span>: Not quite as good as\n\t\tusing Performance of Creation 5 times at once, but close. One item uses the\n\t\ttypical size rules and the rest must be small or tiny, but small is as big\n\t\tas a 3-foot tall humanoid and that&#8217;s plenty to work with. Most weapons could\n\t\tbe considered small, and many extremely valuable items like jewels and\n\t\tjewelry are tiny. You could use the big item to make a small catapult and\n\t\tuse the other items to make projectiles like urns full of alchemist&#8217;s fire.\n\t\tYou can use all 5 items (because you have 20 Charisma by this level) to make\n\t\texpensive poisons, then hand them off to your party&#8217;s rogue. Get\n\t\tcreative. But you could also create 5\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/equipment\/antimatter-rifle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Antimatter Rifles<\/a>\n(provided that they\u2019re available in your game) and hand out weapons to your party that do 6d8 necrotic damage. They comply with the size restriction and there\u2019s no longer a price restriction either.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"college-of-creation-ability-scores\">College of Creation Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise that the Creation Bard would want similar ability scores to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/bard\/#ability-scores\">Bard Handbook<\/a>.

At tenth level, we can choose two of the remaining three Face skills to gain Expertise in, and which two you choose really depends on how you want to focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13b - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We have room for a few feats, but we also have to boost our ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At fourth level, we take Fey Touched, adding +1 Charisma to have 18. For a 1st-level spell we choose Bless, because Bless is strong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eighth level, we take Resilient (Constitution). The +1 Constitution pushes us to 16, and the proficiency helps us shore up our Concentration saves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 13c - longest_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>At twelfth level, we take an ASI for +2 Charisma. We\u2019re a little behind on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\/\">Fundamental Math<\/a>, but being better at Concentration sooner likely kept buffs running longer for those four levels. Those buffs usually don\u2019t care about our Charisma anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At sixteenth and nineteenth level, we have choices. We can either take +2 Constitution twice, +2 Dexterity twice, each once, or we could look at feats like Inspiring Leader or Skill Expert<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Double Dexterity would increase our AC to 18, but doubled Constitution will make us that much better at holding Concentration, as well as be 40 more hit points over the former option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this build we choose to take the 20 Constitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 14a - longest_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"levels\">Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Levels<\/th><th>Features and Feats<\/th><th>Spellcasting<\/th><th>Notes and Tactics<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Bardic Inspiration &#8211; d6<br><br>Skills<br>-Deception<br>-Insight<br>-Intimidation<br>-Perception<br>-Persuasion<\/td><td>Cantrips<br>-Mending<br>-Vicious Mockery<br><br>1st-level Spell<br>-Detect Magic<br>-Healing Word<br>&#8211;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-5es-silvery-barbs\/\">Silvery Barbs<\/a><br>-Sleep<\/td><td>Thanks to being an Autognome, we start with 16 AC from Armored Casing.<br><br>If you want a weapon as a sort of backup for when you want more damage than Vicious Mockery, like a hand crossbow or something, go for it.
