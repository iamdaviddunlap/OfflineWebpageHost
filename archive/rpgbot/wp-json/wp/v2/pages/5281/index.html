Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options.

Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-features\">Monk Class Features<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Hit Points<\/span>: d8 hit points is hard for a\n\t\tstrictly melee class.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Base Attack Bonus<\/span>: The Monk&#8217;s primary\n\t\toffensive option, Flurry of Blows, pretends that the Monk has full BAB,\n\t\twhich is usually enough in combat but can be frustrating when qualifying for\n\t\tfeats.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Saves<\/span>: All good saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: The Monk is proficient\n\t\twith Monk weapons (which make up a collection of strange, exotic, and often\n\t\tforeign weapons) and a couple of other odds and ends like hand axes,\n\t\tcrossbows, and spears. Strangely, the Monk weapons tend to be the best\n\t\toptions since they can benefit from Flurry of blows. Monks gain no armor or\n\t\tshield proficiencies, and generally rely on their Monk AC bonus instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Skills<\/span>: The Monk skill list has several\n\t\texcellent options, several of which are difficult for the monk to capitalize\n\t\ton. By splashing a few skills and focusing on the best ones, the Monk can\n\t\tmake excellent use of their 4+ skill points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">AC Bonus<\/span> (Ex): The Monk AC bonus helps\n\t\tto offset the monk&#8217;s lack of armor. The scaling is fairly negligible, but it\n\t\tstill feels good to have. However, your AC will still be awful without\n\t\tadditional items and AC improvements.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Flurry of Blows<\/span> (Ex): This is the Monk&#8217;s\n\t\ticonic attack. It follows the same progression as a fighter maximizing the\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting feats, but you have no &#8220;off-hand&#8221; attacks. You don&#8217;t\n\t\teven need free hands. You can use your feet if your hands are full. You can\n\t\talso alternate freely between weapons and unarmed strikes, and you can\n\t\tsubstitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Unarmed Strike<\/span>: This is why you generally\n\t\tplay a monk: because you want to hit things with your bare hands\/feet\/etc.\n\t\tThe damage dice starts off fairly small, but when you hit d8 at level 4, it\n\t\tbegins to outpace whatever weapons you might be two-weapon fighting with. At\n\t\tlevel 12, your fists are greatswords. You can also deal nonlethal damage\n\t\twithout penalty, which is situationally useful. It&#8217;s important to note that\n\t\tyour unarmed strike damage is heavily size-based, so you want to do\n\t\teverything you can to increase your effective size. Get enlarged and throw\n\t\tImpact on an Amulet of Mighty Fists. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that the\n\t\tdamage progression stops at 20th-level, so items like a Monks Belt stop\n\t\tbeing useful at high levels unless you multiclass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"size_table\" class=\"wp-block-table zebra-striped is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Small<\/th><th>Medium<\/th><th>Large<\/th><th>Huge<\/th><th>Gargantuan<\/th><th>Colossal<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>1st-3rd<\/td><td>1d4<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4th-7th<\/td><td>1d6<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8th-11th<\/td><td>1d8<\/td><td>1d10<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12th-15th<\/td><td>1d10<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>3d6<\/td><td>4d6<\/td><td>6d6<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16th-19th<\/td><td>2d6<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>3d8<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20th<\/td><td>2d8<\/td><td>2d10<\/td><td>4d8<\/td><td>6d8<\/td><td>8d8<\/td><td>12d8<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Brawler\/Monk Unarmed Strike Damage by Size and Level<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This table is taken from the 3.5 rules.

Check with your GM before using this table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bonus Feats<\/span>: With the addition of the\n\t\tAdvanced Player&#8217;s Guide and Ultimate Combat, the Monk has a lot of great\n\t\tbonus feat options. And the best part: &#8220;A monk need not have any of the\n\t\tprerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.&#8221; This is\n\t\tespecially great for the high level style feats, since many of the\n\t\tprerequisites are fairly awful.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st Level\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Catch Off-Guard<\/span>: There isn&#8217;t a single\n\t\t\t\t\ttime when an improvised weapon will deal more damage than a Monk&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\tUnarmed Strike.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Attacks of\n\t\t\t\t\tOpportunity let you control the battlefiend, and this combines well\n\t\t\t\t\twith Greater Trip.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deflect Arrows<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dodge<\/span>: The Monk generally has low\n\t\t\t\t\tAC, and an extra point is a big help.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Grapple<\/span>: Essential for any\n\t\t\t\t\tgrappler..<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Scorpion Style<\/span>: You give up your full\n\t\t\t\t\tattack for a slightly annoying debuff. Oh, and if you miss or they\n\t\t\t\t\tsave you&#8217;re totally hosed.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Throw Anything<\/span>: Monks are not usually\n\t\t\t\t\tranged characters, and those who are use bows or thrown weapons.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>6th Level\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gorgon&#8217;s Fist<\/span>: Getting this without\n\t\t\t\t\tprerequisites makes it non-functional because Gorgon&#8217;s Fist only works\n\t\t\t\t\ton enemies already affected by Scorpion Style.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Bull Rush<\/span>: Too\n\t\t\t\t\tsituational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Disarm<\/span>: You can bypass\n\t\t\t\t\tCombat Expertise, but this is still situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Feint<\/span>: You are not a\n\t\t\t\t\tRogue.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Trip<\/span>: Getting this without\n\t\t\t\t\tCombat Expertise is fantastic.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mobility<\/span>: If you are within reach of\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething, you should be punching it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>10th Level\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Critical<\/span>: Going from 20 to\n\t\t\t\t\t19-20 isn&#8217;t a big enough leap to justify a feat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Throw<\/span>: Very situational.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Medusa&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: Skipping Scorpion\n\t\t\t\t\tStyle and Gorgon&#8217;s Fist makes this <em>extremely<\/em> potent. Lead off\n\t\t\t\t\ta combo with Stunning Fist, and get two free attacks! At level 12 you\n\t\t\t\t\tcan make foes staggered for 1d6+1 rounds, allowing you to continue to\n\t\t\t\t\tuse this feat without spending additional Ki.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snatch Arrows<\/span>: Situational and\n\t\t\t\t\tinneffective.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spring Attack<\/span>: You need to full\n\t\t\t\t\tattack to do damage as monk.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>14th Level\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Binding Throw<\/span>: This is a hard feat\n\t\t\t\t\tto make work. You need Ki Throw, but if you have both you can easily\n\t\t\t\t\tstart a grapple with an opponent you just tripped.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Ki Throw<\/span>: Still very\n\t\t\t\t\tsituational, and skipping the prereq doesn&#8217;t get you anything.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Stunning First<\/span> (Ex): Another iconic Monk\n\t\tability, stunning fist gets better as you advance. A\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">stunned<\/span> creature drops everything held\n\t\t(free disarm!), can&#8217;t take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its\n\t\tDexterity bonus to AC (if any). This makes the rest of your iterative\n\t\tattacks much better, and prevents the target from taking attacks of\n\t\topportunity when you make Combat Maneuver attempts in place of your\n\t\titerative attacks. At higher levels you can instead make the target\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-red\">fatigued<\/span> (-2 to CMD due to reduced str and\n\t\tdex), <span class=\"rating-orange\">sickened<\/span> (-2 to saves so you can\n\t\tmore reliably apply other affects),\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">staggered<\/span> (only one action per turn),\n\t\tpermanently <span class=\"rating-blue\">blinded<\/span> or\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">deafened<\/span> (permanently flat-footed or\n\t\tpermanently bad at casting spells), and finally\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">paralyzed<\/span> (lol). The only issue is that\n\t\tit&#8217;s a fortitude save, which is typically high for monsters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Always fantastic, Evasion\n\t\tworks well with your reasoanbly high dexterity and strong saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Fast Movement<\/span> (Ex): Extra speed lets you\n\t\tget into position to stop moving sooner. Past round 1, hope that you won&#8217;t\n\t\tneed this much speed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Maneuver Training<\/span> (Ex): Using your class\n\t\tlevel in place of BAB makes you actually viable for Combat Maneuvers.\n\t\tCombined with good strength and a plethora of weapons which give you bonuses\n\t\tto Combat Maneuvers, you can actually do pretty well.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Still Mind<\/span> (Ex): Your saves are already\n\t\tgreat, but a bonus against enchantments and compulsions can save you from\n\t\tsome really awful effects.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Ki Pool<\/span> (Su): Damage reduction is the\n\t\tbiggest problem for builds which rely on large numbers of attacks with\n\t\trelatively low damage. Ki Pool lets you treat your attacks as magic, silver,\n\t\tcold iron, lawful, and finally adamantine. While very few things have\n\t\tDR\/lawful, the others are excellent and cover a broad spectrum of enemies.\n\t\tAt low levels, you may need to carry weapons to handle DR silver and DR cold\n\t\tiron, but Ki Pool will handle things at higher levels so long as you have a\n\t\tpoint in your Ki Pool. You can spend points from your ki pool as a swift to\n\t\tget an <span class=\"rating-blue\">extra attack<\/span>,\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-orange\">boost your speed<\/span>, or\n\t\t<span class=\"rating-green\">boost your AC<\/span>. When things get serious,\n\t\tthese boosts can make or break your monk.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Slow Fall<\/span> (Ex): Patently worse than Feather\n\t\tFall, which is a first level spell, is more effective, and can affect\n\t\tmultiple targets.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">High Jump<\/span> (Ex): The bonus is cute, but\n\t\talmost never useful. By spending Ki, you can jump an extra 5 feet in the\n\t\tair. At 5th level Wizards can Fly.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Purity of Body<\/span> (Ex): Immunity to\n\t\tdiseases is nice, but rarely useful. With the exception of Contagion spell,\n\t\tyou typically have enough time to have someone cast Remove Disease before\n\t\tdisease becomes a problem.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wholeness of Body<\/span> (Ex): At the end of\n\t\tthe day when you&#8217;re about to rest, this is a good way to empty your Ki Pool,\n\t\tbut I don&#8217;t think it will see a lot of use if you still have things to fight\n\t\ttoday.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Improved Evasion<\/span> (Ex): Always amazing and\n\t\treliable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Diamond Body<\/span> (Su): Lots of high level\n\t\tmonsters have poison effects, and it&#8217;s nice to not worry about them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Abundant Step<\/span> (Su): Sometimes your speed\n\t\tcan&#8217;t get you where you need to go, and you can use this a move action.\n\t\tHowever, keep in mind that you can&#8217;t take additional actions after using it.\n\t\tMake sure to do something with your other actions before teleporting, even\n\t\tif it&#8217;s just to Fight Defensively for the AC bonus.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Diamond Soul<\/span> (Ex): Spell resistance which\n\t\teffectively makes 50% of spells and spell-like abilities not affect you,\n\t\tassuming the caster is the same level as you.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Quivering Palm<\/span> (Su): This is notably\n\t\tworse than most wizard save-or-die spells, but it&#8217;s still a once per day\n\t\tdeath effect with a reasonable DC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Timeless Body<\/span> (Ex): Stay young and pretty\n\t\tuntil you die of old age. Leave a pretty corpse.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Tongue of the Sun and Moon<\/span> (Ex): You can\n\t\ttalk to anything, but you&#8217;re not particularly good at it with no Diplomacy\n\t\tand lousy charisma.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Empty Body<\/span> (Su): Punch ghosts and walk\n\t\tthrough walls.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Perfect Self<\/span>: Suddenly you can&#8217;t use\n\t\tEnlarge Person. The DR is cute, and you become immune to things like\n\t\tDominate Person, but things which require you to be a humanoid have\n\t\tgenerally been abandoned for several levels. I would argue that this ability\n\t\tactually makes you <em>worse<\/em> since you can&#8217;t benefit from Enlarge\n\t\tPerson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks are primarily a striker, and their damage comes from their Strength, so Strength needs to be their biggest ability. Unfortunately, Monks are one of the most MAD classes, and you also need to invest in Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Str<\/span>: As a melee character, strength is the monk&#8217;s\n\tmost important ability. It contributes to your melee attacks and damage, shuriken\n\tdamage, and combat maneuvers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Crucial for the monk&#8217;s relatively low AC, and\n\tcontributes to several monk skills. Reflex saves are also a good point to focus\n\ton since you get Evasion.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Monks are combat characters with d8 hit points,\n\tso Constitution is crucial. Fortitude saves are also important for combat characters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Dump to 8.

However, these abilities are still secondary to the Monk&#8217;s primary function\n\tof hitting things and dealing damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Cha<\/span>: Dump to 7.

Extra vision abilities are always nice. Because the Monk&#8217;s damage output depends so heavily on their damage die size, being small is a serious problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dwarf<\/span>: While they don&#8217;t get a bonus to Strength, a +2\n\t\tto both Constitution and Wisdom goes a long way. Their penalty is to the Monk&#8217;s dump\n\t\tstat, and their low speed is offset by the monk speed bonus. Darkvision is great, and\n\t\tthey get a +2 to saves against spells on top of the Monk&#8217;s already impressive saves.\n\t\tUnfortunately, the favored class bonus is worthless.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Elf<\/span>: -2 to con is brutal, and their only helpful\n\t\tbonus is a +2 to dexterity. Many of the Elf&#8217;s bonuses relate to spellcasting, which\n\t\tmonks can&#8217;t do, and the alternate racial traits are not specifically helpful to the\n\t\tMonk. The favored class bonus provides a wholly unnecessary bonus to the Monk&#8217;s\n\t\tspeed.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Gnome<\/span>: Small monks? A -2 to strength is crippling, especially\n\t\tsince your damage dice will be smaller, and Enlarge Person won&#8217;t give you reach.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Elf<\/span>: +2 to strength and low-light vision, but that&#8217;s\n\t\treally all we get here. The Half-Elf&#8217;s alternate racial traits don&#8217;t offer anything\n\t\thelpful, and the Half-Elf&#8217;s alternate racial traits don&#8217;t help much. The Half-Elf can\n\t\ttake the Human favored class bonus for additional Ki, but that doesn&#8217;t help much.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Orc<\/span>: +2 to strength, and Ferocity can be helpful if\n\t\tyou want to use Intimidate. Darkvision is fantastic, too. The Half-Orc favored class\n\t\tbonus is garbage, so take the Human favored class bonus for extra Ki.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Halfling<\/span>: Small monks are typically terrible, but\n\t\tHalflings might be viable thanks to their racial feats. Emphasizing Fight Defensively\n\t\t(see my Practical Guide to Fighting Defensively) and taking Risky Striker can provide\n\t\ta significant damage boost, though the total number of feats you&#8217;ll need to succeed\n\t\tmay be prohibitive.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: +2 strength and a feat is pretty nice, but most\n\t\tdecent Monk feats aren&#8217;t available at first level. The skill points don&#8217;t hurt, but\n\t\tthey&#8217;re not doing us any big favors. The Human favored class bonus provides a bonus\n\t\tto the Monk&#8217;s Ki pool, which is especially helpful if you don&#8217;t take an archetype\n\t\twhich allows you to recharge your Ki.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Anatomist<\/span> (combat): Critical hits are not for monks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Axe to Grind<\/span> (combat): You may spend a great deal\n\t\tof time going one-on-one against enemies, and with your multiple attacks this +1\n\t\tbonus will add up to a lot of points.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodthirsty<\/span> (combat): This is just a bad trait.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bullied<\/span> (combat): If you are building your Monk\n\t\tas an area control defender, this may be useful.

You&#8217;re\n\t\ttrapped in here with me. Escape Artist is highly situational, and most of those situations\n\t\tinvolve getting away from a monk. Add one rank if you can spare on, but certainly don&#8217;t\n\t\tfocus on Escape Artist too much.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Intimidate<\/span> (Cha): Intimidate is you&#8217;re only interesting charisma-based\n\t\tskill, and Charisma is your dump stat. Unless you have very specific ideas how to use it,\n\t\tsuch as the Enforcer feat, Intimidate is a waste.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Knowledge (history)<\/span> (Int): One of the less important knowledge skills,\n\t\tand your intelligence is garbage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Knowledge (religion)<\/span> (Int): One of the best knowledge skills.\n\t\tIf no one in the party has it, maximize it. Otherwise, take one rank and hope for lucky rolls.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Perception<\/span> (Wis): Your wisdom is great, and this is the most used\n\t\tskill in the game.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Perform<\/span> (Cha): Do you look like a bard? Maybe cute in an\n\t\tRP heavy campaign, but otherwise useless.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ride<\/span> (Dex): You can run faster than a horse by level 6 (9 for\n\t\tdwarves), and don&#8217;t get a mount.

You have better ways to handle the combat maneuvers which\n\t\t\tCombat Expertise lets you focus on, and your Monk bonus feats grant you\n\t\t\taccess to many combat maneuver feats.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Disarm<\/span>: Disarming enemies\n\t\t\t\t\tcan put them at a major disadvantage. Because you probably have a free\n\t\t\t\t\thand, you can also take the enemies weapon to keep them from\n\t\t\t\t\trecovering it.

Note that your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tadjacent allies will also get free attacks, which makes this very\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeadly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Whirlwind Attack<\/span>: This is a bad feat\n\t\t\t\t\twith too many prerequisites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Reflexes<\/span>: Attacks of Opportunity\n\t\t\tlet you control the battlefield, and this combines well with Greater Trip.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Stand Still<\/span>: This is a good option\n\t\t\t\t\tif you aren&#8217;t good at tripping, but make sure that you are enlarged to\n\t\t\t\t\textend your reach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Combat Patrol<\/span>: Fantastic way to control\n\t\t\tthe battlefield.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Critical Focus<\/span>: Critical hits aren&#8217;t a\n\t\t\tgood mechanic for Monks.

Essential if you want to use more than one combat\n\t\t\tstyle.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Crushing Fist<\/span>: The penalty can be nice if\n\t\t\tyou have high Wisdom, but this should never be better than hitting the\n\t\t\ttarget a bunch of times or tripping them.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Deny Death<\/span>: You should not be spending\n\t\t\tenough time dieing to need this feat.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Agility<\/span>: Situational, and\n\t\t\tyou get a very limited number of uses of Abundant Step.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Assault<\/span>: This makes\n\t\t\t\t\tAbundant Step a good option early in fights.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Dimensional Dervish<\/span>: The two\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfeats required for this hurt, but teleporting during your full\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattack really helps with your mobility.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dimensional Maneuvers<\/span>: The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbonus is really big.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dimensional Savant<\/span>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSituational.

Consider looking for additional attacks:\n\t\t\thaste, natural weapons either from spells or from items, basically\n\t\t\tanything that lets you make another attack roll.

If you can stun your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttargets with one of your first few attacks, this will get you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta lot of free attacks. You can take this as your 10th level\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonk bonus feat to avoid the lousy prerequisites.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cockatrice Strike<\/span>: You\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshould not depend on critical hits to be effective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"\">Stunning Fist<\/span>: You already get this for\n\t\t\t\t\tfree.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Jawbreaker<\/span>: Bleed damage, and the\n\t\t\ttarget can&#8217;t cast spells with verbal components because it can&#8217;t speak.\n\t\t\tThe damage isn&#8217;t huge, but ongoing damage racks up quickly.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bonebreaker<\/span>: You have to stun an\n\t\t\t\t\talready stunned target, and ability damage to Strength and Dexterity\n\t\t\t\t\tisn;&#8217;t particularly lethal.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Neckbreaker<\/span>: This requires a huge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpile of feats, and if you have a target pinned they are probably\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\talready going to die.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Iron Will<\/span>: Your saves should all be\n\t\t\tfantastic already.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Stand<\/span>: You should not be spending\n\t\t\tenough time prone to justify this feat. If you are, Monkey Style is\n\t\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Throw<\/span>: I have no idea why Ki is in\n\t\t\tthe name. You can combine this with Greater Trip to throw the enemy toward\n\t\t\tyour allies in order to get more attacks of opportunity against the\n\t\t\ttarget.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Ki Throw<\/span>: Use your Ki throw\n\t\t\t\t\tto trip another target. However, you hit the second target as Bull\n\t\t\t\t\tRush with a -4 penalty, which means that you will fail a lot unless\n\t\t\t\t\tyou also put a lot of feats into Bull Rush. The feat is situational\n\t\t\t\t\talready, so making it situational <em>and<\/em> unreliable makes this\n\t\t\t\t\tfeat unappealing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Lunge<\/span>: Reach can be very helpful, but\n\t\t\tthis only applies to your attacks, so you can&#8217;t use it to get extra\n\t\t\tattacks of opportunity.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Nightmare Fist<\/span>: Highly situational, and\n\t\t\tMonks generally can&#8217;t make magical darkness.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Perfect Strike<\/span>: The ability is cool,\n\t\t\tbut the weapon list is needlessly limited, and you get very few uses per\n\t\t\tday. You will probably find yourself saving the uses for important fights,\n\t\t\tthen forgetting to use them.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pinning Knockout<\/span>: Subdual damage\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t work on everything, but when it does you can deal double damage\n\t\t\tand finish them off later.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Pinning Rend<\/span>: If you&#8217;re grappling, this\n\t\t\tcan add quite a bit of extra damage. Monk&#8217;s weapon dice also get bigger as\n\t\t\tyou level, which can make this particularly effective.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Punishing Kick<\/span>: You need to hit to use\n\t\t\tthe effect, and the target still gets a saving throw. The effects can be\n\t\t\treplicated with the Bull Rush and Trip maneuvers, which monks should\n\t\t\tgenerally be decent at without taking any feats, but this does allow you\n\t\t\tto do both without an attack of opportunity and without spending\n\t\t\tadditional feats.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Power Attack<\/span>: Unlike many melee\n\t\t\tcharacters, Power Attack is not a given for Monks. Your attack bonus\n\t\t\tmatches a two-weapon fighter, and your damage comes primarily from\n\t\t\tmultiple attacks. If you find that you hit frequently, power attack can be\n\t\t\tan excellent way to boost your damage. Don&#8217;t be afraid to turn it off\n\t\t\tagainst armored foes.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Furious Focus<\/span>: Because you depend on\n\t\t\t\t\ta large number of attacks, this won&#8217;t help you very much.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Spider Step<\/span>: Cool, but very situational.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Cloud Step<\/span>: Cool, but very\n\t\t\t\t\tsituational, and by this level there should be other flight\n\t\t\t\t\toptions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Step Up<\/span>: Extremely helpful for any\n\t\t\tmelee character, but especially against spellcasters.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Following Step<\/span>: An excellent\n\t\t\t\t\timprovement on Step Up; you could theoretically chase several enemies\n\t\t\t\t\taround the field if you position yourself properly with the 10 foot\n\t\t\t\t\tmove.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Step Up And Strike<\/span>: Combat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReflexes isn&#8217;t required, but you really want it. This can let you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tget a huge number of free attacks as enemies run around within\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyour reach.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Touch of Serenity<\/span>: Off-switch for\n\t\t\tmages. The DC will be respectable if you have the 18 wisdom for the feat.\n\t\t\tOne use per monk level should be plenty; if you&#8217;re preventing spellcasters\n\t\t\tfrom casting spells, they should fall apart quickly.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Toughness<\/span>: With only d8 hit points,\n\t\t\tMonk need all of the help they can get.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Vicious Stomp<\/span>: Combined with Improved\n\t\t\tTrip, this is a free attack. Combined with Greater Trip, you get two\n\t\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Vital Strike<\/span>: Monks depend on Full\n\t\t\tAttack.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon Finesse<\/span>: If your Dexterity is\n\t\t\thigher than your Strength, you aren&#8217;t doing enough damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon Focus<\/span>: Like two-weapon weilders,\n\t\t\tweapon focus gets you a lot of mileage due to your high number of\n\t\t\tattacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"style-feats\">Style Feats<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your best bet will often be to pick one or two styles and stick to it. If you take Combat Style Master, you can switch styles as a free action, which allows you to spend your turn in an offensive style, then switch to a defensive style when you are done attacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Boar Style<\/span>: One of the few monk styles\n\t\t\twhich adds damage with the first feat, Boar Style lets you inflict 2d6\n\t\t\textra damage if you hit the same target more than once in a turn. If you\n\t\t\thave a spare feat and don&#8217;t want to deal with style feats, this is a good\n\t\t\tdip into monk styles, but if you want to invest in style feats look\n\t\t\telsewhere.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Boar Ferocity<\/span>: Now you can deal\n\t\t\t\t\tpiercing damage. Demoralizing target for free when you rend flesh is\n\t\t\t\t\tnice, but intimidate generally isn&#8217;t in the Monk&#8217;s wheelhouse.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Boar Shred<\/span>: This adds ongoing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbleed damage. The ability to demoralize as a move action is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tredundant with Boar Ferocity, and is actually worse because it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprevents you from making a Full Attack. The ongoing damage is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfairly small for style capstone feat, making this one of the very\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfew styles without a decent capstone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Crane Style<\/span>: The Crane style is very\n\t\t\tdefensive, and works well right away. Crane Style makes the Fight\n\t\t\tDefensively option -2 to attacks and +3 to AC. Couple with a few ranks in\n\t\t\tAcrobatics, that becomes -2\/+4, which exceeds the bonus provided by Combat\n\t\t\tExpertise until level 16, and at a reduced penalty. Coupled with Dodge,\n\t\t\tthis makes your AC fairly impressive, but you are very vulnerable when\n\t\t\tcaught flat-footed. Check out my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/fighting_defensively\">Practical Guide to Fighting Defensively<\/a>.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Crane Wing<\/span>: An extra +4 AC is\n\t\t\t\t\tpretty great, even though it only applies to melee attacks. You&#8217;ll\n\t\t\t\t\tneed to track how close enemies get to hitting you because you lose\n\t\t\t\t\tthe AC bonus on a near-miss.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Crane Riposte<\/span>: If you are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tusing Crane Style, you are likely always fighting defensively,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhich means this is effectively a +1 to your attacks. The second\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbenefit is a free attack when you use Crane Wing when you lose the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCrane Wing bonus to AC. This isn&#8217;t essential to enjoy Crane\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStyle.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Djinni Style<\/span>:Elemental fist isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\tspectacular, and the bonus damage won&#8217;t help much. The bonus to AC against\n\t\t\tattacks of opportunity is situational at best.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Djinni Spirit<\/span>: The deafening\n\t\t\t\t\teffect is nice, but being deafened generally isn&#8217;t very problematic.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe resistance to electricity is also nice, but can be replaced by a\n\t\t\t\t\tcheap spell.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Djinni Spin<\/span>: Far better than\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhirlwind Attack, Djinni Spin deals automatic damage. Combined\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith Djinni Spirit, Djinni Spin also deafens targets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Style<\/span>: A grab bag of bonuses and\n\t\t\tbuffs, Dragon Style is decent, but not spectacular. The bonus damage only\n\t\t\tapplies to your first attack per round (not even your first hit), so it&#8217;s\n\t\t\tnot especially meaningful.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dragon Ferocity<\/span>: Doubling your\n\t\t\t\t\tstrength bonus to unarmed strike damage is tempting, but it&#8217;s still\n\t\t\t\t\tonly your first attack per round and you need two feats to do it.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Dragon Roar<\/span>: The cone&#8217;s small size\n\t\t\t\t\tmeans that you can affect at most 6 targets, but automatic damage is\n\t\t\t\t\tstill pretty good. Adding the Shaken condition is also nice, as Shaken\n\t\t\t\t\tcan really make an enemy vulnerable. Don&#8217;t plan to spam this, but it&#8217;s\n\t\t\t\t\ta cool option on turns when you need to move or when multiple enemies\n\t\t\t\t\tare grouped together. Also note that the extra damage from Dragon\n\t\t\t\t\tStyle and Dragon Ferocity don&#8217;t apply because this isn&#8217;t an attack.\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Child Style<\/span>: Unless you fight a\n\t\t\thuge number of giants, this is useless.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Child Topple<\/span>: Unless you fight\n\t\t\t\t\ta huge number of giants, this is useless.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Earth Child Binder<\/span>: Situational,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teven if you&#8217;re fighting giants exclusively.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Efreeti Style<\/span>: Similar to Djinni\n\t\t\tstyle, this adds a small amount of damage to your Elemental Fist, which is\n\t\t\ta fairly limited resource due to the limited uses per day.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Efreeti Stance<\/span>: The resistance is\n\t\t\t\t\tnice, and setting things on fire is awesome. Short of an appropriate\n\t\t\t\t\tsource of water, the only way to overcome the &#8220;on fire&#8221; condition is\n\t\t\t\t\tto waste a round in hopes that you will pass the reflex save. Then\n\t\t\t\t\twhen they finally do, you can just set them on fire again.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Efreeti Touch<\/span>: The cone is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall, but setting a bunch of enemies on fire is undeniably\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teffective. The ongoing damage is fairly small, but it is costly to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tovercome, and racks up faster than you might expect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grabbing Style<\/span>: Essential for any\n\t\t\tgrappler. This makes it much easier to grapple two targets at the same\n\t\t\ttime.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Grabbing Drag<\/span>: With Swift Grapple,\n\t\t\t\t\tyou can make three grapple checks in a turn and damage or move two\n\t\t\t\t\topponents.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Grabbing Master<\/span>: The biggest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappeal of Grabbing Style is that you can affect two targets at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonce without penalty. This provides a tiny bit of extra mobility,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut it doesn&#8217;t function under Grabbing Style&#8217;s primary use\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcase.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jabbing Style<\/span>: +1d6 damage on each\n\t\t\tsuccessful attack after the first against a single target. There does not\n\t\t\tappear to be a cap on how many times this damage can apply in a single\n\t\t\tturn.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Jabbing Dancer<\/span>: Fantastic for\n\t\t\t\t\tmoving into flanking or getting out of a bad position in combat.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Jabbing Master<\/span>: The damage here\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tis nuts. Your second successful attack adds +2d6 damage, and every\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfurther successful attack adds +4d6 damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Janni Style<\/span>: Dodge is strictly better.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Janni Tempest<\/span>:The +4 bonus is nice,\n\t\t\t\t\tbut Bull Rush is situational, and you should generally be tripping as\n\t\t\t\t\tyour first attack in a round to capitalize on the attack bonus against\n\t\t\t\t\tprone targets.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Janni Rush<\/span>: Charging isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treally a big part of being a monk, but doubling the damage dice is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnice once your unarmed strike damage gets suitably big.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kirin Style<\/span>: A bonus to saving throws\n\t\t\tagainst attacks. Not special attacks. Not spells. Not special abilities.\n\t\t\tAttacks. There&#8217;s some room to argue that &#8220;Attack&#8221; in this case constitutes\n\t\t\tany hostile action (similar to how the spell Invisibility breaks when you\n\t\t\t&#8220;attack&#8221;), but it&#8217;s not clear, so check with your GM. Oh, and a bonus\n\t\t\tagainst attacks of opportunity for some reason. On top of how weird the\n\t\t\tbonuses are, monks are typically terrible at Knowledge skills, so I don&#8217;t\n\t\t\tknow how you would reliably benefit from the feat.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kirin Strike<\/span>: Oh good, now you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\tdependent on Intelligence for damage on top of the other 4 abilities\n\t\t\t\t\tyou need just to remain upright. Making this a swift action is just\n\t\t\t\t\tcruel considering how much you need to invest to do more than the\n\t\t\t\t\tminimum damage with it.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Kirin Path<\/span>: Taking 10 on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tknowledge checks to identify creatures is nice, and you can do it\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&#8220;even when using Kirin Style&#8221;, which is great because that&#8217;s the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly time that you would want to do it. You can dance around your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenemies a bit when they move up to you, but to get any real use\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tout of this you need a particularly high intelligence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Mantis Style<\/span>: Stunning fist is very\n\t\t\teffective, but its biggest problem is the DC. This helps quite a bit.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Mantis Wisdom<\/span>: The first half of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe benefits of this feat is very odd. It encourages multiclassing as\n\t\t\t\t\ta Monk, and allows you to remove Stunning Fist effects. I&#8217;m not sure\n\t\t\t\t\twhy you would do either of those things. The only real draw is the +2\n\t\t\t\t\tto stunning fist attacks, which is nice because missing wastes the\n\t\t\t\t\tattempt.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Mantis Torment<\/span>: So instead of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbecoming Stunned, which robs them of their entire turn, forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem to drop their weapons, and makes them flat-footed with an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\textra -2 to AC, the enemy is dazzled (-1 to attacks), staggered\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(one action), and then fatigued a turn later. This actually makes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStunning Fist worse. You could arguably hit them again to make\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem Exhausted, but at that point you&#8217;ve spent four Stunning Fist\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattempts to apply a status condition that&#8217;s less harmful than\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStunned.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Marid Style<\/span>: Similar to Djinni style,\n\t\t\tthis adds a small amount of damage to your Elemental Fist, which is a\n\t\t\tfairly limited resource due to the limited uses per day.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Marid Spirit<\/span>: The ice resistance is\n\t\t\t\t\tnice, but the Entangle effect is the real draw. Entangled lowers AC\n\t\t\t\t\tand CMD, and keeps people in place for additional punching.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Marid Coldsnap<\/span>: Lines are one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the least useful AOEs, but the effect and automatic damage is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monkey Style<\/span>: If you spend a lot of time\n\t\t\tprone, you are a very bad monk.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monkey Moves<\/span>: This allows you to move\n\t\t\t\t\tin a lot of ways that you generally won&#8217;t want to move, and makes you\n\t\t\t\t\tslightly better at climbing.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Monkey Shine<\/span>: +4 to attacks and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAC against a target is fantastic. Stun them, move into their\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspace, trip them while they can&#8217;t make attacks of opportunity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(keep in mind that losing dexterity to AC also affects CMD, as do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tother typeless AC penalties like the -2 from the Stunned\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcondition), and revel in your net +8 bonus to attack your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvictim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Panther Style<\/span>: This would be a cool\n\t\t\tability if Monks spent a lot of time moving around in combat.\n\t\t\tUnfortunately, they generally don&#8217;t. Panther Style seems to fly in the\n\t\t\tface of this stereotype by allowing you to attack in response to attacks\n\t\t\tof opportunity. This is an excellent counter to Area Control Defenders,\n\t\t\tassuming that you can reach them from the wrong end of their polearms.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panther Claw<\/span>: Run through mobs of\n\t\t\t\t\tenemies at full Run speed, and punch the snot out of everything dumb\n\t\t\t\t\tenough to try to stop you. You probably want Mobility, or you&#8217;re going\n\t\t\t\t\tto eat a lot of damage trying to draw these attacks.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Panther Parry<\/span>: This really\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timproves the reliability of Panther Claw. You have the potential\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto kill, stun, trip, or otherwise disable the target before they\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tattack you, and you apply a -2 penalty to their attack if they&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstill able to attack you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pummelling Style<\/span>: This fixes Flurry of\n\t\t\tBlows&#8217; problem with DR, and greatly increases the probability of scoring a\n\t\t\tcritical hit. If you hit with several of the attack rolls and score a\n\t\t\tcritical hit, you may end up duplicating a fairly absurd amount of damage.\n\t\t\tIf you don&#8217;t know what style to pick up, make it this one.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Pummelling Bully<\/span>: If you are built\n\t\t\t\t\tfor it, tripping your target can be a great option. However, the\n\t\t\t\t\trequirement for Improved Reposition (which requires 13 Int) is really\n\t\t\t\t\tsteep.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Pummelling Charge<\/span>: You should start\n\t\t\t\t\tevery combat with a Pummeling Strike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan Style<\/span>: Similar to Djinni style,\n\t\t\tthis adds a small amount of damage to your Elemental Fist, which is a\n\t\t\tfairly limited resource due to the limited uses per day. If you miss you\n\t\t\tstill deal the acid damage, which is pretty nice for your iterative\n\t\t\tattacks.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan Skin<\/span>: The acid resistance\n\t\t\t\t\tis decent, and Staggerred is a pretty good status condition.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Shaitan Earthblast<\/span>: Columns are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta great AOE shape, and this has the best range of the djinni-like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstyles. Automatic unarmed strike damage is great, and staggering\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgroups of enemies can really turn a battle in your favor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snake Style<\/span>: And suddenly Sense Motive\n\t\t\tis your AC. At first level, with one rank, 14 wisdom, and Snake Style, you\n\t\t\tcan have a +8 to Sense Motive, which likely beats your AC bonus. This is\n\t\t\tan immediate action, so you can only do it once per round, which means you\n\t\t\tstill want to invest in your AC for iterative attacks and multiple\n\t\t\tenemies. As you grow in level, your Sense Motive bonus will likely outpace\n\t\t\tyour AC if only because you get guaranteed skill ranks every level.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snake Sidewind<\/span>: Critical hits aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\t\tsomething that monks can rely on, and your Sense Motive bonus probably\n\t\t\t\t\tshouldn&#8217;t outpace your attack bonus, except with your iterative\n\t\t\t\t\tattacks. Spending your immediate action to take a free 5 foot step is\n\t\t\t\t\tan interesting option, but you can&#8217;t do it if you used Snake Style in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe previous round.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Snake Fang<\/span>: free attack when\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyour enemy misses is good enough to justify taking Combat Reflexes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand standing in crowds of enemies to draw fire. Because you also\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuse your immediate action to use Snake Style to replace your AC,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou may need to decide between defending yourself or relying on\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyour AC and potentially hitting your opponent an extra time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Snapping Turtle Style<\/span>: Dodge is\n\t\t\tstrictly better, but this contributes to the Monk&#8217;s flat-footed AC, which\n\t\t\tis generally terrible.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Snapping Turtle Clutch<\/span>: Literally\n\t\t\t\t\tthe only reason to take this is for the free grapple attempts.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Snapping Turtle Shell<\/span>: An extra\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t+1 to AC still isn&#8217;t much, but it applies to your AC\/touch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAC\/flat-footed AC, which is nice. -4 to critical hit confirmations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tagainst you won&#8217;t matter much, but it certainly feels\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomforting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tiger Style<\/span>: Slashing damage is only\n\t\t\toccasionally helpful, the CMD bonus is situational, critical hits aren&#8217;t\n\t\t\tsomething that Monks can really rely on, and even in the case of a\n\t\t\tcritical hit the bleed damage doesn&#8217;t last long enough to be meaningful.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Tiger Claws<\/span>: Your Base Attack Bonus\n\t\t\t\t\twill be lower than your best attacks with Flurry of Blows because\n\t\t\t\t\tflurry pretends that you have 1\/1 BAB, but Monks actually have 2\/3\n\t\t\t\t\tBAB. Bull rushing an enemy and not being able to follow them actively\n\t\t\t\t\thurts you because you can&#8217;t full attack next round, which Tiger Pounce\n\t\t\t\t\tconveniently addresses. You can choose to immediately close the\n\t\t\t\t\tdistance by moving as a swift action, or you can wait until your next\n\t\t\t\t\tturn to chase your enemy if they&#8217;ve moved around.<p><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Tiger Pounce<\/span>: You get to move\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas a swift action, which is great, but it can only be toward an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tenemy you hit on this turn or your previous turn. The most likely\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscenario is that you&#8217;re chasing a fleeing foe or that you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclosing with an enemy which you pushed away with Tiger Claws.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While you will most likely be fighting unarmed, monk weapons offer you a lot of really fantastic options, including bonuses to combat maneuvers. Monks who aren&#8217;t specialized with weapons should still carry a couple to bypass DR until Ki Pool covers the bases, and for bonuses on CMB checks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monks can use a single weapon for flurry of blows, which removes the need for double weapons or two-weapon fighting. This also increases the importance of damage enhancements on your weapon because you get a large number of low-damage attacks. If you plan to use weapons, be sure to pick up some damage enhancements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">bo staff<\/span>: Basically a quarterstaff with the\n\t\tblocking property. d6 damage, 20&#215;2 crit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">brass knuckles<\/span>: Just like unarmed strike, but\n\t\tless damage and enchantable.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">butterfly sword<\/span>: Basically a fancy version of\n\t\ta dagger that you can&#8217;t throw. d4 damage, 19-20&#215;2 crit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">cestus<\/span>: Allows bludgeoning <em>or<\/em> piercing\n\t\tdamage, which adds some nice versatility. d4 damage, 19-20&#215;2 crit.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">dan bong<\/span>: Despite doing 1d3 bludgeoning damage,\n\t\tthe Dan Bong is fantastic. It adds an incredibly rare +2 bonus to grapple checks,\n\t\thas the blocking property, and can be thrown. Also it has 19-20&#215;2 crit for some\n\t\treason. It doesn&#8217;t actually have the Grapple property, so you can&#8217;t apply other\n\t\tweapon bonuses (masterwork\/enhancement) to your grapple checks by using a dan\n\t\tbong. However, since you&#8217;re not using it to grapple, you can use your unarmed\n\t\tstrike damage when grappling.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">double chained kama<\/span>: The double property doesn&#8217;t\n\t\treally matter, but reach does. The double-chained kama also has the Trip property,\n\t\twhich means you can use it to trip, drop one end to prevent yourself from being\n\t\ttripped back, then pick up the dropped end as a free action by pulling the chain.\n\t\tThe description mentions using it to disarm, but the table doesn&#8217;t list the disarm\n\t\tproperty, and normal Kamas don&#8217;t have disarm. Keep in mind that because this is\n\t\ta double weapon, each end of the weapon can be a different material and can be\n\t\tenchanted seperately.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">double chicken saber<\/span>: A short sword with Disarm.\n\t\t1d6 slashing damage and 19-20 crit. A solid choice, though not very exciting.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">emei piercer<\/span>: The wording is confusing. Despite the d3\n\t\tdamage, the description says that emei piercers turn unarmed strikes into piercing\n\t\tdamage. General consensus in rules discussions seems to be that the weapon overrides\n\t\tunarmed strike damage, but is otherwise treated as an unarmed strike. If you just need\n\t\ta source of piercing damage, there are better options.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">fighting fan<\/span>: Leave these for ninjas. Poison is not\n\t\tyour thing, and neither is feinting.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">jutte<\/span>: 1d6 bludgeoning damage and disarm. Not awful, but\n\t\tyou will be better served getting a weapon with a different damage type so that\n\t\tyou don&#8217;t have to carry a pile of weapons.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">kama<\/span>: 1d6 slashing damage and trip. One of the best\n\t\toptions in the core rulebook. It&#8217;s light, which doesn&#8217;t do much for monks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">kusarigama<\/span>: Similar to the double-chained kama, but\n\t\tthe kusarigama trades some of the off-hand weapon damage for the grapple property.\n\t\tThe Grapple property gives you a +2 to grapple, and you can add weapon enhancement\n\t\tbonuses to your grapple checks, but you use the weapon&#8217;s damage when grappling in\n\t\tplace of your unarmed strike damage.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">kyoketsu shoge<\/span>: The description doesn&#8217;t appear to match\n\t\tthe stats: it says that you can swing the ring around, but the stats don&#8217;t say\n\t\tthat you can deal bludgeoning damage. For what it does, the Kusarigama and\n\t\tdouble-chained kama are better options, but the sword can do slashing or piercing\n\t\tdamage, which covers both of your missing damage types.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">lungchuan tamo<\/span>: 1d4 damage, piercing or slashing\n\t\tdamage, and throwable. This is a very versatile option if you don&#8217;t plan to use\n\t\tcombat maneuvers.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">monk&#8217;s spade<\/span>: 1d6 damage of any type. The table is a bit\n\t\tmisleading, though; the two ends do different types of damage. This seems like a\n\t\tsolid option, but it&#8217;s two-handed, which limits your options in a fight, and it\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t give you bonuses to combat maneuvers.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">nine-ring broadsword<\/span>: The monk&#8217;s battleaxe. Solid\n\t\t1d8 slashing damage, and x3 crit, but nothing for combat maneuvers.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">nine-section whip<\/span>: 1d8 bludgeoning damage, 19-20&#215;2\n\t\tcrit, blocking, distracting, and trip. Blocking and trip on one item is great,\n\t\tbut the damage isn&#8217;t spectacular because it&#8217;s bludgeoning. Still, this would be a\n\t\tgreat item at low levels before your unarmed strike damage exceeds 1d8. You can\n\t\thold it in one hand to take advantage of the blocking property while still fighting\n\t\tunarmed, which is great for Crane Style monks.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">nunchaku<\/span>: 1d6 bludgeoning damage and disarm.\n\t\tNot awful, but there are better options.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">quarterstaff<\/span>: Bo Staff is strictly better.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">rope dart<\/span>: 1d4 piercing damage, blocking, distracting,\n\t\tand throwable.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">sai<\/span>: Less damage than the nunchaku, but also provides\n\t\ta +2 bonus when sundering weapons. Sundering isn&#8217;t a particularly popular option,\n\t\tso the nunchaku is probably a better weapon.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">sansetsukon<\/span>: 1d10 bludgeoning damage is pretty great,\n\t\tand meets your unarmed strike damage until level 12. 19-20&#215;2 crit is great, and\n\t\tblocking and disarm are great on one weapon. The damage is good enough that, even\n\t\tat high levels where your unarmed strikes exceed 1d10 damage, the Sansetsukon may\n\t\tbe a viable option. The ability to attack with a two-handed weapon with as many\n\t\tattacks as two-weapon fighting builds means that the additional damage from Strength\n\t\t(not to mention Power Attack if you take it) could easily close the gap in damage\n\t\toutput. However, you still need to overcome the RAW numerical advantage provided\n\t\tby permanent +5 unarmed strikes, which will be difficult to do.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">seven-branched sword<\/span>: 1d10 slashing damage with x3 crit\n\t\tis pretty good, and it has disarm. You can also do an almost-trip to make targets\n\t\tflat-footed for a round, which is a weird situationally useful trick.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shang gou<\/span>: 1d4 slashing damage, but it can be used for\n\t\tdisarm <em>or<\/em> trip, which adds some excellent versatility.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">shuriken<\/span>: Because they are drawn as a free action like\n\t\tammunition, shuriken can be used with Flurry of Blows. However, they are destroyed when\n\t\tused, which makes it difficult to justify enchanting them. Carry a few mundane shuriken\n\t\tfor the rare case where you can&#8217;t just run up and punch things.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">siangham<\/span>: 1d6 piercing damage. There are options\n\t\twhich deal the same damage and have special properties.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">tiger fork<\/span>: 1d8 piercing damage, and it can be set\n\t\tagainst charges. Basically a bad trident.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">tonfa<\/span>: 1d6 bludgeoning damage and blocking. Nine-section\n\t\twhip is strictly better unless you need a light weapon for some weird reason.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">tri-point double-edged sword<\/span>: &#8220;sword&#8221; is somewhat of a\n\t\tminsomer; this thing is more of a polearm. 1d10 slashing damage, x3 crit, and reach.\n\t\tDespite being in the &#8220;monk&#8221; weapon group, but lacks the Monk property, so you can&#8217;t\n\t\tuse it with Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">unarmed strike<\/span>: Tried and true. Your damage scales\n\t\twith level, you can&#8217;t be disarmed, and you technically don&#8217;t need your hands free\n\t\tto fight unarmed.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">urumi<\/span>: 1d8 slashing damage an impressive 18-20&#215;2 critical.\n\t\tDistracting won&#8217;t get you much because Monks generally don&#8217;t feint.\n\t\tDespite being in the &#8220;monk&#8221; weapon group, but lacks the Monk property, so you can&#8217;t\n\t\tuse it with Flurry of Blows. <\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">wushu dart<\/span>: 1d3 piercing damage and throwable. There are\n\t\tmany more interesting options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend carrying a sansetsukon as your primary weapon due to the high damage and critical threat range, but be prepared to drop it once you get Ki Strike if you need to bypass DR\/magic, or abandon it completely once you can get enhancement bonuses on your fists reliably. The sansetsukon can also be used to disarm, but when you stop using it as your primary weapon replace it with something lighter like a double-chicken saber (for the slashing damage). Also carry a double-chained kama for tripping and for reach. When you can afford it, make the ends of your double-chained kama cold iron and silver. Piercing damage isn&#8217;t as important, but carry a Lungchuan Tamo or two just to be safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Monks can&#8217;t use armor, so I recommend getting someone in your party to cast Mage Armor on you. With hours\/level duration even a low level wizard can cover you for the full adventuring day. If your pet Wizard is stingy with his spell slots, drop 1000 gold pieces to buy him a Pearl of Power 1 so you can both share Mage Armor from one slot. The +4 bonus from Mage Armor is enough to make up most of the AC gap between a Monk and typical front-line character like a Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Blade of the Sword-Saint<\/span> (75,350 gp): 18-20 threat\n\t\trange and you can use it two-handed. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s worth the cost because\n\t\tKi Intensifying isn&#8217;t very good, but sometimes you just really want to double-down\n\t\ton the far-east feel of a monk swinging a katana.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Brawling<\/span> (+1): Add your enhancement bonus to all\n\t\tof your combat maneuvers. Conveniently, unarmed strikes are light bludgeoning weapons\n\t\tso you could put this on an Amulet of Mighty Fists if you wanted to do so.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Furyborn<\/span> (+2): The best case scenario for this weapon\n\t\tability is for a monk to put it on an amulet of mighty fists. You need to be attacking\n\t\twith the same weapon a large number of times to make the ability work, and monks are\n\t\tthe best way to do that. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not clear if the maximum bonus of +5\n\t\tis +5 in total with other enhancement bonuses (like your +5 unarmed strikes) or if\n\t\tit&#8217;s +5 just from Furyborn. If it&#8217;s the latter, the appeal of attacking with a +10\n\t\tenhancement bonus is hard to ignore. Of course, you still face the issue that you\n\t\tshould be killing enemies too quickly for this to ramp up, in which case you&#8217;re\n\t\tsinking a bunch of money into an ability that rarely matters.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Ki Focus<\/span> (+1): If you insist on using weapons,\n\t\tyou need to have this.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Ki Intensifying<\/span> (+2): Basically Ki Focus but you\n\t\tget to add half of your enhancement bonus to relevant special abilities. If you\n\t\tplan to put a bunch of money into an enhancement bonus this might work, but I\n\t\twould wait until you have a <em>ton<\/em> of spare money before you even consider\n\t\tthis ability. Enhancing your Wisdom will do much more for you for much less money.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wounding<\/span> (+2): Because the bleed stacks with itself,\n\t\tWounding works best when you make a huge number of attacks with a single weapon,\n\t\twhich is where monks specialize. Unfortunately, most of the time you&#8217;ll get more\n\t\tdamage out of abilities like Flaming because bleed damage takes so long to deal\n\t\tsignificant of damage. This could be great against enemies with huge pools\n\t\tof hit points, but even against those foes you&#8217;ll do more damage hitting them\n\t\tmore on successive rounds.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wyroot<\/span> (1,000\/2,000\/4,000): An easily-overlooked\n\t\tmethod for recovering Ki. Attacking a helpless target is an automatic critical\n\t\thit, so you can use this to farm Ki from unconscious enemies. If you deal nonlethal\n\t\tdamage you can beat the same target repeatedly to fully restore your Ki pool, then\n\t\tfill the weapon to recharge later.

Notably, it doesn&#8217;t require\n\t\ta +1 enhancement bonus like a weapon does, so you can go straight to the fun\n\t\tstuff. The Impact enhancement is tempting since it lets you use a larger damage\n\t\tscale, but Paizo has ruled that unarmed strikes count as light weapons and\n\t\tImpact can&#8217;t be placed on light weapons. Instead, consider options like shocking,\n\t\tspeed (oh look more attacks), or holy.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Belt of Physical Perfection<\/span>: Get one early, and\n\t\tupgrade it often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bracers of Armor<\/span>: A wand of Mage Armor provides as\n\t\tmuch AC as +4 bands, and for the same cost you can guy a huge box of wands, and\n\t\tget the AC bonus at much lower level.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Cloak of Resistance<\/span>: Too crucial to forego.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deliquescent Gloves<\/span>: For just 8,000 gp you can add\n\t\t+1d6 acid damage to attacks made with your hands. You&#8217;ll need to use your hands\n\t\tfor unarmed strikes to get the damage, but if you&#8217;re not using a weapon that&#8217;s\n\t\tprobably not a problem. These cost as much as a +2 weapon, so wait to get these\n\t\tuntil your Amulet of Mighty Fists is already +2-equivalent.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Ioun Stone (Dusty Rose)<\/span>: At only\n\t\t5000gp, a Dusty Rose Ioun Stone provides a cheaper boost to AC than upgrading\n\t\tyour Ring of Protection from +1 to +2. The bonus is an insight bonus, which\n\t\tmakes it easy to stack because insight bonuses to AC are extremely rare.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Headband of inspired wisdom<\/span>: Get one for the\n\t\textra AC, ki pool, and boost to your saves, but your belt is more important.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Monk&#8217;s Belt<\/span>: Your belt of Physical Perfection will\n\t\tbe considerably more effective.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Monk&#8217;s Robe<\/span>: Similar to the Monk&#8217;s Belt, but you\n\t\tpretend to be 5 levels higher instead of 4 and it takes your mostly useless\n\t\trobe slot.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Longarm Bracers<\/span>: Functionally similar to the Lunge\n\t\tfeat, but they only work 3 times per day and they don&#8217;t impose a penalty on\n\t\tattack rolls for your unarmed strikes.

When your\n\t\tparty members are upgrading to +1 weapons, this is a great low-cost option until\n\t\tyou can afford +5 Greater Magic Fang.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Magic Fang, Greater<\/span>: Assuming that you can find\n\t\tsomeone with Caster Level 20, permanent +5 to your unarmed strikes costs just 8550gp\n\t\t(7500 for\n\t\tpermanent greater magic fang, 1000 for permanency by that same caster or 450 for\n\t\tsomeone else to do it, plus 600 to actually cast greater magic fang at CL 20),\n\t\tonly a hair more than a +2 weapon.

Three levels gets you Dexterity to damage instead of Strength for one\n\t\tweapon.

An almost strictly combat character with medium Base Attack Bonus progression, d8 hit points, and no armor. Monks in Pathfinder still have the same features, but many of their most glaring issues have been heavily improved upon. Due to their unique abilities, it can be difficult to identify the monk&#8217;s role in the party. With their skill list, they can function as a scout, but their combat skills make them a passable defender or striker (See my article on Party Composition).
