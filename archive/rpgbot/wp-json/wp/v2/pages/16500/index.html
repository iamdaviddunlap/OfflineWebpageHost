At the release of 5th, this class pairing was the answer to <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/bladesinging\/\">Bladesinger<\/a> that you\u2019d bring if you wanted to be a Face (or if you wanted to be a gish character that does a bunch of damage <em>without<\/em> just resorting to being a wizard that happens to be holding a sword). Of course, then in Tasha\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/hexblade\/\">Hexblade<\/a> happened, the fire nation attacked, and we ended up with <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/hexadin\/\">this monstrosity<\/a>, likely the single most popular multiclass archetype in the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>But that build is always going to fall on the \u201cEldritch Knight\u201d side of the gish spectrum where you\u2019re definitely a spellsword, but the emphasis is on the sword. What if I instead wanted to be the best Paladin possible by being almost the minimum amount of Paladin possible? This, of course, requires that we codify what exactly we\u2019re measuring on here, so I\u2019m going to lean into a few things: Paladins should smite things often, be very durable, and protect their party members. Sure, you might say \u201cbut what about auras?\u201d To which I\u2019d say \u201cI\u2019m going to lay hands on you, is that sufficiently paladiny?\u201d Spoilers: it will not result in healing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Given that Hexadin is already the premier version of that end of the spectrum, this guide is going to focus on working a lot of sorcery into full plate and see where that lands us.

The advice offered in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a> still mostly applies, but there\u2019s some extra nuance beyond what that article can reasonably cover.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sorcerer\">Sorcerer<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This section is in addition to the advice on the Sorcerer\u2019s core features detailed in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/#bard\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>, and only covers a subset of subclasses which we believe are obviously relevant to the Sorcadin. Other subclasses may still be great here, but they don\u2019t need additional explanation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Clockwork Soul<\/strong>: The biggest draw of this subclass isn\u2019t even something written on it. Bastion of Law and Trance of Order are both pretty great, especially considering we\u2019re going to be spending quite a bit of our time attacking, but the real value is hidden in the description of the expanded spell list. Not the expanded spell list itself, but the fact that you can retrain them for any \u201cabjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.\u201d Coming in at 1st level as an abjuration spell on the Warlock list, we have the incredible and hard-to-access Armor of Agathys. Now you get it with almost a full caster progression\u2019s worth of scaling spell slots for the low cost of not knowing Alarm.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Draconic Soul<\/strong>: If you wanted to do an <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/oops-all-elves\/\">Elven Accuracy<\/a> version of this build, this is how I\u2019d do it. You\u2019ll be stuck putting a 13 you\u2019ll never use into Strength to multiclass out of Paladin, but you don\u2019t have to take it up to 15 to wear full plate without walking slowly or suffer from a low AC. Plus you get wings, and options like Branding Smite are a cheap way to add your impressive Charisma to damage and offer you the chance to get resistance to a valuable damage type.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"paladin\">Paladin<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This section is in addition to the advice on the Paladin\u2019s core features detailed in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/#paladin\">Practical Guide to Multiclassing<\/a>, and only covers a subset of subclasses which we believe are obviously relevant to the Sorcadin. Other subclasses may still be great here, but they don\u2019t need additional explanation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Oath of Vengeance<\/strong>: Vow of Enmity provides easy Advantage, but you only get it once per rest. This is what I would take on the Elven Accuracy version of the Sorcadin I mentioned above so that you don\u2019t have to worry about the source of Advantage. Just make sure you short rest after every fight like the Warlock you definitely aren\u2019t.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oath of Conquest<\/strong>: Not that I would, but this is the Paladin subclass I\u2019d take to 5 if I were going to go that high for the ASI and Extra Attack. Spiritual Weapon is so good they <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/one-dd-playtest-unearthed-arcana-the-cleric-and-revised-species\/#spiritual-weapon\">nerfed it<\/a> in the One D&amp;D UA, and this build has no other way to access it. Of course, since you\u2019re there, go to 7 and get the aura, then come back to Sorcerer to get the spell Fear much more often than a Paladin can ever cast it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oath of Redemption<\/strong>: What you\u2019ll see below. If all we\u2019re caring about is Paladin 3, we should look for something that gets us great Channel options and good 1st-level spells. This build absolutely loves both Channel options here. Getting to play an uno reverse card when something crits your friend is an incredible feeling, or you can just get an enormous bonus to social encounters if you\u2019re not fighting soon. Sanctuary is a Bonus Action, non-concentration way to protect something. Sleep is probably not helpful by the time we get it, but that\u2019s fine when everything else is so good.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"example-build-smiting-every-turn-like-clockwork\">Example Build \u2013 Smiting Every Turn Like Clockwork<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI can feel it in my soul: your imperfection must be cleansed from existence.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining Clockwork Soul and Oath of Redemption gets you something that feels like the enlightenment of the Eldritch Knight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>Base<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Increased<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Str<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dex<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Con<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Int<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wis<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cha<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"race\">Race<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Variant Human.

We now have a total of 6 spell slots: four 1st-level and two 2nd-level. At my continued insistence, I\u2019m going to say that there should be 3 fights per day in an average adventuring party despite the guidance about \u201cencounters\u201d in the DMG. We know from the game rules that there should be an average of 3 rounds per fight. That\u2019s a total of 9 rounds of fighting per day.<br><br>Right now, all we can use Sorcery Points for is getting extra 1st-level spell slots. With the bonus points for the day, we get four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level per day. That means we can use Divine Smite every single turn except the last one of the last fight in the day.&nbsp;The cost here is that we can\u2019t cast any spells right now if we use this strategy. On the other hand, if we were most martial classes, we couldn\u2019t do that anyway. We do also have the option to burn through slots faster, resulting in slightly lower DPR overall but enormous burst. Any 1st-level slot can still be a Thunderous Smite which, now that we\u2019re combining with Booming Blade, triggers more damage if they fail the save and want to hit you back.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6 \u2013 Sorcerer 3<\/td><td>Metamagic:<br>&#8211; Heightened Spell<br>&#8211; Quickened Spell<br><br>New Spells:<br>&#8211; Aid<br>&#8211; Lesser Restoration<br>&#8211; Misty Step<\/td><td>Heightened Spell will help us later on when we get to start using our spell slots for actual spells. This will be a big way we overcome our lower-than-optimized Charisma. Same with Quickened.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7 \u2013 Sorcerer 4<\/td><td>Feat: Polearm Master<br><br>New Cantrip: Sword Burst<\/td><td>We get several great things at this level. First off, we already have Warcaster and now we get Polearm Master, so we get to Booming Blade something if it makes the grave error of walking adjacent to us. The other part of PAM will come into play at next level.<br><br>We also get two 3rd-level spell slots. There are some great things to do with this (actually use Misty Step, upcast Absorb Elements, etc), but you can also just hold them for bigger Smites on crit. You can also upcast Armor of Agathys to cover for your HP which is starting to lag compared to single-class paladins. 15 temp HP that will also deal a minimum of 15 damage if something attacks you is nearly as good as swinging a weapon and Smiting with the same slot. If you get the damage to trigger twice, it\u2019s actually <em>more<\/em> damage from the action than if you\u2019d used a normal turn, and with a 1-hour duration you can easily cast Armor of Agathys ahead of time.<br><br>The other thing you can do is also melt those down into 1st-level slots. That would give you more opportunities to Silvery Barbs, Shield, or Absorb Elements.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8 \u2013 Sorcerer 5<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>\u2013 Haste<\/td><td>Alrighty. We now have access to 3rd-level spells. Because of multiclassing, we get three slots per day. That means the first action taken in every fight is casting Haste on yourself.<br><br>The reason Haste is so ludicrously good is that it will let us Booming Blade <em>and<\/em> get a regular weapon attack in the same round, thus triggering PAM and letting us attack again with our bonus action. This is how we fish for crits: just throw more attacks at it and see what lands.<br><br>We have the resources to take full advantage of this: with points combining into two 1st-level slots and the slots we won\u2019t be using on Haste, that\u2019s 9 slots per day we can use to power Smiting every turn.<br><br>DPR is now almost 25, despite being way behind on the fundamental math. This means that any external source of accuracy (flanking optional rule, someone else running Bless, etc) is going to result in a much more dramatic increase in DPR for us than it will for most characters.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9 \u2013 Sorcerer 6<\/td><td>Bastion of Law<br><br>New Spell:<br>&#8211; Fireball<\/td><td>Bastion of Law is an incredible tool in combination with the new 4th-level slot we can use to upcast Armor of Agathys. Put it on yourself and reduce incoming damage to a very low (but non-zero) number. Trigger retaliation damage. ????? Profit. It requires an Action to put on the bastion but lasts all day, so just do it with all your spare points when you wake up.<br><br>Remember that you can use points to Quicken Armor of Agathys. All you\u2019ll lose for the turn is the bonus action bonk from PAM.<br><br>Also, Fireball. It\u2019s definitely a bit late, but this is your answer to crowds. The damage is still really good, and we can upcast it since our spell slots are slightly ahead of our maximum spell level known.<br><br>DPR doesn\u2019t technically change, but that combo I just mentioned could be easily getting you another 20 damage per turn for one of your fights. Maybe even more than one if you run the first two of the day together like in a dungeon crawl.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 \u2013 Sorcerer 7<\/td><td>New Spell Known:<br>\u2013 Banishment<br>&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/summoning\/#summon-creature-spells\">Summon Construct<\/a><\/td><td>Another two levels since we last checked, which means we have another 1st-level spell slot available from fusing sorcery points.<br><br>Of course, you can also use three points to Empower a Banishment instead and force someone to roll with disadvantage on going into Time Out for the whole fight. Or you can quicken the Summon Construct you now have access to. <br><br>The scaling on the Summon spells is incredible, and the slow aura you\u2019ll get from choosing Stone will help you enormously as a Defender, but be aware that this will fight for Concentration with your Haste. If you want more Smite opportunities, go it alone.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11 \u2013 Sorcerer 8<\/td><td>Ability Score Increase: <br>Str 16 -&gt; 18<br><br>New Spell Known:<br>\u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/spells\/polymorph\/\">Polymorph<\/a><\/td><td>This is a great level for us. Not only does the effectiveness of Booming Blade increase, but we get +1 to hit and damage, almost getting us back on Fundamental Math track.DPR is up to 32 just with the attacks. A quickened Summon on the first turn will bring that up to 41 for that fight if your table allows flanking and you just summon the golem on the other side of your target and flank with each other.<br><br>Since we count as 9th level for slots, we can do that on the first two fights in a day, and use the 5th-level slot we have for upcasting Armor of Agathys. That\u2019s a staggering 25 temp HP and 25 damage every time it triggers. This is as high as most things would ever be able to take it.
