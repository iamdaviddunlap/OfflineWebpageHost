As such, half of the Clockwork\u2019s features influence the machinery of the universe (d20s) in somewhat novel ways. The other half of the features instead rewind the clock on creatures, objects, and effects, restoring them to a previous state.

Not everything on the list is a gem,\n\t\t\tof course, and be sure to check my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/spells\">Cleric Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\t\t(for the cleric spells which you get by default) and my\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/spells\">Warlock Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/spells\">Wizard Spell List Breakdown<\/a>\n\t\t\tfor details on the spells borrowed from the Wizard&#8217;s spell list as well as\n\t\t\tpossible retraining options.\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Slightly less obvious: this adds a total of 10 known leveled spells to\n\t\t\tyour sorcerer. A 20th-level sorcerer typically knows just 15 spells, so\n\t\t\tthis is a massive increase. Even at level 1, you know twice as many spells\n\t\t\tas a typical sorcerer.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Third, and easiest to overlook, is the retraining mechanic. The Sorcerer\n\t\t\tcan already retrain one known spell every time they gain a level, but\n\t\t\tClockwork Magic also allows you to retrain the spells granted by the\n\t\t\tfeature. Surprisingly, you can choose from the sorcerer, warlock, and\n\t\t\twizard spell lists, though you&#8217;re limited to abjuration and transmutation\n\t\t\tspells. Of course, there are plenty of excellent abjuration and\n\t\t\ttransmutation options (Absorb Elements and Shield are good at any level),\n\t\t\tso that&#8217;s not a problem. Trade in spells that you&#8217;re not benefiting from\n\t\t\tas you gain levels, especially since abjuration options are often useful\n\t\t\tlong after their spell level stops being defining in combat.<\/p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">1st Level<\/span>: Protection from Evil and\n\t\t\t\tGood is a staple buff at any level, covering a wide range of dangerous\n\t\t\t\tcreatures. Alarm isn&#8217;t useful enough to justify on a sorcerer, so\n\t\t\t\tretrain it.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">3rd Level<\/span>: Two staple cleric\n\t\t\t\toptions.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">5th Level<\/span>: A staple utility option and\n\t\t\t\tan important defensive buff. Not glamorous or flashy, but hard to go\n\t\t\t\twithout.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"><span class=\"rating-green\">7th Level<\/span>: Freedom of Movement is\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but helpful against enemies which like to grapple.\n\t\t\t\tSummon Construct is a wizard exclusive, and it&#8217;s a decent summon option\n\t\t\t\tif you need a pet Defender.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">9th Level<\/span>: Greater Restoration isn&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tas important as Lesser Restoration, but it&#8217;s still very important. The\n\t\t\t\tconditions which it fixes are miserable and in many cases borderline\n\t\t\t\tlethal. Wall of Force (another wizard exclusive) is one of the best area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol effects around, especially if you have another spellcaster in\n\t\t\t\tthe party who can drop some ongoing area damage before you put your\n\t\t\t\tenemies inside the impenetrable hemisphere.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"1\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Restore Balance<\/span>: This solves a lot of\n\t\tproblems. Creatures which have Advantage on saves against specific\n\t\tconditions are common, and for a sorcerer encountering those resistances can\n\t\thandicap you a great deal due to your limited pool of spells knowns.\n\t\tSimilarly, if your allies have Disadvantage on a save (such as because they\n\t\tare Restrained or Poisoned), you can help protect them. The usage pool is\n\t\tlimited, so save this for when it really matters.<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Bastion of Law<\/span>: This is similar in many\n\t\tways to temporary hit points (though you can notably apply this on top of\n\t\ttemporary hit points). The duration is great, and allowing the target to\n\t\tchoose when to use the ward allows you to take a little damage when you know\n\t\tthat there&#8217;s a Short Rest coming so you can spend some hit dice to manage\n\t\tyour limited resources.\n\t\t<p>Compare this to casting False Life. False Life is a 1st-level spell, so\n\t\t\tyou can spend two Sorcery Points to get a spell slot with which to cast\n\t\t\tFalse Life. False Life lasts for one hour, and grants 1d4+4 (average 6.5)\n\t\t\ttemporary hit points. Each additional spell level adds 5 more hit points.\n\t\t\tFor those same two Sorcery points, you can give a creature a ward with two\n\t\t\tdice, which will prevent an average of 9 damage and lasts until you take a\n\t\t\tLong Rest. Each additional Sorcery Points adds 4.5 more damage protection,\n\t\t\tcompared to one or two Sorcery Points for 5 more temporary hit points from\n\t\t\tFalse Life. So Bastion of law is cheaper compared to a 1st-level spell\n\t\t\tslot, and the scaling cost of converting Sorcery Points into spell slots\n\t\t\tkeeps this more efficient.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Trance of Order<\/span>: The\n\t\t<a href=\"\/dnd5\/characters\/fundamental_math\">Fundamental Math<\/a> of DnD 5e\n\t\tassumes that players will succeed on attack rolls against a typical\n\t\tCR-appropriate AC if they roll an 8 or better (provided that your primary\n\t\tability scores hits 16, 18, and 20 at levels 1, 4, and 8), giving players a\n\t\t65% chance of hitting an attack against an average, CR-appropriate enemy.\n\t\tGiving you a minimum guaranteed roll of 10 on attacks, saves, and ability\n\t\tchecks means that you&#8217;re mostly guaranteed to hit with attacks, pass on any\n\t\tsaves in which you&#8217;re proficient and have a decent ability score, and pass\n\t\tany ability checks with skills in which you&#8217;re well-suited. With a 1-minute\n\t\tduration, this is enough to get through one combat or to perform\n\t\tseries of skill checks if you move quickly.\n\t\t<p>This is a great ability on almost any other class, but on the Sorcerer\n\t\t\tits usefulness is extremely limited. Spells which require attack rolls\n\t\t\t(with the exception of cantrips) mostly vanished around 2nd-level spells\n\t\t\tunless you&#8217;re upcasting low-level spells. Sorcerers are proficient with\n\t\t\tConstitution saves so this helps with Concentration, so this helps a lot\n\t\t\twith that. Since sorcerers are Charisma-based, most of your skills will be\n\t\t\ttoo and using Persuasion in combat doesn&#8217;t work particularly well. So the\n\t\t\tthree best uses for this are cantrips, upcasting low-level spells like\n\t\t\tScorching Ray, and Concentration. That&#8217;s underwhelming for an ability\n\t\t\twhich costs 5 Sorcery Points to recharge.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"18\"><span class=\"rating-orange\">Clockwork Cavalcade<\/span>: Even with three\n\t\teffects, this is still only situationally useful. The 100 points of healing\n\t\twill be the most consistently useful option for adventurers, allowing you to\n\t\tget allies back on their feet and restore a nice chunk of hit points. But at\n\t\tthis level, healing options like Mass Cure Wounds and Heal have been around\n\t\tfor a while.\n<p>The repair effect is neat, but only rarely useful.\nThis could be used to solve some puzzles though: Picture the \n<a href=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/23\/Rosetta_Stone.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rosetta Stone<\/a>, now picture the Rosetta Stone after a Clockwork Soul snaps their fingers and all the broken pieces that have been missing for millennia just reappear in place with complete text and all the wear and tear of time is undone.<\/p>\n\t\t<p>Perhaps the\n\t\tmost remarkable effect is the last one, which outright ends spell effects\n\t\twithout the ability checks required by Dispel Magic. But even then, it&#8217;s\n\t\trare that you&#8217;ll face more than a small handful of enemies with magic effects\n\t\ton them, so in most cases you can just upcast Dispel Magic to 6th level to\n\t\tget the same effect if you don&#8217;t want to risk making the ability checks.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"clockwork-soul-ability-scores\">Clockwork Soul Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Not substantially different from the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/#ability-scores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sorcerer Handbook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Not important for Single-Classed Sorcery.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Get some AC cause we don\u2019t have Armor.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Get some HP cause we need it.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Int<\/span>: Maybe for skills if you have extra points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Wis<\/span>: Maybe for skills and saves if you have extra points.

From Clockwork we\u2019re granted Alarm and Protection from Evil and Good. Alarm isn\u2019t super useful without the ability to cast it as a ritual, so it will get traded out next level, but Protection from Evil and Good will serve well for a while when fighting the specific targets which it affects.<br><br>For skills, we\u2019ve got a few social options and Arcana so that we can pull Face duty while also having the ability to scribe scrolls.<br><br>We\u2019re also taking a large number of Tool proficiencies so that we can be a literal clockmaker as a Clockwork Soul.<br><br>As a Mountain Dwarf, we also have Medium Armor proficiency.
