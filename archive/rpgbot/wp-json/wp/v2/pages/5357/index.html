The social persona is just some\n\tnormal guy, but when things get crazy he loses control and breaks stuff.\n\tHowever, the archetype has huge mechanical holes. You need Strength to back up\n\tall of your unarmed strikes (unless you do some crafty build stuff like Weapon\n\tFinesse and the Lethal Grace Vigilante Talent, which seems super weird for The\n\tHulk), and 1d8 hit points is nowhere near enough to keep a character like this\n\talive, especially since your armor doesn&#8217;t work while you&#8217;re transformed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the Brute is not completely unsalvageable. Keep your Dexterity\n\thigh, and pick up Weapon Finesse and the Lethal Grace Vigilante Talent. Pick\n\tup Heavy Punches (see below), the Vital Punishment Vigilante Talent, and the\n\tVital Strike feat chain. That gives you ridiculous damage on a single attack\n\tper round, it will scale exponentially. For defense, pick up Sizing Equipment\n\t(see below), a shield, and possibly the Unkillable Vigilante Talent. Then run\n\taround all weird and skinny and call yourself The Husk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-none\">Chaotic Vigilante<\/span> (Ex): Not a notable issue,\n\tand it certainly won&#8217;t affect the effectiveness of your build.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Brutish Fortitude<\/span> (Ex): Reverses the\n\tVigilante&#8217;s saves, going from two good saves to one good save.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Losing medium\n\tarmor means that you&#8217;ll need more Dexterity, and switching to unarmed strikes\n\tpresents its own set of problems. Fortunately, Heavy Punches will give you a\n\tbunch of extra damage. Be sure to get your hands magically enhanced (see my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/monk\/#permanent-spells\"\n\t\t>Monk Handbook&#8217;s<\/a\n\t>\n\tsection on permanent spells).<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Brute Talents<\/span>: Several of the talents are\n\tvery good, but they&#8217;re also completely essential to the function of the\n\tarchetype. Without Sizing Equipment, the Brute will die almost immediately.\n\tWithout Heavy Punches, the Brute&#8217;s damage will be pitiful.<\/p\n>\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Awesome Blow<\/span> (Ex): You&#8217;re actually giving\n\t\tup damage to move enemies out of your reach.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Heavy Punches<\/span> (Ex): I really wish that you\n\t\tcould combine this with Fist of the Avenger, but on it&#8217;s own it&#8217;s still a\n\t\tsolid damage boost.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Scale Surroundings<\/span> (Ex): Potions of SPider\n\t\tClimb are 50 gp.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Sizing Equipment<\/span> (Ex): AC is a serious\n\t\tproblem for the Brute, so magically resizing your armor is absolutely\n\t\tcrucial.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Total Destruction<\/span> (Ex): The initial damage\n\t\tis nothing special unless you can throw an enemy at another enemym but the\n\t\t16th-level improvement lets you drop small fireballs every round so long as\n\t\tyou can find a sufficiently large object.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Tear Them Apart<\/span> (Ex): A solid improvement\n\tto your damage output provided that you can hit reliably.

It may be difficult to get both.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: dual identity (altered), saving throws, armor and weapon\n\tproficiencies, vigilante specialization, vigilante talents (altered),\n\tvengeance strike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"cabalist\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-red\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/vigilante\/archetypes\/vigilante-archetypes---paizo-inc\/cabalist\"\n\t\t>Cabalist<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cabalist is a really cool flavor with a poor implementation. Casting\n\tspells as a Magus with the Witch spell list is great, but adds an extra\n\tability dependency to a class which is already fairly MAD (Magi use\n\tIntelligence for spellcasting).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Class Skills<\/span>: Losing 2 skill ranks per\n\tlevel is really hard when your skill list is so long. You also lose some\n\tRogue-like skills to gain some spellcasting-related skills. You need\n\tIntelligence for the Cabalists spells, which helps a bit.<\/p\n>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: <\/p>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Witch spell list\n\tincludes a lot of really great options, especially utility options not\n\tnormally available to 2\/3 casters like the Magus.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Spill Blood<\/span> (Ex): Similar to the Rogue&#8217;s\n\tBleeding Attack. Bleed damage isn&#8217;t a fantastic way to kill things, but it\n\talso fuels many of the Cabalist&#8217;s abilities.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Cabalist Talents<\/span>: A few additional talent\n\toptions, a couple of which are worthwhile. It&#8217;s also frustrating that they\n\tadded extra talent options and removed half of the Vigilante&#8217;s chances to take\n\tthem.<\/p\n>\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Bond of Blood<\/span> (Sp, Su): Once per hour is\n\t\tvery infrequently consider how few temporary hit points you get.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Familiar<\/span> (Ex): Familiars are great\n\t\toptions for highly skilled characters, but the utility is somewhat\n\t\tdiminished sinc ethe Cabalist gives up so many skill ranks.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Living Shadow<\/span> (Sp): Since you can&#8217;t cast\n\t\tspells in the shadow form and the Shadow Body doesn&#8217;t allow you to attack,\n\t\tthis is basically a fancy way to hide.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Necromantic Focus<\/span> (Ex): Some very solid\n\t\tadditions to the Cabalist&#8217;s spell list, but save-or-suck spells arne&#8217;t a\n\t\tgreat option for 2\/3 casters.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Shadow Jump<\/span> (Su): Situational, and the\n\t\tlimited total distance makes it difficult to use.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tattoo Chamber<\/span> (Su): A great way to sneak\n\t\tweapons, wands, etc. into a social setting. The ability to use\n\t\tspell-triggers items means that you can use wands without drawing them,\n\t\twhich is pretty helpful.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Bloodbound Spell<\/span> (Ex): The bonuses are really\n\tsmall.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Bloody Horror<\/span> (Ex): Frightening Presence\n\tis strictly better and requires considerably less setup.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shadowy Appearance<\/span> (Sp): A 20% miss chance\n\tis a considerable defensive buff, plus it allows you to hide anywhere and\n\tmakes you immune to Sneak Attack. The invisibility ability is great, but has a\n\tvery short duration and only works once per day.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Class Skills, skill ranks per level, armor and weapon\n\tproficiencies, vigilante talents (altered), 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and\n\t16th-level vigilante talents, startling appearance, frightening appearance,\n\tstunning appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"gunmaster\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/vigilante\/archetypes\/vigilante-archetypes---paizo-inc\/gunmaster\"\n\t\t>Gunmaster<\/a\n\t>\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gunmaster trades some of the Vigilante&#8217;s less useful abilities for access\n\tto Firearms and a couple of abilities from the Gunslinger. Altoghether, it&#8217;s a\n\tvery solid choice for a ranged Vigilante, though you lose access to Vigilante\n\tSpecialization and all of the talents which require you to be either an\n\tAvenger or a Stalker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Firearms are\n\tvery powerful, and you&#8217;ll want to be in light armor anyway.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Gunmaster<\/span>: The Gunmaster is perhaps the only\n\tfirearm-centric archetype\/class which doesn&#8217;t force the character to\n\tpidgeon-hole themselves into a single firearm. Grab a bunch and use whatever\n\tfits the situation, and you still get the scaling bonus to attacks and\n\tdamage.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Gunmaster Talents<\/span>: Several poor options.\n\tNothing that you really need to have.<\/p\n>\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Deadeye<\/span> (Ex): It&#8217;s pretty rare for\n\t\tfights in Pathfinder to take place at extremely long range, and a musket\n\t\tdoes just fine in every other case.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Death&#8217;s Shot<\/span> (Ex): Certainly not\n\t\treliable, especially since firearms have a tiny threat range.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Gunmaster Initiative <\/span> (Ex): Very helpful\n\t\tso that you can get a shot off during the surprise round.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Lightning Reload<\/span> (Ex): Justy get the Rapid\n\t\tReload feat and use alchemical cartridges. They&#8217;re much better and doesn&#8217;t\n\t\thave a limited number of uses per day.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Quick Clear<\/span> (Ex): Just grab another\n\t\tgun.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ul>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Nimble<\/span> (Ex): A small, but helpful bonus to\n\tAC. The scaling is nice, too.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: armor and weapon proficiencies, vigilante specialization,\n\tvigilante talents (altered), unshakable<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"magical-child\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-green\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/vigilante\/archetypes\/vigilante-archetypes---paizo-inc\/magical-child\"\n\t\t>Magical Child<\/a\n\t><\/h3\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The Magical Child adds spellcasting to the Vigilante in much the same way\n\tthat the Cabalist does, but without the MAD issues. The Magical Child also\n\tgains a potent familiar which offers a lot of very interesting options.\n\tHowever, the archetype lacks directly offensive options common to most\n\tVigilantes, so you need to rely on summons, attrition, and clever tactics to\n\tdefeat your foes rather than outright killing them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Losing 2 skill ranks per level\n\tis really hard when your skill list is so long. You also lose some Rogue-like\n\tskills to gain some spellcasting-related skills.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Light armor\n\tis fine. You&#8217;ll likely want to pick up a mithral buckler to boost your AC a\n\tbit, too.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Unchained Summoner&#8217;s spell\n\tlist includes a lot of great support and area control options which are really\n\thelpful without relying on a high spell DC. The spellcasting is spontaneous so\n\tyou don&#8217;t need to carry around a potentially incriminating spellbook, and\n\tsince it&#8217;s Charisma-based you don&#8217;t have the MAD issues presented by the\n\tCabalist.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Transformation Sequence<\/span> (Su): SHAZAM! The\n\timproved time for transformation is nice, but the added flair also makes it\n\thard to conceal your dual identities.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Animal Guide<\/span> (Ex): Familiars are excellent,\n\tand can do quite a bit. The biggest and most exciting part of this ability is\n\tthat the familiar improves its form as you gain levels and eventually gains\n\tthe ability to switch back to old forms. Be sure to read my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/familiars\">Practical Guide to Familiars<\/a>\n\tfor help selecting your familiar forms.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Staunch Ally<\/span> (Ex): You don&#8217;t so much give\n\tup the &#8220;Appearance&#8221; abilities as grant them to your familiar. This is fine,\n\tsince your familiar is typically either right next to you or off somewhere\n\tbeing more mobile than you are.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: Class Skills, skill ranks per level, armor and weapon\n\tproficiencies, 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents,\n\tvigilante specialization, startling appearance, frightening appearance,\n\tstunning appearance, and vengeance strike<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"mounted-fury\"\n\t><a\n\t\tclass=\"rating-orange\"\n\t\thref=\"\/\/www.d20pfsrd.com\/classes\/base-classes\/vigilante\/archetypes\/vigilante-archetypes---paizo-inc\/mounted-fury\"\n\t\t>Mounted Fury<\/a\n\t><\/h3\n>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mounted Fury gets a rideable Animal Companion and opens up the option of\n\tmounted builds to the Vigilante. This is mechanically fine, but a nightmare to\n\troleplay. How do you explain being the only one dragging a horse everywhere,\n\tthen having your vigilante identity suddenly appear with a horse? The issues\n\tget worse with less-common mounts like a wolf or a boar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Handle Animal is a bad skill,\n\tand UMD is hard to give up when you&#8217;re already a Charisma-dependent class.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Thorough Change<\/span>: So you&#8217;re disallowed from\n\ttaking two mediocre tallents. Not a problem.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Mount<\/span> (Ex): The mount options are very\n\tlimited, especially if it&#8217;s hard to explain why you&#8217;re riding a wolf or a\n\tboar. Still, an animal companion is a powerful tool. Be sure to read my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/animal_companions\"\n\t\t>Practical Guide to Animal Companions<\/a\n\t>.

A Vigilante could start with 14 or 16\n\tDexterity, and not put a single ability score increase into it and get by just\n\tfine. This allows you Vigilante to put resources into Intelligence to improve\n\ttheir spellcasting capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Class Skills<\/span>: Losing 2 skill ranks per level\n\tis really hard when your skill list is so long. You also lose some Rogue-like\n\tskills to gain some spellcasting-related skills.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon and Armor Proficiency<\/span>: Light armor\n\tis fine. You&#8217;ll likely want to pick up a mithral buckler to boost your AC a\n\tbit, too.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Spellcasting<\/span>: The Sorcerer\/Wizard spell\n\tlist is arguably the best in the game, and even as a 2\/3 caster access to that\n\tspell list is fantastic.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Mystic Bolts<\/span> (Su): The wording is a bit\n\tconfusing, but Mystic Bolts are normal attacks by default (&#8220;touching her foe&#8221;\n\thas no rules effect). The wording of the damage bonus is also abnormal;\n\ttypically &#8220;plus&#8221; referring to a numeric bonus is listed as &#8220;+X&#8221;, not &#8220;plus X&#8221;.\n\tStill, I believe the intent is +1 damage per four levels, not +1d6. The\n\tability to use the bolts with TWF is great, and I don&#8217;t see any reason why\n\tRapid Shot and Deadly Aim wouldn&#8217;t work. You get to choose the energy types\n\tyou can use, but gain new types over a long period. I recommend Acid,\n\tElectricity, Fire, then Cold. Mystic Bolts is intended to replace the use of\n\tweapons, so learn to love it.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Piercing Bolts<\/span> (Ex): Unless you&#8217;re using TWF\n\t(and you probably should), the &#8220;one bolt per round&#8221; will cover all of your\n\tbolts. Once you hit level 5 there&#8217;s no excuse to not use TWF, even if you\n\tdon&#8217;t have the feat. Touch AC generally doesn&#8217;t scale with CR, so as you gain\n\tlevels you will almost always be trying to hit a touch AC in the range of\n\t10-12.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Warlock Talents<\/span>: Several fantastic options.\n\tYou really need to be careful about which talents you take since Warlocks get\n\tso few.<\/p\n>\n<ul>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Arcane Striker<\/span> (Su): Since Mystic Bolts\n\t\ttreats you as using &#8220;light one-handed weapons&#8221;, I don&#8217;t see a reason why\n\t\tArcane Striker wouldn&#8217;t work with your bolts. Arcane Strike isn&#8217;t great, but\n\t\tit&#8217;s a little bit of on-hit damage on top of your ability to spam Mystic\n\t\tBolts with TWF and Rapid Shot. The added magical abilities add even more\n\t\tdamage to your magical machine gun.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Armor<\/span> (Su): The higher level\n\t\tbonuses get gradually better, but I wouldn&#8217;t rush to get this at a low\n\t\tlevel.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Familiar<\/span> (Ex): Familiars are great\n\t\toptions for highly skilled characters, but the utility is somewhat\n\t\tdiminished sinc ethe Cabalist gives up so many skill ranks.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Social Simulacrum<\/span> (Sp): Every other\n\t\tVigilante has to figure out this problem on their own.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Tattoo Chamber<\/span> (Su): A great way to sneak\n\t\tweapons, wands, etc. into a social setting.

As a GM I would\n\timpose -20 and consider that exceptionally generous.<\/p\n>\n\n\n\n<p>Replaced Features: vigilante specialization (altered), 2nd, 6th, 12th, and\n\t18th-level Vigilante Talents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Archetypes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"arachnid\" class=\"rating-red\">Arachnid<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Falconine starts of really rough with a garbage talent and a situational\n\tbonus to Perception, but past level 10 it really hits its stride when you gain\n\tflight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Soft Landing<\/span> (Ex): The fact that you still\n\tneed to be within arms reach of a wall to get the full effect is insulting.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Eagle Eye<\/span> (Ex): Situational, but\n\tPerception is still the most-rolled skill in the game, and the majority of\n\tthose cheks are visual.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Take to the Air<\/span> (Ex): Permanent flight while\n\tin Vigilante persona. It&#8217;s unclear how this interacts with the wing-flaps\n\tunder your arms, but I think we can just assume that you&#8217;ll never need those\n\tnow so they&#8217;ll just be politely forgotten.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deadly Dive<\/span> (Ex): This is impressively\n\tlethal, but you&#8217;ll need a speed boost of some kind to reach the full 20d6\n\tdamage. You can&#8217;t combine this with charge abilities, Vital Strike, or\n\tanything else interesting, so be sure to pick up the biggest total damage you\n\tcan manage on a single attack. Also note that this provokes two attacks of\n\topportunity: one for the movement and one for the attack. You can potentially\n\tremove both by using a reach weapon, so grab a Glaive. You&#8217;ll still need to\n\tdeal with enemies with long reach, so consider Enlarge Person to improve your\n\town reach or Mobility if you&#8217;re going to come to terms with drawing an\n\toccasional opportunity attack..<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t>Natural weapons are hard to make viable for a PC, and Ursine doesn&#8217;t provide\n\tenough to fix that.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t>Much like the Cabalist, the Zealot makes the Vigilante a 2\/3 spellcaster. And\n\tagain like the Cabalist, it makes the Vigilante very MAD. Wisdo mis the\n\tVigilante&#8217;s only viable dump stat, which makes the Zealot especially\n\tproblematic.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t>Replaced Features: Class Skills, skill ranks per level, weapon proficiencies,\n\t4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents, vigilante\n\tspecialization<\/p\n>\n<p>Compatible Archetypes: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly a play on spider man, Arachnid is a train wreck. Shoot Webs is the\n\tonly worthwhile ability, and its limited usage per day means that you can&#8217;t\n\trely on it consistently. The other abilities fit the objective of the\n\tarchetype, but by the time you get them they&#8217;re completely obsolete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heightened Senses<\/span> (Ex): Stalker Sense is a\n\tsolid ability and gets some nice improvements as you gain levels. It won&#8217;t\n\tmake you very threatening at low levels, but it might keep you alive.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Shoot Webs<\/span> (Ex): Tanglefoot bags are a great\n\titem, but stop being helpful when their DC 15 reflex save stops working\n\treliably. Entangling enemies, especially flying enemies, is a massive tactical\n\tadvantage. However, note that tanglefoot bags require an attack to use\n\t(possibly as part of a full attack) while this requires a Standard Action to\n\tuse since it&#8217;s a special ability.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Web Specialist<\/span> (Ex): Wasting a uise of Shoot\n\tWebs on a climb speed is pretty sad considering a potion of Spider Climb costs\n\t50 gold. Of course, being a Spider Man-derivce character without the ability\n\tto climb walls without a potion is pretty sad, too. The ability to create a\n\ttemporary rope is very situational, but obviously fits the theme. This is made\n\teven worse by the fact that at this level all of your allies are flying.<\/p\n>\n<p\n\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Web Master<\/span> (Ex): Finally your 18th-level\n\tvigilante can do what Spider Man figured out how to do in his first few days\n\tof being a super hero! The mechanics of rope swinging are left completely\n\tunexplained, so have a good discussion with your DM about how exactly this\n\twould work.<\/p\n>\n\n<p\n\t>Falconine starts of really rough with a garbage talent and a situational\n\tbonus to Perception, but past level 10 it really hits its stride when you gain\n\tflight.<\/p\n>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Vigilante archetypes attempt to open up other superhero concepts, and many of them have a lot of cool flavor.

The social persona is just some normal guy, but when things get crazy he loses control and breaks stuff. However, the archetype has huge mechanical holes.
