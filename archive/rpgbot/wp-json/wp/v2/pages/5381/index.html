Be very cautious about using metamagic with spells which require a saving throw to function. It is frequently easier to use spells which don&#8217;t require saving throws, but might depend on an attack roll. Attack rolls aren&#8217;t affected by metamagic, so spells like Shocking Grasp, Scorching Ray, and Polar Ray are all great options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#metamagic\">Metamagic Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#rods\">Rods<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Also note that many colored items are also links to the Paizo SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational. Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances. Useful sometimes.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Green<\/span>: Good options. Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"metamagic\">Metamagic Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Bouncing Spell<\/span>: For one spell level, you\n\teffectively get to retry a spell on someone else if your first attempt failed.\n\tYour spells shouldn&#8217;t be failing often, but sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have some\n\tinsurance. Not as powerful or precise as Persistent spell, but half the\n\tcost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Burning Spell<\/span>: A cool concept, but the math\n\tdoesn&#8217;t justify the feat. Compare a 7th-level fire spell like Delayed Blast\n\tFireball and a 9th-level spell like Meteor Swarm (the only choice), both cast\n\tby the same 20th-level Wizard. Delayed Blast Fireball will deal 20d6+14 (avg.\n\t84 damage) compared to Meteor Swarms flat 24d6 fire + 8d6 bludgeoning damage\n\t(avg. 84+28). The only advantages offered by Delayed Blast Fireball are the\n\ttimer and the AOE.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Concussive Spell<\/span>: The penalties roughly match\n\tthe Shaken and Nauseated conditions, and the duration last for several rounds,\n\tbut 2 spell levels for this effect is simply too expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Dazing Spell<\/span>: Tempting, but difficult to\n\tuse. The 3 level cost ensures that the spell DC will lag behind your best\n\tspells, dramatically improving the likelihood that enemies will pass the DC\n\tfor the Daze effect. Potentially useful for Spell Perfection abusers like the\n\tMagus, but most casters can skip this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Disruptive Spell<\/span>: If you are trying to\n\tprevent another spellcaster from casting a spell, just kill them instead.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Echoing Spell<\/span>: Considerably worse than the\n\tSplit Slot Arcane Discover, but potentially useful for non-Wizards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ectoplasmic Spell<\/span>: Too situational. Go learn\n\tsome force spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Elemental Spell<\/span>: Essential for blasters.\n\tEnergy resistance is common and often problematic, and changing energy types\n\tof your favorite blast spells can keep them useful against any foe.\n\tUnfortunately you can&#8217;t switch to Sonic damage.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Empower Spell<\/span>: Nice for blasts with a\n\tlimited number of spells known (looking at you, Sorcerers), Empower Spell has\n\ta surprisingly good damage payoff. At many levels, you may find that an\n\tEmpowered spell does as much or more damage than spells of the spell&#8217;s new\n\tlevel due to caster level limitations. Consider Fireball and a Cone of Cold,\n\tboth cast by a 10th-level Sorcerer. The Fireball deals 10d6*1.5 damage (avg.\n\t52.5), while the Cone of Cold only deals 10d6. 10d6*1.5 is effectively the\n\tsame as 15d6, which means that Cone of Cold will meet but never exceed\n\tFireball. Empowered Cone of Cold has a similar relationship with Delayed Blast\n\tFireball; 15d6*1.5 is effectively 22.5d6, which is more than delayed blast\n\tfireball can do. Empowered Delayed Blast Fireball does as much damage as\n\tMeteor Swarm&#8217;s best-case scenario, and has a better AOE and doesn&#8217;t require\n\tattack rolls. Empower Spell&#8217;s only real problem is that it lowers the spell&#8217;s\n\tDC, making it more likely that enemies will succeed on their saves and end up\n\ttaking less damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Enlarge Spell<\/span>: Often confused with Widen\n\tSpell, Enlarge Spell improves the spell&#8217;s range. Instead of wasting a feat,\n\tFly closer to your enemies. If you absolutely need to increase the range of a\n\tspell, Reach Spell is more effective and considerably more versatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extend Spell<\/span>: Extend your buff spells and\n\tarea control spells. At high levels you can abuse hours\/level duration spells\n\tby casting them the evening before, and letting them last through the next\n\tday.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Flaring Spell<\/span>: Dazzled is a garbage status\n\teffect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Focuses Spell<\/span>: Spell Focus is considerably\n\tbetter.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Heighten Spell<\/span>: Potentially useful for\n\tSorcerers who need to stretch their limited set of spells known, but not very\n\tflashy.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Intensified Spell<\/span>: This took 4 spell levels\n\tin 3.5, but Paizo had the good sense to lower it to one. The extra damage dice\n\twon&#8217;t matter until you are high enough level to start maxing out spells&#8217;\n\tvariable numeric effects, but this can stretch the effectiveness of spells\n\tlike Fireball well into high level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Lingering Spell<\/span>: Turn your blast spells\n\tinto a short-lived area control effect. Potentially useful for blasters, but\n\tsituational.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Maximize Spell<\/span>: Not nearly so easy to use\n\tas Empower Spell, but the math is very similar. Let&#8217;s compare a Maximized\n\tFireball to Delayed Blast Fireball. At 13th-level, the minimum to cast Delayed\n\tBlast Fireball, Maximized Fireball deals a flat 60 damage, while Delayed Blast\n\tFireball deals 13d6 (avg. 45.5). As the caster grows in level, that Delayed\n\tBlast Fireball will cap out at 20d6 (avg. 70), just barely above Fireball.\n\tThis is certainly very tempting, but lowering your DC by 4 is going to give\n\tyour enemies a huge chance to pass the save.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Merciful Spell<\/span>: You are not a pacifist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Persistent Spell<\/span>: Make people reroll\n\tagainst your insanely high spell DCs. Better than Bouncing Spell, but at twice\n\tthe cost.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Piercing Spell<\/span>: Just take Spell\n\tPenetration.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quicken Spell<\/span>: At high levels, Quicken Spell\n\tis king. The +4 spell level hurts, but it gets you a second spell per turn. Be\n\tsure to use spells which don&#8217;t allow saving throws like ray spells and\n\tbuffs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reach Spell<\/span>: This is a great option for\n\tspells with range problems like Shocking Grasp, and can dramatically improve\n\ttheir usefulness for spellcasters who can&#8217;t risk going into melee. Compare an\n\tIntensified Reach Shocking Grasp to Fireball (both 3rd-level spells). Each\n\tdoes up to 10d6 damage, but Shocking Grasp doesn&#8217;t allow a saving throw, and\n\tFireball is an AOE. Each is great for a different situation, and versatility\n\tis one of the big draws of Metamagic. And that&#8217;s only the offensive\n\tapplication. Consider how many important buff spells are touch range:\n\tprotection from energy, protection from evil, cure spells, heal, sanctuary.\n\tAll touch range. Imagine standing in the middle of a big room and hitting your\n\tentire party with Communal Protection From Evil without needing to walk over\n\tto them. Breath of Life benefits even more because its full-round casting time\n\ttypically means that you need to find some way to reach your fallen ally\n\twithout using your move action.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Rime Spell<\/span>: Entangling creatures can\n\tgreatly impede them if they rely on movement, but if you really need to\n\tentangle things you can use a net or a tanglefoot bag.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Selective Spell<\/span>: Potentially useful if you\n\thave a bad habit of dropping spells on top of your allies, but many blast\n\tspells more powerful than Fireball have the ability to shape or place the AOE\n\tso that they won&#8217;t hit your allies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Sickening Spell<\/span>: 2 spell levels isn&#8217;t enough\n\tto justify Sickened.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Silent Spell<\/span>: Situationally useful. Just\n\tget a rod.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Still Spell<\/span>: Situationally useful. Using\n\tStill Spell on a teleportation spell is a great way to get out of a grapple,\n\tbut that&#8217;s a pretty rare case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Toppling Spell<\/span>: If you like force spells\n\tlike Magic Missile or X Hand, this can be a nice trick. Magic missile allows\n\tyou to make up to five trip attempts as a second level spell, which can do a\n\tlot of good things for your melee allies.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Thundering Spell<\/span>: Deafened is absolutely not\n\tworth two spell levels.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Widen Spell<\/span>: Awful. Truly awful. You might be\n\ttempted by the prospect of fireballs with huge areas, but higher levels spells\n\twill generally have sufficiently large areas that Widen Spell isn&#8217;t\n\thelpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rods\">Rods<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Metamagic rods are easily overlooked, but are among the most important items in the game for prepared spellcasters. Where spontaneous casters can use metamagic on a whim, prepared casters must plan to use metamagic well ahead of time. With fewer spells per day to use, prepared spellcasters are often loath to give up high level spell slots when using metamagic, making rods the obvious solution.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Metamagic feats are a complex and interesting subject.
