Keep in mind that Spirited Charge and the lance damage\n\t\t\t\tmultiplier only apply to your first attack on a charge. Even so, this\n\t\t\t\tfeat is incredible.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Unseat<\/span>: This is ridiculously\n\t\t\t\tsituational.

If you do already have natural weapons, you may still find this archetype to be extremely mediocre and disappointing. But if you&#8217;re as much of a fan of Vital Strike as I am, this archetype is surprisingly amazing find.

Without this feat, this archetype basically won&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tfunction unless you already have natural weapons.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Improved Natural Weapon<\/span>: Bumping\n\t\t\t\tyour claws from d4 to d6 is really only useful because d6&#8217;s are more fun\n\t\t\t\tto roll.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Rending Claws<\/span>: An extra d6 damage per\n\t\t\t\tround is certainly not worth a feat.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Weapon Focus<\/span>: Well, there aren&#8217;t any\n\t\t\t\tbetter options.

If you only get you make one\n\t\t\t\tattack, you should be charging so that you can get in position to make a\n\t\t\t\tfull attack. Damage dice are a very small portion of your total damage\n\t\t\t\tas you level, and adding an extra d4 or d6 is hardly going to make a\n\t\t\t\tdifference. If you somehow have exactly one big natural weapon (maybe\n\t\t\t\tyou&#8217;re an awakened animal or something), Vital Strike could be a great\n\t\t\t\toption, and you should read my\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/vital_strike.html\">Practical Guide to Vital Strike<\/a>. However, most natural weapon builds get by on having numerous natural\n\t\t\t\tweapons, so hypothetical Vital Strike builds are vastly in the\n\t\t\t\tminority.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t10th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Multiattack<\/span>: If you have secondary\n\t\t\t\tnatural attacks, this is essential.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Improved Vital Strike<\/span>: Still the same\n\t\t\t\tissue that Vital Strike faces for most rangers.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"thrown-weapon\"><a class=\"rating-red\" href=\"\/\/paizo.com\/pathfinderRPG\/prd\/advancedClassGuide\/classOptions\/slayer.html#slayer-new-combat-style\">Thrown Weapon<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thrown Weapon builds require two sets of feats: archery feats, and two-weapon fighting feats. The Thrown Weapon combat style provides the basics of both, but doesn&#8217;t help you get any of the difficult feats. You could get any worthwhile feat in this combat style by level 5 with little effort. You would be much better served by either the Archery or Two-Weapon Fighting combat styles, depending on how you want to distribute your ability scores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tBase\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Distance Thrower<\/span>: Far Shot is much\n\t\t\t\tbetter.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Precise Shot<\/span>: Required for any ranged\n\t\t\t\tcharacter.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Quick Draw<\/span>: Unless you&#8217;re using\n\t\t\t\tShurikens (a bad idea), you will need Quick Draw to draw more weapons\n\t\t\t\tfaster than a move action.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Two-Weapon Fighting<\/span>: If you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tthrowing weapons, you probably want to use your off-hand to throw some\n\t\t\t\tmore.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t6th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Close-Quarters Thrower<\/span>: Very helpful\n\t\t\t\tfor getting in close, but you can always take a 5-foot step away.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">False<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rating-blue\">Opening<\/span>: This is great if you have\n\t\t\t\tSneak Attack.

Rangers get medium armor and d10 hit points, which makes it hard to be in melee without a shield. If you really want to use a two-handed weapon as a ranger, consider the Wild Stalker archetype instead of this combat style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tBase\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Cleave<\/span>: Cleave is a decent option at\n\t\t\t\tlow levels if you tend to fight mobs of enemys. It can be hard to set up\n\t\t\t\tsince the targets need to be adjacent, but it gets you two attacks very\n\t\t\t\tearly in the game.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Power Attack<\/span>: Basically required.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Pushing Assault<\/span>: Like a lousy version\n\t\t\t\tof bull rush, and you sacrifice your power attack damage.<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Shield of Swings<\/span>: If you wanted better\n\t\t\t\tAC you should have just picked a combat style that involved shields.<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t6th Level\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Furious Focus<\/span>: Fantastic.

If you want a Strength-based two-weapon fighting build, invest in dual-wielding shields. If you want to go the Dexterity route, stick to light armor and pick up Slashing Grace and Sawtooth Sabres. You might not be able to keep up with rogues in terms of damage, but your full BAB lets you get considerably more attacks than a Rogue, and you can actually hit things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tBase\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Double Slice<\/span>: You need a huge amount of\n\t\t\t\tstrength to make this feat worthwhile.
