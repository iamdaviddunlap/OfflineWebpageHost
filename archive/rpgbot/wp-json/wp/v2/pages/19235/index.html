The signature feature, Wickerbone Behemoth, neatly addresses the Druid&#8217;s problematic lack of durability while also giving you an effective weapon attack option that&#8217;s good enough to carry you through many encounters. The subclass also brings in several Osteomancy spells (also introduced in Steinhardt&#8217;s), offering some really exciting bone-themed magic with novel, powerful effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The closest official option to Circle of Symbiosis is <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/circle-of-spores\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2638\">Circle of Spores<\/a>: both subclasses use Wild Shape to turn the Druid into a martial form which makes them more of a martial threat while still maintaining the ability to cast spells. Compared to Circle of Spores, Circle of Symbiosis monopolizes your action economy considerably less, but benefits from similar tactics and build choices. In many ways, Circle of Symbiosis is simpler to build and play than Circle of Spores, but also leaves much more flexibility in what you can do while still building an effective character. That said, Circle of Symbiosis works best with a good understanding of the mechanics of temporary hit points and of the spell Barkskin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because Barkskin features so heavily in the subclass&#8217;s features, it&#8217;s important to understand how it works.

Skeletal Tail\n\t\t\t\t(Steinhardt&#8217;s) is a good area control buff, making it difficult for\n\t\t\t\tenemies to move around while you&#8217;re nearby. The 1-minute duration is\n\t\t\t\tenough to get through a fight, but try to pre-cast it before you jump\n\t\t\t\tinto combat if you can.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">5<\/span>: Osseus Cage (Steinhardt&#8217;s) is like\n\t\t\t\ta low-budget Forcecage, allowing you to trap enemies inside the cage\n\t\t\t\twith you or to trap enemies outside. Plant Growth is great area control.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">7<\/span>: Maiden of Bones (Steinhardt&#8217;s)\n\t\t\t\tcompletely removes an enemy from a fight for up to a minute, and\n\t\t\t\tamazingly doesn&#8217;t require Concentration. For creatures not built around\n\t\t\t\tStrength, this is a death sentence. Stoneskin is an excellent defensive\n\t\t\t\toption. It does require Concentration, but halving most attacking damage\n\t\t\t\tmakes it much easier to pass Concentration saves.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">9<\/span>: Forest of Dread (Steinhardt&#8217;s) is\n\t\t\t\tpassable area control, but since the damage only applies when creatures\n\t\t\t\tmove, it&#8217;s entirely possible that enemies will simply remain still while\n\t\t\t\tfighting or flee the area of effect on round 1. Tree Stride is at best\n\t\t\t\tmediocre, and even then only when you&#8217;re consistently in forests with\n\t\t\t\tqualifying trees.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Wickerbone Behemoth<\/span>: Circle of Symbiosis&#8217;s\n\t\tsignature feature, Wickerbone Behemoth turns you into a melee threat.\n\t\tOffensively, you&#8217;re relying on your club hands. Wickerbone Behemoth allows\n\t\tyour hands to function as clubs affected by Shillelagh. Clubs notably have\n\t\tthe Light property, which means that they qualify for Two-Weapon Fighting.\n\t\tIf you&#8217;re not using your Bonus Action for a spell, you&#8217;ll frequently be in\n\t\tmelee attacking with both hands.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>But what about the Druid&#8217;s famously poor defenses? d8 hit dice and poor\n\t\t\tarmor options make melee a scary place. Barkskin helps a bit, but AC 16\n\t\t\tdoesn&#8217;t make you bulletproof. If you can handle the damage, baiting\n\t\t\tattacks to trigger the 1d4 damage when you&#8217;re hit can be very effective,\n\t\t\tespecially if you&#8217;re in a crowd.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You&#8217;re expected to survive based on the third bullet of the feature.\n\t\t\tRecovering half of the damage you take up to 3x Wisdom means that you can\n\t\t\teasily handle small amounts of damage, even from multiple sources, but\n\t\t\tsince you only recover half you need to end fights quickly. Consider the\n\t\t\tTough feat so that you can handle more damage.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"2\"\n\t\t><strong>Grafted Power<\/strong>:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Bear Back<\/span>: Adding Wisdom to your\n\t\t\t\tStrength checks is most often useful for grappling and shoving. With\n\t\t\t\tExtra Attack, that&#8217;s actually a useful option for you so that you can\n\t\t\t\tuse the\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">Grapple+Shove combo<\/a\n\t\t\t\t>. However, if you plan to do this you&#8217;ll need to invest in Strength or\n\t\t\t\tspend a feat to get Expertise in order to offset a poor Strength score.\n\t\t\t\tIt&#8217;s more effort than Deer Head, but it may be worth the expense.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Deer Head<\/span>: Most Perception checks rely\n\t\t\t\ton Sight, so this will be consistently useful. This is effectively the\n\t\t\t\tdefault option; take this unless you plan to use Bear Back to\n\t\t\t\tgrapple.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Goat Hooves<\/span>: Climb speeds are nice,\n\t\t\t\tbut you can also Wild Shape into a spider if you need to climb or into a\n\t\t\t\tbird and avoid climbing altogether. Advantage on saves against things\n\t\t\t\twhich knock you prone is neat, but only situationally useful. Most\n\t\t\t\tthings that knock creatures prone come from players.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ul>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Extra Attack<\/span>: If you&#8217;re going to bother\n\t\tmaking weapon attacks, you either need on-hit damage boosts (the druid gets\n\t\tnone) or you need Extra Attack.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"10\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Nature&#8217;s Wrath<\/span>: Permanent Barkskin is\n\t\tgreat, but not a huge improvement since you already get it from Wickerbone\n\t\tBehemoth when you&#8217;re in combat. Large size is fine, but not very exciting\n\t\twithout expanded reach. The ability to get temporary hit points every turn\n\t\tis excellent, especially since you can make three attacks if you&#8217;re\n\t\ttwo-weapon fighting. The extra temporary hp can easily make up for the\n\t\trelatively low AC and might even make up for dropping a shield.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Also keep in mind how this interacts with the regeneration from\n\t\t\tWickerbone Behemoth. If you take damage that&#8217;s applied to your temporary\n\t\t\thit points, you&#8217;re still taking that damage, so you still regenerate real\n\t\t\thit points. This is great for when you&#8217;re taking real hit point damage\n\t\t\tthat&#8217;s not consistently getting through your temporary hit points.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"14\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Briarheart<\/span>: The damage bonus \n\t\tstacks with Shillelagh, so at this level you&#8217;re likely dealing 1d8+10 damage\n\t\ton 2 or 3 attacks per turn. At this level, that damage boost is crucial to\n\t\tkeep your damage output meaningful when you&#8217;re relying on attacks.\n<p>The effect when you drop to 0 hit points provides so insurance in case all of your temporary\nhit points, your regeneration, and your ability to cast Heal don&#8217;t keep you up. Your allies get\nthe benefits of Wickerbone Behemoth (probably not with the Nature&#8217;s Wrath size change), so they\nget Shillelagh hands, Barkskin, and regeneration. It&#8217;s not clear from the text, but I think your\nallies are intended to use your spellcasting modifier, so you don&#8217;t need to worry abour barbarian\nhaving 8 Wisdom and not getting regeneration.<\/p>\n<p>I confirmed with the author: When you target allies with this, they are allowed to wear armor\neven though you are not allowed to do so.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-symbiosis-ability-scores\">Circle of Symbiosis Ability Scores<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-145\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Max Wisdom, then max Constitution, then figure out how much you want of\n\tStrength and Dexterity.

Wickerbone Behemoth already gives you 1d4 (2d4 at 10th level) that hits anything you want within 5 feet, and effects like Bone Shield, Fire Shield, and Armor of Agathys can all add to that.

This lets us increase our Wisdom by 1 again, getting us to 20. By now we have enough hit points that we can afford to spend a few on the feat, especially if we have Wickerbone Behemoth running so that we&#8217;ll regenerate half of the damage we take. Using this with Bone Shield is especially fun to use with Osteomantic Adept because we can take 1d6 damage to add another 1d12 of damage prevention, then apply the reduced damage to our attacker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At level 16 we take Warcaster.

Either option will greatly improve our durability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might drop one of the above feats for Skill Expert. A +1 ability score increase and Expertise in Athletics so that our grapples are more reliable could be very impactful. The easiest swap is Cosmos Touched.

If your feeling extra spicy, you can cast this before Wild Shaping into something that flies (starting at level 8, of course), then fly around and drag enemies into the air whenever they try to move around below you and then drop them for falling damage.<br><br>Lightning Charged (Steinhardt&#8217;s) may be a good addition to your tactics. With a 10-minute duration and no Concentration, it&#8217;ll add 1d6 extra damage to your melee attacks with minimal effort. It&#8217;s exactly the sort of on-hit damage boost that two-weapon fighting needs to be effective, and the 6 charges are easily enough to get through your typical 3-round encounter.<br><br>DPR with TWF Shilellagh, Wickerbone Behemoth 1d4 on-hit retaliatory damage: 10.75<br>DPR with TWF Shilellagh, Lightning Charged, Wickerbone Behemoth 1d4 on-hit retaliatory damage: 13.15<br><br>Enlarge\/Reduce can make you a bigger melee threat both by increasing your reach, adding some extra damage, and giving you Advantage on Strength checks. Great all around, though the 1-minute duration an Action casting time can be difficult. If you wan Advantage on Strength checks, Enhance Ability&#8217;s 1-hour duration is likely a better choice.<br><br>Spike Growth is a popular crowd control spell, and with your reasonably good ability to grapple you can grapple enemies and drag them back and forth through the area to inflict damage.<br><br>Warding Wind creates an area of difficult terraind around that will make it hard for enemies to move away.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4<\/td><td>Wild Shape (CR 1\/2)<br>ASI: Wis 16 -&gt; 18<br>New Cantrips Known<br>&#8211; Thunderclap<\/td><td>More Wisdom isn&#8217;t super exciting, but we&#8217;re heavily dependent on it and we don&#8217;t have the spell slots or hit points to throw around for the feats we want to take yet. +4 Wisdom means that we can now regenerate up to 12 damage per round.<br><br>DPR with TWF Shilellagh, Wickerbone Behemoth 1d4 on-hit retaliatory damage: 11.4<br>DPR with TWF Shilellagh, Lightning Charged, Wickerbone Behemoth 1d4 on-hit retaliatory damage: 13.80<br><br>We&#8217;ll learn Thunderclap for a cheap way to handle crowds of enemies in melee.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Astral Barrage (Steinhardt&#8217;s) monopolizes your actions for an encounter, but it does a decent pile of single-target damage.<br><br>Osseus Cage (Steinhardt&#8217;s, Circle of Symbiosis spell list) is like<br>a low-budget Forcecage, allowing you to trap enemies inside the cage<br>with you or to trap enemies outside. You can let creatures in or out with a Reaction, which means only one per round, but that&#8217;s likely still enough for allies to run in and out if they need cover. Note that the cage is only 3\/4 cover, so you can see through it enough to cast spells, but you get a comfortable bonus to AC and Dexterity saves.<br><br>Aura of Vitality isn&#8217;t normally a spell I use, but I recommend that you consider it. You&#8217;re expecting to take a lot of damage, and hit dice can only get you so far.<br><br>Elemental Weapon comes online at this level and it&#8217;s worth a look. Your shillelagh hands count as weapons, but not magic weapons, so they&#8217;re valid targets for Elemental Weapon. The attack and damage bonuses can go a long way, and with a 1-hour duration it&#8217;s an easy use of a spell slot. Unfortunately, it can only affect one hand, so save it for when you have Extra Attack if you use it at all.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Extra Attack<\/td><td>Extra Attack does a lot of things for us, the least interesting of which is boosting our DPR. Attacking 3 times in one turn does mean going through Lightning Charged faster, but 2 turns of attacking is still enough to justify the spell, and we&#8217;ll likely spen at least some turns casting spells.<br><br>DPR with Extra Attack+TWF Shilellagh, Lightning Charged, Elemental Weapon on primary attacks, Wickerbone Behemoth 1d4 on-hit retaliatory damage: 29.45<br><br>With Extra Attack in hand, we can now engage in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">Grapple+Shove combo<\/a> in a single turn. Even better, we can use Goring Charge to knock our targets prone if we think the save will work better than an opposed check. Rush into melee, hit once with an attack, use Goring Charge as a Bonus Action, then use your second attack to Grapple. If everything goes well, your target is stuck prone.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Erupting Lightning (Steinhardt&#8217;s) is decent damage that you can splut to avoid allies, but 7 cubes means that the range is very short.<br><br>Maiden of Bones (Steinhardt&#8217;s, Circle of Symbiosis spell list) is a Strength-based save-or-suck spell. Throw an enemy into it, deal with their friends, then wait to see if your target escapes before the ongoing damage kills them.<br><br>Fire Shield adds yet source of damage when enemies hit you, and with a 10-minute duration and no Concentration it&#8217;s easy to pre-cast alongside Wickerbone Behemoth and Lightning Charged. Just be careful that you&#8217;re not making it so scary to attack your that enemies ignore you to go beat up your friends.

A Bonus Action casting time means that can activate it and still attack or activate Wickerbone Behemoth. Advantage on Constitution saves includes Concentration to maintain the spell. Advantage on Wisdom-based attacks covers our Shillelagh hands. 10 temporary hit points helps keep us alive. Another 1d6 Force damage on hit with weapon attacks adds a big pile of additional DPR.<br><br>It does mean no Elemental Weapon, but Guardian of Nature will have a considerably larger impact, both in terms of DPR and in terms of tactical benefits.<br><br>DPR with Extra Attack+TWF Shilellagh, Lightning Charged, Guardian of Nature, Wickerbone Behemoth 1d4 on-hit retaliatory damage: 43.16<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/pathfinder\/characters\/polymorph\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"5382\">Polymorph<\/a> raises the horrifying possibility that you can combine it with Wickerbone Behemoth. Turn yourself into a giant ape and use shillelagh with your gorilla hand, or turn yourself into tyranosaurus and enjoy a considerably higher AC plus retributive damage on top of your 136 hit points. This may actually be more effective than bothering with Shillelagh.<br><br>Stoneskin looks extremely tempting, and the improved durability certainly is, especially with a 1-hour duration. But beware the Tank Fallacy. Without Guardian of Nature or Elemental Weapon, our damage will lag considerably unless you&#8217;re relying on leveled spells.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8<\/td><td>Wild Shape (CR 1, flight)<br>Feat: Cosmos Touched (Wis 18 -&gt; 19, Armor of Agathys)<\/td><td>Cosmos Touched gets us Armor of Agathys.

With a 1-hour duration, we can get a lot of mileage out of one casting of the spell, provided that the temporary hit points last with our dismal 16 AC.<br><br>You&#8217;re free to cast it at whatever spell level you think you can afford. Right now, 2nd-level spell slots seem like a reasonable choice, but as you gain levels you can consider upcasting it further.

Armor of Agathys only cares that you were hit with a melee attack; it doesn&#8217;t care if you took damage.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><td>Forest of Dread (Steinhardt&#8217;s, Circle of Symbiosis spell list) is fine, but given the choice I would rather cast Spike Growth in most cases.<br><br>Starfall (Steinhardt&#8217;s) is really neat and fantastic against crowds, but the damage is far too slow to have a meaningful impact.<br><br>There aren&#8217;t many spells at this level that work uniquely well with our build. Malestrom can combo very nicely with Osseus Cage: run up to your enemies, put them in the cage on turn one. If you have movement left, run out of the cage. Turn 2, drop Maelstrom inside the cage. Watch as your enemies try to eat through he cage&#8217;s 100hp before Maelstrom grinds them down. Maelstrom notably only damage creatures, so your targets won&#8217;t get any help with the cage. Even if they do, you&#8217;re good at grappling and shoving, so you can simply force enemies back into the Maelstrom.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td>Nature&#8217;s Wrath<\/td><td>A massive improvement to our durability.

Still, I would be happy with the alternate damage. 15d8 (avg. 67.5) is a decent amount of damage, and we can power it up with Osteomantic Adept at the cost of 3d6 (avg. 10.5) damage to inflict another 6d8 (avg. 27) damage.
