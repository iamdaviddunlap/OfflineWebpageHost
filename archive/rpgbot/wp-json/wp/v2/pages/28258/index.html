Unfortunately, the high-level options are\n\t\tless useful.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1 Spells<\/span>: Bless is nearly a win\n\t\t\t\tcondition at low levels where adding 1d4 to a roll can exceed your\n\t\t\t\tproficiency bonus, and it remains a staple buff at basically any level\n\t\t\t\tso long as you don&#8217;t need your Concentration for something else. Cure\n\t\t\t\tWounds is a fine healing spell, but in combat you want to rely on\n\t\t\t\tHealing Word and spend your Action on offense.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 3 Spells<\/span>: Aid is a fantastic\n\t\t\t\tbuff for the entire party that can also be used in place of Mass Healing\n\t\t\t\tWord to rescue multiple dying alllies. Lesser Restoration is nice to\n\t\t\t\thave handy, but much of the time the effects which it removes can wait\n\t\t\t\tuntil you can rest and prepare spells to fix them.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5 Spells<\/span>: Mass Healing Word is\n\t\t\t\tvery expensive for very little healing, so hopefully you&#8217;ll never need\n\t\t\t\tto use it when you can cast Aid and you have Channel Divinity: Preserve\n\t\t\t\tLife. Revivify is the &#8220;Cleric Tax&#8221;, so getting it for free is really\n\t\t\t\tnice.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 7 Spells<\/span>: Aura of Life is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but it&#8217;s great against undead enemies. Death Ward\n\t\t\t\tis a fantastic defensive buff with a long duration.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-red\">Level 9 Spells<\/span>: Greater Restoration\n\t\t\t\tshould be an option of last resort since the material component is\n\t\t\t\texpensive, but every party needs it eventually. Mass Cure is redundant\n\t\t\t\twith Preserve Life.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Disciple of Life<\/span>: This isn&#8217;t a ton of\n\t\thealing all at once, but it will be especially useful with Healing Word,\n\t\twhich is a good combination because it uses a Bonus Action, but normally\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t heal for a particularly large amount. Over the course of your\n\t\tcareer, the total amount of additional healing will be significant, so I\n\t\tencourage you to keep a running score if for no other reason than to remind\n\t\tyour party members how badly they need you to survive.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Channel Divinity: Preserve Life<\/span>: Fantastic\n\t\twhen you&#8217;re looking at a possible TPK. Since you&#8217;re healing so much, most\n\t\tcharacters of your level will go from 0 to half hit points, unless you&#8217;re\n\t\tlooking at someone like a Barbarian with d12 hit dice and 20 Constitution or\n\t\tif you&#8217;re splitting the points between multiple allies. Even so, the scaling\n\t\tis excellent. As you gain additional uses of Channel Divinity this will\n\t\tquickly become your go-to option for large amounts of hit point recovery\n\t\twhile in combat.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Blessed Healer<\/span>: There is now almost never\n\t\ta reason to cast a healing spell on yourself instead of helping your allies.\n\t\tHowever, casting a healing spell to restore hit points should not happen\n\t\tfrequently during combat, so this may not trigger as frequently as you would\n\t\tlike.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Supreme Healing<\/span>: As you add more and more\n\t\tdice, your rolls will skew toward the statistical average, meaning that each\n\t\td8 from Cure Wounds is effectively 4.5 points of healing. Maximizing the die\n\t\timproves this to 8 points of healing, almost doubling the effects of your\n\t\thealing spells and thereby making your spell slots spent on healing much\n\t\tmore efficient, allowing you to reserve high-level spell slots for more\n\t\tinteresting things.\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIf you need healing in a fight, most characters should cast Heal or Mass\n\t\t\tHeal, neither of which involve dice. But with Supreme Healing, Cure Wounds\n\t\t\theals more per spell slot level than Heal does, making it a viable source\n\t\t\tof healing in combat.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"light-domainphb\"><span class=\"rating-blue\">Light Domain<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Light Domain Cleric is a Blaster, Controller, and Striker, specializing\n\tin dealing damage both to single targets and to areas. Clerics already have\n\tthe best Radiant damage spells in the game, and the Light Domain supplements\n\tthose spells with some of the best Fire damage spells. If your party doesn&#8217;t\n\thave room for both a Cleric-equivalent and a Wizard-equivalent, Light Domain\n\tis a good choice because you can so easily replace the Wizard&#8217;s ability to\n\tquickly handle groups of weak enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Light Domain Spells<\/span>: A fantastic set of\n\t\toffensive spells which close the gap between Clerics and Wizards.\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 1 Spells<\/span>: Faerie Fire is a great\n\t\t\t\tway to handle invisible creatures, but it&#8217;s also helpful support option\n\t\t\t\tfor allies that rely on attacks because it&#8217;s an easy source of Advantage\n\t\t\t\tagainst multiple targets. Burning Hands is a great low-level AOE damage\n\t\t\t\tspell, but resist the urge to burn all of your spell slots casting it or\n\t\t\t\tyou won&#8217;t have any slots to heal with. At high levels, Faerie Fire\n\t\t\t\tremains incredibly potent, but Burning Hands will be obsolete after a\n\t\t\t\tfew levels.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3 Spells<\/span>: Scorching Ray is a\n\t\t\t\tgreat single-target option, especially if you have Bless or Faerie Fire\n\t\t\t\trunning to boost the attack rolls. See Invisibility gives you an even\n\t\t\t\tbetter way to handle invisibile enemies than Faerie Fire.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5 Spells<\/span>: Daylight is only\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful, but Fireball is the sledgehammer of offensive\n\t\t\t\tspells: sometimes you just need to hit your problems until they fall\n\t\t\t\tdown. In terms of instantaneous area damage, there isn&#8217;t another spell\n\t\t\t\tthat can compete with Fireball until 9th-level spells introduce stuff\n\t\t\t\tlike Meteor Swarm.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 7 Spells<\/span>: Arcane Eye is my\n\t\t\t\tabsolute favorite scouting option. Wall of Fire is among the best area\n\t\t\t\tcontrol spells in the game.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Level 9 Spells<\/span>: Flame Strike is\n\t\t\t\tconsiderably less important since you get Fireball, but it&#8217;s only 2d6\n\t\t\t\tdamage behind Fireball, and avoiding common Fire damage resistances with\n\t\t\t\thalf of the damage can make the spell more reliable against some\n\t\t\t\tenemies. Scrying is only situationally useful so it&#8217;s frustrating to\n\t\t\t\thave it prepared every day.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-orange\">Radiance of the Dawn<\/span>: The damage isn&#8217;t\n\t\tgreat beyond low levels. Magical darkness can really cause problems, and a\n\t\tguaranteed way to remove it is very convenient, but you can also negate\n\t\tmagical darkness with the spell Daylight, which you get prepared for free\n\t\tonce you hit level 5. So there&#8217;s a small level window where this might be\n\t\timpactful, but once you get through low levels you&#8217;ll frequently get better\n\t\tresults from the Harness Divine Power Optional Class Feature if your DM\n\t\tallows it.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Warding Flair<\/span>: You won&#8217;t get a ton of\n\t\tuses, so save this for enemies which can do a lot of damage on a single\n\t\tattack. This needs to be activated &#8220;before an attack hits or misses&#8221;, which\n\t\tis frustratingly vague, but I assume it means &#8220;before the result of the\n\t\tattack is determined&#8221;. So your DM could roll, ask &#8220;Does a 25 hit?&#8221; knowing\n\t\tfull well that it does, and you could scream &#8220;Warding Flare!&#8221; before the DM\n\t\tsays &#8220;you are hit&#8221; and the DM would then roll with Disadvantage (meaning\n\t\tthat they roll a second die and choose the lower of the two results, not\n\t\tthat they need to dump whatever they&#8217;ve already rolled).\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Of course, your DM might read that differently and take my portrayal of\n\t\t\tthat interaction poorly, so check with your DM before you assume how this\n\t\t\tworks. Tragically, Jeremy Crawford&#8217;s only response on the subject\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyECrawford\/status\/839263164936003584\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn&#8217;t actually clarify the answer<\/a\n\t\t\t>.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Improved Flare<\/span>: Fantastic if you have\n\t\tallies who are squishier than you (like a Wizard) or if you need to buy time\n\t\tuntil you can heal someone.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Corona of Light<\/span>: If you&#8217;re anything like\n\t\tme, you want to make a joke about light beer whenever you see this ability.\n\t\tBut, unlike light beer, this is fun. It&#8217;s essentially an overdrive button\n\t\tfor your Fire and Radiant damage spells, which is especially nice with Light\n\t\tDomain Spells and with Cleric staples like Spirit Guardians.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>However, it&#8217;s an Action to activate, which can make it hard to use in\n\t\t\tcombat. Start this before jumping into combat if possible.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"trickery\"><span class=\"rating-green\">Trickery Domain<\/span>\n\t<sup>(<a href=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/abbreviations\/\">PHB<\/a>)<\/sup><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Trickery Domain turns the Cleric into an effective Scout, providing better\n\tstealth options through spells and through Blessing of the Trickster.

Options like Word of Radiance are much safer when you can walk\n\t\t\tyour illusion into a crowd of enemies to cast it, and, since the illusion\n\t\t\tisn&#8217;t a creature, it&#8217;s not worried about things like Opportunity Attacks,\n\t\t\tarea control effects, or even enemy creatures blocking spaces.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>You can use the illusion to get yourself Advantage in melee, but I&#8217;m\n\t\t\tnervous to recommend capitalizing on that as a go-to tactic. Weapon\n\t\t\tattacks aren&#8217;t a great option for Clerics. Easy access to Advantage may\n\t\t\tmake weapons viable compared to cantrips, especially with Divine Strike,\n\t\t\tbut don&#8217;t let that compel you to build around melee. This notably applies\n\t\t\tto all attacks, so you can deliver spells like Inflict Wounds and\n\t\t\tSpiritual Weapon with Advantage.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>If you&#8217;re happy using your illusory double as a distraction and as a\n\t\t\tcourier for your spells, you can totally ignore the Advantage part of\n\t\t\tInvoke Duplicity and you&#8217;ll still do just fine.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The wording of the ability allows you to place the illusion and\n\t\t\tmove it around in the air. This may be helpful for targeting spells with\n\t\t\tless concerns about cover, or for targeting flying enemies.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>Strangely, Invoke Duplicity doesn&#8217;t offer details on how to handle\n\t\t\tinteraction with the illusory double. What happens if the illusion is\n\t\t\tattacked? Can creatures disbelieve it, and if they do so, how do they then\n\t\t\tperceive the illusion? If creatures are aware that the double is an\n\t\t\tillusion, do you still get Advantage on attacks when you and your double\n\t\t\tare adjacent to a creature?

However, it requires Concentration, which means that you can&#8217;t\n\t\t\t\tcombine it with other great low-level buffs like Bless.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 3 Spells<\/span>: Magic Weapon\nis essential if you lack permanent magical weapons, but for allies that rely heavily on weapons, the +1 attack\/damage bonus is also a huge boost to their damage output. If you&#8217;re expecting to face several encounters in the 1-hour duration,  Spiritual Weapon\n\t\t\t\tis a staple Cleric option, and a great way to convert your Bonus Action\n\t\t\t\tinto damage output while leaving your Action free for non-Concentration\n\t\t\t\tspells like Guiding Bolt. However, it competes for space with War Priest\n\t\t\t\tboth conceptually and within the action economy.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"5\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 5 Spells<\/span>: Crusader&#8217;s Mantle is\n\t\t\t\tDivine Favor for the whole party. The damage per attack is still small,\n\t\t\t\tbut if you have someone using Two-Weapon Fighting, allies with Extra\n\t\t\t\tAttack, or just a large party, the value adds up quickly. But it\n\t\t\t\tgenerally can&#8217;t compete with Spirit Guardians, which you also get.\n\t\t\t\tSpirit Guardians is among the most efficient damage options in the game,\n\t\t\t\tand many clerics prepare it every day.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"7\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">Level 7 Spells<\/span>: Fire Shield is a\n\t\t\t\tgreat defensive buff if you&#8217;re on the front lines, especially if you&#8217;re\n\t\t\t\tnot wearing heavy armor and a shield. Freedom of movement is\n\t\t\t\tsituationally useful.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t<li value=\"9\"\n\t\t\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Level 9 Spells<\/span>: Hold Monster is a\n\t\t\t\tfantastic save-or-suck spell which you can immediately follow with an\n\t\t\t\tattack from War Priest for a guaranteed critical hit. Steel Wind Strike\n\t\t\t\tis simple, direct damage. Since you can use Guided Strike without an\n\t\t\t\taction for your own attacks, you can use it with multiple missed attacks\n\t\t\t\twithin a single turn. Note that the damage is fixed regardless of your\n\t\t\t\tweapon, so you can wave a dart and still deal 6d10 damage to each of\n\t\t\t\tyour targets if you don&#8217;t routinely wield a weapon.<\/li\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t<\/ol>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"3\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-green\">War Priest<\/span>: A convenient use for your\n\t\tBonus Action, allowing you to turn any spare Bonus Action into an attack.\n\t\tOnce you hit 20 Wisdom, you might find yourself unable to use all of your\n\t\tWar Priest uses in a given adventuring day, provided that your party\n\t\tremembers to take Short Rests.\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>The biggest difficulty here is that you need to invest in either Strength\n\t\t\tor Dexterity to make these attacks effective, which is difficult for the\n\t\t\tcleric. Shillelagh helps, but it also competes for your Bonus Action. Your\n\t\t\tbest bet is to use Guided Strike when you miss, but that does add another\n\t\t\tlimited resource to the equation whenever you want to attack.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t\t<p\n\t\t\t>There&#8217;s also a great deal of competition within the subclass for your\n\t\t\tBonus Action, and nearly every use of your Bonus Action is more appealing\n\t\t\tthan War Priest. Fortunately, these options start to come online right as\n\t\t\tyou start getting ability score increases and decide that it&#8217;s time to\n\t\t\tleave your Strength or Dexterity at 16 in order to focus on Wisdom.<\/p\n\t\t>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li value=\"6\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">War God&#8217;s Blessing<\/span>: Casting Shield of\n\t\tFaith without Concentration is a significant buff at any point in your\n\t\tcareer, and since Channel Divinity recharges on a Short Rest, you can afford\n\t\tto use it frequently. Spiritual Weapon as a Bonus Action is similarly\n\t\tfantastic, and will be a much more reliable use for your Bonus Action than\n\t\tbuilding yourself to use War Priest, but the damage may feel unappealing at\n\t\thigh levels since it won&#8217;t scale.<\/li\n\t>\n\t<li value=\"17\"\n\t\t><span class=\"rating-blue\">Avatar of Battle<\/span>: Permanent resistance to\n\t\tthe three most common damage types in the game.<\/li\n\t>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Your Cleric&#8217;s subclass determines not only your character&#8217;s central theme as a divine spellcaster, but also your role on the battlefield and your general playstyle.
