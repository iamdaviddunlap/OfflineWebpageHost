It casts spells spontaneously, but it&#8217;s Intelligence-based like a wizard. The Psychic&#8217;s spell list overlaps with the Sorcerer\/Wizard spell list quite a bit, but isn&#8217;t quite as large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Like the Wizard, the Psychic can fill a variety of roles thanks to their expansive skills and spell list. No role except healer is beyond your reach, though the psychic excels as a Striker, Support, and a Utility Caster. Charisma-heavy psychics also make excellent Faces. However, the Psychic&#8217;s spells focus much more heavily on mind-affecting effects. While many of these are powerful, this also comes with complications. Anything that is mindless or is resistant or immune to mind-affecting effects (constructs, undead, etc.) will be difficult for the Psychic to handle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"\/pathfinder\/supported_content\">support a limited subset of Pathfinder&#8217;s rules content<\/a>.

Touch AC scales very little from level 1\n\tto level 20, going from an\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/tools\/monster_analysis\/\">\n\t\taverage of 12.2 on CR 1 monsters to 16.4 on CR 20 monsters<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Saves<\/span>: Your only good save is Will.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Proficiencies<\/span>: Simple weapons are nice,\n\tbut you&#8217;re not going to use them. No armor, either, but you don&#8217;t care about\n\tArcane Spell Failure and armor check penalty barely matters.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Skills<\/span>: Psychics only get 2+ skills, but you\n\tget <em>every<\/em> knowledge skill as a class skill plus every Face skill, and\n\tyour absurd intelligence will give you plenty of skill points to throw around.\n\tRemember that permanently increasing your intelligence will give you\n\tadditional skill points retroactively, which will be nice when you hit levels\n\t8 and 16.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spells<\/span>: The Psychic is the only psychic\n\tspellcaster that gets full casting.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Knacks<\/span>: Knacks are cantrips with a funny\n\tname. Just like cantrips, they&#8217;re fantastic and extremely versatile.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Phrenic Pool<\/span> (Su): Phrenic Pool powers your\n\tamplifications. You want your pool to be as big as possible, and you want to\n\trecharge it as quickly as you can after using points. The <em>only<\/em> use\n\tfor your phrenic pool points is your phrenic amplifications, so be sure to\n\tselect options which you can regularly depend upon. If you go an entire day\n\twithout spending a phrenic pool point you&#8217;re doing something wrong.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Phrenic Amplifications<\/span>: A few of the\n\tphrenic amplifications are extremely powerful, but most are bad. The feature\n\tas a whole is fine, and you only get three amplifications before you get Major\n\tAmplifications, but there aren&#8217;t enough good options to leave much room for\n\tcustomization. See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/psychic\/phrenic_amplifications\">Phrenic Amplification Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor further analysis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Psychic Discipline<\/span> (Ex or Sp): Your psychic\n\tdiscipline grants you an extra spell known at every spell level, a mechanism\n\tto add extra points to your Phrenic Pool throughout the day, and several\n\tspecial abilities. Unfortunately, very few of the discipline options are good.\n\tSee my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/psychic\/psychic_disciplines\">Psychic Disciplines Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor further guidance.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Detect Thoughts <\/span> (Sp): Detect thoughts is a\n\tsituational spell, and situational spells are hard for spontaneous casters to\n\tuse since you&#8217;ve got a limited selection of spells known. This gives it to you\n\tfor free, and it doesn&#8217;t use a spell slot the first time you use it each\n\tday.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Telepathic Bond<\/span> (Sp): Telepathic bond is a\n\tfantastic spell that keeps your party in constant communication without giving\n\tyourselves away. If my party is trying to be subtle in any way, I try to make\n\tsure that someone in the party can cast this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Major Amplifications<\/span>: A significant\n\timprovement on the basic amplifications. See my\n\t<a href=\"\/pathfinder\/characters\/classes\/psychic\/phrenic_amplifications\">Phrenic Amplification Breakdown<\/a>\n\tfor further analysis.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Telepathy<\/span> (Su): Telepathy doesn&#8217;t require a\n\tlanguage, so if you picked up Face skills you can now communicate with any\n\tcreature intelligent enough to speak a language.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Remade Self<\/span> (Sp): All of the spell options\n\tare excellent, but at this level a 3rd-level spell isn&#8217;t going to make a huge\n\tdifference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abilities\">Abilities<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Psychic is very MAD for a spellcaster. Their spellcasting is Intelligence-based, but depending on your Psychic Discipline you&#8217;ll need either Wisdom or Charisma. You also need Dexterity and Constitution for AC, hp, and saves. That leaves you with just one dump stat compared to the Wizard&#8217;s two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Str<\/span>: Dump to 7. You need the points.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dex<\/span>: Saves and AC.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Con<\/span>: Saves and hp.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Int<\/span>: Runs your spells.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Wi<\/span><span class=\"rating-orange\">s<\/span>: If\n\tyour discipline needs Wisdom, you want to invest here. If it doesn&#8217;t, you\n\tstill don&#8217;t want to dump this because you need Will saves.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-red\">Ch<\/span><span class=\"rating-green\">a<\/span>: If\n\tyour discipline uses Charisma, you get to be a Face. If it doesn&#8217;t, dump this\n\tto 7.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 18<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 16<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 8<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 14<\/li>\n<li>Con: 14<\/li>\n<li>Int: 17<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 17<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 7<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 15<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 14<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 10<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Wisdom-based Discipline<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>25 Point Buy<\/th><th>20 Point Buy<\/th><th>15 Point Buy<\/th><th>Elite Array<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 17<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 16<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 17<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 12<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 7<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 12<\/li>\n<li>Int: 16<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><td>\n<ul>\n<li>Str: 8<\/li>\n<li>Dex: 12<\/li>\n<li>Con: 13<\/li>\n<li>Int: 15<\/li>\n<li>Wis: 10<\/li>\n<li>Cha: 14<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>Charisma-based Discipline<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Psychic&#8217;s strange ability scores mean that a variety of races can work as psychics. However, your race&#8217;s ability scores may make some disciplines more appealing than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/span>: Wisdom bonus works for some\n\tdisciplines, and the bonus duration to abjuration spells from the favored\n\tclass bonus is useful once it adds up a bit.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Elf<\/span>: Dexterity for saves and AC,\n\tIntelligence for spells, +2 to overcome spell resistance that stacks with\n\tSpell Penetration. The Constitution penalty always hurts, but the Intelligence\n\tbonus is well worth it. The favored class bonus increases the size of your\n\tphrenic pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Gnome<\/span>: Charisma works for some disciplines,\n\tbonus Constitution, a penalty to your dump stat, and small size. The favored\n\tclass bonus increases the size of your phrenic pool.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Half-Elf<\/span>: Flexible +2 goes into\n\tIntelligence. The favored class bonus is tempting, but it&#8217;s hard to justify\n\tsix levels of favored class bonus when there are already so few good\n\tamplification options.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-orange\">Half-Orc<\/span>: Flexible +2 goes into\n\tIntelligence. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s the only good bit that half-orcs offer.\n\tThe favored class bonus is terrible.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Halfling<\/span>: Charisma works for some\n\tdisciplines, Dexterity helps with AC and saves, and small size. The favored\n\tclass bonus is really unique and exciting. Treating your Charisma bonus as\n\thigher allows you to recharge your phrenic pool more and use powerful\n\tdiscipline abilities more throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Human<\/span>: Flexible +2 in Intelligence, bonus\n\tskill ranks, and a feat. The favored class bonus gets you extra spells known,\n\tsolving the largest problem for spontaneous casters. At low levels you won&#8217;t\n\tbe able to use the favored class bonus for anything interesting (ooh boy, more\n\tcantrips!) so put the points into your hit points or get some extra skill\n\tranks to spread around your gigantic skill list. I rarely recommend this, but\n\tthe Dual Talent alternate racial feature may worthwhile here if you don&#8217;t need\n\tthe extra feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traits\">Traits<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Deft Dodger<\/span> (Combat): +1 to a weak\n\t\tsave.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Reactionary<\/span> (Combat): +2 initiative is\n\t\thuge.
