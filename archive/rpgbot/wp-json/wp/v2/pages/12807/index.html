Their signature feature, Spellstrike, allows you to deliver spells at the end of a weapon, combining the damage of your weapon with the damage of a spell. However, in exchange for this exceptional martial capability you give up much of the versatility and magical might of a typical spellcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>With a huge amount of damage output, the Magus is a natural Striker. They lack the built-in durability and &#8220;stickiness&#8221; of a Defender, but with the right subclass and if you take the Attack of Opportunity feat, you can come to class to matching the Fighter&#8217;s capacity as a Defender. The Magus needs high Intelligence to back up their spells, so the Magus also makes a natural Scholar, covering the party&#8217;s need for knowledge skills. Depending on your build you could also serve as a Scout, but the Magus won&#8217;t match a rogue and the Magus doesn&#8217;t have the Wizard&#8217;s magic to fill the gap. Your limited spellcasting also means that you&#8217;re not an effective support or utility caster, so the Magus fills a role similar to the Fighter, but without the Fighter&#8217;s durability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The Magus&#8217;s spellcasting is extremely unusual. You prepare spells from a\n\tspellbook just like a wizard, but you have at most 4 regular spell slots (not\n\tcounting Focus Spells), split between the two highest-level spells you can\n\tcast. In a way, this feels similar to DnD 5e&#8217;s Warlock. The Magus also gets a\n\tfew lower-level slots from Studious Spells which can be used for a handful of\n\tspecific buff spells, but these are few in number and limited in scope. The\n\tMagus also never gets 10th-level spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Because leveled spells present an opportunity for a big power spike, the\n\tMagus benefits greatly from additional sources of spell slots. Archetypes,\n\tscrolls, and staves are all extremely useful for the Magus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>You may also find these supporting articles helpful:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/magus\/hybrid-study\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"12806\">Magus Hybrid Study Breakdown<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/p2\/characters\/arcane-spell-list\/\">Arcane Spell List Breakdown<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"simpletoc-title\">Table of Contents<\/h2>\n<ul class=\"simpletoc-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-features\">Magus Class Features<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#ability-scores\">Magus Ability Scores<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#strengthbased\">Strength-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#dexteritybased\">Dexterity-Based<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#ancestries\">Ancestries<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">Magus Skills and Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#general-skill-feats\">Magus General Skill Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#feats\">Magus Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#class-feats\">Class Feats<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#class-feats-1\">1st Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-2\">2nd Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-4\">4th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-6\">6th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-8\">8th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-10\">10th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-12\">12th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-14\">14th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-16\">16th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-18\">18th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#class-feats-20\">20th Level<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#general-feats\">General Feats<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#weapons\">Magus Weapons<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#armor\">Magus Armor<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells\">Magus Focus Spells &#8211; Conflux Spells<\/a>\n\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"#focus-spells-1\">1st-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-3\">3rd-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-4\">4th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#focus-spells-7\">7th-Level Spells<\/a>\n\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li><a href=\"#archetypes\">Archetypes<\/a>\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RPGBOT uses the color coding scheme which has become common among Pathfinder build handbooks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Red<\/span>: Bad, useless options, or options which\n\t\tare extremely situational.

You also don&#8217;t have a class DC to use as a basis\n\t\tfor Weapon Critical Specialization Effects, so if you find a way to get\n\t\taccess to them, you&#8217;ll need to stick to weapon\n\t\ttypes that don&#8217;t allow a save.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Spellcasting<\/span>: Similar to the Wizard, the Magus uses the Arcane spell list, and they are prepared spellcasters so you need to prepare a spell in each of your spell slots during your Daily Preparations. However, the Magus&#8217;s spell slots work very differently from other classes. Rather than accumulating a growing number of slots across your full range of spell levels, the Magus maxes out at 4 spell slots of two spell levels (not counting Studious Spells).<\/p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Heightened Spells<\/strong>: Heightening spells is an important\n\t\tmechanic in Pathfinder 2e. Many important spells scale with spell level, allowing\n\t\tthem to stay relevant long after you first learned them. Since the Magus\n\t\tdoesn&#8217;t use a Spell Repertoire, you only need to learn a spell once, then\n\t\tyou can prepare it at any level that you can cast.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Cantrips<\/strong>: The Magus can prepare 5\n\t\tcantrips, and they start with 10 in their spellbook so you have lots of room\n\t\tto customize your arsenal every day. Cantrips will do a lot of work with\n\t\tSpellstrike, so cantrips are a much more central part of your spellcasting\n\t\tthan they are for most spellcasters.<\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Spellbook<\/strong>: Your spellbook is your most\n\t\tvaluable possession. Guard it jealously; if you lose it, you&#8217;ll be unable to\n\t\tprepare spells. You don&#8217;t need to hoard new spells quite like a wizard does,\n\t\tbut you likely still want to learn more spells than what you get for\n\t\tfree.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Spellstrike<\/span>: Spellstrike is the Magus&#8217;s\n\tcentral feature, and much of how you build your character will be to get the\n\tmost out of Spellstrike. To briefly summarize: you cast a spell and hit your target with a weapon in order to deliver the spell, combining the damage of both. If you choose to ignore Spellstrike, you&#8217;re basically\n\tjust a disappointing fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Spellstrike is so central to the class, let&#8217;s really dig into how it works and how it fits into playing the class. Understanding the action economy, the recharge mechanics, and how Spellstrike works with your spells will make you much more effective. The book draws attention to this issue in the &#8220;Combining Your Abilities&#8221; sidebar, and you know it&#8217;s complicated when the rules text gives you hints on tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Spellstrike is a 2-Action activity. It typically uses your melee reach,\n\tbut Starlit Span offers ranged weapons as an option. Using Spellstrike counts\n\tas two attacks for your Multiple Attack Penalty, so making additional strikes\n\tin the same turn is generally both difficult and ineffective. If you score a\n\tcritical hit, you score a critical hit with both the weapon attack and the\n\tspell. Of course, that also means that it&#8217;s very &#8220;hit or miss&#8221; and since\n\tyou&#8217;re unlikely to make additional strikes in the same turn you\n\t<em>really<\/em> need Spellstrike to hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice of spell is crucial, and you want to have enough options available to cover whatever you might face. That&#8217;s hard to do with at most 4 spell slots, so you need to lean heavily on your cantrips. You&#8217;re limited to spells which make spell attacks, but some class feats can expand that and we&#8217;ll discuss tactics in the assessments for those feats.

If you use anything else with Spellstrike it needs to beat Gouging Claw to justify consideration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recharging Spellstrike is easily the most challenging part of playing the\n\tMagus. You want to use Spellstrike as often as possible, but you need to do\n\tsomething to recharge it after each use, and this will typically require\n\tspending an Action of some kind. You can just spend an Action to recharge, but\n\tthat effectively turns Spellstrike into a 3-Action activity, and while\n\tSpellstrike is really good, that&#8217;s a steep action cost. More likely, you&#8217;ll\n\trecharge it by casting a Conflux Spell (the Magus&#8217;s Focus Spells). The options\n\tin Secrets of Magic all cost one Action, so you can reliably use them at no\n\textra Action cost in order to recharge. You can also recharge with certain\n\tclass feats, including Magus&#8217;s Analysis and Rapid Recharge. These options are\n\timportant because your Focus Pool is limited in size, so you may not have\n\tenough Focus Points to keep recharging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Positioning is an immediate problem for the Magus. The 2-Action cost plus the Action cost to recharge means that you typically can&#8217;t move, recharge, and use Spellstrike on the same turn. Generally that means that you can expect to use Spellstrike once every other turn unless you&#8217;re using the Starlit Span Hybrid Study so that you can attack at range. Using Reach weapons can mitigate this somewhat, as can the Laughing Shadow&#8217;s Dimensional Assault. But for everyone else, if you need to move to get to a new target you likely need to give up Spellstrike for a turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you gain the ability to cast Haste, this all improves somewhat. An extra\n\tAction which you can use to Stride makes things much easier. You can&#8217;t Step\n\twith this action, but if you&#8217;re in a position where Step makes sense you&#8217;re\n\tprobably in melee already, so you can go straight to hitting stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-green\">Arcane Cascade<\/span>: Oh great, another action\n\tcost. The damage bonus is pitifully small even with the scaling, so it&#8217;s\n\tbasically only there to make you feel good and if you&#8217;re very lucky to trigger\n\tvulnerabilities. On its own, this is not worth the action cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arcane Cascade&#8217;s real benefit comes from your Hybrid Study. You&#8217;ll get an\n\tadditional benefit which applies only while you&#8217;re in Arcane Cascade, and the\n\tbenefits are generally good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The specific wording of Arcane Cascade is fundamentally broken: using the\n\tAction to activate the stance breaks the stance because you no longer qualify\n\tfor the stance. We&#8217;ve been promised errata, but haven&#8217;t recieve it as of this\n\twriting. I believe the intent is for the stance to last until the end of the\n\tencounter, and I&#8217;m going to write the rest of this handbook with that\n\tassumption in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hybrid Study<\/strong>: See my\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/RPGBOT.net\/p2\/characters\/classes\/magus\/hybrid-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magus Hybrid Study Breakdown<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conflux Spells<\/strong>: See magus focus spells, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Magus Feats<\/strong>: See magus feats, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Studious Spells<\/span>: Two additional spell slots.\n\tYou can only use them for a handful of buff spells, but the options are mostly\n\tgood and they cover some essentials which allow the Magus to function at high\n\tlevels without the assistance of another spellcaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"rating-blue\">Double Spellstrike<\/span>: This essentially doubles\n\thow much you can get out of your spell slots.

Because the Magus can be built around either Strength or Dexterity,\n\twhichever of the two is easier to boost is one in a series of benefits which\n\tcan greatly influence your build. Avoid Intelligence Flaws, but otherwise you\n\tcan do fine with many races.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a magus planning to fight unarmed, look for an Ancestry that can get you a better unarmed attack or consider a Versatile Heritage which can get you one, such as the Changeling&#8217;s Hag Claws ancestry feat. The Arcane Fist class feat is the Magus&#8217;s only built-in option if you want to fight unarmed, and it is outright inferior to whatever option you can get from your Ancestry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a magus planning to use a weapon, weapon familiarity feats are a great\n\tchoice. The Magus doesn&#8217;t get access to Critical Specialization Effects (with\n\tthe exception of the Student of the Staff class feat), so getting it from your\n\tAncestry is helpful. Unfortunately that does limit you to a small set of\n\tweapons, but those weapons are often very good. When considering what weapons\n\tto use, be sure to consider the advice under Magus Weapons, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to innate spellcasting from your Ancestry can also be very helpful. While the Magus can prepare as many cantrips as other spellcasters and gets access to the Cantrip Expansion feat, your limited pool of spell slots means that you don&#8217;t have as many magic options as most spellcasters. Adding an extra cantrip or a leveled buff spell can expand your options significantly. However, remember that innate spells are typically Charisma-based, so you don&#8217;t want anything that cares about a spell attack or a saving throw. Stick to utility spells, buffs, and defensive options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/ancestries\/catfolk\/\" class=\"rating-orange\">Catfolk<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">APG<\/a><\/sup>: Use the Optional Flaw rule to dump Charisma in exchange for another Boost\n\tso that you can boost Dex\/Con\/Int. Catfolk Weapon Familiarity can get you\n\taccess to the Whip Claw, and you can get a good natural weapon from either the\n\tClawed Catfolk Heritage or from Saberteeth if you want to build an unarmed\n\tmagus. Catfolk Weapon Rake gets you Critical Specialization Effects, but the\n\tBrawling category (which is typically what you use for unarmed strikes,\n\tincluding the Catfolk&#8217;s claws\/teeth) relies on your Class DC, and the Magus\n\tdoesn&#8217;t have one. In many ways, the Catfolk&#8217;s options resemble worse versions\n\tof the Gnome&#8217;s, with the exception of unarmed strikes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/p2\/characters\/ancestries\/dwarf\/\" class=\"rating-green\">Dwarf<\/a><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: With high ancestry hit points and Mountain&#8217;s Stoutness, the Dwarf is very\n\tdurable, making them a great option for front-line builds like Inexorable Iron\n\tand Sparkling Targe.

If you&#8217;re not using\n\t\tStarlit Span, you likely need to start your turn in melee with your target\n\t\tand also have Spellstrike charged. Provided you meet those conditions, the\n\t\tcounteract effect is on top of your normal Spellstrike, so you&#8217;re\n\t\tessentially adding one action to also try to counteract a spell. I&#8217;m not\n\t\tsure how you pick which spell to counteract, but that&#8217;s a discussion for\n\t\tyour GM.\n\t\t<p>Outside of combat, this is dispel magic for free as often as you want.

The counteract effect is as good as\n\t\t\theightening Dispel Magic to the highest level spell you can cast (possibly\n\t\t\thigher since it can hit 10th level, but the Magus doesn&#8217;t get 10th-level\n\t\t\tspells).<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Resounding Cascade<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: The damage is decent since by this level your allies will have weapon\n\t\texpertise of some variety, but the 5-foot radius on the aura makes it very\n\t\tdifficult to keep allies in the aura.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-18\">18th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Conflux Wellspring<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: Considering that Conflux Spells are among your best choices for\n\t\trecharging Spellstrike, you really want to be able to recharge all of your\n\t\tFocus Points.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-green\">Versatile Spellstrike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: The versatility is nice, but not always necessary, and the cost is\n\t\tsteep.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"class-feats-20\">20th Level<\/h4>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Supreme Spellstrike<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: Solving the need to recharge your Spellstrike leaves that action open for\n\t\tthings like moving, which goes a long way to address the Magus&#8217;s\n\t\ttightly-constrained action economy.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Whirlwind Spell<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">SoM<\/a><\/sup>: In encounters with multiple enemies, this can be a great way to handle\n\t\tcrowds.

As such, the use of Spellstrike greatly determines both your action economy and your best weapon options. Most importantly: expect to spend most rounds in combat devoting two Actions to a single Spellstrike, and any further attacks are made at the maximum Multiple Attack Penalty, and choose your weaponry around that assumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because making multiple attacks in one turn is such a rarity for the Magus, weapons that make doing so easier or more beneficial are less useful. Weapons with the Agile, Backswing, Forceful, and Swipe properties are less useful than comparable weapons without those traits. Similarly, weapons which need an action to be reloaded will place too much strain on your action economy to justify, so most crossbows and firearms are a poor choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-red\">Bo Staff<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: Tragically, it&#8217;s not a &#8220;Staff&#8221; (which is a specific weapon), so Twisted\n\t\tTree can&#8217;t use this effectively.<\/li>\n\t<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Greatsword \/ Maul<\/span><sup><a href=\"\/p2\/abbreviations\/\">CRB<\/a><\/sup>: A good go-to for Inexorable Iron builds if you don&#8217;t want Reach.
