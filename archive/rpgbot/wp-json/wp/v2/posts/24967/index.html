In game, fifteen years ago, Drakkenheim was destroyed by an eldritch storm of falling stars. Now, the city is a dismal urban wasteland contaminated by otherworldly magic and haunted by hideous monsters. Players can expect to discover fantastic wealth, lost knowledge, and powerful artifacts that lie ready for the taking for adventurers brave or foolish enough to venture into the ruins! Maps, monsters, and more in these offerings will be available for Dungeon Masters to use across D&amp;D Beyond, including full integration in the Maps feature available to subscribers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dungeons of Drakkenheim:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Designed for Characters level 1 to 13<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exploration as your characters embark on dangerous expeditions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interactions with faction leaders and NPC\u2019s specific to the campaign<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fierce battles with predatory beasts, mutated monstrosities and terrifying abominations produced by the mysterious meteor shower<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These two new additions to DnD Beyond are proof positive that Dungeons &amp; Dragons is continuing to invest in talented partners and the inspired creative community surrounding the World\u2019s Greatest Roleplaying Game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s incredibly important to us to showcase the ingenuity of the D&amp;D community, and we\u2019re excited to share the love of fantasy roleplaying with more fans by bringing the Dungeon Dudes and Ghostfire Gaming to D&amp;D Beyond,\u201d said Marjory Laymon, Vice President of D&amp;D Beyond Product and Tech at Wizards of the Coast. \u201cThis is just the first step as we\u2019ve got even more surprises planned for next year as we celebrate the 50<sup>th<\/sup> Anniversary of D&amp;D.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Grim Hollow<\/em> and <em>Drakkenheim<\/em> really are passion projects for Ghostfire and the Dungeon Dudes, respectively, with rich worlds meant to be explored and have stories woven within,\u201d said Ben Byrne, Creative Content Director at Ghostfire Gaming. \u201cThat so many new D&amp;D fans will be introduced to them through D&amp;D Beyond is incredibly humbling.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The locations, maps, and monsters within these offerings will be available to all fans who purchase them to use in their campaigns on D&amp;D Beyond.
