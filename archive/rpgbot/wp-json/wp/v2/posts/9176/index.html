I&#8217;m Randall James, your dungeon master and with me is Georg played by Tyler Kamstra<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi everybody, I&#8217;m replaying Georg my fourth level of Dragonborn Battle Master Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, and we have Amiable Jack played by Random Powell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good evening. Yes. Once again, I am a Satyr Bard. I&#8217;ll be honest, I forgot what college I am. Oh, eloquence. There we go. Talking good. You can tell because I&#8217;m doing that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. No, it&#8217;s It&#8217;s brilliant. It&#8217;s great. Yeah, so we&#8217;re going to do an actual play one shot tonight and we&#8217;re gonna hop right into it. For folks who maybe didn&#8217;t listen last time or it&#8217;s been a while since they&#8217;ve heard it. We did a Halloween one shot with these characters where they&#8217;re adopted father, because they&#8217;re orphaned brothers. That&#8217;s important. Maybe. Their adopted father had died and sent them on a journey to rescue his most prized possession. And it turned out that they were more or less sent to the Village of the Damned in the middle of nowhere. And they saved a bunch of children from the blood war, the eternal battle between demons and devils. And in so doing, they found themselves with a bunch of kids that needed homes and parents and them being orphans themselves, they did have some sympathy. Luckily, there was kind of a maternal figure already embedded within the group. Celia. Celia was the woman that they interacted with. A young woman they interacted with. And so they find themselves on the eve of the winter solstice in their home with these orphans in tow. Celia, Jack, and Georg are sitting by the fire as the snow falls outside the window. All the kids are in bed for the night in honor of the marish tradition. Some say that if you are extra kind, extra helpful on the eve of the winter solstice, that a jolly wise giant will visit you in your sleep and leave treats and toys. The orphans rescued from Port Averna were unfamiliar with this tradition but adapted easily. As Thomas put it: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen weirder.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before bed, Georg and Jack dressed in their adventuring gear to put on a show for the orphans about the great battle for the sun to celebrate the winter solstice, a tradition that dates back to their own youth, when Malikai needed to convince his own sons to go to sleep. Even as adults, you continue the tradition, sometimes hopping into the act alongside Malikai with no one left in the audience to admire the silliness. There was a bit of melancholy this year, performing for the first time without your father. So now you find yourself sitting around a fire with Celia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that was weird. I haven&#8217;t done that in a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to say. I certainly appreciate having a competent set of arms while I do some narration so I&#8217;d say you did good. Thank you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I um&#8230; I I found I found the whole event&#8230; wonderous? Wondrous. I&#8217;m going to use the word wondrous. I thought it was fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It grows on you. The more time you spend here I think you&#8217;ll become both accustomed to and come to enjoy it. It definitely took us a while but Malachi was a character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it gets just a little weirder every year. So you know, good introduction this year. Next year expected to be a little weirder. It&#8217;s going to be great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, yeah. Oh, well, that that sounds quite special than I&#8217;m not trying not to change the subject. But to change the subject quickly. I bought you gifts for the Solstice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh! Thank you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celia approaches each of you and makes a big show pulling out just this giant box and dumping it into the lap of Georg, and then reaches into our cote pocket and pulls out the smallest box like smaller than a tiny purse, then flicks it over to Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. This is unexpected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open them, open them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m already halfway through opening mine. I wasn&#8217;t listening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so get over fines inside the box, a pair of winged boots that are exactly Georg sighs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That explains what she was measuring my feet in my sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not just weird Port Averna tradition, apparently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d notice. But I had no idea how to get them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could have measured my boots<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would have been the fun in that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you&#8217;re gonna fit into this family very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, Jack, have you opened your present yet?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that I&#8217;ll undo the box a bit. peek inside,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see something that you&#8217;ve seen many, many times before. It is a deck of illusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, all right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as you look harder you realize it is not just any deck of illusions. It is a holiday deck of illusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just to give a bit of flavor, so I&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got a table over here. Everybody loves tables. I&#8217;m gonna keep the table my back pocket. But to give you an idea of what&#8217;s there a couple of things: an animated knit sweater and a snow column with a sweet top hat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I can&#8217;t use him to sled down hills at like 60 feet per round, I&#8217;m going to consider myself ripped off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why did you give me the stupid present? And so yeah, you you&#8217;ve been given this these gifts, Celia sits down and starts to sip her brandy issues wont to do, especially this late at night?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14 year olds. Brandy. Alright, good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s yeah, it&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s the holidays, what are you going to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the holidays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of a sudden sylius sits up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is that? Pointing at Amiable Jack&#8217;s chest. What is that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll kind of tug unconsciously at the leather thong or that is tucked down into my shirt. I&#8217;m surprised you noticed this i i haven&#8217;t thought about it in a while. And I&#8217;ll pull it out and you see on the end like where a pendant would be a chunk of bone. Clearly bone, but not really anything like&#8230; it&#8217;s it&#8217;s like cut into a cube basically and then strung through this leather. And on it there&#8217;s a rune and I&#8217;ll sort of play with it a little bit and I&#8217;ll say that&#8217;s a good eye you&#8217;ve got. I couldn&#8217;t really tell you what it is. I know that I was wearing it when I was found and I know that it says &#8220;Jack.&#8221; can&#8217;t tell you how I know that, but that&#8217;s why I&#8230; That&#8217;s why I always took this name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she she approaches you and leans in as if she&#8217;s going to touch it. Do you allow her to touch it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will poorly conceal a start to shrink back and then stop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you do let her touch it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you do. After like just a moment basically makes contact with it and then she pops back and she says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>they&#8217;re they&#8217;re spying on us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She looks each of you in the eye one by one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Celia&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re watching us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just as you&#8217;re trying to comprehend what Celia is saying to you, to each of you, it feels like Celia&#8217;s face is receding. In fact, the entire room is receding around you and suddenly you feel cold. As the world takes shape, you are struck by vertigo and all you find yourself in a forest. It is nighttime, the moon hangs brightly in an impossible crescent almost reaching point to point touching. The woods that surround you are full of evergreens. The canopy sits high with clear visibility to the sky, to the starry night sky and through the forest around you. The forest feels as if it&#8217;s lit by daylight. You notice flowers growing out of the evergreens surrounding you. Each of them is light blue with petals of violet shaped like the crescent moon above<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is a very strangely shaped flower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good eye. I&#8217;m gonna have each of you roll an Arcana check. Random, you can roll with advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, let&#8217;s see how this goes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16 somehow. How?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, that&#8217;s not terrible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s that beats my 14.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, good. Good. So somehow, Georg, you to figure it out. You do not believe that you are on the prime material plane. In fact, you believe that you have found your way into the Feywild.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Jack&#8230; You know, the whole the fairy place thing. The fairy&#8230; land?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just gonna casually point at my lower legs. Yes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just think it&#8217;s neat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. Also, uh, choose a survival or nature. But make me a survival or a nature check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will do you survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m equally bad. Oh, wait, no, I&#8217;m&#8230; okay, fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m bad. All these things. But I&#8217;m worse than one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, well, you notice that the air isn&#8217;t that cold and you think that you&#8217;re going to be fine in your current clothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, yeah. Okay, I assume we&#8217;re just wearing like pajamas or whatever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, luckily, almost as if somebody had the forethought for it. You were dressed in your adventuring gear for the show that you put on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, cool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s almost like I didn&#8217;t want to deal with that plot hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, I put on I put my Solstice cap on top of my full plate helmet. And, I don&#8217;t know if you know what a solstice cap looks like, but it&#8217;s got a white fuzzy brim, and it&#8217;s kind of red and conical. And then there&#8217;s a white poof ball on the end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s pretty novel. Because there&#8217;s no real ,there&#8217;s no real world hat like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I think you&#8217;ve you&#8217;ve created something wonderful and I think we should all wear them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll just try and&#8230; I mean, I I know that Derrick has told me that we&#8217;re in the Feywild. But I&#8217;ll try and just gather my senses. See, like, where we are. Is there anything that immediately makes sense? That&#8217;s maybe a place where I can find out what the heck just happened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so, so something you do notice as you&#8217;re still gathering your wits about you. The snow is actually fairly high, but you&#8217;re in a, almost like a trough. Like you&#8217;re you&#8217;re in a valley in the snow that is a little bit wider than your own person. And as you look harder you don&#8217;t notice, let&#8217;s say, any footprints or anything like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll also for for those playing at home. I know. So I know Jack has a passive perception of what like a 17?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15 but yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15. Okay, yeah, he notices these things. That&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;re we&#8217;re in a low area and the snow snows piled up around us, but there&#8217;s no footprints, which means&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s it&#8217;s clearly like a path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, but it snowed since the last group of people came through most likely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, maybe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I conveniently have these cool boots that let me fly. So I could just like pop up and look around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I&#8217;m into that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Georg, having never flown before. Randall. How do these boots of flight carry me aloft? Is it a, like, I stand up right and just kind of like move upright situation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please say they drag you buy ankles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll accept it. Yeah, I&#8217;m, like, just upside down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I forget what movie it is. But there&#8217;s some movie, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s, like, Pauly Shore hanging upside down by boots in a doorway trying to do like inverted situp, but he can&#8217;t. That&#8217;s what you look like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so the boots obey the command. They go up. You&#8217;re&#8230; you know, the world is inverted. Other than that, I think things are fine. Let&#8217;s say you go 10 foot up. 20 foot up. 30 foot up. You see along the path that you are eyeing something that you have never seen before. You see what you can only imagine to be the largest snail that has ever existed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s definitely not what I was expecting you to say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And unfortunately for that snail, there appears to be some creature attacking it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, what&#8217;s what does the creature attacking it look like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you look. It&#8217;s cat-like, but it&#8217;s quite large. It&#8217;s has sleek. Solid. You can&#8217;t quite place it. Is it like a black fur or like a bluish fur? It&#8217;s almost if it&#8217;s like scintillating in front of you. It&#8217;s hard to really hard to pin down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Is Celia with us?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, okay, good. We didn&#8217;t drag a we didn&#8217;t drag a literal child to the Feywild by accident. Okay, that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, that&#8217;s the Feywild&#8217;s job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll flying boot back down to Jack and just hang upside down at eye level. There&#8217;s a snail fighting a giant cat over there.

And it&#8217;s actually that which is attacking the snail which is, and you hear this just clack clack clack. You also notice that the snail has retracted into its shell. And so you can&#8217;t quite see any of the soft body of the snail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s just like beating on the shell?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And how is that working out for it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me check.

Man. I don&#8217;t make this up. And I&#8217;m going to pluck a little melody, as I say, &#8220;Now now. Be in a cage.&#8221; And I&#8217;m going to cast phantasmal force at the cat. So the Doss Loot, since I am using it as part of the verbal or somatic components to cast a&#8230; oh, that&#8217;s only for charm. Well, it still sounds neat. Anyway, basically, I&#8217;m going to ask it for an intelligence save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so to do an intelligent save, I&#8217;m going to roll and then use my modifier. Okay, that&#8217;s not bad. 14.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is unfortunately, the DC for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think at that point,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>is it half-caged?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see. So I create an illusion&#8230; why did I use this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What a great question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a failed save, blah. So, yeah, like it sees like a cage shimmer into place around it for a second. And then when it realizes, Hey, that&#8217;s not real, then the illusion dissipates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing happens. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hearing. Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, nothing happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. Cool. Cool. And just to nail it down. So the phantasmal force, the idea of it is that you you bring this illusion to life. And then not only does, whatever, not only does the creature have to honor the illusion, but you can also use natural mechanisms of the illusion to deal psychic damage to the creature. Right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correct. Yeah. So basically, I was going to craft a cage, and then if it proved that it was going to be resistant to negotiation, then I was going to say, &#8220;ah, that&#8217;s weird. This metal cage is suddenly getting hot.&#8221; And it was just going to take psychic damage every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that sounds&#8230; Yeah. That sounds terrible. And also effective. Unfortunately, this cat is smarter than it looks. Okay. Uh, Georg, what are you gonna do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it noticed us yet?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It certainly noticed me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me rephrase. Would you describe it as &#8220;surprised&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m gonna throw net anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. So he said, we&#8217;re about 20 feet away. So I&#8217;ll walk like five feet closer and then throw a net at it. I&#8217;m gonna have disadvantage no matter what. I might as well go long. Oh, that went&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s 17 on the first die and nine on the second. So that&#8217;s probably not going to go great. Let&#8217;s see. So plus three, so 12. That&#8217;s almost certainly not going to do it. So I&#8217;m going to use one of my combat maneuvers. I&#8217;m going to use precision&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of which he knows many.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>of which I know many! I&#8217;m going to use precision attack and I&#8217;m going to roll a d8 and add that to my attack. Okay, seven. Nice. So 19 to hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. The cat is now restrained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oof. Okay, so you have tossed a new and restrained to the cat?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. What does&#8211; Oh, go ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I&#8217;ll pull out a hammer and walk up next to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m imagining it exactly like that, that you literally just hammer comes out slow stroll. Okay, cool. So it is now the cat&#8217;s turn. And I think, given the players that we have here, I think that they have figured out they are facing a displcer beast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m seeing nods. Yeah, okay. All right. So, luckily you were already rolling with disadvantage. So how does my cats become not restrained?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let me double check. Okay, a large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless or creatures that are huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on the success, dealing five slashing damage to the net, which has AC 10, also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. So basically, it has to waste its turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, well, let&#8217;s see how that goes. He is not going to attack the net. He&#8217;s simply going to try to free himself. Alright? And a 13 meets the check?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So, out of the net. And also very angry to be near you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That feels right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack, it&#8217;s back to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Superb. Given that he seems to be unwilling to participate in my shenanigans. I&#8217;m going to strum a little quick, like, won&#8217;t want and say, &#8220;Wow, you just spent your whole thing getting rid of a four silver net. I&#8217;m so proud of you.&#8221; And I&#8217;m going to ask him for wisdom save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. Doo doo doo doo doo. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s wise. How does an 8&#8230; How does an 8 do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that&#8217;s not a 14.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, step one, is you&#8217;re going to take the three psychic damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, now this display series has avoidance. So it&#8217;s subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw, it takes only half damage, and no damage on success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that cover every save? Is that how it works?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to show you text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. I mean, if that&#8217;s the way it works, subjected to an effect allows it&#8230; Okay, so this was not an effect that allows it to make a save for half.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically this is to cover for previous editions evasion, which I think has also made it into fifth edition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just just differently than&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>okay,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No longer a core rule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have taken half damage had it succeeded, it actually would have taken no damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correct. And so it does not get to evasion Vicious mockery, which is what has happened to it. Okay, and so it will then also have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so three damage you said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three damage.

Yeah, I&#8217;m I&#8217;m gonna hammer it again. 18 and 16.

All right now it is the displacer beast&#8217;s return. The Displacer Beast has had enough attempting to tentacle Georg, having had what basically is no success and is going to run and attempt to attack Amiable Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, stop, don&#8217;t?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So I think&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can I have an opportunity to act as runs away from me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely, you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>cool and I imagine this one will still be a disadvantage. Well, I started with a 3, so I&#8217;m just gonna call it there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. That went worse for you than I thought that it would. And now Jack, you find yourself with a a large cat. A little here, a little there. And&#8230; ooh, good roll. Does a 9 hit you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it astonishingly doesn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Once again reaches around with another tentacle. Does a 16 hit you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That one will connect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. All right. Let&#8217;s roll. All right, you&#8217;ll take six bludgeoning damage and two piercing damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sure will. For a total of eight. Damage tracked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Jack, it is back to you. There is a cat in your metaphorical face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a cat in my character&#8217;s literal face. So I am suddenly much less okay with this. This time as you hear the the lute strum it feels just a little richer. It feels like it&#8217;s almost like honey in his words, as he says, &#8220;no, no, no. You&#8217;re standing on a forever pit.&#8221; So I&#8217;m going to use Cutting Words as a bonus action to use one of my inspirations. You roll a d6 and subtract it from the next save you make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ooh, great. So, subtract five from an intelligence save please.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Okay, great news. Great news. I&#8217;ll go until you the intelligence modifier is a -2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh huh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rolled a 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh! Wow!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then minus five, minus six, something like this. Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it sure does. I mean, I think that wraps around and just kills it it outright.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integer overflow!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Yeah, the short answer is, uh, he is going to believe that he is encased in a&#8230; it can only affect a 10 foot cube, but he&#8217;s gonna believe that he is encased in a 10 foot cube basically, like, hand reached up from the ground and like, pulled him into the earth and he&#8217;s now trapped in the earth and being crushed by it. So it says it because there&#8217;s a ton of text for this spell. I&#8217;m not going to try and read the whole thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You haven&#8217;t explicitly said What spell you&#8217;re casting. I assume this is, again&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, it&#8217;s the same one. Yeah, phantasmal force. The phantasm includes sound temperature and other stimuli also only evident to the creature. Basically, it treats the phantasm as if it were real, it real it rationalizes any illogical outcomes are interacting with the phantasm. For example, a creature attempting to walk onto a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If it survive, the fall it still believes the bridge is there and just, like, it messed up and stepped wrong or something. Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. I do want to stop for a second. I love this spell because I&#8217;m reading it and it it reads as if, as the DM I really should honor this effective grapple that you have imagined.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping and you would therefore say yes, restrained and I&#8217;m going to casually back away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Yeah, I know. I&#8217;m gonna take it we&#8217;re going to do we&#8217;re going to do this later on. I&#8217;m going to look this up to see if anybody smarter than I am has, uh, has ruled on this. But yeah, it reads is it basically the creature is supposed to completely interpret what you&#8217;ve described as real. What you have described feels in bounds of the spell. So let&#8217;s party on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I take the 1d6 psychic damage this turn? Or does that start on my turn?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each round on your turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On my turn, so it&#8217;s going to take 2. 2 points of psychic damage. As it, you know, the illusory fist squeezes and yeah, then I will back away and say, Alright, Georg it&#8217;s confused. Go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I hit it? Do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I certainly hope so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like we should have talked about this one beforehand. I&#8217;m just gonna hit it with this hammer and hope it&#8217;s fine. Can it still like see me, or am I&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s it&#8230; Pretend that it&#8217;s like earth fisted. Because that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s experiencing. So you know, grappled by a hand made of the ground and pinned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so is it restrained? Like&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s saying<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m fishing for ways to get advantage, basically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s what Randall&#8217;s giving me is restrained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to give restrained, but I&#8217;m actually going to say not with advantage. We&#8217;re just going to call it an even roll. Because it would have advantage due to the restrained, because of the displacer it would have had disadvantage. Call it even and we&#8217;ll have a roll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. All right. Straight roll. Let&#8217;s do it. Well, 8. Total.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. 18 you said?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8. Eeeeiiigght.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh! Okay. Do you? You don&#8217;t have a maneuver for this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it feels silly using it at this point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, It doesn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t.

Alright, come on, hit it like you mean it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. We&#8217;ll use precision attack and I roll a d8. I got a 2, so it&#8217;s a 10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. That was a bad idea.

So you do have a way to break out of this spell. You don&#8217;t get to retry the save. You have to make an intelligence (investigation) check against my spell DC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And your DC was 14. You said it starts with a minus two, as I&#8217;ve already given up the ghost on. There&#8217;s a, I do want to say there&#8217;s a little bit interesting about this spell that the creature is supposed to honor it completely and believe and even rationalize irrational things that are happening due to the spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also has the wherewithal to be like&#8230; Yeah, okay.

I will deal with a another six points of psychic damage. And then I will say &#8220;you can&#8217;t even tell what&#8217;s real and what&#8217;s not.

Yeah, let&#8217;s find one of my d6&#8217;s, which, fun fact: if you have, if you have superiority dice from the fighting style superior technique, and from the Martial Sdept, they&#8217;re not always as big as your regular dice. So I&#8217;m just going to use one of my d6&#8217;s. Roll that. Technically, you don&#8217;t even have to roll it just makes a wisdom save DC 12.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. It fails. Whatever, whatever the DC was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s excellent. And apparently I do actually have to roll it because it gets added to the damage. So five more damage. Total of 13.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, this cat&#8217;s looking real bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also scared.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also scared.

And the snail is once again going to basically just you know shell slam. And that is a hit. OK, you have no idea how close we are to me saying &#8220;what does it look like when a snail kills your enemy?&#8221; But anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack, your turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I would love for it to be my turn.

Because it is afraid of Georg and it can see Georg it has disadvantage on skill checks. Like the investigation check it has to make to break out of my spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, that was the one where it also had a penalty to roll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so you&#8217;re trying to hit a DC 14 with disadvantage with a minus two to your roll.

So you&#8217;re saying it looks pretty badly beat up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>it is having the worst day of its life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Superb. In that case, I&#8217;m gonna switch from the kind of aggressive melody that I&#8217;ve been playing on the lute, and just do like a few real light picks. Kind of trailing off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it sound like my cat has fleas?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly. Well, no what it what it sounds like is I&#8217;m going to find a way to place a 20 foot circle, so that it only covers the cat. Because we&#8217;re theater of the mind right now, I&#8217;m just gonna have to pretend that I, you know, can can make that work. I am going to roll my d8 five times<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we nuking the cat?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m putting it to sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. 10. 13. 21!

You&#8217;re casting sleep and what gives you the right to roll 5d8 and some of the stuff?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is the description of it. This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, and what level spells that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A first level spell. If you upcast it, you get to do two additional d8 per level. And sleep doesn&#8217;t have a safe because basically it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s sort of a save-or-suck on its own. Because if you hit the hit point total, things fall asleep. If you don&#8217;t hit the hit point total, your spell doesn&#8217;t do anything yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing happens. It&#8217;s like power word kill, but kinder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But level one. Yeah, it&#8217;s great. Okay, so yeah, so I strum a little melody. And when I see that the cat has stopped thrashing against the invisible hand. I will release concentration on that invisible hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, you do it and the cat is asleep. How long will it be asleep for ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A minute. Okay. Bold move. You do that and as you do it, to halflings hop out of the tree near where the snail was previously being beaten.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m surprised I didn&#8217;t see you earlier.

And it&#8217;s like really attending to this nail. The other looks at the crystal ball in his hand and looks up at you folks and looks back at the crystal ball. And it looks up at you folks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8230; it worked! It worked!

And now&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, first off, I introduced myself, Who am I speaking to?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s a great question. I&#8217;m Grandpa Notoni. And this is my good friend, Bush de Noelle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.

It&#8217;s delicious. We have a couple that we hang out with who are Italian. They promised me&#8230; Okay, so let me take a step back. We&#8217;re gonna do this live. In a pantone contest in Italy, there&#8217;s a company that took second place in the panatone contest, which is pretty good I would say. They have committed. They&#8217;re going to Italy next week.

We we watch the special children to keep our lists updated on who&#8217;s naughty and who&#8217;s nice.

He probably needs to talk to you, I think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Klaus. Yes, this this sounds fascinating. Also.

Have you ever listened to YMCA?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if I allow myself to be taken along and called &#8220;young man.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do you, do you go through the gates do you enter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. Wonderful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re pretty quickly brought into halls. You see various automatons. You see glass baubles, wooden baubles, bone baubles. Wooden toys, lining shelves. Grandpa Notoni notices you eyeing these things. Halflings seem to be running in all directions, like, putting down toys, replacing toys along the walls, but you kind of have this general impression that despite all the effort being expended, there really isn&#8217;t a lot of work actually happening. It&#8217;s just chaos. Grandpa leans in, he says,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time, time passes differently here. We usually get the toys out to the children over the next two weeks. Once we talked to Klaus, I expect we&#8217;ll be able to get right on with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great. Do we get to, do we get to be Klaus now? Like, right now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can we do it now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s there&#8217;s a meeting. There&#8217;s a meeting in the meeting room where we have our meetings and we&#8217;re gonna go to the meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to meeting Klaus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we will meet in the meeting room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So he brings you into a room and you notice there&#8217;s lots and lots of halflings. Like, a sea of halflings in front of you and you&#8217;re kind of trapped at the back. There&#8217;s a, what appears to be a meeting table at the center of it in the meeting room. A halfling stands on top of the table addressing the others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s have a well timed recap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were attacked. They appeared to be coming for the Looking Glasses, perhaps for nefarious purposes. Perhaps because they too have a love and a passion for making kids happy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You hear someone call from the back &#8220;and bludgeoning damage!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes of course, bludgeoning. Klaus managed to feed one of the displacer beasts a cornish hen stuffed with a target. He gave instructions before he pursued that if he wasn&#8217;t back in an hour to wait another 30 minutes. But then if he wasn&#8217;t back in 30 minutes, maybe you give them a few more. Well, team, it&#8217;s been a bit over an hour and a half and Klaus has not returned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you hear somebody call from the back &#8220;what are we gonna do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m not in charge. I was just the one standing on this table. When you all came in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire room goes into a panic, like these halflings are just like literally like, they turn one direction they bump the one they turn the other direction they bump it on the other just&#8230;. it&#8217;s terrible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, okay, I&#8217;m going to use one of my maneuvers. This, this is gonna sound surprising for people who haven&#8217;t spent enough time reading Tasha&#8217;s, but I&#8217;m going to use commanding presence, which lets me add a maneuver die to a charisma intimidation performance or persuasion check. I&#8217;m going to use intimidation. So I&#8217;m going to roll a d20 plus a d8. So I got a an 18 to intimidate. I just jump up on the table and just just shout &#8220;AH. QUIET.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of them. Absolutely quiet. Just everybody is staring at you now. And you hear a quiet voice in the back. &#8220;I love those guys.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will jump up next to Georg. Please excuse my brother&#8217;s methods. Although I will have to admit that this time they were quite effective. You seem to have lost your Klaus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>my name is Jack. This is my brother Georg. We will track him down. If you point us in the direction we will return your giant to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. So there&#8217;s kind of like a rustling is the only way I could describe it but kind of a Red Sea parts and a particular halfling comes up holding a crystal ball. And he says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>okay, we know that klaus followed the target. So all you have to do is just, uh, well, you&#8217;ll you&#8217;ll look into the crystal ball and then kind of, kind of lean in. You know? Just lean into it. And then you&#8217;ll figure the rest out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we have time for a short rest real quick?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, yeah. Hey, let&#8217;s uh, let&#8217;s get them a good meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, cornish game hymns come in front of you. Pickled pears because people were into that for some reason. There&#8217;s an entire dish of yams covered with sugar covered with marshmallows. Nobody knows why this counts as a vegetable, but it does. And so that&#8217;s in front of you. There&#8217;s there&#8217;s like a jello marshmallow paste, which again, is part of the main meal and nobody really unserstands why all these things are made available to you. Also a pheasant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, this is great. I&#8217;ve been abusing the food rules and haven&#8217;t eaten in several weeks. I&#8217;m gonna reset the timer now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good news. Okay, so you folks successfully take a short rest. During a short rest, do you, do you engage at all? Is there anything you want to know more about?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just I ask dumb questions about Klaus. Just the dumbest questions. How tall is he? How does he fit down chimneys if he&#8217;s so tall?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, he&#8217;s he&#8217;s he&#8217;s tall like you&#8217;re tall. But maybe taller. I don&#8217;t know. You all, y&#8217;all look really tall to me. That that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m&#8230; What&#8217;s this business about chimneys? We already explained to you. We use the crystal balls and boop! Because, Oh, so maybe this is important. So the crystal ball, like, we can watch all the time, right? All the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s weird, but cool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what we can only we can only visit on winter solstice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the reason we bring the presents, because like we accumulate all this time we&#8217;re like, okay, you&#8217;re doing good. You&#8217;re doing good. And luckily, because I mean ever, you know, the Fey&#8230; in the Fey, the time. Time&#8217;s weird, right? Time&#8217;s really strange compared to the material plane. So sure, it&#8217;s a night there. But we can actually, we can basically cover the entire plane in two weeks, we got enough, you know, halfling power here. We can we can totally take care of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now how is it that you, you managed to turn that around and bring us here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a that&#8217;s that&#8217;s a good question. There was a risk was a lot of risk. There was a lot of risk for you. And we&#8217;re glad you&#8217;re here. We really are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That person having answered the question just kind of flees the room. Leaves? Yeah, perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So reassured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. After after a little bit when there&#8217;s kind of a lull. We&#8217;ve eaten whatever, I&#8217;ll just start kind of idly playing with the the bone charm on my neck and pull it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, it&#8217;s Hey, it&#8217;s your target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My what<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your target. No, that&#8217;s&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;so at this point. Grandpa&#8217;s doing you and grandpa starts like digging through the satchel they took off the snail. Finds a particular crystal ball. And when you look in the crystal ball, you get this like eerie vertigo feeling because you&#8217;re actually looking from the thing around your neck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait. I have very Spaceballs moments, looking at the monitor looking over my shoulder. Looking at the thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When is now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon. But I&#8217;ll just like just turn and look at grandpa. This is how you watch this? This is my name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, no, absolutely. Klaus and the Mistress, especially they love to stare at you. I don&#8217;t know. I mean, it just so happens so you&#8217;ve done a lot of really cool stuff. So at this point, it&#8217;s kind of become a thing. We enjoy. We like to, we&#8230; Jack, we know a lot about you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You described Klaus and the mistress as giants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, the mistress isn&#8217;t a giant. Klaus is a giant. But, you know, I say best not to dwell on it. I am measuring time and I feel like you&#8217;re pretty well short rested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, let Yes, let&#8217;s let&#8217;s track down Klaus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfling 1&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. All right, I gotta go bye!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then at this point, grandpa&#8217;s like fleeing the room. I don&#8217;t want to answer uncomfortable questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll just sort of like distractedly pass the first orb we got over to Georg. Brother, you you need to pull that one out so that you can fall in and then we can<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. Oh, the first one. I was thinking the second one that was watching us. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I&#8217;ll hold it up and look into it very intently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, put a hand on a shoulder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roll me and arcana check, Georg the Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no. 6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re staring into it and you you tried to do is described to you of, like, falling into it. And you basically just go like *thump* crystal ball against&#8230; Okay, I&#8217;m gonna suggest that you hand it to your brother and let&#8217;s see how this goes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feels right. Very on brand for Georg<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of these days we&#8217;ll teach you something. And I&#8217;ll look at it. Get a, I mean, does it like can I see a being on the other side of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see snow and you see bits of something but it&#8217;s kind of hard. It&#8217;s almost like a cloak has been shredded across the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll concentrate real hard on that cloak. Try and, like, do what I remember cold fabric to feel like and try and fall into it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roll me that are Arcana check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m only very slightly better than Georg at arcana. I am very convincing and not very smart. But&#8230; 12?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you managed to fall through, and I&#8217;m going to hold for a minute. I&#8217;m not going to describe what you experience. The crystal ball, like, Looney Tunes it for a second. Just kind of hangs in the air for a moment. Georg it what do you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, like, cartoon style, try and dive into it like a pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, brilliant. Well, it&#8217;s floating in midair. Nothing could go wrong here. I am going to let you roll an Arcana check with advantage. Okay, because you&#8217;ve just seen that thing successful used<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16 and 15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. That&#8217;s great. Okay, so your your Scooby Doo dive totally pays off. You basically swan dive into it, and you land prone in the snow. So let me describe to you what you see. You feel the same receding feeling that you felt as you were pulled into the Feywild, you find yourself once again in the snow outside with the same moon hovering overhead. You&#8217;re surrounded by what you suspect maybe bits of Displacer Beast. The light next to you has an eerie reflection. Not of the moon ann the stars, but of a bright sun and puffy white clouds hanging in a perfect blue sky. You hear a voice from behind you. Hey, can one of you twos come untie me? I ain&#8217;t got no opposable thumbs. It makes the ropes real hard. Your turn around to see a reindeer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What an adventure we&#8217;ve been on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You notice it seems quite larger than any reindeer you&#8217;ve ever seen. It stands at least eight foot tall at the head. But its most remarkable feature is its bright nose casting light for at least 30 feet in every direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just marvel at it for slightly too long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to start walking over. As I do, are there multiple sets of ropes binding it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s it&#8217;s like one rope wrapped around the neck. But also the head. Actually, I&#8217;m going to ask for a couple of things, right quick. I am going to ask for a perception check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh boy, I&#8217;m gonna fall back to my passive of 15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also gonna fall back to his passive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Okay, cool. The other thing that I&#8217;m going to ask for is I am going to ask for a insight check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.

Is no longer tied and begins to trot towards the the sleigh. Right as as the reindeer approaches the sleigh, the facade of a reindeer disappears. And you see a green woman like figure, do like a standing handspring into the back of the sled, and then yell, &#8220;Yah! Yah!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything pulling the sled?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From your initial standpoint, you couldn&#8217;t tell. But all of a sudden, you see a pack of reindeer take to the air with a sled following behind it. Now the reindeer are in flight. And the sled is in flight. And the Green Lady is also in flight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, crud. Okay, I&#8217;m going to think quickly I&#8217;m going to switch on my winged boots.

And then just drop Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another happy landing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.

What do you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will pull out my rapier and just kind of skillfully do a few quick cuts through the cloth to uncover its face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bright red nose. 30 foot of light.

But I think you follow me. So I think I think you&#8217;re gonna be able to close just fine. Jack, you&#8217;re you&#8217;re on the back of this reindeer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s go and cut to the chase.

And so then just to be clear, we&#8217;re gonna keep the initiative order as we have it. We&#8217;re starting at 120 foot out. The travel speed per turn is 15 for the sled, I think eg if you have 30, I&#8217;m going to tell you that you&#8217;re into your has 30. And then I think you&#8217;re flying.

And I&#8217;m going to strum something that&#8217;s just really kind of really enchanting. A really soothing, pleasant sound. I&#8217;m going to call up another bit of inspiration for cutting words. And I&#8217;m going to cast crown of madness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Targeting the hag. So, first off, this does inflict the charmed condition, so she&#8217;s going to roll it disadvantage. She&#8217;s also going to roll that d6 and subtract it from her save. So would you kindly make a wisdom save under the conditions I just described?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, wait, why does she roll with disadvantage?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a capacity of the Doss Loot.

This effect only applies if the spell has a somatic or material component, which in this case, crown of madness, I&#8217;m reasonably certain has a somatic. Yep, it sure does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. All right. So roll with disadvantage, and then also roll a d6 and take that off. Okay, exactly. So let&#8217;s do the d6 first, because I feel like that sets the tone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agreed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rolled a five.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a big number, but in this case, it&#8217;s actually worse.

I have a brief moment where I realize, hm, if I had been riding on the Mount, I could have climbed off the mount still at half my move speed and then use dash and gotten really close to the the sleigh because that&#8217;s how movement and mounted combat work. But I wasn&#8217;t thinking that far ahead, so I&#8217;m just gonna dash and get 60 feet closer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, Rudel turns his head back toward you is like Yeah, but you feel like a real idiot now, huh?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just give him a look.

And I&#8217;m gonna pick a number, I&#8217;m gonna say that this whole slide has like 20 health. Okay.

So I&#8217;m actually going to use my action to do unsettling words, which is normally a bonus action, but it&#8217;s, you know, I&#8217;m using it this.

So what&#8217;s fall damage per&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>d10? d6 per 10 feet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s 15d6. We&#8217;re gonna go to the Google roll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least that&#8217;s what it was in 3.x. If they&#8217;ve changed it for fifth, I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s d10s. Now. Oh, no.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s d6&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, something else was d10&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the DM screen, it suggests like environmental damage and it suggested something is deadly. It&#8217;s like 3d10. But yeah, so 15d6. There we go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. 15d6. I have rolled it. I have applied it. Let&#8217;s describe the situation that we&#8217;re in. Klaus is in the open back of the sled. The reindeer are flying forward. Now that you&#8217;re closer, you can see the Klaus is kind of all tied up. The hag fell 150 feet through the air to the ground. But you now have Rudolph and Dancer and Prancer and Blitsen. You have Klaus!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see me just like concentrate on her for a second and pull. And then as she falls, I turn and say to Klaus, I apologize for your sleigh. But let&#8217;s get you home, sir.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Klaus notices who it is that has just done the rescuing and you kind of hear an under the breath, like, &#8220;I love these guys.&#8221; And yeah, do you do you help untie Klaus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. Oh, I guess I do. I mean, I&#8217;m out of action, but I have enough movement that I can. Oh, actually, you know what? So Rudolph has enough movement left to get me to the sleigh and then I can use my half of my movement to dismount into the sleigh. Now, I can&#8217;t do anything else as far as like starting to untie him, but I&#8217;ll certainly like, I will show my intent to undo his rope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. All right, well, here&#8217;s what I say. Let&#8217;s actually, for the moment, we&#8217;re gonna exit combat. Superb. You notice once you&#8217;re in the sled, that in the front row of the sled, there is another type of creature. It&#8217;s a satyr. Your presumption is that this is the mistress that everyone keeps talking about. And, you know, she sits up and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, Jack! thanks.&#8221; So do you&#8230; is the goal now you&#8217;re gonna guide everybody back to the workshop?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you say back to the workshop and all the reindeer know what&#8217;s up, like, Rudolph iss like, Alright, let me get up front. Let&#8217;s make this thing happen. And you ultimately are able to return to Klaus&#8217;s workshop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the hag was never seen again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>150 feet of fall damage will do that to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna go and do a spoiler. Actually, the 150 feet of fall damage did not kill the hag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Called it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlighting yet another bizarre fallacy of dungeons of dragons. Like, yes, a fall from terminal velocity just won&#8217;t kill&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you made an article at some point doing the math and it&#8217;s, like, an eighth level adventure on average will survive a terminal velocity fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, although in this case, right, like, she fell into soft snow. So there&#8217;s something for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the trees with a pretty flowers broker fall so that&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So yeah, to maybe to put a bow on this little adventure. You arrive back at the workshop, and Klaus says immediately it&#8217;s like, okay, problem solved. We got rid of her. What you learn is that hags are famously carnivorous, and the hag thought that magical balls that could bring you to food on the winter solstice would be a great thing to have in her possession. And so her and her displacer neast broke into the workshop and tried to steal them. And luckily, in the collected actions of everyone you&#8217;ve managed to foil this, yet again proving that the village people truly are heroes. You get to go with Klaus on his sleigh to deliver presents to all the good boys and girls. Also, bludgeoning damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georg particularly enjoys that part.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You you in particular got to go to your own orphanage, and mixed bag there. Some presents, some not. At one point when when you happen to be pummeling one of the little bad children, Thomas peeks his head up and looks, looks at the three of you, the Goliath Klaus, Georg, and Jack and immediately pretends to go back to sleep and having seen nothing. Because he knows what&#8217;s what. You go back and at the end of it all, you&#8217;ve covered the entire world delivering some amount of joy everywhere. Throughout throughout the plane. And finally, you get to talk and sit with the satyr mistress. And&#8230; I think that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re gonna end it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, perfect cliffhanger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beautiful. Perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. All right, what&#8217;d you think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s a good place to leave it for a long hiatus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, that was a ton of fun, thank you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am of course kidding about the hiatus. Don&#8217;t do that to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which we&#8217;re gonna wait. You know, I think what&#8217;s the next holiday that we have coming up with any real meaning? uh&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Year&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, yeah. I&#8217;m kidding. I make that joke on Twitter every year. Like, like, the&#8230; New Year&#8217;s Eve. I say, &#8220;Well, folks, I&#8217;m taking the rest of the year off to spend time with my family.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one gets it. It&#8217;s never funny.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They get it. They just agree with the latter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, way to, yeah, way to solve that combat. Like, a little bit behind the scenes. We did want to keep this to a reasonable time. And I think we&#8217;ve already kind of punched it. I&#8217;m looking at Producer Dan. Producer Dan has a face. I love you, producer Dan, and we thank you. I was like the first combat took long enough that when we got to the second combat, I&#8217;m like, Oh, God, this is gonna take forever. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Way to use your surroundings to your advantage. In particular, gravity. Who knew?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravity. I, like, honestly, I mean, if you&#8217;ve if you&#8217;ve read my Artificer handbook, the armor Artificer handbook. I talk about telekinetic because honestly, it&#8217;s just, like, if you are a caster, it is one of the best feats that exists. It&#8217;s so good did it like even if it didn&#8217;t have bonus action push or pull whenever you wanted to, which is brilliant and good all the time. It also just gives you mage hand. Or if you already have mage hand, gives you 30 more feet of mage hand, which is the only feat that does anything like that. And also you&#8217;re mage hand&#8217;s invisible, because you&#8217;re telekinetic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice. Nice. Hey, go. Alright,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that hadn&#8217;t worked I was just going to shove her out of the the wagon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;d be a great way to solve it.
