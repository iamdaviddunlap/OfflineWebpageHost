Building a party around a single class presents unique challenges often due individual classes\u2019 limited capabilities. DnD is fundamentally a game about a party of diverse characters pooling their abilities to become more than the sum of their parts.

A single-class party will require the Sorcerer to really stretch their muscles and look for options which they might typically overlook.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-rules\">The Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No multiclassing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>4 party members<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Must attempt to cover all <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/party-composition\/\">party roles<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-allsorcerer-party\">Strengths and Weaknesses of the All-Sorcerer Party<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With full spellcasting and a fairly large spell list, the Sorcerer can do a lot with magic. Their high Charisma makes them great Faces, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with d6 hit dice and no armor, they\u2019re incredibly frail. Sorcerers also know fewer spells than other classes, which strictly limits their ability to diversify their spell lists in order to cover multiple roles.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-party\">The Party<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-1-divine-soul-sorcerer\">Member 1: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/divine-soul\/\">Divine Soul Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The only Sorcerer with access to healing spells, Divine Soul Sorcerer is an essential addition to the party. The Cleric\u2019s spell list also adds a ton of great Support options, so we\u2019ll make this our Healer and Support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll still have room for other spells, of course. We\u2019re not going to make this a boring healbot because no one enjoys a healbot.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-2-shadow-magic-sorcerer\">Member 2: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/shadow-magic\/\">Shadow Magic Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With exceptionally good Darkvision, the ability to cast Darkness at a discount, and the ability to summon a bunch of hounds, Shadow Magic offers some great stuff. We\u2019ll make this our Scout to capitalize on their ability to move around in the dark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could also make this our Defender, choosing to focus most of their spellcasting on summoning creatures since we\u2019re already summoning hounds. However, the Disadvantage on saves imposed by Hound of Ill Omen makes it much more effective to focus on save-or-suck spells, making this our Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-3-draconic-bloodline-sorcerer\">Member 3: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/draconic-bloodline\/\">Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Elemental Affinity adds a modest, but consistent boost to damage spells which makes this a natural choice for our Blaster. Draconic Resilience also makes our Draconic Sorcerer unusually durable. Coupled with a race like the Dwarf which further improves their durability, we could make this our Defender by throwing them in front of the rest of the party at low levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as they become an option, we\u2019ll start relying on summoning spells. Summoning a creature (or a crowd of them) to stand between us and our enemies is very effective, and, since Fireball doesn\u2019t care about Concentration, it pairs nicely with our Blaster tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-4-aberrant-mind-sorcerer\">Member 4: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/sorcerer\/subclasses\/aberrant-mind\/\">Aberrant Mind Sorcerer<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With free spells known from their subclass, the Aberrant Mind Sorcerer has a huge advantage over the rest of the team. This leaves us lots of room in our spell list, especially since Aberrant Mind offers some great Controller options like Hunger of Hadar and Utility options like Telekinesis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since their spellcasting is also both the easiest and the most flexible, we\u2019ll also make this our Scholar. A small investment in Intelligence and the right background and\/or race, and we\u2019re in good shape.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-report-card\">The Report Card<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Role<\/th><th>Member(s)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Blaster<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Controller<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Defender<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Face<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Healer<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scholar<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scout<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Striker<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Support<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Utility Caster<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-strength\">Biggest Strength<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With four full spellcasters, our offensive spellcasting is brutally effective.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-weakness\">Biggest Weakness<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Creatures resistant to magic, antimagic fields, and anything good at breaking Concentration will present a huge problem for us. We\u2019re also limited by our spells known, so anything that we don\u2019t have a spell to solve may be functionally unsolvable.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This party is going to fall somewhere between \u201cWe can\u2019t <em>all<\/em> have Fireball. One of us is going to have to change.\u201d and \u201cWait, but I thought <em>you<\/em> were going to be proficient in Persuasions!\u201d Those mixups will either be a hilarious running gag, or they\u2019ll absolutely wreck the campaign. I honestly can\u2019t tell which.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction We\u2019re taking a look at building single-class parties.
