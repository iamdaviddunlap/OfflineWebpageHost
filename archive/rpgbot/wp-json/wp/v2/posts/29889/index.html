These changes have also introduced interesting balance changes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"we-havent-seen-the-monster-manual\">We Haven\u2019t Seen the Monster Manual<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We have not yet seen the changes to monsters. We know that WotC wants creatures above CR 20 to be much more powerful than in the 2014 rules, but they haven\u2019t said anything about other creatures other than that everything got reexamined to make sure that it matched its CR. We\u2019ve seen a few isolated examples, such as the Dire Wolf, which actually got nerfed between the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/16841-dire-wolf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2014<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/4775812-dire-wolf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2024<\/a> versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also don\u2019t know for certain that XP for a creature at a given CR has not changed. There are enough examples in the 2024 DMG that I don\u2019t think they have, but I can\u2019t say for certain.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-multiple-monster-multipliers-are-gone\">The Multiple Monster Multipliers are Gone<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In the 2014 rules, you added a multiplier for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/dmg-2014\/creating-adventures#EncounterMultipliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">each additional enemy<\/a> in an encounter, then applied <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/dmg-2014\/creating-adventures#PartySize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another multiplier<\/a> based on the number of party members. The \u201cnormal\u201d encounter was 4 PCs against 1 monster of CR equal to the party\u2019s average level, but even that never really held up because the xp value for any given CR never matched the XP budget for 4 players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything beyond that got screwy, and there was no distinction for varying monster CR. An encounter with a CR 10 Froghemoth and 2 CR \u00bc Giant Frogs was treated as slightly more difficult than a single CR 14 creature (12,000 xp vs. 11,500 xp). It\u2019s not. Those Giant Frogs are fun to add to the encounter, but they do not add to the difficulty of the encounter as the math indicates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These clumsy multipliers have gone away. This makes it considerably easier to build encounters without the aid of an <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/tools\/encounter-builder\/\">encounter builder<\/a>, but it also means that encounters with multiple enemies no longer exponentially increase the XP budget for an encounter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re free to throw in CR 0 enemies at 10xp each to fill out encounters, leaving the party mobs to carve through without worrying that the game thinks you\u2019re going to TPK your level 10 adventurers. You\u2019re also free to hit them with a group of enemies just below their level, which will often be more challenging than a single CR-appropriate enemy due to the shift in action economy.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xp-budgets-massively-increased\">XP Budgets Massively Increased<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The change that originally inspired this article was that the \u201cDeadly\u201d column in the 2014 combat encounter rules is gone. We noted that the \u201cDeadly\u201d column for traps is gone in our review of the 2024 DMG, and I was terrified that WotC had done the same thing here, only to find a startling shift in the encounter math.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low Difficulty (formerly \u201cEasy\u201d) encounters now use an XP budget progression higher than the Medium progression in the 2014 rules, more than doubling the XP budget for an Easy encounter. Moderate Difficulty (formerly \u201cMedium\u201d) encounters use a progression higher than the High encounters in the 2014 rules. High Difficulty (formerly \u201cHard\u201d) encounters match 2014\u2019s Deadly encounters through level 8, then gradually become even more difficult..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven\u2019t yet grabbed a copy of the 2024 DMG, the combat encounter rules are included in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/free-rules\/combat#CombatEncounters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free rules<\/a>. I encourage you to examine the differences yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tells us that encounters in the 2014 rules weren\u2019t challenging enough, especially with the gradual power creep introduced by new supplements and with the addition of Weapon Mastery, Origin Feats, and easier access to magic items in the 2024 rules. Characters are stronger, but individual monsters mostly aren\u2019t (at least as far as we\u2019ve seen), so encounters need to be more difficult to compensate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also tells us that using single creatures that match the party\u2019s level isn\u2019t a challenge. One CR 10 Froghemoth was slightly above Medium difficulty for a party of 4 level 10 adventurers in 2014. In 2024, it\u2019s below the Low threshold. It\u2019s not even Moderate Difficulty for a party of 3.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-what-actually-changed\">So What Actually Changed?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example encounter. We have a party of 4 level 3 players, and they\u2019re facing a pack of gnolls. Gnolls have a few different stat blocks across 5e\u2019s various books, plus we can throw in hyenas and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/2560869-maw-demon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maw demons<\/a>. Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re planning an exciting boss fight, so we want one big enemy, a couple bodyguards, and a few low-CR minions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 2014 rules, we have an XP budget of 1600. We\u2019ll start with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/monsters\/17153-gnoll-pack-lord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gnoll Pack Lord<\/a> (CR 2, 450 XP), then throw in 2 Maw Demons as bodyguards (CR 1, 200 XP each). That\u2019s 850 XP, but since it\u2019s 3 creatures, we apply a x2 multiplier, and we\u2019re suddenly at 1700 XP. There\u2019s no room for minions here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could replace the Maw Demons with 2 Gnolls (CR \u00bc, 100 XP each), which is 650 before the multiplier. That will let us add some Hyenas (CR 0, 10 XP each). 5 hyenas feels exciting, bringing us to a nice, round 700 XP. We then apply the 3.5x multiplier for 8 creatures, and we\u2019re at 1750 XP despite this probably being an easier encounter. I\u2019m tearing my hair out at this point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s use the same group of creatures in the 2024 rules. Our Gnoll Pack Lord and 2 Maw Demons is a total of 850 XP, and there are no multipliers <em>ever<\/em>. A Moderate Difficulty encounter for our party of 4 is 900 XP, so we\u2019re well within budget. We could add 5 Hyenas and exactly hit the cap for Moderate. If we threw in some Gnolls, we would inch toward High Difficulty.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The 2024 rules aimed to simplify a lot of things and address long-standing pain points. Removing the multipliers from the encounter math is a huge improvement, in my opinion, but it will probably be overlooked by a huge number of DMs who have been running 5e for a decade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resulting changes to XP budgets now mean that single-enemy encounters will need to feature much stronger creatures, which is great since there are so many new ways to lock a single creature out of combat in the 2024 rules. With increased budgets, I think that encounters will be much more exciting, and DMs will have more flexibility in how they pick monsters for any given fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m excited to see these changes in action. I love a challenging fight, and 5e has terribly few of those that didn\u2019t feel like cheap gimmicks. I\u2019m optimistic that this change will make the game more satisfying.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The 2024 Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide snuck a significant difficulty increase into the game, and most of us didn\u2019t even look at the combat encounter rules closely enough to notice.
