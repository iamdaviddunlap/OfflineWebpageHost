I&#8217;m Randall James your Dungeon Mmaster and with me is Tyler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>00:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>00:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and Random Powell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>00:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howdy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>00:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. This is Episode 11, the 12th episode of the RPGBOT.podcast. Tyler, what are we gonna do tonight?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>00:39<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s see. Spooktober is&#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>00:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cut off! Nope. It&#8217;s my show. I&#8217;m gonna say we&#8217;re gonna do tonight. Yeah, it is. It&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s the end of Spooktober. It is the culmination of everything that we&#8217;ve been talking about. We talked about the Monsterizer, and how great it was to create your own monsters. We talked about death. We talked about how to execute horror in tabletop gaming, especially focused on using rules in like D&amp;D Fifth Edition, and tonight, we are going to try to do it together. Alright, so we&#8217;re going to do actual play. I&#8217;m going to DM these folks are going to be characters. And we&#8217;re gonna try to get a little spooky with it. Although I feel like saying you&#8217;re gonna try to get a little spooky with it is probably not gonna lead to a lot of spook, but anyway,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>01:22<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just setting that tone right off the bat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>01:26<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spooky characters! No, uh, yeah. So what kind of characters do we have tonight?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>01:31<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I&#8217;m playing Georg with the fourth Level dragonborn Battle Master Fighter. He&#8217;s a soldier and, uh, he knows some maneuvers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>01:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My joke! It comes back! And I am playing Amiable Jack. No particular reason for the name. I have never actually gotten to play a Bard in fifth edition, and so I thought I would try Eloquence Bard because, well, some things are definitely spooky. Perhaps maybe we can talk our way out of some of them instead of having to murder them. Because I wanted to have my character be with Georg for a reasonable reason, we&#8217;re adopted brothers. So there you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>02:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that&#8217;s right. Absolutely. We had a lot of discussions in the background about like, what&#8217;s a good hook? What would be something that would be interesting? And this was mainly coming from, you know, in the last episode, we talked about malaise and how to generate it. And so it&#8217;s like, Hey, here&#8217;s some creepy situations. And the group immediately latched onto one of them particular, which is going to kind of be the basis for the adventure we&#8217;re going to do tonight. With that we have this hook. The hook is we have these two brothers, they are adventurers of a certain level. And what is that level by the way?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>02:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>02:45<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Level four,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>02:47<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means you get a feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>02:49<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feats are good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>02:49<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I think we&#8217;ve talked about this a couple times. At some point we want to do an episode about the right level for doing a one-shot, but spoiler we thought somewhere around four made a lot of sense for a lot of reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>03:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m hearing spooky noises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>03:05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somebody spooky. We&#8217;re gonna delete all this. This won&#8217;t make the podcast. Okay. Or will it? Anyway. The conversation is that yeah, they&#8217;re adopted brothers. They were raised by a half-elf named Malikai. On Malakai&#8217;s deathbed, which he swears he was 200 years old, which is very old for a half-elf. But on his deathbed, at the ripe old age of allegedly 200. He handed them, the two brothers, a map. And he said that his greatest treasure was left there, and that the boys should rescue it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>03:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going on a treasure hunt, cool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>03:47<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And obviously everything is going to work out great. The boys and by boys. I mean these these two grown adult adventures, got together got everything they needed, hopped on their horses, and started following the trail. There&#8217;s a place where several mountain ranges meet near near where they are. And the map brings you through a pass that most didn&#8217;t realize was even there. Most maps will show these mountain ranges as intersecting at a particular point. But the map that Malakai gave you shows you that in fact, there&#8217;s a valley between the ranges, and there&#8217;s a path that you would have never thought to check for from a distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>04:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That that seems like the logical place to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>04:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Not a lot of people are gonna be running by there, right? Once in the valley, you&#8217;re immediately surrounded by old growth. Autumn&#8217;s come early here most of the trees are bare. You ride for hours, and a dull drone rings in the air. It lulls you to comfort your saddle so much that you agree to dismount, begin looking for a place to set up camp for the night. As you take your packs off the horses, you suddenly realize that the droning has become all too loud and you wonder how you could have ever found it soothing. Just as you look to each other to comment on it, a creature descends from the sky onto Jack&#8217;s horse, impaling it with a sharp straw-like nose. More of these creatures are descending from behind you. You hear one of them called the other:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Demonic Voice&nbsp; <\/strong>05:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh Meat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>05:09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How big are these things?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>05:11<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About Jack&#8217;s horse sized. Like it crawled onto Jack&#8230; it landed on Jack&#8217;s horse. Literally looks like it&#8217;s starting to draw the blood. I mean, it almost looks like a mosquito-esque creature. just gigantic and is like literally sucking the life out of the horses. The horse is laying there screaming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>05:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Georg. Forest. Go now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>05:31<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forst. Yep. Yes, I grab my pack and just book it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>05:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, awesome. So you have your packs. You run into the woods. Roll, both of you roll perception for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>05:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not great. Seven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>05:47<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna stick with my passive 15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>05:50<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passive of 15. Great. Okay, you&#8230; Good. You see a goat in the distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>05:57<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>05:57<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you say &#8220;in the distance&#8221; is that in the direction we&#8217;re heading or the direction we&#8217;re fleeing from?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>06:01<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s good. So you come off the road, you basically come up over the ditch. And you see in the clearing, there&#8217;s a goat laying on the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>06:09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So goat is down. This isn&#8217;t like a goat standing in front of us. Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>06:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>06:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Run around the goat. Quick Look at the goat. What is the status of our goat friend?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>06:19<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you run around the goat, the goat stands up onto its back legs and raises an axe above its head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>06:25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>06:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks at you and screams &#8220;Order must fall!&#8221; Hurls the axe. Jack, make a dexterity saving throw.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>06:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>06:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>06:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wait, I&#8217;m not Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>06:38<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re not Jack. 24.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>06:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, good. You&#8217;re able to dodge out of the way as the axe goes flying over your head. You continue to run. Make a perception check for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>06:55<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>06:56<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>06:58<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>23.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>06:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>06:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>23. Okay, you notice in front of you, there is a bog of some sort. And you&#8217;re concerned about your ability to make it safely through. What do you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>07:09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m in full plate&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>07:11<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it look like it extends very far? It, like, could we skirt it to one side?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>07:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You believe that you could skirt it over to the right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>07:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Right. Go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>07:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re once again you save Gerog&#8217;s life, you get them around. As you fly&#8230; as you flee deeper into the forest. You see the silhouette of a village dancing in the streets as finally the sun is kind of set and you find yourself running in the dark. A boy holds a torch out in front of him. &#8220;Over here&#8221; he yells. You fight through the underbrush feeling as if the trees themselves are seeking to restrain you. You hear the bleeting of the creature pursuing you as you approach the small huts on the exterior of the village. You feel the hot, wet breath of your pursuer on the back of your neck as you come across&#8230; some magical barrier. You look around to find that the boy that saved you is gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>07:56<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slap slap slap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>07:57<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Describe to me this barrier. Like&#8230; invisible wall?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>08:02<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically walk through something and as you did you almost had like a flash of blue in your brain. And now that you&#8217;re through it, you don&#8217;t see anything. You don&#8217;t see anything behind you. There&#8217;s nothing that you can touch. So yeah, what do you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>08:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you said the boy is gone. But we&#8217;re, I mean, the town is still a town. Like there&#8217;s still buildings?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>08:20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That that&#8217;s right. You&#8217;re basically, like, there&#8217;s a hut in front of you and it&#8217;s backlit. Your view would be there&#8217;s like probably some central fire or something that&#8217;s causing all the illumination that you do see<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>08:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other inhabitants immediately visible?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>08:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. So as you&#8217;re looking and you&#8217;re getting your bearings put together from each side of the nearby building men and women begin to approach some carry torches, backlighting each other&#8217;s silhouettes. But what you really see is kind of the dark side of of all of these folks coming towards you with torches held aloft. They&#8217;re wielding farming implements as weapons and while you doubt the skill of the artisan where the maintenance of the tools you do not doubt the sharpness of the blade or the pain that they would inflict.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>08:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will, uh&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>09:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind you, the demons have started to gather at the edge. Just out of reach where they can&#8217;t quite reach to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>09:08<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so the the people are inside the barrier, the demons are outside the barrier, and we&#8217;re at the barrier in between the two of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>09:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you&#8217;re on the good, not-demon side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>09:19<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll slick back my hair, step forward, offer out a hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>09:24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s gonna be some misunderstanding, but I&#8217;m very grateful for your town for saving us. I don&#8217;t quite know what happened to the little boy who did so but my name is Jack. This is my brother. I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s any need for violence here. We barely made it through whatever&#8217;s keeping these horrible things out, so, thank you very much, and we&#8217;re we&#8217;re just looking to try and pass through here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>09:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire time that you&#8217;re giving that speech. The men and the women are getting closer and closer to you, edging you towards&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>09:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put my shield on nice step in front of Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>10:02<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>pPlease excuse my brother.

Is there someone here who leads you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>10:19<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They keep gettin closer?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>10:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I look at them, does there seem to be anything inherently wrong with them? Do they just look like people carrying torches or?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>10:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, roll me&#8230; roll me an insight check. You can both roll an insight check?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>10:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will certainly&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>10:38<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeese. 5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>10:41<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, okay, well, my third consecutive 19 on the dice. So 20&#8230; 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>10:48<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You, you are fairly certain that these people are not hearing or listening to anything that you say. There&#8217;s no reaction, there&#8217;s no eye contact, all the signs that you tend to expect from intelligent folks are just not there. As they&#8217;re approaching brandishing their weapons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>11:05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8230; we can only see like their silhouettes and stuff, right? Like, there&#8217;s, they&#8217;re holding torches towards the back. So we can&#8217;t really see their faces very well?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>11:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yeah, there&#8217;s a few torches up and so you can see a view faces throughout the space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>11:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>11:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you either do either of you have darkvision? Suppose I should have known that before we started?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>11:24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>11:25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am reasonably certain.I also do not because bringing darkvision into a horror game is silly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>11:31<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a little cheating. Yeah. Okay, good. So I said what I said then, there are some faces that you can see by the illuminated torch light. And this is of course, where you see the dead eyes not registering anything you say. And then the entire body language for the folks that are coming close to you. And they&#8217;re inching closer and closer. Closer&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>11:51<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m thinking bolt to the right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>11:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>11:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I gesture once to the right and then just immediately run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>11:57<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you start to do this, you hear a loud booming voice scream, &#8220;stop!&#8221; It&#8217;s an effeminate voice. Feminine voice, I should say. The men and women begin to make way. And as finally they part to make a path. A short woman approaches you. And as you look closer, you realize that she&#8217;s probably no older than 16, maybe even 14 years old. And she, you know, as she gets closer, repeats herself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Young Woman&#8217;s Voice&nbsp; <\/strong>12:33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Stop.

You see them each kind of going off to one of the huts that&#8217;s in the village. One woman approaches you, basically looks at you and then turns around and begins walking away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>18:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you Sarah. Frantically grab Georg&#8217;s arm and Drag him. Follow her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>18:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is super weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>18:47<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you follow Sarah to the to the hut that she brings you to?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>18:51<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>18:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. So she walks you inside. She looks around for a moment and just leaves you in the room. And then comes back a few moments later with a couple, like, bundles of wood under each arm and tosses them by the fireplace, and then walks out and shuts the door behind her. Thank you, good luck with the ritual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>19:14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, describe to me the interior of this hut.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>19:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would absolutely love to. There are absolutely no windows and it is completely pitch black.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>19:25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, well&#8230; Just the one door?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>19:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just the one door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>19:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I guess I light the fireplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>19:39<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you scramble a bit. Let&#8217;s say it takes you a little bit given how dark it is in the room. But you do eventually get the fire lit. And now the entire room is illuminated by fires. The entire room, and of course you noticed this when it was dark. It has like a sense of staleness, as if it was wet for a long time or the windows were left open for a long time, and it&#8217;s never really been properly aired back out. As you touch things there are, there&#8217;s a large bed in the room. But as you touch it, you can actually feel the dust kind of sits off of it and shake shake away. There&#8217;s a bookcase in the room. And in the bookcase, there&#8217;s lots of books, you can see like stacked rough papers, certainly not in any kind of order. They&#8217;re kind of scattered and all mish-mashed as if almost all of them had just been tossed there as an afterthought, as opposed to it had ever really been, you know, someone&#8217;s personal library or anything of the sort. And then there&#8217;s typical, you know, comfort things. So there is next to the fire, there&#8217;s actually like an old-fashioned fireplace stove, where you would burn wood into the fireplace, and then there&#8217;s a cooking surface on top of it. This is actually set off separately from the actual fireplace. There&#8217;s a desk to sit at, there are chairs and a small table. These sorts of things. So you could tell that at one point, this was a reasonably livable, comfortable space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>21:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And is there anything in here like lanterns or candles or anything like that? Or is the only light source the fireplace?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>21:14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do find some candles by the bedside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>21:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it seems like somebody lived here a while ago. Weird, okay. So if the house is empty, but somebody was living here, that means whoever lived here either left or died.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>21:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is of course the way of things. Your eloquence astounds m, brother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>21:33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, well, I mean, they left or they died, and no one moved in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>21:39<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Celia is to be believed, I wouldn&#8217;t expect a lot of people to be coming here to move in. Honestly, Celia being so innately commanding of these people is a little bit odd. And I wonder if perhaps these notes might tell us anything about it. And I&#8217;ll head over and start leafing through the stuff in the bookcase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>22:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and what are what are you looking for?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>22:09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything not immediately bound. Because that&#8217;s, to me, that&#8217;s&#8230; I&#8217;m looking for things that are like letters, or anything like mad rambling. But I&#8217;m starting with the not bound stuff because that&#8217;s going to be really easy to sift through just like, is this a grocery list or is this a letter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>22:38<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, cool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>22:39<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a diary maybe?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>22:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna say, Jack, roll me an investigation check with advantage because you have quite some time to do this search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>22:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, 12 on the die&#8230; and, 13.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>22:58<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, 13 total. As you&#8217;er you&#8217;re part of the way through your investigation as you&#8217;re searching you you hear something outside and say your passive perception is enough that you just pick this up. You hear something that&#8217;s not quite understandable but then you you hear almost like a callback. &#8220;Order is coming&#8221;. lots of tiny children&#8217;s voices chanting. &#8220;Order is coming.

But you do&#8230; You you, you can&#8217;t help but recognize the similarity between a Averna and Avernus. And you look on the map, and you notice that there are three gates drawn on the map. Two of them appear to be in town. You recognize one to be the sigil of Malakai. You&#8217;re not sure what the other two sigils are, but they each have a sigil drawn by them. And the third one seems to be outside of town. And then finally, in the last page of the journal that&#8217;s filled, there&#8217;s written in kind of a broken common and words are all misspelled. And it&#8217;s very strange to read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Malakai&nbsp; <\/strong>28:03<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two eyes and one is left before me. With my eyes that I have left behind, I&#8217;ve left a gift for the children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>28:11<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>28:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll read that back to you.

I think we&#8217;re looking for dad&#8217;s eye. I think it&#8217;s gonna be where he lost it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>28:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we? Do we remember anything about Malikai having weird eyes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>28:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, that&#8217;s great. And I like that a lot. Malakai had two perfectly normal eyes. They seem to work perfectly fine. I mean, you got away with some stuff. But yeah, that&#8217;s life. You were happy with the amount of watching that happened. A few things that Malakai always talked about: So he actually made clothes. That was his profession. He was also a cobbler from time to time. So tailor, cobbler, that sort of thing. And he had a certain love for it. But he always talked about how much he missed his wife that this is something that he had learned to do with his wife, but that he had lost her and he didn&#8217;t talk much about her. Because he said that it hurt too much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>29:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m gonna take a stab in the dark here. Maybe mom lived here. And I&#8217;m going to take another stab in the dark here. I&#8217;m thinking there&#8217;s a needle joke in here somewhere. Joke isn&#8217;t right, but you get my drift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>29:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would sound like dad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>29:49<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes something like this, dads love dad jokes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>29:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>29:53<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you&#8217;re pondering this, there&#8217;s a&#8230; next to the fireplace. There&#8217;s almost like a gate. And I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t mention this before, but it&#8217;s the type of thing that you use to open to reach firewood from outside. If this makes sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>30:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know that that was the thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>30:14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, that&#8217;s totally a thing. Yeah. So basically, you can shut it from the inside, you can actually lock it from the inside. But you could go outdoors, you can load all your firewood on the side of your house. And then during the course of the winter, you can just open it and grab some wood in and then close it again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>30:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s convenient. Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>30:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? I mean, if you if you are living with a wood fire heated home, not having to go outside and freeze to get your wood sounds great. And it is convenient that this home has this because all of a sudden, it pops open. And the boy that was waving at you earlier, fairly certain this is him. And he says,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Young Boy&#8217;s Voice&nbsp; <\/strong>30:53<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m glad you made it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>30:56<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I grab him by his shirt and drag him into the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Young Boy&#8217;s Voice&nbsp; <\/strong>30:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, no.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>31:02<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, right, do you let him go?

Roll me a stealth check both of you. *the sound of dice* That was not stealthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>36:14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>36:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NIce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>36:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I finally rolled well on something.

So let&#8217;s say with those stealth rolls, you actually managed to sneak all the way through and basically brings you around like a quarter of the huts in the village and then finally brings you closer to the heart of the center. And you find what is a single room, it almost, like, it&#8217;s a little bit larger than an outhouse. And if you spent much time in the mountains or in like mining villages, you would actually recognize it as the opening to a mineshaft. And so, the door, the boy opens the door and begins to descend down the slope. Do you follow?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>37:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did the kid have a light source?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>37:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>37:08<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What?

Hut. There&#8217;s a better word for this. So yeah, you get in there, you&#8217;re able to shut the door, get them late. And you look down the kids already like 200 yards in front of you. It&#8217;s like well, well beyond. So you catch up to him. And as soon as it flat flattens out, you begin to recognize that surely this was once a mine by the way that it was carved. But as you look now it&#8217;s also doubling duty of catacombs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>38:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great.

There are carvings into the side of the wall and there are tombs. There are coffins, I should say. Some of the gaps are empty, perhaps waiting to be filled. And some sections are fuller than another as you continue to walk on the way. You&#8217;re occasionally finding intersections. And you quickly get the feeling this is laid out in kind of a grid of sorts. That it was almost carved out with lots and lots of like perpendicular lines and parallel lines. Okay. Some of the coffins above them are labeled in common with names that you like would know and recognize. Dome of them are in scripts that you can certainly recognize but you can&#8217;t necessarily read. some of them are simply marked with sigils. And the boy says you know<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Young Boy&#8217;s Voice&nbsp; <\/strong>39:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comr, come this way!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>39:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and starts to lead you and is moving faster and faster.

And he keeps picking up speed. And it&#8217;s left and then it&#8217;s right. And then I, probably another right you think but you&#8217;re a little confused at this point. And the whole time you&#8217;re trying to keep in the back of your mind. Like, where did we come from? Like what is kind of the origin and as long as you could keep that, as you get, you know, twisted in turn, do you think that you&#8217;re going to be able to keep it straight. And you realize eventually like, no, you have lost it and right when you are aboutto scream out to he boy, like, &#8220;stop!&#8221; for fear that you&#8217;re never gonna find a way out of here.

Okay, I am&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna do something which doesn&#8217;t make any sense narratively, but mechanically is totally allowed.

That&#8217;s a 20 on the first roll and a 9 on the second so it&#8217;s going to be nine but I&#8217;m going to use, uh, I&#8217;m going to use my martial maneuver Precision Attack to roll a d8 and add that to the result.

And then towards the mine exit which you happen to be standing directly in front of.&nbsp; You didn&#8217;t realize that a second ago but you actually when you were following in the dark.

And you can see that it&#8217;s like player and you can see silhouettes of people against the buildings, this sort of thing. You, you can&#8217;t see any bodies directly.

When you, when you arrive, Celia is sitting there on her knees in front of Order.

Now, right as that happens, you hear almost a cackling coming from the boy and the boy begins to transform directly in front of your eyes. As long twisting horns come out of the head. The boy grows to almost eight foot tall to the point where the adults who are trying to hold him back before can not even hang on as the arms lift.

You can&#8217;t hear anything. No noise is reaching you whatsoever. But you see just massive fist and muscles just pounding into each other. Like every hit appears to be like breaking bone and like moving things askew on each other&#8217;s body. And they&#8217;re, you know, one on top of the other and just boom, boom, and like one reaches back. And just like, you know, you can tell it&#8217;s a forceful yell just &#8220;ah!&#8221; but no noise reaches you whatsoever. Celia finishes reading, and all of a sudden&#8230; you&#8217;re no longer there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:12:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geez.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:12:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How could Celia read the scroll?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:12:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, uh, she&#8217;s at least literate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:12:46<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, but that&#8217;s what scrolls do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:12:49<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, you, uh&#8230; So actually, so comes the effective end of our adventure. And I&#8217;ll describe kind of what happens from here. You were brought to a different plane of existence. I should have had one in mind, but here we are. You&#8230; Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:13:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it one of the nice ones?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:13:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one of the nice ones. She heard about it once. Oh, somehow somewhere. You you go to a different plane of existence, you do find your way back to the material plane, which is great. You eventually find somebody who can read elven. Yeah, who who describes to you the rest of the contents of the book. And you learn the entire backstory, which I&#8217;m going to give you now. This, this devil was using this town. Well, so the the portal to Hell had always been in this town. And the devils had made use of people from it from time to time, and the people there tended to be fairly gifted in magic. One day, a portal to the abyss opened nearby. And no one knows why or how this happened. But the demons started to descend on them, until a particular devil named Order decided that he wanted to basically create a warlock farm for lack of a better way to put it. And so he made a pact that he would provide magic that would keep the demons out of the village, and would come by every so often, and take the most gifted of the young people there to become warlocks. He would give them with power, the rest would remain completely happy and satisfied to the end of their days. And<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:14:35<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God nothing ever goes wrong in a deal with the devil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:14:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody thought this sounded like a good idea. Except for Malaki. He thought it sounded terrible. So Malakai left a very special scroll of interplanar travel, which would be able to save many of the folks in the village and hoped that he had left enough clues to allow them to save themselves. But as he checked every so often it seemed like nobody had ever heard anything from Port Averna. And so on his deathbed, realizing that if he died, perhaps no one would ever discover the town and save them. And generation after generation would be born into this, he sent his two sons hoping that they&#8217;d be able to break the curse and the pact<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:15:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:15:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, it was terrible. Let&#8217;s be, yeah, maybe the devil lived, you didn&#8217;t stay long enough to see. And if Order lived, then there would be a new generation of children. And really the pact would continue on. And that&#8217;s its own kind of terrible. And if the, well, if the demon won, then the portal would fall. Or the barrier would fall. And when that fell, the&#8230; Yeah, I mean, the town would be gone. And at that point, the war between the demons and the devils would be wide open with two gates sitting right next to each other<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classic blood war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:02<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so we did it. We did We did some actual play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeese. Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; and maybe if we think we need a follow up for it, but I think let&#8217;s let&#8217;s do, let&#8217;s do feedback. One thing that I&#8217;m recognizing immediately, I did not think too hard about the scroll. And so you saying well, &#8220;the scroll is not going to get us all out&#8221; I&#8217;m like, No, that wasn&#8217;t my intention. This was meant to be the way out. Because I absolutely had bad endings planned. There were things you could have done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which would have led to the demons winning or the devils winning and everybody dying? Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The story was great. There were a lot of elements there that you did a really superb job in not a lot of time of building powerlessness into this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:55<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:16:56<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brother pinned, boy getting dragged off, and darkness. I am very rarely someone to be paralyzed. That was awful. That I, I mean, really everything, good stuff. But that moment in particular, that felt terrible. Which, you know, spot on, that&#8217;s what we were going for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:17:20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And I&#8230; not having full plate would have really sucked if there had been a drag out fight. So yes, I, mechanically, I was a little powerless. But I would&#8230; I was 100% expecting the ending to be, like, one of us goes out in a blaze of glory fighting a demon while everybody else teleports safety. But yeah, the&#8230; so Plane Shift, I think is a maximum of 8 people, right? Yeah. So when you said 11 Kids and like, oh, not only is one of us going to die in a blaze of glory, it&#8217;s also going to be a pyrrhic victory because we&#8217;re still going to have to leave a bunch of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:18:03<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, no, that&#8217;s fair. No, that&#8217;s Yeah. Two! Two scrolls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:18:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One for the dubious, uh, the dubious teenager and one for the Sater Bard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:18:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s probably something that I could tighten up. I, I did imagine a world where you did the fight. And it&#8217;s, it was actually kind of the juxtaposition. So going for horror, I, I didn&#8217;t want the big bad guy to be something that you could take out. I considered trying to play this game of like, I&#8217;ll roll some dice and I&#8217;ll pick one of them to have lived. And then they&#8217;re gonna come at you with like, 10 HP left. But otherwise, still, like a level nine demon or devil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:18:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:18:53<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that if, I mean, if we hadn&#8217;t found the scroll. If we hadn&#8217;t, you know, taken that way out. Yeah, absolutely. That&#8217;s definitely a way it could go. Even so, I mean, in either case, we are then&#8230; the town is then without its protection. Either the demon kills Order, or we kill Order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:19:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, and hear me out: you&#8217;re already built around Charisma. Warlock levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:19:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I well. You know&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:19:33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You did complain about not being able to see in the dark<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp; <\/strong>1:19:36<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did, in fact, do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:19:38<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that was actually&#8230; so if if the boy was was dead, which there were things that we could have done. You didn&#8217;t go for any of them, so that&#8217;s fantastic. That basically the plan was Order shows up. Order Feebleminds you, and if you passed is like &#8220;hey, do you&#8230; do you want to be a warlock?&#8221; And then then that&#8217;s the ending. So yeah, I&#8217;ll um, I&#8217;ll write up. Yeah, I&#8217;ll put together kind of maybe some of the rest of the skeleton, all the things that we didn&#8217;t tickle, because of course, we were actually trying to do this in a timely manner as well. But yeah, so folks at home, I hope you had a good time. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you&#8230; Yeah, so we talked about what&#8217;s the right way to put it. I think we there was definitely some anxiety. There might have even been a little bit of dread during the periods of darkness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp; <\/strong>1:20:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp; <\/strong>1:20:33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah.
