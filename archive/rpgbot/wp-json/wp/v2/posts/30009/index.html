They\u2019re all supposed to be thematically linked in a way that makes sense for the individual background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/free-rules\/character-origins#Soldier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Soldier<\/a> background lets you increase Strength, Dexterity, and\/or Constitution, which all make sense for a physically demanding job. The Origin Feat is Savage Attacker, which makes your damage rolls very slightly more reliable so that you\u2019re more effective in combat. You gain proficiency in Athletics for marching and in Intimidation for looking imposing. You also gain proficiency in one gaming set because soldiers spend a lot of time waiting for things to happen, and fill that time with diversions like playing cards. The equipment includes some basic soldier equipment, including a spear, a bow, and a healer\u2019s kit. All of this makes sense together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With those options, the Soldier is a good fit for martial characters like the Barbarian and the Fighter, but can also work for classes like Paladin and Monk. The backstories aren\u2019t even especially hard to justify.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-the-problem\">What\u2019s the Problem?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/dnd\/phb-2024\/character-origins#Scribe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scribe<\/a> is my favorite example. It supports Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom, which appeals to most classes in the game. The Scholar\u2019s Origin Feat is Skilled, which works for literally any character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes Scribe an easy go-to option for Artificers, Clerics, Druids, Fighters, Monks, Rangers, Rogues, and Wizards. That\u2019s more than half of DnD\u2019s classes, and it\u2019s entirely possible to form an optimized party from nothing but scribes. A bunch of bookish scholars strap on swords and armor one day and wander out in the world to fight dragons and stuff but somehow all have wildly different skillsets. Sure, I expect that from a Wizard, but there\u2019s a point where the suspension of disbelief gets a little hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new backgrounds also mean that most classes have one go-to background which is clearly intended for the class, but then another background that\u2019s mechanically much better but often wildly different in theme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Bard: Default pick is Entertainer, but with skills this bad they\u2019re better off with almost anything else. Criminal and Noble are good examples.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cleric: Default pick is Acolyte for additional Cleric spells, but Guide and Sage both diversify your spellcasting options, which is much more powerful even though it doesn\u2019t make thematic sense for most deities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Druid: Default pick is Guide or Hermit, but Acolyte and Sage diversify your spellcasting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fighter: Default pick is Guard or Soldier, but almost any background is just as good. Charlatan, which makes absolutely no sense thematically, is one of their best options.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ranger: Default pick is something like Guide or Soldier, but they do really well with Charlatan, Criminal, and Scribe.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rogue: Default pick is Criminal or Wayfarer, and those options work great, but Scribe is weirdly appealing. All of these sneaky scribes running around doing mischief.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Monk: Scribe and maybe Hermit are the obvious choices, but Sailor\u2019s access to Tavern Brawler is so good that it\u2019s basically the default. I expect that most Monks will be sailors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paladin: Should take options similar to the Cleric and the Fighter, but Charlatan and Merchant are among their best options.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sorcerer: I\u2019m honestly not sure which background is the go-to for Sorcerers, but their best options include Charlatan and Merchant. Because obviously when you\u2019re naturally magical, you go around pretending to be\u2026 magical? I don\u2019t know, what else would you want to pretend to be?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Warlock: Basically the same as the Sorcerer. You build them the same way, so I guess that makes sense.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wizard: Default pick is Sage or Scribe, but does better with Criminal to get the Alert feat or with Acolyte or Guide to get more diverse spell options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So with all of these charlatan paladins, scribe rogues, and sage druids running around, it feels like backgrounds have become really detached from the sorts of backstories that we might want for many of our characters. Without DM permission to customize or homebrew, we often can\u2019t build optimized characters while also picking a background that tells the story that we want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m mostly just salty that Sailor is such a good option for the Monk. We can\u2019t all be Popeye.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-legacy-backgrounds\">What About Legacy Backgrounds?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Legacy Backgrounds are about as flexible as they were in the 2014 rules: You essentially pick the name, and fill in the rest with whatever you can convince your DM to allow. It\u2019s basically homebrew with the 2014 background as inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to pick options a la carte is also objectively more powerful than using the published backgrounds as-is. If you go this route, I recommend letting everyone at the table do it so that it feels fair. The DMG\u2019s guidance for <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/863283965081944064\/968602940430508062\/1308890668562649119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating backgrounds<\/a> suggests a process for this.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-we-fix-this\">How Do We Fix This?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Volume. We need more Backgrounds. WotC has cut the amount of text for a background down to a very tiny format, so they\u2019re easy to write once someone has a passable concept. They can pack the next splat book absolutely full of these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More backgrounds that share access to individual Origin Feats will offer more diversity in character options, but won\u2019t actually make characters more powerful unless there\u2019s power creep in Origin Feats. Just as we look at ability scores and say \u201cI need Dexterity and Constitution, therefore my options are X and Y\u201d, we can say \u201cI want Tavern Brawler, so my options are A and B.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, we could partially or fully detach the mechanical parts of backgrounds, essentially letting players choose a la carte as the go-to option. Why does this Sage have Tavern Brawler? Well, they like to go to the local tavern on Friday nights and start trouble. Why does this Noble have the Poisoner feat? Because they\u2019re from Menzoberranzan, where that\u2019s not only normal, it\u2019s encouraged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, we need more options. Xanathar\u2019s came 3 years into 5e, and Tasha\u2019s came 5 years in. I hope we don\u2019t need to wait that long. The Forgotten Realm&#8217;s Player&#8217;s Guide is scheduled to release in late 2025, and I hope that it has a lot to offer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What\u2019s Different With Backgrounds?
