We explore the mechanics of the help action, including its use in combat and out of combat scenarios. We also discuss the limitations and potential benefits of using the help action, as well as different character options that can enhance its effectiveness. This highlights the importance of understanding the rules and clarifying any misconceptions to ensure a fair and balanced gameplay experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss the rules and mechanics of the Aid action in both D&amp;D 5e and Pathfinder 2e, exploring the differences in how the action is handled in each system, including the requirements, benefits, and limitations. We include character options that make taking the Aid action more attractive, such as the Mastermind Rogue subclass in 5e and the Cooperative Nature and Loyal Empath feats in Pathfinder 2e. Overall, highlighting the importance and usefulness of the Aid action in both systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the final part of the episode we talk about the cooperative nature of aid checks in Pathfinder Second Edition, and the idea of adjusting the DC for aid checks based on the difficulty of the task and the level of training of the character being aided; and how aid checks can be used in combat to create openings for attacks or to identify weaknesses in enemies. The team share their personal experiences with aid checks and offer different perspectives on when and how to adjust the DC; overall, emphasizing the importance of aid checks in the game and encouraging players to use them more often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The help action in tabletop role-playing games allows a character to assist another character, granting advantage on ability checks or attacks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The help action is commonly used in combat to provide advantage on attack rolls, especially with familiars or characters with specific abilities<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In out of combat scenarios, the use of the help action depends on the DM&#8217;s ruling and the specific skill being assisted<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Understanding the rules and clarifying any misconceptions about the help action is important to ensure a fair and balanced gameplay experience<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Different character options, such as feats or class abilities, can enhance the effectiveness of the help action.
