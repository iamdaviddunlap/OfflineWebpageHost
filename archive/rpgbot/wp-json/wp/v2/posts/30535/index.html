Creatures were updated to fit their CR better, to be easier to play, and ideally to surprise long-time players who have developed an encyclopedic knowledge of the Monster Manual\u2019s contents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article contains a comprehensive change log comparing the 2014 and 2024 versions of monsters. It was compiled as part of my ongoing work on <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/announcing-monstrous-species-for-dnd-5e\/\">Monstrous Species<\/a>, and I\u2019ve chosen to share my change log in hopes that it\u2019s useful for other players and other DnD creators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:<\/strong> This article is a work in progress. RPGBOT didn\u2019t receive early access to the Monster Manual, so I have not had access to the full rules text yet. The list below is based on stat blocks available in the Player\u2019s Handbook and in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enworld.org\/threads\/monster-manual-2025-stat-block-compilation.709621\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stat block previews<\/a> which WotC has shared on social media. I will continue to update this article as we get more stat blocks and when I can get my hands on the book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ANOTHER NOTE<\/strong>: DnDBeyond has issued <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/changelog#JanuaryMarch2025?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=social&amp;utm_campaign=2024core_monstermanual_&amp;utm_content=ddb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">errata for the Monster Manual<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"organizational-changes\">Organizational Changes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Creatures are no longer grouped by \u201cfamily\u201d, so there are no longer sections of angels, true dragons, etc.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Many creatures were renamed. A full list is included in the appendices. Most were to make individual stat blocks more distinct, such as \u201cAarakocra\u201d changing to \u201cAarakocra Skirmisher,\u201d but a few creatures were changed to fit updated lore, such as the \u201cAndrosphinx\u201d changing to \u201cSphinx of Valor.\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The 2014 Monster Manual included two appendices with stat blocks: Miscellaneous Creatures and NPCs. There is now only one appendix with stat blocks titled \u201cAnimals.\u201d Everything else was sorted into the rest of the Monster Manual.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"general-design-changes\">General Design Changes<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Echolocation is gone<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>False Appearance is gone. This raises odd questions for creatures like animated armor and galeb duhr, which previously liked to disguise themselves as mundane objects before giving players a jump scare. Can animated armor pretend to be regular armor convincingly? If so, how?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Humanoids are largely absent from the Monster Manual except as NPCs\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Duergar and drow are not included; instead, they\u2019re handled using NPC stat blocks with no distinction for species.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The 2014 DMG has a table of stat adjustments that you could use to alter NPC stat blocks to fit specific humanoids, but that was not replicated in the 2024 DMG, so species for NPCs is now purely cosmetic.(Ash hates this even more)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gith, gnolls, and goblins are all still included because they are no longer humanoids.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>WoTC also promised us higher level humanoid enemies. They only go up to CR 12, so the upper limit of humanoids hasn\u2019t changed, but we do have more NPCs toward the top of that limit than we did before.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We were hoping to see some answer to Weapon Mastery, but didn\u2019t get anything of the sort<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Initiative bonuses tend to be much higher. Many creatures add their PB or even double their PB to initiative. Players have few accessible ways to match that capability, so enemies are more likely to act first as players advance. Builds which depend on acting first (Assassin Rogues, etc.) will need to get creative to keep up at high levels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keen Sense traits have gone away. Most creatures that had a Keen Sense now get proficiency in Perception. Some get Expertise.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Legendary Actions which consume more than one Legendary Action no longer exist.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resistance to non-magical B\/P\/S is gone. This makes magic weapons less essential for martial characters, but also means that durable creatures like gargoyles are suddenly no tougher than any other creature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Poison on hit now doesn\u2019t call for a saving throw. Generally this damage has been reduced as a result. Some creatures do still require a follow-up save, such as for the ghoul\u2019s paralyzing claws.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some creatures include their Proficiency Bonus or even double their Proficiency Bonus in their initiative modifiers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sure-Footed (Advantage on saves vs. being knocked prone) has gone away. Creatures like goats and mules got a little less interesting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Web Walker and Web Sense, which were always together on creatures that had them, are now consolidated into Web Walker.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creatures which had powerful save-or-suck effects, such as the Ghoul (Paralyzing Claws) and the Mind Flayer (Mind Blast) have had the durations of those effects reduced from 1 minute to 1 round. These effects could easily take a player character out of a fight, often with no resource except a lucky roll on a difficult save. This was terribly unsatisfying for players, and made those creatures unpredictably powerful since one bad save could cause the party to death spiral into a TPK. But don\u2019t worry: these creatures were buffed in other ways to compensate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-introduction\">The Introduction<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The designers repeatedly promised that the introduction would include more thorough advice on how to actually run monsters, including advice on how to run creatures to suit their CR. No such advice exists, which is disappointing, but honestly not surprising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WotC has done this with all three of the core rulebooks: promised a very specific thing that players wanted (engaging crafting rules in the PHB, specific magic item prices in the DMG), then gave us the barest hint of what they promised. I\u2019m not letting this specific omission color my opinions of the rest of the book, but it would be nice if the DnD design team were more honest with the community about what was in the books. There is enough here to be happy about that they don\u2019t need to lie about the book\u2019s contents, and I wish they would stop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Introduction thoroughly explains the format of stat blocks and how individual parts of a monster and a monster entry function. This section is shorter than the 2014 version, as explanations of various movement types and senses have been moved to the Player\u2019s Handbook. Largely this section is concise, well-written, and accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did notice one particularly odd bit of text in the explanation of how spellcasting works: The text clarifies that, despite being listed in the \u201cActions\u201d section, spells with a casting time longer than 1 Action still follow the normal rules for casting such spells. But what about spells with a Bonus Action casting time Shillelagh or Misty Step? Do monsters and NPCs cast those spells as an Action?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Introduction no longer discusses ammunition. The 2014 version specified that enemies carried 2d4 pieces of ammunition for thrown weapons and 2d10 for ranged weapons. This could, in theory, lead to a hilarious situation where enemy archers went into a fight with just two arrows. I have never heard of anyone using this rule, so I\u2019m not surprised that it has been omitted.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stat-block-changes\">Stat Block Changes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Stat blocks are organized to reflect the organization of the new Monster Manual.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monsters\">Monsters<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Aarakocra<\/strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New: Aarakocra Aeromancer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Aarakocra.<\/strong> Renamed to \u201cAarakocra Skirmisher.\u201d Lost one hit die, but Constitution increased from 10 to 12, resulting in a total of 2 lost hit points. Dive Attack was rolled into Talons and its damage bonus changed from 1d6 to 2d4, so the Aarakocra Skirmisher can\u2019t get the damage bonus with weapons. The Aarakocra\u2019s javelin was replaced with a new \u201cwind javelin,\u201d which deals an additional 1d4 Thunder damage and then magically returns to the Aarakocra\u2019s hand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Aboleth. <\/strong>Initiative changed from -1 to +8.

Enslave is replaced by Consume Memories and Dominate Mind.
