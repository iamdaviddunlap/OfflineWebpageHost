The more the better.&#8221; Some of them will be benign like &#8220;Reach for Peace&#8221;, which is led by a &#8220;kindly elder with eyes that seem to glow with a soft light&#8221; and hates violence. You might also get the occasional absurd combination like &#8220;Sisterhood of Sisterhood&#8221;. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Results will vary, as currently this thing spits out well over 80 quadrillion variations (no, I didn&#8217;t make that number up). If you ever see the same result twice in a single human lifetime, you have defied probability so much that a cult might start worshiping you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-rpgbot wp-block-embed-rpgbot\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"appmQjhVkG\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/general-tabletop\/tools\/cult-generator\/\">Cult Generator<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Cult Generator&#8221; &#8212; RPGBOT\" src=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/general-tabletop\/tools\/cult-generator\/embed\/#?secret=GXelPWhDO9#?secret=appmQjhVkG\" data-secret=\"appmQjhVkG\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you end up with an especially exciting cult, share a screenshot and tag RPGBOT on social media.
