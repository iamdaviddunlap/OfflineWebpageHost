Building a party around a single class presents unique challenges often due individual classes\u2019 limited capabilities. DnD is fundamentally a game about a party of diverse characters pooling their abilities to become more than the sum of their parts. The single-class party flips that on its head, introducing fun new challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exceptionally durable, frustratingly hard to kill, and capable of smiting enemies into nonexistence in the space of a single turn, Paladins are a great class. That said, making an all-Paladin party is surprisingly difficult. While paladins are diverse in tone and style, their skill set is extremely rigid. Paladins also have the frustrating moral restriction of their oaths, which means that any all-Paladin party will need to pick subclasses which won\u2019t cause their oaths to conflict.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-rules\">The Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No multiclassing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>4 party members<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Must attempt to cover all <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/party-composition\/\">party roles<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-allpaladin-party\">Strengths and Weaknesses of the All-Paladin Party<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With d10 hit dice, heavy armor, and all of the Paladin\u2019s magic and auras and other stuff, the Paladin is extremely durable. Divine Smite gives us a lot of burst damage, Lay on Hands gives us a lot of healing, and the Paladin\u2019s spellcasting can provide a lot of buffs. We have the Defender, Healer, Striker, and Support rolls covered with no further effort. With high Charisma, we can cover the Face role, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, paladins often struggle to go beyond those roles. Ranged combat is very difficult for paladins, and their spellcasting is very limited in quantity and has few spell options.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-party\">The Party<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-1-oath-of-devotion-paladin\">Member 1: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/subclasses\/oath-of-devotion\/\">Oath of Devotion Paladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Our party\u2019s primary front line. Oath of Conquest or Oath of Vengeance would work here mechanically, but their oaths are much more confrontational, making them difficult to integrate into an all-paladin party. While our entire party can smite and such, getting into melee and waving a sword around is our primary function within the party. We\u2019ll need other party members to sacrifice some of the Paladin\u2019s conventional martial focus to pick up other roles.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-2-oath-of-redemption\">Member 2: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/subclasses\/oath-of-redemption\/\">Oath of Redemption<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Emissary of Peace gives us a bonus to Charisma skills which other paladins can\u2019t match, so we\u2019ll make this our Face. Otherwise, our job is to keep everyone else alive.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-3-oath-of-the-ancients-paladin\">Member 3: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/subclasses\/ancients\/\">Oath of the Ancients Paladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll mostly duplicate our Dexterity-based example build from our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/subclasses\/oath-of-the-ancients\/\">Oath of the Ancients Paladin Handbook<\/a>. Building around Ensnaring Strike lets us fight effectively at range with a smite-like option, filling one of the party\u2019s biggest tactical gaps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With high Dexterity, we\u2019ll also make this our Scout. We might change the example build\u2019s race from Giff to something that offers extra skill proficiencies like the Kenku or the Tabaxi.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-4-oath-of-the-watchers-paladin\">Member 4: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/subclasses\/oath-of-the-watchers\/\">Oath of the Watchers Paladin<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Oath of the Watchers brings a few exciting offensive spells, and the subclass as a whole makes it well suited to the Blessed Warrior Fighting Style. We\u2019ll build our Watchers Paladin around Charisma, allowing us to focus on spellcasting. This won\u2019t compete with classes like the Cleric, but it\u2019s enough that we could call this our Blaster and our Controller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With little need for physical ability scores to support weapons, we can afford to invest in Intelligence and also claim the Scholar role. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility on one character, but it is the best fit. We\u2019re also not taxing our resources with Divine Smite.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-report-card\">The Report Card<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>Role<\/th><th>Member(s)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Blaster<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Controller<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Defender<\/td><td>1, 2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Face<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Healer<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scholar<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scout<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Striker<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Support<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Utility Caster<\/td><td>&#8211;<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-strength\">Biggest Strength<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Durability. Everyone in the party has Aura of Protection, Lay on Hands, d10 hit dice, and good AC. Hurting us is difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-weakness\">Biggest Weakness<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Our lack of utility casting means that a lot of frustrating challenges will need to be solved manually. Walls climbed with rope instead of flight, barriers smash down with tools rather than blasted apart, etc. It\u2019s mostly inconvenient, but I don\u2019t think it will kill us.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Be especially aware of the tenets of your oath, because everyone in the party has different tenets. While the specific party that we\u2019ve assembled here will rarely conflict as long as we\u2019re sticking to the most idealistic version of lawful good, there may still be conflicts that need to be cautiously negotiated to avoid everyone becoming oathbreakers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this article, I encourage you to check out the other articles in the series:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-parties-oops-all-artificers\/\">Oops All Artificers<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-barbarians\/\">Oops All Barbarians<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-the-all-bard-party\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27059\">Oops All Bards<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-druids\/\">Oops All Druids<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-parties-oops-all-fighters\/\">Oops All Fighters<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-monks\/\">Oops All Monks<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-rogues\/\">Oops All Rogues<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-warlocks\/\">Oops All Warlocks<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Exceptionally durable, frustratingly hard to kill, and capable of smiting enemies into nonexistence in the space of a single turn, Paladins are a great class.
