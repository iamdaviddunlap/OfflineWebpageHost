We were given the option of scheduling a game to run a playtest scenario, and a developer would sit in to observe if scheduling allowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had plans to explore the VTT with other members of the RPGBOT.Podcast team, but the scheduling didn\u2019t line up, so I was only able to test the VTT solo. This involved a lot of clicking buttons and trying to see what I could do and how all of the options worked. Other participants may have more realistic impressions of how the VTT works in practice if they were able to actually run a session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The playtest gave us access to a single pre-built area which was something like your stereotypical D&amp;D tavern with a few surrounding out-buildings like a stable and a well. Encounters were scattered around the area, as were tokens intended for those various encounters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My general impressions: It\u2019s very pretty, but this is definitely an alpha.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tokens, structures, and terrain looked good. The 3d environment is attractive, and clearly quite a bit of work was put into the models. Based on chatter in the discord, the VTT performed well on a variety of devices with varying tech specs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of functionality that still feels like early stages, and the user interface is frequently confusing. It\u2019s not clear what various buttons do, how to accomplish a lot of simple tasks, or how to clean up mistakes after you click the wrong button. There is a lot of room for improvement here, but a lot of it could also be fixed by improving button text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There appears to be support for playing on a 2d surface, but it\u2019s not clear to me how well it will work in play. You can place a 2d map as an object on the map, then set the content by plugging in a web URL to populate it. Based on a conversation with the dev team, this is intended to support importing a 2d map image. I imagine that you could drop this on a blank area, scale the map, and drop tokens onto it, but it wasn\u2019t obvious to me how to do any of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would allow people to easily play with adventures that don\u2019t already have pre-built maps in the VTT, which is good because there have been long-standing concerns that any non-official adventures would be frustrating to play, if not impossible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on information we were given, the VTT is slated for release in 2025. A lot can change about software in a time window that big. I think it\u2019s possible that WotC could have something really impressive by then. For now, I\u2019m hoping for a beta some time in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the past few days I had the opportunity to participate in a closed alpha playtest of WotC\u2019s new virtual tabletop, currently named &#8220;Dungeons and Dragons Digital.&#8221; There were some other creators also in the alpha whose names you will likely recognize, but it\u2019s not my place to list them off.
