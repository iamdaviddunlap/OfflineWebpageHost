It\u2019s also the one that most of the meme quotes are from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What those movies describe is a world where capitalism went so hard that we had to expand into the stars to be able to find more natural resources to consume to sustain it. Fortunately, very-near-future not-Elon Musk figured out FTL travel to make that possible and cryosleep so you weren\u2019t crazy when you got there. Now, 200 years later, with hundreds of planets colonized and all the infrastructure necessary to make that work, someone needs to be cogs in the system to keep everything turning, and that\u2019s you and your band of player characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book leans into the fact that the original movie came out in the 70\u2019s and had the aesthetic to match. Ships have intercoms and terminals scattered throughout and computers can\u2019t be accessed otherwise. The AI mainframe is in a whole separate room. Ship drive cores are radioactive. Everything is CRTs and heavy wires and very analog. It is truly, as they say, a vibe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conflict-resolution-dice\">Conflict Resolution (Dice)<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>ALIEN uses a dice pool system based on the Attributes (think Ability Scores if you\u2019re coming from DnD or Pathfinder) of the character rolling, along with any Skill Points gained from character customization, environmental factors, and bonuses from equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked to make a roll, pick up a number of d6\u2019s equal to the relevant attribute, any skill ranks you may have, and any modifiers from equipment. Add one additional die for each person helping you, to a maximum of +3. Add or subtract any at the GM\u2019s discretion based on difficulty. Roll that pile. If you get a 6 on any die, you succeed. If you get additional successes, you can spend them to succeed harder based on the type of skill you were rolling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting thing this does mean is that every action in the game must be classified into one of the 12 skills, unless the GM really wants to break things and determine that no skill is relevant and have you roll on straight attribute or try and pull in D&amp;D\u2019s ability to mix and match ability and proficiency like we\u2019ve talked about in some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/podcast\/\">podcast<\/a> episodes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The game uses two types of dice: \u201cregular dice\u201d and \u201cstress dice\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every d6 I mentioned in the above scenario would be a regular die.

Characters will have stress levels based on events, and for each level of stress you have you add a stress die into your roll. Stress dice can succeed as normal (adrenaline helps you focus and Get Things Done), but they also introduce the potential for the catastrophic: Panic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary way you gain stress is actually also due to these dice rolls: if, after the roll, you didn\u2019t like the outcome, you can \u201cPush\u201d the roll. To do so, you increase your stress level by 1, pick up the pile of dice, immediately add another stress die to it due to the increase you just did, and roll it again. No roll can be pushed more than once. There\u2019s a handy chart in the book right next to the section on this describing the percentage likelihood of success for rolls from 1d6-10d6, with and without pushing, to give you a baseline for your risk\/reward analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character-creation-and-advancement\">Character Creation and Advancement<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3b - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"major-decision-points-career-talentnbsp\">Major decision points: Career, Talent <\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 3c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Career is your class and determines your key attribute, which is the only one you can increase past 4. It also determines what pool of Talents you have access to. A primary feature of talents is to allow your character to Push some type of roll a second time, which can be critical to your (and\/or everyone\u2019s) survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A notable alternative is that your character can be an Android. Androids work differently in that they start substantially stronger than humans (+3 to two attributes after creation) and are immune to stress. This means, however, that they can\u2019t push rolls and never get the bonus dice from being stressed. Additionally, they don\u2019t heal the way humans do (which is very generous in this game) and instead must be repaired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advancement\">Advancement<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Character advancement is only relevant to campaign play but even more so than I mean that for other systems. See below for more of an explanation of what Cinematic Play is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ALIEN uses an XP system. XP is earned by, at the end of each session, looking at a list of 8 questions and asking \u201cDid I do this thing?\u201d You get 1 xp for each yes. XP can be spent 5 at a time to increase the rank of a skill or to purchase a new talent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>12 skills split evenly across the 4 Attributes&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No skill can ever be trained to a rank higher than 3, meaning that for most people their natural aptitude is going to be more influential on their success than any amount of training. Opposed checks are common, especially Observation versus Mobility (which is the stand in for both Stealth and Dexterity saves). Close Combat is especially good as it allows you to both attack effectively and block in melee combat effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One cool thing to call out is that roles as a group for those two skills are specifically called out with mechanics. Groups may select anyone to roll their combined observation check but must select the player with the lowest Mobility to roll for their combined stealth attempt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another fun note is that both \u201cface skills\u201d and medicine are all tied to the same attribute, so your captain is also probably the best doctor on the ship. This makes it extra rough if they die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"equipment\">Equipment<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Every career starts with a certain amount of gear but nearly anything is freely available for purchase and has a listed price. Most things will have some kind of supply limitations. Guns don\u2019t force you to count bullets, but if you roll a 1 on a stress die while shooting, you run out and have to reload which both prevents you from shooting for a turn and requires you to be carrying \u201ca reload\u201d for that gun (a clever reader will notice that this means that Androids never run out of ammo for guns. This is explicitly called out as being part of the rules). Other things you have to track are Power supplies (for things like the famous motion tracker), air, food, and water. Each piece of equipment has an inventory slot size and your Strength determines how many things you can carry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important things you\u2019ll carry is your \u201csignature item,\u201d a small trinket that can, once per session, be interacted with to reduce your stress level by 1. It can be things like a photo of a loved one, a patch on a piece of clothing, or a beloved cigarette lighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"combat\">Combat<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Every combat starts with initiative. ALIEN uses a unique mechanic where each player draws a card from a stack of 10, each labeled 1, 2, 3 and so on up to 10. After they\u2019ve drawn, the GM draws from the remaining to assign initiatives to anything hostile in the encounter. If there aren\u2019t enough cards and there are groups of enemies with the same block, they all act on one card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the fight starts, and at the beginning of each round, players may exchange cards with each other as long as they can speak to each other. Once that\u2019s done, everything takes a turn in initiative order starting from 1 and going down. Each turn allows you one slow action and one fast action. Slow actions are very much Actions from D&amp;D 5e while fast actions include both movement and things you might classify as Bonus Actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One critical thing that can be done with your fast action is to not use it on your turn but instead wait until you\u2019re attacked in close combat and then you can respond with the Block action. This still uses Close Combat as a skill and will reduce incoming damage which means you get better at both offense and defense by investing heavily in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I talked about earlier, extra successes on dice rolls can do neat things. In combat, the most obvious thing you can do is to just do extra damage with them on top of whatever the damage rating is for your weapon. However, you can also do things like force your target to trade initiatives with you, potentially giving them a worse value for future rounds and allowing more of your party to go before it does and try to finish it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-157\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"time\">Time<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-158\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of rounds, time is measured in an odd way in this game. Combat is always measured in rounds which are intended to be 5-10 seconds. Many things in the game care about a Turn which is intended to be 5-10 minutes. Shifts, the longest, are 5-10 hours. Given that much of the game takes place in space with no cycle to stick the passage of time to, it makes a lot of sense, but then you still need to do things like sleep for one shift every \u201cday\u201d to avoid exhaustion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 7c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ship-combat\">Ship Combat<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Rules for ship combat are surprisingly robust and even more quick and brutal than regular combat. A full 10 pages is devoted to this covering everything from trying to hide your ship, pushing engines to outrun, and even ramming and boarding. Initiative works sort of similarly in that the captains of the ships draw cards and lower number goes first, but the play is very different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m just going to paste this here from the book because it\u2019s so cool: \u201cAlso, unlike personal combat, guessing your enemy\u2019s moves is difficult in space combat. Therefore, each ship selects its action in each [of the four] phases secretly. Actions are declared simultaneously, and then performed in initiative order.\u201d The four phases called out above roughly map to crew positions so that each player can participate in a unique way assuming a standard 4 person party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8b - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cinematic-play\">Cinematic Play<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 8c - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>All of the above describes how you play in a campaign setting (which, by the way, if you want help making your own campaign the back of the book has tables to randomly create jobs for each flavor of campaign including quest giver, task, reward, and complication).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other way to use the rules is for cinematic play, akin to living out the experience of an <em>Alien<\/em> movie in a TTRPG. The rules for players all work the same way except that, instead of getting XP, you get a metacurrency called Story Points that you can spend to automatically succeed on checks even after you\u2019ve seen your roll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is relevant because each Cinematic Play scenario is broken up into three Acts, just like a movie. You will be given a pre-generated character and, for each act, a hidden agenda that you are supposed to base your roleplay around. If you do, when each act ends, you get a story point. These belong to the player, not the character (important since characters frequently die and players take over an NPC, if one is available), allowing you to use it to help whoever you might be piloting at the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9a - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pain-points\">Pain Points<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-136\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9b - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>My only real issue with the game is the sheer amount of things the GM has to keep track of. While running the Cinematic Play scenario in the starter kit, I completely forgot to track my players on air consumption and power consumption of the motion tracker that all of us forgot they were using. I needed to be constantly looking at the map, at the descriptions of the rooms, at the stat blocks of NPCs, at the list of events, and at the core rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of events is at the end of the book, separated out by Act but is given in no other particular order. Some of them are required for you to experience before the Act can advance, but the required ones are mixed in with the optional ones. Then there are the room descriptions which don\u2019t contain any context for things that might happen in them. The map is 4 separate pages and the key for the symbols on it is only present on one of those pages. If I\u2019d been able to print\/photocopy like 12 pages and levitate them all around me for easy access, I would have felt much better running it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, this is going to be a game that heavily relies on a GM\u2019s ability to build ambiance and the player\u2019s willingness to participate. Like we talked about in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-episode-10\/\">Horror episode of the podcast<\/a>, if people aren\u2019t buying into having their characters act like they\u2019re facing down monstrous horrors, the game is going to feel pretty flat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-159\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 9c - longer_content -->\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-160\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 10a - longer_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>ALIEN is one of the best systems I\u2019ve come across for combining great mechanics and great atmosphere in a package that delivers on really everything you want it to.
