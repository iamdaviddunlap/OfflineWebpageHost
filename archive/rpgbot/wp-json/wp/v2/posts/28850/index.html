We cover the changes to classes, subclasses, and backgrounds. The order of character creation has been adjusted, with class being chosen first, followed by origin (background), ability scores, alignment, and details. The complexity of each class is now listed, helping players choose a class that suits their preferences. Subclasses have been moved to level three, allowing for more flexibility in playstyle. Backgrounds have undergone the most significant rework, with each background now providing ability score options, skill and tool proficiencies, starting equipment, and an origin feat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backgrounds are now more meaningful and important in character creation and we talk about the potential for new batches of backgrounds in future adventures and source books. We express the desire for more backgrounds and suggest tying them to major characters in the supplements. We also discuss the importance of making backgrounds available on D&amp;D Beyond for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then talk about the different types of feats, including origin feats, general feats, and epic boons. We go into specific feats and the changes that have been made to them, such as the nerf to the Lucky feat. We highlight the inclusion of ability score increases in general feats and the impact this has on character builds. In this final part of the conversation, We discuss character creation and NPC generation in the new edition of Dungeons and Dragons. We advise using generators for names and backgrounds, and recommend reskinning existing monsters for NPCs. We caution against building NPCs as player characters and suggest using the personality traits provided in the background section of the Player&#8217;s Handbook.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"materials-referenced-in-this-episode\">Materials Referenced in This Episode<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/4c1MO5N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2024 DnD 5e Player\u2019s Handbook<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/wip.rpgbot.net\/about\/faq#affiliate-links\">affiliate link<\/a>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/koboldpress.com\/kpstore\/product\/tome-of-beasts-1-2023-edition\/affiliate\/rpgbot\/?campaign=rpgbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tome of Beasts<\/a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/wip.rpgbot.net\/about\/faq#affiliate-links\">affiliate link<\/a>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Content from RPGBOT.net\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd-5e-transition-guide-and-change-log-everything-thats-different-in-the-new-players-handbook\/\">2024 D&amp;D 5e Transition Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>RPGBOT.Podcast Episodes\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-players-handbook-the-rpgbot-review-rpgbot-podcast-s4e87\/\">2024 DnD 5e PHB Review<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoy the show, please rate and review us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/id1580860988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple Podcasts<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/3pEIs8ff4CBezpwJyTZZtt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify,<\/a>&nbsp;or your favorite podcast app. It\u2019s a quick, free way to support the podcast, and helps us reach new listeners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love the show, consider joining us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/rpgbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Patreon<\/a>, where backers at the $5 and above tiers get&nbsp;<strong>ad free access to RPGBOT.net and the RPGBOT.Podcast, direct access to the RPGBOT.Team on the RPGBOT.Discord, and can join us every week for live-streamed recordings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support us on Amazon.com when you purchase products recommended in the show at the following link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3NwElxQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/3NwElxQ<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Find Us:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In-depth articles, guides, handbooks, reviews, news on Tabletop Role Playing at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/\">RPGBOT.net<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tyler Kamstra<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RPGBOTDOTNET\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@RPGBOTDOTNET<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rpgbotdotnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook: rpgbotbotdotnet<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/rpgbot.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bluesky: rpgbot.bsky.social<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ash Ely<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/startplaying.games\/gm\/gravenashes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Professional Game Master on StartPlaying.Games<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/PdPtnWkSte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Join Ash&#8217;s West Marches-style PF2 Game<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GravenAshes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@GravenAshes<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@AshRavenMedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@ashravenmedia<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Randall James<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amateurjack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/amateurjack.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AmateurJack.com<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JackAmateur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@JackAmateur<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Producer Dan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lzr_illuminati\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@Lzr_illuminati<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Show Notes In this episode of the RPGBOT.Podcast we&#8217;ll be discussing the revamped character creation process in the upcoming 2024 D&amp;D 5th Edition ruleset.
