The Aasimar makes sense alongside the Tiefling. The Goliath has been a community favorite since at least 3.5. Bringing the Orc into the Player\u2019s Handbook makes sense after the removal of the Half-Elf and the Half-Orc. I\u2019m excited to see the core roster of species continue to expand beyond the Tolkien-esque line-up of previous editions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we saw in the Unearthed Arcana playtest, all of the species have gotten updated mechanics. Many 2014 core species fell out of favor as newer, more powerful options were published, so I\u2019m excited to see what WotC does with these iconic options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aasimar\u2019s transformation has been updated to allow you to choose which transformation you use every time that you use it, which is a huge upgrade. Based on the Unearthed Arcana version, the Dragonborn has also gotten some major upgrades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t know how subraces will be handled yet. Post-Tasha\u2019s materials published new subraces like the Astral Elf as standalone race entries, so it\u2019s reasonable to assume that subraces like the High Elf and the Wood Elf will have independent traits rather than being added onto the base Elf traits. But until we know more, we can only speculate.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"legacy-species\">Legacy Species<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Species from older books are usable with the new rules, but species which are included in the new PHB (dwarf, goliath, etc.) are intended to replace the older versions. If your species hasn\u2019t been updated, the PHB contains a sidebar explaining how to handle those species.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the custom origin changes introduced in Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything and the knowledge that ability score adjustments are now part of backgrounds, we can make some educated guesses. Ability score improvements will be ignored, and you\u2019ll likely be locked into any proficiencies provided by your race.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds-the-new-heavy-hitter\">Backgrounds: The New Heavy Hitter<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Backgrounds introduced in the years following Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything began to grant players feats at level 1. This sought to address the fact that almost all backgrounds provided a feature which amounted to the ability to couch surf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the new rules, backgrounds all provide an \u201cOrigin Feat\u201d. From what was said in the videos, some feats are only available from one background, while others like Alert and Skilled are available from multiple backgrounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the feat changes, backgrounds now also determine adjustments to your character\u2019s starting ability scores. Each background specifies three ability scores, and you can choose +2 to one and +1 to another or +1 to all three.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds-in-my-character-optimization-preposterous\">Backgrounds? In my Character Optimization? Preposterous!<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The changes here make backgrounds a massively important decision point when building a character. Just as races\/species have historically been locked into certain class choices, backgrounds will now be locked to specific classes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"legacy-backgrounds-what-do-we-know\">Legacy Backgrounds: What Do We Know?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t yet know how backgrounds from the 2014 rules will be handled. Adventures like Dragonlance and Strixhaven allowed players to choose backgrounds which didn\u2019t grant feats, then let players choose feats from a tailored list. Eventually this list was pared down to Skilled or Tough, so it wasn\u2019t a great list, but we also didn\u2019t have a pre-made list of Origin Feats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t know anything for certain, but we\u2019ll likely get guidance allowing players to pick an appropriate origin feat and to work with their DM to pick three appropriate ability scores. The idea of customizing backgrounds hasn\u2019t been discussed, so I\u2019m not certain if that will remain an option.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats-origin-or-otherwise\">Feats: Origin or Otherwise<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re getting a new group of feats called \u201corigin feats\u201d which are available at 1st level from your background. You can still choose Origin Feats whenever you would get another feat. Origin Feats are just a subset of the overall selection of feats which are available at level 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Characters can now select an Epic Boon feat when they reach level 19 in a class. These feats include an ability score increase which can go past the maximum of 20, and according to Jeremy Crawford they go beyond what feats can normally do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boon of Combat Prowess: Once per turn when you miss, you can decide to hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One unnamed boon gives you Truesight, while another lets you teleport when you take the Attack action or Magic action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in the 2014 rules, players who sit at level 20 long enough can accumulate enough experience to get more Epic Boons, potentially raising their ability scores to 30.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"barbarian\">Barbarian<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Rage. Persist Rage by forcing saves or by spending a Bonus Action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Danger Sense. No longer requires you to see the source of danger.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Primal Knowledge. Different from Tasha\u2019s. Use Strength as the ability for certain ability checks with non-Strength skills like Intimidation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>9. Brutal Strike. Replaces Brutal Critical. Drop Advantage from Reckless Attack to add a rider effect on hit. Combos with Weapon Mastery are expected.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11. Relentless Rage. Now heals you for a few hit points so that you don\u2019t immediately drop when you get hit again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"berserker\">Berserker<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Crawford acknowledged that Frenzy\u2019s Exhaustion effect made people unwilling to use it. Main goal was to redesign Frenzy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Frenzy. If you use Reckless Attack, you deal more damage once per turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Mindless Rage. Now ends charmed\/frightened effects rather than simply suppressing them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Retaliation. Moved from 14th level to 10.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Intimidating Presence. Moved from 10th level to 14 and buffed. Previously targeted one creature. Now as many targets as you want within 30 feet, and it\u2019s a Bonus Action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wild-heart\">Wild Heart<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Formerly \u201cTotem Warrior\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cEven more flexibility than before\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>For two of the decision points, choose them every time that you rage<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>For the other, change it every time you Long Rest<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Animals renamed to not share names across steps because players got confused and thought they were locked into one animal for their whole career<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"world-tree\">World Tree<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Allows teleportation at high level<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support party by giving themselves or allies temporary hit points<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grab enemies with the roots of the world tree<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extend reach with melee weapons<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cFiddle around\u201d with weapon mastery properties<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sounds very close to the UA playtest version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"zealot\">Zealot<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Jeremy Crawford does not like features that rely on you dying (me too!), so Zealot got some redesigns.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Warrior of the Gods. Previously just made it easier to raise you from the dead. Now it gives you a pool of dice to heal yourself, similar in concept to Lay on Hands, but only for yourself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Fanatical Focus. Now also grants a bonus to the reroll.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Rage of the Gods. No longer requires dropping to 0. Now you can activate it when you Rage. Flight, damage resistance, and thwart allies\u2019 deaths as a Reaction.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"druidnbsp\">Druid: <\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Primal Order. Warden gets medium armor and martial weapons. Magician focuses more on spellcasting; gets an extra cantrip and adds Wisdom to Arcana and Nature checks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Druidic. Now also lets you cast Speak With Animals.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Spellcasting. Spell list expanded and reviewed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Wild Shape. Major changes.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>All Druids Wild Shape as a Bonus Action<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Druids can speak in Wild Shape<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gain temporary hit points<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Wild Companion. Same as Tasha\u2019s.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wild Resurgence. Spend a spell slot to regain a Wild Shape use as often as you want. Once per long rest, turn a Wild Shape into a spell slot.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>7. Elemental Fury. Pick between weapon use or spellcasting similar to Primal Order, but Primal Order doesn\u2019t force your choice here. Add damage to weapons or add damage to cantrips with Potent Spellcasting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>15. Improved Elemental Fury. Improves options chosen at level 7. More weapon damage or extend cantrip range.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Archdruid. When you roll initiative, recover a use of Wild Shape if you don\u2019t have any. Upgrades ability to convert Wild Shape into a spell slot. No more infinite Wild Shape.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Cantrips\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Elementalism. Shape elements in various ways.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starry Wisp. \u201cRanged cantrip\u201d but no more details.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-moon\">Circle of the Moon<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Still focused on Wild Shape<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>AC is more reliable. Beasts have terrible AC, which was a big problem. Now AC is 13 + Wisdom modifier or the beast\u2019s, whichever is higher.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gain more temporary hit points from Wild Shape than most druids<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No more using the beast\u2019s separate pool of hp\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Caused issues in other parts of the system when you dropped to 0 hp (no examples given, but Disintegrate is an example)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No longer knocked out of Wild Shape when the temporary hp are depleted<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Circle of the Moon Spells\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New subclass spell list for Circle of the Moon<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Includes Cure Wounds, Moonbeam, Starry Wisp, Conjure Animals, Font of Moonlight, Mass Cure Wounds<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can be cast while in Wild Shape<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>At higher levels, Wild Shape attacks can deal radiant damage<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhanced saving throws<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Moonlight Step. Teleport as a Bonus Action. Doesn\u2019t rely on Wild Shape.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Lunar Form. When you attack in Wild Shape, deal extra radiant damage. When you use Moonlight Step, bring a friend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-land\">Circle of the Land<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Still focused on spellcasting<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now lets you change your chosen land on a Long Rest, changing the subclass spell list that you get each day<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved subclass spell lists to make them more appealing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Land\u2019s Aid. New. Gives you a new way to use Wild Shape. Burn Wild shape to cause damage to enemies and heal an ally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Natural Recovery. 2014 allowed recovering spell slots. Now lets you cast one of your level 1 subclass spells without a spell slot.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Nature\u2019s Ward. Damage resistance associated with your land type. Immune to Poisoned condition.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nature\u2019s Sanctuary. Another use for Wild Shape. Cause plants to give you and allies half cover and share your damage resistance from Nature\u2019s Ward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-sea\">Circle of the Sea<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New! Focused on the magic of oceans and storms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Storm component was crucial to avoid \u201can Aqua Man problem\u201d where the character has nothing to offer without a nearby body of water<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Wrath of the Sea. Bonus Action to spend Wild Shape to manifest a stormy ocean spray aura around themselves. Once per turn, force a target to make a Con save, taking cold damage on failure and potentially push them away.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Wrath of the Sea gets bigger by 10 feet. Gain a swim speed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Stormborn. While Wrath of the Sea is active, you gain a fly speed and resistance to cold, lightning, and thunder damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Oceanic Gift. Manifest Wrath of the Sea around another creature.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"circle-of-the-stars\">Circle of the Stars<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Largely the same as in Tasha\u2019s<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fighter-refined-and-expanded-but-still-accessible\">Fighter: Refined and Expanded, but Still Accessible<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Second Wind is usable more often.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Tactical Mind: add a die to a failed ability check<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Tactical Shift: when you use Second Wind, move half speed without Opportunity Attacks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>9. Tactical Master: Replace a weapon mastery option with Push, Sap, or Slow.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the new Fighting Style options introduced in Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything are now in the PHB. Protection style has been improved. You can change your Fighting Style when you gain a Fighter level.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"battle-master\">Battle Master<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Making maneuvers a core Fighter feature was considered, and that was originally the plan for 2024. They walked that back because it removed the ability to support multiple levels of complexity and multiple play styles within the same class. Basically, anyone who didn\u2019t want to play a Battle Master wouldn\u2019t be able to play a Fighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>All of the maneuver options introduced in Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything have made it into the Player\u2019s Handbook.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Student of War: Now also grants a skill proficiency to help them feel more well-rounded.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Redesigned \u201cKnow Your Enemy\u201d: Now has a clearer use in battle, allowing you to discern a creature\u2019s immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"champion\">Champion<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Trying to appeal to players that want a simple Fighter but also want it to be satisfying for players who like tactical options. Crawford put a lot of time into this one personally because he wanted Champion to be more fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>3. Remarkable Athlete: When you score a critical hit, you can move without provoking Opportunity Attacks. Advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks and on initiative rolls. We know that grapple\/shove work differently now, so Advantage on Athletics is going to be less useful than in the 2014 rules.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional Fighting Style moved from 10 to 7.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Heroic Warrior. Champion starts every turn in combat with Heroic Inspiration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>18. Survivor: In addition to previous benefit, Advantage on death saves, and you heal to 1 on an 18, 19, or 20.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eldritch-knight\">Eldritch Knight<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No more school of magic restrictions (same for Arcane Trickster!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can use arcane focus now<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>War Magic. Now longer eats your Bonus Action. Instead, replace one attack with a cantrip.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved War Magic. Now lets you replace 2 attacks with a level 1 or level 2 spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"psi-warrior\">Psi Warrior<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Changes are just wording changes to fit the new rules.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ranger-oh-look-controversy\">Ranger: Oh Look, Controversy<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Rangers have struggled throughout 5th edition. The 2014 Player\u2019s Handbook version of the class was riddled with issues and weak subclass options. Many of the class\u2019s features were heavily situational, so big parts of your class never mattered in most campaigns. It was consistently among the lowest-rated classes, occasionally trading places with the Monk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past decade we\u2019ve seen a fully revised ranger in Unearthed Arcana, then a pile of replacement features in Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything, then finally several rounds of revisions in the 2024 playtest process, all seeking to find a very narrow sweet spot for the Ranger. The post-Tasha\u2019s Ranger was a major improvement, especially with the powerful new subclass options, but the core of the class still had a lot of rough edges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The online response to the 2024 reveal video for the Ranger has been largely negative. In Crawford\u2019s words, \u201cThe Ranger, more than any other class in the new Player\u2019s Handbook, is a new class.\u201d That oversells the changes, but the changes are still significant. All of the Tasha\u2019s optional features are now permanent, and several of them were improved further. Spellcasting moving to level 1 makes level 1 much more satisfying, and Weapon Mastery adds some great tactical options, especially for melee builds where two-weapon fighting was previously both expected and also very difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest worry I see is over-reliance on Hunter\u2019s Mark as a central mechanic of the class. The 2014 Ranger depended on it as a crucial damage boost to the point that you often couldn\u2019t use other spells in combat. Tasha\u2019s shifted that a bit by adding Elemental Weapon and Magic Weapon to your spell list, but it just meant that now you have a different spell monopolizing your Concentration to the exclusion of any other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Ranger apparently goes back to over-reliance on Hunter\u2019s Mark. Getting some free castings each day helps a bit, but it doesn\u2019t solve the Concentration issue. High-level features and at least one subclass feature all tie into Hunter\u2019s Mark, further locking you into the spell. Even the Ranger\u2019s capstone ability is now a modest buff to Hunter\u2019s Mark, which is probably better than the 2014 Ranger\u2019s capstone, but the bar is on the floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\u2019s likely that the updated Ranger is much more satisfying to play than the 2014 version in several ways. I\u2019m frustrated by the choice to lean even harder into Hunter\u2019s Mark since we\u2019ve known the issues with Hunter\u2019s Mark since 2014. But until we get the 2024 rules, we can\u2019t know for certain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Spellcasting at level 1. They want people who are new to the class to immediately acclimate to the Ranger\u2019s martial\/caster hybrid nature. Can change one of their prepared spells on a Long Rest; previously they could only retrain one on gaining a Ranger level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Favored Enemy. Reworked again. Hunter\u2019s Mark prepared for free, and a few free castings per day. Hunter\u2019s Mark is central to the Ranger\u2019s capabilities and concept, and they wanted the resource cost to be easier, especially at low levels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Weapon Mastery!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Deft Explorer. Updated from the version introduced in Tasha\u2019s. Expertise in one skill and 2 languages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Fighting Style. No more restricted, curated list. You can also take Druidic Warrior instead of a Fighting Style.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Roving. +10 ft. speed in non-heavy armor, climb speed, and swim speed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expertise in 2 more skills. Unclear when in the level progression.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Tireless. Updated from the version introduced in Tasha\u2019s. Give yourself temporary hit points a few times per day, and whenever you finish a Short Rest you remove a level of Exhaustion.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>13. Hunter\u2019s Mark improves. Damage can\u2019t break your Concentration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>14. Nature\u2019s Veil. Turn invisible. Appears to be identical to the version introduced in Tasha\u2019s.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>17. Hunter\u2019s Mark improves again. Constant Advantage on attacks against your target.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>18. Blindsight 30 ft.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Hunter\u2019s Mark damage increases to 1d10.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beast-master\">Beast Master<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Once again described as a brand new subclass, but it sounds like they just kept the Tasha\u2019s updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Command your beast as a Bonus Action instead of as an Action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Uses 3 generic stat blocks (air\/land\/sea) like they did in Tasha\u2019s<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Share Spells sounds like it hasn\u2019t changed<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hunter\u2019s Mark now benefits your beast, too<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fey-wanderer\">Fey Wanderer<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>It appears that the Fey Wanderer has changed very little. It was already fantastic, so I\u2019m fine with this.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gloom-stalker\">Gloom Stalker<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This one got a lot of discussion, but very few specific details. It sounds as though changes were made to Dread Ambusher, but they were incredibly vague about what they were. I think it\u2019s likely that the feature was nerfed. People are going to be understandably upset about that, but hopefully the updated feature will still be fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>3. Dread Ambusher. Extra damage is no longer restricted to the first round of combat. They wanted the subclass to continue to matter beyond turn 1. There\u2019s apparently a damage boost which works a few times per day, but Crawford and Kenreck sound excited about the size of the damage boost.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintains their improved Darkvision and their invisibility to creatures relying on Darkvision<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gains some ability to make them better on initiative rolls, but the specifics weren\u2019t discussed<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cVarious mental defenses\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11. Stalker\u2019s Flurry. Psychic damage improves, and the can \u201cexude mass fear\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>15. Teleport out of harm\u2019s way when attacked.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hunter\">Hunter<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>3. Hunter\u2019s Lore. When a creature is marked by Hunter\u2019s Mark, you now know its resistances, vulnerabilities, and immunities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Hunter\u2019s Prey. 2014 had 3 options. They narrowed it to \u201cthe best choices\u201d, and now you can change it on Short or Long Rest. If they reduced the list, but it\u2019s still plural, there are now 2 choices.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>7. Defensive Tactics. Same deal as Hunter\u2019s Prey.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11. Superior Hunter\u2019s Prey. When you deal damage to a creature with Hunter\u2019s Mark on it, you can also deal the damage to another nearby creature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>15. Reaction to give yourself Resistance to one damage type \u201cuntil the end of your current turn.\u201d I\u2019m hoping that Crawford misread that, because that timing doesn\u2019t make sense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monk-focused-and-deadly\">Monk: Focused and Deadly<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Monk has struggled to be functional since at least as far back as 3rd edition, which is to say nothing of the long-standing cultural issues. The 2024 version of the Monk makes some ambitious changes to the class, making it a terrifying competent martial threat. The core mechanical functions of the class are largely the same, but everything works much better than it did in the 2014 rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players who followed the 2024 rules Unearthed Arcana changes will recognize many of the changes, but even the most-recent version of the UA Monk saw additional buffs. Sadly, they didn\u2019t get Weapon Mastery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got a smattering of details from the preview video, but despite 40 minutes of discussion, Crawford and Kenreck couldn\u2019t cover everything. We did get much more detailed information on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/posts\/1758-2024-monk-vs-2014-monk-whats-new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DnDBeyond<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Martial Arts\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Monk weapons selection expanded to all simple weapons and martial weapons with the Light property.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make the Bonus Action attack without taking the Attack action first.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The changes here benefit from the core changes to Unarmed Strike, which now allows you to grapple\/shove. Monks get to use Dexterity instead of their Strength for the grapple\/shove DCs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Martial Arts damage die is one step higher through the full level range<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Monk\u2019s Focus (Formerly \u201cKi\u201d)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Now called \u201cFocus Points\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flurry of Blows. 1 FP. 2 attacks as a Bonus Action. No longer requires you to Attack first.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patient Defense. Disengage as a Bonus Action. 1 FP to also Dodge.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Step of the Wind. Dash as a Bonus Action. 1 FP to also Disengage and double jump distance for the turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Uncanny Metabolism. When rolling initiative, regain all of your FP and some hp. Once per Long Rest. FP still recharges on Short Rest, but this will do a lot to help with resource starvation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Deflect Attacks. Replaces Deflect Missiles. Deflect attacks which deal bludgeoning\/piercing\/slashing damage as a Reaction, reducing damage by 1d10 + Monk level. If you reduce damage to 0, spend 1 FP to damage another creature. Upgrades at level 13 when you add Deflect Energy. Allowing Monks to massively reduce damage from one attack will make them exceptionally deadly against single foes. With decent AC, Monks may be functionally untouchable for many enemies even if they have multiple attacks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Stunning Strike. Now only usable once per turn, but if the target succeeds on their save, their speed is halved and the next attack against them has Advantage. This will prevent Monks from spamming Stunning Strike, which was something I actively advocated for because against important enemies it\u2019s a winning strategy. Now we\u2019ll have to actually exert some effort.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Empowered Strike. Choose to deal Force damage instead of your usual damage type. It seems like making attacks magic to overcome damage resistances is less of a thing. I\u2019m curious to see what monster stats look like.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Disciplined Survivor. Reroll saving throws. Level wasn\u2019t mentioned.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Heightened Focus.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Flurry of Blows. Three attacks instead of 2.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patient Defense. Grants temporary hp.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Step of the Wind. Bring a friend with you. If you grapple, you may be able to bring additional friends, turning the Monk into the party\u2019s preferred method of transportation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Self Restoration. At end of turn, end charmed\/frightened\/poisoned conditions. No action cost. Also, you don\u2019t need food or water.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>13. Deflect Energy. Use Deflect Attacks on any damage type.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>15. Perfect Focus. Backup option for Uncanny Metabolism. Guarantees that you start every fight with 4 FP.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>18. Superior Defense. Spend 3 Focus Points at the start of your turn to gain resistance to all damage types except Force for 1 minute. Appears to replace Empty Body.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Body and Mind. +4 Dex and +4 Wis. A huge mathematical boost for what is still the most MAD class in the game. Monks who managed to hit 20 Dex and 20 Wis will suddenly enjoy AC of 24 and save DC\u2019s of 21.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warrior-of-mercy\">Warrior of Mercy<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Flurry of Healing Hands can now be used a number of times per Long Rest equal to Wisdom modifier rather than as often as you can afford to use Flurry of Blows.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warrior-of-the-elements\">Warrior of the Elements<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Way of the Four Elements was often the lowest-rated subclass in the 2014 PHB<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Elemental Attunement. Increase reach of their unarmed strikes\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cast \u201cElementalism\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elemental Strikes. Spend FP to activate. Deal elemental damage instead of normal unarmed strike damage, and force the target to save or forcibly move them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. AOE elemental damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>11. Fly speed and swim speed while running Elemental Attunement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>17. Elemental Epitome. Elemental damage resistance which you can choose at the start of each of your turns, cause damage as you move around the battlefield, deal additional elemental damage once per turn.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warrior-of-shadow\">Warrior of Shadow<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pass Without Trace and Silence have been removed<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Opportunist feature has been removed<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. See in your own Darkness spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>11. Improved Shadow Step. Can now spend 1 FP to start or end the teleportation outside of dim light or darkness. Make an unarmed strike immediately after teleporting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>17. Cloak of Shadows. Spend FP to turn invisible, become partially incorporeal. Pass through occupied spaces and use Flurry of Blows without spending FP.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warrior-of-the-open-hand\">Warrior of the Open Hand<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open Hand Technique blocks Opportunity Attacks rather than all Reactions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Wholeness of Body. Now a Bonus Action instead of an Action, and can be used multiple times per day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fleet Step. When you use a Bonus Action for anything except Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quivering Palm. Now deals damage instead of dropping the target to 0. Deals lots of damage on a failed save, deals some damage on a successful save.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"paladin-more-accessible-but-less-bursty\">Paladin: More Accessible, but Less Bursty<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The paladin splash art is an orc paladin with flowing red hair and a glowing sword. I love it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Spellcasting at level 1. In the 2014 rules, the Artificer was the only half caster that got spellcasting at level 1. I\u2019m curious to see how this affects multiclass spellcasting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Weapon Mastery!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Fighting Style has changed for the Paladin. No more restricted, curated list! You now get all the same options as the Fighter <em>and<\/em> you can skip a Fighting Style and take 2 cleric cantrips.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Divine Smite is now called \u201cPaladin\u2019s Smite\u201d. Divine Smite is now a spell. Divine Smite lets you have it prepared permanently, and you get one free smite per day. Since Divine Smite is now a spell, you\u2019ll only be able to use it once per turn, so no more bursting enemies down with multiple smits in one turn.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Channel Divinity. Paladins now get 2+ uses per day and recover 1 on a Short Rest; 2014 only got 1 per rest.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Divine Sense is now a Channel Divinity option, and lasts 10 minutes rather than 1 round. The design team wanted it to be useful in social situations, which typically take several minutes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Find Steed prepared for free, and you can cast it once per day without a spell slot.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Find Steed gets more powerful with higher-level spell slots, and has its own stat block rather than starting from a monster stat block. We saw this in the Unearthed Arcana playtest, and my group brought it into our ongoing game. It worked very well when our paladin remembered that he had a horse.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Abjure Foes. Use Channel Divinity against enemies. Based on several similar subclass features.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paladin\u2019s aura is now a single aura that gains additional abilities rather than multiple auras, sometimes with different sizes. The aura now uses a new type of AOE called \u201cemanation\u201d. These AOEs existed, but never had a shared name like \u201csphere\u201d or \u201cline\u201d.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yes, Pathfinder 2e has had this for several years.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-devotion\">Oath of Devotion<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Activate Sacred Weapon as part of an attack. Doing it as an Action was so costly that many players never used it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Replaced Purity of Spirit with Smite of Protection. When you use Divine Smite, you and allies inside your Aura of Protection gain half cover.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>20. Holy Nimbus. Now a Bonus Action rather than an Action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-glory\">Oath of Glory<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Peerless Athlete now lasts an hour rather than 10 minutes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Aura of Alacrity now applies to allies that pass through your aura rather than only those that start in the aura.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Oath of Glory gets the new spell \u201cYolan\u2019s Regal Presence\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-the-ancients\">Oath of the Ancients<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Aura provides resistance to necrotic, psychic, and radiant damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nature\u2019s Wrath range increased<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Undying Sentinel now allows you to heal to half hp<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oath-of-vengeance\">Oath of Vengeance<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Vow of Enmity. No longer a Bonus Action; you use it when you take the Attack action. You can also transfer it to another target after killing your target.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avenging Angel. Now a Bonus Action rather than an Action, and it lasts for an hour so that you can chase your enemies if they flee.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rogue\">Rogue<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1. Rogues get Weapon Mastery.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Thieves\u2019 Cant now gives you an additional language on top of Thieves\u2019 Cant.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Steady Aim. Now a permanent feature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Cunning Strike. The big new feature; big hit in the Unearthed Arcana series. Trade some Sneak Attack damage dice for other effects. Eventually add multiple effects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reliable Talent at lower level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slippery Mind. Now proficiency in both Wisdom and Charisma saves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arcane-trickster\">Arcane Trickster<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Minor modifications to integrate with other rules updates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spellcasting no longer restricted by school of magic, and can use an arcane focus<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can now use Mage Hand with Cunning Strike to trip enemies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"assassin\">Assassin<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2014 version struggled in play because Surprise was so difficult. Surprise rules have changed, and they want Assassin\u2019s features to be more reliable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Assassinate. Advantage on initiative. Extra damage doesn\u2019t rely on surprise, just on the target not having acted yet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You now get tool kits when you get proficiency with them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Infiltration Expertise. Still includes some mimicry, but now also allows you to use Steady Aim while moving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Envenom Weapons. Boosts the poison option of Cunning Strike.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Death Strike. No longer relies on Surprise; just needs to hit target before they act in combat.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"soulknife\">Soulknife<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Can now use psychic blades on Opportunity Attacks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Psychic blades have the Vex Weapon Mastery property<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thief\">Thief<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fast Hands. Can now activate magic items as a Bonus Action. This was a common mistake in the 2014 rules, and it felt like an obvious thing which Fast Hands should allow.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Second-Story Work. Now use Dexterity instead of Strength for jumping, and now gives you an actual climb speed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supreme Sneak. New Cunning Strike option, allowing you to attack while hidden and remain hidden.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use Magic Device. Attune to up to 4 items, chance to use charge items without spending charges, and use spell scrolls. This appears to replace the old version, which had a very high chance of never having any effect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"warlock-now-even-more-customizable\">Warlock: Now Even More Customizable<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yes, they still have 2014 Pact Magic<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.

Magical Cunning. Recover some spell slots.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Added a way to directly talk to your patron<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Class spell list expanded (apparently true for everyone). Not as long as the Sorcerer or the Wizard.

Can now change a cantrip on every long rest (no one else can do this)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1. Ritual Adept. New (sort of). Allows Wizards to cast any ritual in their spellbook. Not actually a new capability, but many players overlooked it in the Spellcasting feature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>2. Scholar. Expertise in a skill from the specified list (Arcana, etc.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5. Memorize Spell. On a Short Rest, swap one of your prepared spells.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On a personal note: A lot of folks joke that I love wizards because they\u2019re the best at everything. They are, but that\u2019s not why I love them. It\u2019s the versatility. I\u2019m thrilled to hear that the D&amp;D design team sees the Wizard\u2019s versatility as its greatest strength, and that they\u2019re leaning into that instead of trying to put them at the front of a damage output arms race.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abjurer\">Abjurer<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many spells changed schools to become Abjuration spells<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The \u201cX Savant\u201d features were reworked for all subclasses. 2014 version was generally forgotten and rarely helpful. Now gives you 2 more spells of your school at level 1, then another of your school for free whenever you gain a Wizard level.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Arcane Ward. Resistance\/immunity now applied before Arcane Ward takes damage.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Spellbreaker. Always have Counterspell and Dispel Magic prepared. Cast Dispel Magic as a Bonus Action.

Third Eye. Can now be used as a Bonus Action. Darkvision option now 120 feet.

Potent Cantrip. Formerly only worked on cantrips which called for saving throws, but there weren\u2019t enough of those. Now applies to all damage cantrips. Also moved down to level 3.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"illusionist\">Illusionist<\/h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Illusion Savant updated<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3. Improved Illusions. Can now cast illusions without Verbal components. Illusion spell ranges increased by 60 feet. Minor Illusion with vision+sound at the same time, and can cast it as a Bonus Action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>6. Phantasmal Creatures. Summon Beast and Summon Fey always prepared. Can change spell school to illusion. Can cast each once per day without a spell slot, but they have half hit points.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10. Illusory Self. Can recharge with a spell slot.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The rules glossary now includes advice on how to handle illusions, answering common questions about illusions, which should make gameplay for illusionists more consistent and less subject to the DM\u2019s whims.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapon-mastery-the-shiny-new-toy\">Weapon Mastery: The Shiny New Toy<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>For classes with the Weapon Mastery feature, Weapon Mastery options now add a rider effect when you hit with a weapon. This adds some much-needed tactical versatility to martial characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very easy to miss among all of the other information: Todd Kenreck and Jeremy Crawford clarified that while the Nick mastery allows you to take the additional attack from two-weapon during your Attack action, it doesn\u2019t prevent you from making another attack using your Bonus Action. This means that a level 1 character wielding a weapon with Nick, such as a dagger, could <a href=\"https:\/\/youtube.com\/clip\/UgkxxMNzyVFE_8SBvP2sgf3cukiWdpeCBnRy?si=uYgPDeH4OmSfr-tS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attack three times in a turn<\/a>. This is surprising, and I\u2019m curious to see if they misspoke.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Rangers get mastery in two weapons at a time. Fighters get more, and their number increases with level. Rogues get Weapon Mastery based on a discussion of the Vex mastery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crawford specifically discussed using two-weapon fighting to perform combos using weapons with different masteries, such as using Vex to gain Advantage on the attack with your second weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We saw two rounds of Unearthed Arcana documents with versions of the weapons table, including Weapon Mastery. Based on the discussion in the video, it sounds like the masteries work as they did in those documents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy Crawford ended the video on Weapon Mastery by discussing the fact that Weapon Mastery can apply on every attack. Because it can apply so often, they needed to keep the complexity low to avoid bogging down the game. For comparison, Tales of the Valiant\u2019s \u201cWeapon Options\u201d system requires you to use the Weapon Option instead of dealing damage, so Weapon Options are more of a precision instrument than a button that mash every turn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complexity of Weapon Mastery slowing down combat was one of my biggest concerns when Weapon Mastery was introduced, but I\u2019ll withhold judgment until I get more time playing with Weapon Mastery. It\u2019s almost certainly worth the added complexity to make martial characters more exciting, but it\u2019s not going to address the long-lived criticism that D&amp;D combat takes too long.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"surprise-rules-no-longer-a-win-condition\">Surprise Rules: No Longer a Win Condition<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Changed to no longer prevent combatants from acting for a turn, unbalancing the game in some circumstances by trivializing encounters when players surprised their enemies. Instead, surprised creatures now have disadvantage on initiative rolls.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"changes-to-spell-lists\">Changes to Spell Lists<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Spell lists are now in the class\u2019s description, rather than being in the Spells chapter. These tables also detail the spell\u2019s school, its components, and whether or not it requires Concentration, making these tables a useful reference table rather than simply a bulleted list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crawford also hinted at new spells on the spell lists. We saw a couple new options in the Unearthed Arcana playtest documents, but we don\u2019t know what has made it into the final version of the book.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"changes-to-spells\">Changes to Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>According to Crawford, the 2024 Player\u2019s Handbook includes at least 30 spells not in the 2014 PHB, and every spell from the 2014 PHB has been revisited. Answers to common questions about spells have often been included in the spells\u2019 updated descriptions, so they\u2019re easier to understand without actually changing. Some spells have had their wording shortened to simplify them without changing their effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spells\u2019 descriptions now also list what classes have that spell on their list so that you don\u2019t need to flip around as much. The Ritual tag has been moved within spell descriptions to make it easier to find. In general, it sounds like the formatting got a nice quality of life improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some high-level damage spells had their damage increased so that they\u2019re more satisfying to use. Flame Strike was listed as an example. High-level spells were also updated to make their effects clearer in many cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healing spells have been upgraded to make them feel more satisfying to cast, but we didn\u2019t get details on how. Casting Cure Wounds only to have an enemy stab your target for the same amount of damage has felt awful for as long as DnD has had magical healing, which is why so few people are willing to cast anything except Healing Word during combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wording of many spells has been standardized to make their effects easier to understand. The new \u201cemanation\u201d AOE will cover a lot of spells like Word of Radiance and Spirit Guardians.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shapeshifting spells like Polymorph have been updated so that they no longer grant a secondary pool of hp. Instead, they give you temporary hit points. We\u2019ve seen the same change with Wild Shape in the Unearthed Arcana documents. I\u2019m excited to see how this will affect spellcasters like the Wizard who don\u2019t have as much hp as the Druid to fall back on.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"summoning-spells\">Summoning Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The excellent summoning spells in Tasha\u2019s were brought into the PHB, and some of them got new options. Many of them now have art. Kenreck mentioned summoning a construct, which wasn\u2019t an option in Tasha\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conjure-x-spells\">Conjure X Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The 2014 versions required hunting for stat blocks, added a bunch of creatures to the battlefield, bogged down play, and made DMs sad. They\u2019ve all been redesigned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, these spells now summon spirits that help you in some way. Crawford said that the response to those versions in Unearthed Arcana was positive, so I imagine that there were very few changes. I remember those spells all being worse versions of Spirit Guardians, so I hope that they at least feel more distinct now.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-spells\">Other Spells<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Many spells were brought in to support specific subclasses, such as the new Elementalism for Warrior of the Elements Monk and Dragon Breath for the Draconic Sorcerer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re also getting some new spells that we\u2019ve never seen before, often tied to established DnD canon characters. Yolande\u2019s Regal Presence and Jolarze\u2019s Storm of Radiance were listed as examples. Tasha\u2019s Bubbling Cauldron lets you create potions. No further details on any of the three.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Blade Ward and Resistance. Buffed so that someone might actually use them, but no details on how.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chromatic Orb. Added the ability for the orb to bounce. It sounds like they combined it with Chaos Bolt.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cloud of Daggers. Now lets you move the cloud. The static position of the cloud bothered Crawford personally, including in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, so he pushed for this change.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dragons\u2019 Breath. Brought in so that it could be given to the Draconic Sorcerer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elementalism. Answer to the various elemental cantrips. They considered bringing all four of the elemental cantrips into the PHB, but didn\u2019t.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Guidance. Now buffs a chosen skill, and works for any ability check for that skill for the duration.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prayer of Healing. Now grants the benefits of a Short Rest once per day<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Produce Flame. Allegedly easier to use now. Apparently casting it was annoying both at the table and in Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, so Crawford set out to fix it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Steel Wind Strike. Brought in because people like it on the Dragon.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toll the Dead, Synaptic Static, Mind Spike, Mind Sliver, Ice Knife, Vitriolic Sphere, Word of Radiance all in the PHB<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starry Whisps, Sorcerous Burst new from the 2024 UA playtest<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wish. Now has more default options and more to say about the ramifications of casting the spell, including specific guidance on what happens if you mess with Sigil or the Lady of Pain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"crafting\">Crafting<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The new Player\u2019s Handbook will apparently include updated descriptions for tools, including what you can craft with those tools. Spell scrolls will be in the book both for purchase and for crafting. It\u2019s not clear how crafting will work, but Jeremy Crawford did state that the Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide\u2019s rules for crafting magic items will be much more straightforward than those in the 2014 DMG.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-it-means-especially-for-character-optimization\">What it Means (Especially for Character Optimization)<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Building characters has a fun new lever in the updated Backgrounds. Since ability scores and feats are now attached to backgrounds, they\u2019ll fill a mechanical niche that historically has been filled by races through most of DnD\u2019s history. Creating new backgrounds will also require much less mechanical consideration than designing new races, so I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll see an abundance of options both in the Player\u2019s Handbook and in future supplements. I\u2019m sure homebrewers and 3rd-party creators will find fertile ground here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, losing the Tasha\u2019s-era flexibility in Ability Score Increases means that we\u2019re more constrained in our build choices under the 2024 rules. Constraints like this impose interesting cost-benefit comparisons which I really enjoy when building characters. Do I take the obvious background? Or do I pick one that has worse ability scores so that I can get a feat that\u2019s really good for my build?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes to races\/species which we\u2019ve seen seem to follow what we say in the playtest. We still don\u2019t have precise text, but I expect that weaker species will be brought in line with the more powerful species in the Player\u2019s Handbook. We know that the Goliath is getting some new options and the Dragonborn is getting an upgrade, but otherwise we don\u2019t have answers yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Species will remain an important decision point in optimizing character, but unusual species\/class pairings may be more viable than they were in the 2014 rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes to classes seem very close to the Unearthed Arcana documents so far. We saw a lot of changes throughout the 2 year UA process, so it will be interesting to see what they kept.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weapon Mastery is going to be huge for martials. I think folks will quickly find ways to make Weapon Mastery a problem since it applies to every attack. For example: the Slow mastery imposing a speed penalty when combined with other options like Ray of Frost can reduce enemies\u2019 speed to the point that they functionally can\u2019t get into melee. The ability to lock melee-only enemies out of range this easily will necessitate changes to encounter design, and even then it remains to be seen what will remain viable to challenge the players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that said, I dislike some of the changes. Converting Divine Smite into a spell is absolutely going to limit Paladin players in a way that\u2019s less fun than the 2014 version. I want to be able to cast Shield of Faith, then charge into battle and smite things on turn 1. That\u2019s not allowed now. Limiting Divine Smite to \u201conce one each of your turns\u201d would have solved the burst problem just as well with minimal change to the Paladin\u2019s gameplay. They did that with plenty of other features, so it\u2019s not clear to me why it didn\u2019t happen here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing grapple and shove to unarmed strikes does address the overpowered <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\">grapple\/shove combo<\/a> somewhat, but now you can grapple on Opportunity Attacks, thereby preventing enemies from moving away. Even characters with dismal Strength can capitalize on this because even strong creatures will sometimes roll poorly. They\u2019ve essentially just moved the problem from Athletics checks to unarmed strikes rather than solving how easy it was to be unstoppable at grappling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m also worried about the adherence to a minimum DC of 15 when hiding which we saw in the last several UA documents. That stability makes it nearly certain that the rule will make it into the PHB. This would mean that a level 1 character purpose-built for stealth has a 50% chance to successfully hide, or a 60% chance if they have Expertise in Stealth. This would make low-level rogues extremely difficult to play, not to mention the frustration of literally anyone else trying to hide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s still a lot that we don\u2019t know, but with a brand new Player\u2019s Handbook coming, there\u2019s a fresh landscape for character optimization. I\u2019m excited to see what we can build in the new rules landscape, but I\u2019m certain that there will be both pros and cons of the updated ruleset.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Throughout this week, the Dungeons and Dragons design team has been revealing content and rules changes in the upcoming 2024 rules.
