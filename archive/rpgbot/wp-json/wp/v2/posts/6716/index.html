Nearly never useful.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-orange\">Orange<\/span>: OK options, or useful options\n\t\tthat only apply in rare circumstances.

Useful often.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"rating-blue\">Blue<\/span>: Fantastic options, often essential\n\t\tto the function of your character. Useful very frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"where-did-this-come-from\">Where did this come from?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Short answer: I stole it. I\u2019ve been wrongly credited with creating the 4-color rating system for years and I try really hard to clarify that this wasn\u2019t my idea. I stole it from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChrisHonkala\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Treantmonk<\/a>. (Don\u2019t worry, he told me that he doesn\u2019t mind)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started RPGBOT some time in 2013, and at the time Treantmonk was basically the only big name in character optimization for Pathfinder. He had the most and the best character optimization content, and his rating system had mostly become a standard. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not the only reason why I adopted it, but historical context helps.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-4-tiers\">Why 4 tiers?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of other rating systems in character optimization content. 5 tiers is common, but I\u2019ve also seen people use 7, 8, and 10 tiers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stuck to 4 tiers specifically because there is no \u201cmiddle\u201d. There\u2019s no \u201cthis is fine\u201d rating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Character options aren\u2019t like movies where if you see a bad one you\u2019re out two hours and maybe the price of a ticket. If you pick something, you might be stuck with it for months or years depending on how long your game runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s little room for something to be \u201cfine\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When there\u2019s a clear middle, ratings frequently form a sort of bell curve where the peak of the bell is in the middle and most things fall into that rating. If half of the things available are rated 3\/5, it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s actually worth picking from those options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you stretch the rating scale to add more tiers, the distinction between each step gets smaller and less meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself: if you\u2019re considering a movie with an 8\/10 rating and a movie with a 9\/10 rating, how much better is the 9\/10? Probably not very much. Now if you&#8217;re looking at a movie rated 3\/5 compared to one rated 4\/5, that&#8217;s still only one step on the scale, but it&#8217;s the difference between a movie that&#8217;s &#8220;fine&#8221; or &#8220;okay&#8221; versus one that&#8217;s &#8220;good&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-the-colors\">Why the colors?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Again: I stole the colors from Treantmonk. It\u2019s a simple color pallet that\u2019s easy for most people to distinguish at a glance, so people can easy scroll through articles and look for green and blue stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as has been pointed out to me, if you have color vision differences, the color ratings can be totally unusable. For people who aren&#8217;t familiar with color vision differences, consider <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Color_blindness\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Color_blindness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">red-green color blindness<\/a>: people with this condition have trouble distinguishing red and green from one another, and red and green are half of my color rating scale.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-the-stars-and-the-colors\">Why the stars AND the colors?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The star ratings are there primarily to make my content accessible for readers with color vision differences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don\u2019t worry: the stars and colors <em>always<\/em> match. I\u2019m using some code that I wrote to apply the colors and stars at the same time and I would have to break that code site-wide to make the colors and stars diverge.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-you-decide-on-ratings\">How do you decide on ratings?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>My short descriptions of the four rating tiers make it pretty clear what I\u2019m looking for when I rate something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also try to do math when I can. Sometimes I can boil something down to numbers, and when I can do that it becomes much easier to justify a rating for something.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-your-rating-system-ever-change\">Will your rating system ever change?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>No. I like it, and it has worked for 8+ years without change across several game systems. I suspect that it will continue to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have made very minor changes to the clarifying text over time to make the ratings more sensible for new readers, but the ideas behind the ratings have never changed and likely never will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019m also not good at predicting the future. Assume that the answer is \u201cno\u201d until I say otherwise.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re familiar with RPGOT&#8217;s character optimization content, you\u2019re familiar with my 4-tier rating system, but you might not know where it came from or why it works the way it does.
