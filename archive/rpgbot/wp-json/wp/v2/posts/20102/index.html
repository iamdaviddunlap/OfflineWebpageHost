Gaps in the current rules are filled by the pre-existing rules from the SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"character-creation\">Character Creation<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>When we\u2019ve spoken to Kobold Press on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/tales-of-the-valiant-with-teasers-rpgbot-news-s3e35\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast<\/a>, one of the design goals that the kobolds shared was that they wanted to streamline character creation so that players no longer feel the need to jump back and forth in the process, and the changes that they\u2019ve made are a clear improvement, though there\u2019s still some room to improve further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The section begins with a 7-step explanation of how to create your character, plus a \u201cfinal steps\u201d sidebar with reminders to fill in various bits from your build such as your size and your spell slots. The text for determining your ability scores is mixed right into the middle of this section, which is a weird editing choice since none of the other steps are handled this way. Step 1: X, Step 2: Y, Step 3: Determine our ability scores <em>right now<\/em>, Step 4: Z, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ability-scores\">Ability Scores<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As with historical versions of DnD, character creation starts with ability scores. If you know how ability scores work in 5e, that hasn\u2019t changed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, determining your ability scores has changed significantly. Perhaps most notably, racial ability score changes are entirely gone. This means that once you set your ability scores, you don\u2019t need to worry about them again during character creation. This is a welcome change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The method for rolling is 4d6 drop lowest, but with the added benefit of a +2 increase and a +1 increase which can raise ability scores to max of 18. This gives players some control over the randomness so that they\u2019re somewhat insulated from poor rolls, but there\u2019s also no explicit rule for rerolling, so it\u2019s still possible to have horrid stats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point buy method has changed from the 5e rules. You get a larger pool of points, but the formula for spending them is also different. In addition, you can now buy scores up to 18, rather than 15 in the 5e rules. Of course, 5e assumes that racial ability score modifiers exist, but in Tales of the Valiant you buy your scores and you\u2019re done. The ability to buy an 18 is exciting for SAD characters like wizards, but the cost to do so is significant enough that you\u2019ll need to dump multiple ability scores to achieve it. I anticipate a lot of 18\/14\/14\/10\/8\/8 builds for SAD classes. MAD classes will probably land somewhere very close to the Standard Array.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Standard Array has historically been an unfair option for MAD classes like the Monk and the Paladin. The scale of the scores meant that such characters couldn\u2019t get the ability scores needed to make their class features work, but SAD classes like the Rogue and the Wizard did just fine. The updated array includes three reasonably high scores, making MAD classes considerably more viable when using the Standard Array.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, these are meaningful improvements both in the simplicity of the rules and the ability to customize your build in a way that\u2019s mechanically satisfying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s not part of initial ability score generation, it\u2019s also important to consider Ability Score Increases here. In 5e, it\u2019s +2 to one ability score, +1 to two of them, or a feat. In ToV it\u2019s +1 to one score, plus a Talent.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classes\">Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The alpha presents the four most central classes, and only up to level 5. Kobold Press is focusing on the absolute foundations of the system, and they want to get those right before they start expanding into the rest of the content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each class\u2019s subclass is now granted at 3rd level, similar to One DnD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won\u2019t address changes to the core spellcasting mechanics here; instead, see Spellcasting, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many class features scale based on Proficiency Bonus. I have repeatedly highlight the inherent multiclass abuse here since Tasha\u2019s Cauldron of Everything introduced this design concept. It looks like ToV hasn\u2019t moved away from PB scaling for low-level class features, but without multiclassing addressed anywhere in the alpha, we can\u2019t definitively say that it\u2019s an issue.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cleric\">Cleric<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>Manifestation of Faith is a new 1st-level feature for the Cleric. Like the \u201cDivine Order\u201d feature in the One DnD playtest, this feature distinguishes heavily-armored martial clerics from spellcasting-focused clerics. Manifestation of Faith also includes a once-per-turn damage bonus equal to your Proficiency Bonus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives the cleric a scaling damage boost rather than waiting for 8th level, and since the bonus is \u201conce per turn\u201d rather than \u201conce on each of your turns\u201d, martial clerics can make meaningful Opportunity Attacks. I think this is an interesting improvement, but it does also make 1-level class dips into cleric even more appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Channel Divinity: Turn the Profane replaces Turn Undead. It works the same way, but now also affects fiends. This is a fun idea, but I think it will be hard to explain for evil clerics. I would love to see players given more choice here, such as the ability to turn elementals, fey, etc. depending on their alignment, their deity, or their domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The playtest includes two domains: Life and War.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Life domain is nearly identical to the 5e Life domain, except that Channel Divinity: Preserve Life now heals for a fixed 30 points rather than scaling with level. This will make the feature more impactful at low levels (starting with 5 points at level 1 feels bad), but it will also make the feature obsolete very quickly. Something like 10 + 5 times your cleric level could work, providing a higher initial value than 5e, but also keeping the feature impactful as players gain levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>War domain sees more changes. The domain spell list has been reworked, likely because War Domain is not in the SRD and contains non-SRD spells on its spell list. The new spells seem perfectly fine, though maybe less \u201con theme\u201d than the 5e spells. I hope we\u2019ll see Kobold Press experiment with newly-written spells here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Channel Divinity: Mark of Triumph replaces Guided Strike. Guided Strike was a boost to the cleric\u2019s attack, making low-level attack spells like Inflict Wounds much more accurate. However, clerics in 5e are bad at using weapons (yes, even with Divine Strikes), and attack spells mostly disappear after 2nd-level spells, so the feature was rarely impactful beyond low levels. Mark of Triumph replaces that with a shared buff which gives you entire party Advantage on one attack against a targeted creature, allowing the party to cooperate and focus their attacks on a single high-priority foe. This will remain impactful and satisfying across the level range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Disciple of War feature is ToV\u2019s answer to 5e\u2019s War Priest feature, granting the Cleric an additional weapon attack. Disciple of War grants an additional attack PB times per day as part of an Attack action, which both encourages clerics to use the Attack action and avoids taxing their action economy. I\u2019m on the fence about whether this or the One DnD version is better (One DnD\u2019s is a Bonus Action but doesn\u2019t require the Attack action). I think it will come down to whether ToV can make weapons appealing for clerics beyond low levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, the full 20-level version of the Cleric has been recently shared to Kickstarter backers.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fighter\">Fighter<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>5e\u2019s Second Wind has been replaced by Last Stand, which remains unchanged from the rules preview. Instead of a Bonus Action to heal, you can spend hit dice as a Reaction when you take damage that reduces you below half hp. I dug into the implications in our review of the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/tales-of-the-valiant-kickstarter-rules-preview-a-review\/\">rule preview<\/a>, but tl;dr: I love this feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Martial Action, ToV\u2019s replacement for Fighting Style, has seen some improvements. Rather than a (usually) passive benefit, Martial Action always uses a Bonus Action to do something. New in the alpha, you can either use a Weapon Option (we\u2019ll discuss those below under Equipment) or one of your chosen Martial Action options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The text of the feature states that these Martial Actions improve at higher levels, but the classes currently only go up to 5th level, so we don\u2019t have details on those improvements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Aim: The answer to Archery. Rather than boost all of your ranged attacks, it boosts your first attack against a chosen target. This is less useful for fighters than Archery because fighters rely on multiple attacks, but it\u2019s more useful for rogues, making this a great class dip. I do like that it scales, but the DPR math is extremely complicated because builds can vary so much.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Guard: The answer to Protection, Guard makes it easy to get into an enemy\u2019s face and debuff one of their attacks. Unlike Protection, this also protects you, which is a huge improvement. However, beware the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/the-tank-fallacy\/\">Tank Fallacy<\/a>. Players will need to ensure that their opportunity attacks are scary enough to prevent your target from walking past you to eat your friends. Unfortunately, it also competes for space with the Bash Weapon Option.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quick Strike: The answer to 5e\u2019s two-weapon fighting style. Adding your ability score to your off-hand weapon attack was mathematically terrible starting at level 5, so for fighters, two-weapon fighting was the worst option available to them beyond low levels. Quick Strike adds a second off-hand attack. A qualifying weapon will typically deal 1d6 damage, which means that the second attack\u2019s expected DPR will actually be less than adding your ability modifier to a single attack. However, if you can find other on-hit damage boosts, the additional attack can quickly become very impactful. It\u2019s hard to say if this will be good or not given the limited content currently available.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wind Up: The answer to Great Weapon Fighting. GWF felt satisfying for people whose dice rolls are consistently poor, but mathematically it had almost no impact. Wind Up is essentially Aim for two-handed weapons, which is a huge improvement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The alpha presents two subclasses: The Spell Blade and the Weapon Master.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spell Blade is the equivalent of 5e\u2019s Eldritch Knight. The Spell Blade follow\u2019s 5e\u2019s spell school restrictions, and the spellcasting appears to be the same. Weapon Bond has been replaced by Enchant weapon, which, rather than being a quickly-forgotten novelty, allows you to add a +1 to a weapon. Notably, this bonus explicitly works on already-magic weapons and <em>stacks with pre-existing bonuses<\/em>. It will prevent you from casting Magic Weapon on the weapon because it\u2019s now magical, but that\u2019s still fantastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the Spell Blade can select talents from both the Martial and Magic lists. More on Talents below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Weapon Master is the equivalent to 5e\u2019s Battle Master. \u201cStunts\u201d (equivalent to Maneuvers) work similarly, but the \u201csuperiority dice\u201d mechanic has been abandoned.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Weapon Master has access to all of the options rather than picking and choosing. Instead, the different Stunts are more restrictive about what weapons qualify, so choosing your weapon determines your Stunt options. Largely this is fine, but it does mean that introducing more Stunt options in supplements would require complicated new rules (trade an existing option to take new ones), or would be a straight buff to the subclass. The text does specify that you get more options at higher levels, so maybe the current options are fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stunt options have not changed from the Kickstarter preview. They need a bit of rebalancing, and I think we need more options, but some of the ideas here are really fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Arcing Strike. Cleave to a secondary target for half damage. Fantastic on a big crit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cheap Shot: Make a free unarmed strike as part of the Attack action after you hit. Could be good with a bit of optimization, but may not be worth the effort to do so compared to other options.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make it Count: Make a single attack at +10 to hit instead of potentially multiple attacks. With Aim and Wind Up available, I\u2019m not sure if this will see use beyond low levels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Parry: Mitigate some damage as a Reaction. The scaling is poor, so it likely won\u2019t see much use beyond low levels, especially with Last Stand competing for space. Both options use a Reaction and mitigate damage on a nearly identical scale, and Last Stand uses a different (and larger) pool of resources.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Redirect: Potentially save a missed attack, but only works well against crowds since the second target must be within 5 feet of the first.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Riposte: An easy way to get an additional attack as a Reaction on a regular basis.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run Through: Arcing Strike, but for piercing weapons.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shifting Strike: Only situationally useful, but it can let you move through an enemy\u2019s space, which has some interesting tactical implications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the Weapon Master chooses 3 weapons to master and can reroll a damage die once per turn with those weapons. It\u2019s neat, but mathematically it\u2019s not a huge impact.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rogue\">Rogue<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The rogue has seen some changes from the Kickstart preview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I noted in our review of the preview that the Rogue inexplicably got proficiency with the longsword. Their proficiencies have again changed, and now they get proficiency with all simple weapons plus martial weapons with the Light property. This notably omits the Rapier, but you can still select a rapier as starting equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rogue appears to be otherwise identical to the 5e version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alpha document includes two subclasses: the Enforcer, and the Thief.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enforcer is equivalent to 5e\u2019s Assassin. Ambush is equivalent to Assassinate, but guarantees Advantage on your first attack and gives you the automatic critical hit if you hit a Surprised creature. Surprise is difficult to attain in 5e, so hopefully that improves in ToV. OneDnD handled the issue by making Assassinate much less impactful, but also much easier to attain. There\u2019s room to find a different compromise which may be more satisfying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold-blooded is a new feature, giving the Rogue a way to better handle groups of relatively weak enemies. Normally it\u2019s easy to bring down a rogue by swarming them with low-CR creatures, so this is a fun addition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enforcers can also select Talents from the Martial Talents list, where rogues typically select from the Technical Talents list. More on Talents below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Thief is mostly unchanged. Fast Hands remains identical, but second-story work now gives you an actual climb speed. I think One DnD\u2019s update to Fast Hands (you can use magic items) is a huge improvement, so I hope ToV tries something similar.<\/p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wizard\">Wizard<\/h4>\n\n\n<p>The Wizard does not appear to have changed from the preview document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wizard\u2019s proficiencies now entirely omit weapons. However, you still get the same starting e equipment options as the 5e rules, so you can get a quarterstaff and a staff focus and have two staffs that you\u2019re now even worse at bonking things with. I don\u2019t actually care that wizards can\u2019t use weapons; it always struck me as odd that a light crossbow was such a good choice until level 5. But the starting equipment needs adjusting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arcane Recovery has been moved down to 1st level, the new Magic Sense feature has been added at 2nd level, and your subclass is delayed to 3rd level alongside every other class. At 5th level, wizards get the new Rote Memorization feature which very slightly expands your list of prepared spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wizard may have been hit hardest by the changes to ritual casting. The Wizard\u2019s unique ability to cast any ritual in their spellbook (which could be every wizard ritual) made them a master of magical utility outside of combat, but with the new fixed number of rituals known, the Wizard has lost one of their most unique capabilities. I\u2019m sincerely sad about this change, as it removes much of the need to compulsively collect spells like some sort of mystical magpie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If wizards got more rituals than other classes, I think that would be a major improvement.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m surprised that wizards don\u2019t get a cantrip damage boost feature. Clerics can get one at first level, putting their cantrip damage consistently ahead of wizards. Such features come online around level 6 in the 5e rules, so that may be the answer, but it still feels odd that clerics can do so much more damage for the first 5 levels of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll address the changes to the core mechanic below under Spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules preview includes the Battle Mage and the Cantrip Adept subclasses. The Battle Mage falls somewhere between the 5e War Mage and the 5e Evoker, while the Cantrip Adept is updated from Kobold Press\u2019s Tome of Heroes, in part as proof that it\u2019s easy to move 5e content into Tales of the Valiant, which is a massive boon to other 3rd-party creators who may be practically shut out of One DnD unless WotC updates the SRD to match changes to the core rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Battle Mage offers access to the Martial Talent list, which may offer some interesting build options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spell Ward is the Battle Mage\u2019s signature tactic, providing a buff that requires specific actions to persist, much like the Barbarian\u2019s Rage feature. You need to keep casting leveled spells to persist the ward. The buff is excellent, dramatically improving the wizard\u2019s durability, but the resource cost to maintain it is prohibitive. Reaction spells like Shield can persist the buff, which helps a lot, but you\u2019ll need to carefully monitor your spell slots to keep from burning out in the first encounters of a long adventuring day. Expect to use Arcane Recovery to recover 1st-level slots so that you can maintain your Spell Ward at minimal resource cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tactical Caster works like school of evocation\u2019s Sculpt Spells, though it has a PB\/day usage limitation, so you can\u2019t rely on fireballing your party as your only tactic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cantrip Adept gets two cantrips from any circle spell list, and can cast a cantrip as a Bonus Action PB\/day. Not a ton of nuance here, but if 5e options are available you can do things like Mind Sliver as a Bonus Action prior to casting an Action save-or-suck spell. Quickened Spell metamagic effectively lets you do the same thing, but you need to devote a large amount of resources to match PB\/day uses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly how great Cantrip Adept is will come down to how good cantrips are in ToV.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lineages-and-heritages\">Lineages and Heritages<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Rather than race and potentially subrace, ToV has separated those options into \u201cLineage\u201d and \u201cHeritage\u201d. Lineage presents your character\u2019s biological traits, while Heritage presents your character\u2019s cultural upbringing and the traits they\u2019ve developed as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The text describes go-to pairings to create historically iconic lineage\/heritage pairings, but also encourages you to mix and match as you see fit to create a character whose mechanics represent the unique story you want to tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a few textual changes from the preview document. Kobold Press briefly experimented with \u201cNight Vision\u201d in place of Darkvision, but they have reverted that change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get four lineages:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Beastkin: Live your bear\/bird\/boar\/beast-person fantasy. With multiple decision points within the Beastkin, you can mix and match traits to reflect the variety of beast you want to emulate. Ex: Take Perception, Claws, and Natural Adaptation (Avian) for a hawk person.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dwarf: Darkvision, resistance to poison, bonus hp. An easy go-to options for basically any character simply because they\u2019re survivable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Elf: Proficiency in Perception, advantage on saves against charm, can\u2019t be magically put to sleep, and Trance. Not super exciting, but charm effects are surprisingly common in 5e and Perception is really good.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Human: One extra skill and one Talent from any list. Getting to ignore the Talent list restrictions from your class offers a lot of room for customization and optimization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your character\u2019s language proficiencies come from their Heritage (you may get more from your Background). The current publishes options all give Common, plus one or two other languages of your choice. Lineage-based languages (elven, etc.) exist, but being a member of that Lineage doesn\u2019t make you proficient: You might be a Stone Heritage Elf who grew up in a dwarven society and has never heard a word of elven in your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get eight heritages:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Cloud Heritage: Proficiency in Arcana and build your own innate spellcasting feature around a single school of magic. You only get to cast the non-cantrip spells once per day (no re-casting them with slots), but you do get to pick your spellcasting ability score. This is going to be very powerful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cosmopolitan Heritage: Good at not getting lost or surprised in cities, and good at identifying unfamiliar architecture. I don\u2019t foresee this being used by anyone doing any optimizing at all.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fireforge Heritage: Expertise with smith\u2019s tools, fire resistance, you know the Ignan language, and you can cast Mending on metal objects. Until we get another option with fire resistance, this will be popular for front-line characters.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Grove Heritage: A climb speed and proficiency with weapons which DnD elves have historically been proficient in. Appealing for rogues who want the climb speed and proficiency with longbows.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nomadic Heritage: Advantage vs. weather, reduce Fatigue level once per long rest, proficiency in survival. Unless there\u2019s a class that makes you take Fatigue like 5e\u2019s Berserker Barbarian, I don\u2019t foresee this being used by anyone doing any optimizing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stone Heritage: The closest to the historically iconic dwarf. You get proficiency in historically dwarven weapons (axes and hammers), proficiency in a tool, and proficiency to look at metal and stone. I don\u2019t foresee this being used by anyone doing any optimizing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slayer Heritage: Proficiency in Intimidation, and it\u2019s hard for Beasts to attack you. Beasts stop being a threat early in the CR range in 5e, but Kobold Press\u2019s Tome of Beasts line includes numerous beast options more interesting than those in 5e, so it might remain useful. The wording on the Ferocity trait makes it sound like you\u2019re making a save against your own trait, which appears to be an editing error. The Tracker trait essentially duplicates Survival\u2019s tracking capability and gives you Expertise if you\u2019re already proficient.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wildlands Heritage: Shepherd\u2019s Gift is almost copy+paste from Slayer Heritage\u2019s Ferocity, except that you\u2019re proficient in Animal Handling instead. Beast affinity is neat, but Speak With Animals is a 1st-level spell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still some work needed to balance these.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>As in 5e, backgrounds grant two skill proficiencies, some combination of tools and languages, and some starting equipment. In addition, your background in ToV will give you a Talent. This Talent ignores the usual Talent List restrictions, making your Background a powerful decision point when building a character. Each Background offers a choice of one of three Talents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ToV\u2019s backgrounds replace the trait\/bond\/ideal\/flaw system with a table of example adventuring motivations. I\u2019ve gone back and forth on how I feel about the trait\/bond\/ideal\/flaw system, but I\u2019m not sure if adventuring motivation is actually better of it\u2019s just different and novel. If nothing else, I think it\u2019s less likely to be outright ignored by players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules for customizing backgrounds are just as flexible as they are in 5e\u2019s rules:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTo customize a background, you can replace one talent with any other, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that you can effectively pick any two skills, any two languages\/tools, and any Talent, so backgrounds are more of an example storytelling device than an actual rigid-defined character option.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"talents\">Talents<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not used to playing DnD, you have probably never heard the word \u201cfeat\u201d in your life. Nearly every player I\u2019ve taught to play has instinctively looked at their shoes when I brought up the subject of feats. The term Talent is outright better. It\u2019s easier to understand, and it describes a capability. A \u201cfeat\u201d is a single act. Lifting a horse is a feat. Being able to lift a horse is a talent. Talent is a better word for the idea, and I will die on this hill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talents are separated into three lists: Magic, Martial, and Technical. Each class offers access to one of the three lists, and you may be able to cross lists depending on your subclass. For example: the Spell Blade Fighter can select both from the Magic list and from the Martial list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The presented options include options similar to those in the 5e Player\u2019s Handbook, but several have been updated to address pain points. Some have been buffed, some have been nerfed, but most of the options are roughly equivalent in power. I do see a few options like Artillerist which I think will rarely see use without improvements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talents are granted from your lineage (currently only for humans), from your Background, and when you get an \u201cImprovement\u201d feature from your class. When you get an Improvement, you add +1 to one ability score, effectively making every feat a hybrid feat similar to many of 5e\u2019s feats (Fey Touched, etc.). In addition, you can choose a Talent which gives you another +1 increase, allowing you to opt out of the complexity of Talents if you so choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alpha document gave us a total of 21 Talents across the three Talent Lists matching the options from the preview document. At a glance, I don\u2019t see any changes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"playing-the-game\">Playing the Game<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"making-checks\">Making Checks<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The rules for making checks are very explicit about the workflow: Player describes an <em>action<\/em>, not \u201cI roll for Perception\u201d, then the GM decides if a check is needed. This has always been the rule, but 5e\u2019s text is less explicit, and players jumping straight to rolling dice has led to countless arguments. I don\u2019t care if you rolled a natural 20, I never asked for a check. You can\u2019t throw the gnome into the sun no matter how good you are at Athletics.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"luck\">Luck<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Luck is ToV\u2019s metacurrency. Players start with 0 Luck Points, but can accumulate by failing attacks or saves (once per turn max) or as a reward from the GM. You can have a max of 5, but if you get to 6 you lose most of them and roll a die to keep a few, which discourages hoarding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luck can be spent on a one-to-one basis to add a bonus to your d20 rolls, or spend 3 points to reroll the d20, allowing you to turn near-misses into successes or to recover from disastrously poor rolls. If you have Advantage or Disadvantage, you reroll both dice. No more rolling two natural 1s when you have Advantage. Well, much less. There\u2019s only so much that the rules can do to save you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gen Con ToV sessions experimented with allowing players to share luck. While my group used this to great effect, I think it\u2019s going to introduce problems at the table because it enables the party to hoard Luck Points by spending them from only the largest pool of points. They could mitigate this by making sharing more expensive, such as by making it cost two points to apply one point to another player\u2019s roll.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skills\">Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The text appears to be largely identical to 5e\u2019s, which means that by a strict RAW reading of the rules, you can only do the things explicitly listed in the skill descriptions. This means that Animal Handling, Medicine, and Survival are all explicitly borderline useless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that we need is for someone to liberally sprinkle the words \u201csuch as\u201d in most of the skill descriptions, then to add some flavor text to describe Medicine as capable of doing anything beyond the equivalent of CPR.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-stuff\">Other Stuff<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The other rules seems to be unchanged with very minor exceptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBlindsense\u201d has been renamed \u201ckeensense\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cvoid\u201d damage type is introduced, but it feels like an odd half-way point between psychic damage and necrotic damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything else seems to be copy+pasted from the SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"equipment\">Equipment<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"armor\">Armor<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Padded Armor (wich no one ever used) and Breastplate have been removed. The removal of Breastplate is a bad idea, in my opinion, as it allowed medium-armored characters to be moderately stealthy even if they were several points behind lightly-armored characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armor now has Properties similar to weapons, which offers more flexibility in designing armor options. Currently we have the \u201cCumbersome\u201d property (the same as the Strength requirements in the 5e rules), the \u201cNoisy\u201d property (disadvantage on Stealth), and the \u201cNatural Materials\u201d property which explicitly specifies what armor druids can use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existence of the Natural Materials property implies that ToV is sticking to the prohibition on druids wearing metal armor, which feels odd as a PF2 and One DnD both abandon it. Furthermore, studded leather does not have the trait, making the Druid\u2019s long-standing AC problems that much worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of armor in 5e has long been a point of frustration for me. There is functionally no reason to use any armor except the most expensive version at each step, with the rare exception of a character in medium armor who also wants to be stealthy and is therefore stuck in breastplate until they can get mithral half plate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PF2\u2019s armor has scaling dexterity caps and Strength requirements across the full armor spectrum. This means that every single armor option has a specific mechanical niche catering to different ability scores. Differences in armor are both meaningful and mechanically satisfying. Adjusting 5e\u2019s armor stats to get that same is not only doable, it\u2019s easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s room for more adjustment, but here\u2019s an example how this could be done:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Armor<\/th><th>AC Bonus<\/th><th>Properties<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Light Armor<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leather<\/td><td>11 + DEX modifier<\/td><td>Natural Materials<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Studded Leather<\/td><td>12 + DEX modifier<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Medium Armor<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Hide<\/td><td>12 + DEX modifier (max 4)<\/td><td>Natural Materials<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chain Shirt<\/td><td>13 + DEX modifier (max 3)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scale Male<\/td><td>14 + DEX modifier (max 3)<\/td><td>Noisy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Breastplate<\/td><td>14 + DEX modifier (max 2)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Half Plate<\/td><td>15 + DEX modifier (max 2)<\/td><td>Noisy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Heavy Armor<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ring Mail<\/td><td>14 + DEX modifier (max 1)<\/td><td>Noisy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chain Mail<\/td><td>16 + DEX modifier (max 1)<\/td><td>Cumbersome (STR 13), Noisy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Splint<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>Cumbersome (STR 15), Noisy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Plate<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>Cumbersome (STR 16), Noisy<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"weapons\">Weapons<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Weapon stats appear to be identical to the 5e stats, but with the addition of the new \u201cWeapon Option\u201d system. Similar to One DnD\u2019s Weapon Mastery, this allows characters to do additional things when they hit with a weapon. All characters have access to these options, provided that they\u2019re proficient with a weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The action economy around Weapon Options is interesting. Some options work on a hit, while others replace an attack. This gives the designers more options to design masteries than One DnD\u2019s Weapon Mastery. The Fighter\u2019s Martial Action feature allows you to use a Weapon Option as a Bonus Action, but it\u2019s not clear how that works. Can you use a Bonus Action to use a Hamstring weapon? What about a Bash weapon? Does that mean that you get additional attacks?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some weapons have two Weapon Options, such as crossbows, which typically have both Pinning Shot and Ricochet Shot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Bash: Disadvantage on the target\u2019s next attack. Notably does not have a duration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Disarm: Knock a weapon out of the target\u2019s hand instead of actually attacking. Relatively few enemies use manufactured weapons, so this isn\u2019t consistently useful. It\u2019s also on short swords and rapiers, which are go-to weapons for rogues, so Weapon Options may be a poor option for rogues.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hamstring: Instead of dealing damage, impose a -10 ft. speed which last until a creature succeeds on a Medicine check as an Action, which is unlikely to happen during combat.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pinning Shot: It\u2019s frustrating that this requires the target to be wearing clothes, but immobilizing them and requiring an Action to try to escape makes this very powerful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pull: Pull enemies off of horses, just like the gods of polearms intended when they start putting hooks on the heads of polearms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ricochet Shot: A full action and it limits additional damage boosts like Sneak Attack.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trip: Excellent, especially if you\u2019re making numerous attacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-items\">Other Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This appears to be copied directly from the SRD.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-items\">Magic Items<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This is our first look at magic items in ToV, and there are some exciting things here!<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fabled-items\">\u201cFabled\u201d Items<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Fabled items start at Common rarity, but scale as the player gains levels. This is similar to the Vestiges of Divergence from 5e\u2019s Wildemount or Hoard Magic Items from 5e\u2019s Fizban\u2019s Treasury of Dragons.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blood Spike Armor is included as an example.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enchanted-magic-items-vs-permanent-magic-items\">\u201cEnchanted Magic Items\u201d vs. \u201cPermanent Magic Items\u201d<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>In addition to consumable magic items (portins, spell scrolls, etc.), ToV introduces the concept of \u201cEnchanted Magic Items\u201d, which are distinct from \u201cPermanent Magic Items\u201d. Enchanted Magic Items are easier to price than Permanent Magic Items, but what distinguishes the two categories is clear as mud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>+X items are definitely enchanted, as are a handful of items listed as examples in the price table, but beyond that it\u2019s totally unclear. Artifacts are definitely Permanent Magic Items, as are anything with Fabled rarity. But that leaves most magic items uncategorized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intent here is that Enchanted Magic Items will have a simple table that you can use to calculate the price of items. +1 weapons cost X, +2 armor costs Y, and so on. But since it\u2019s not perfectly, brutally clear what qualifies as Enchanted vs. Permanent, the table\u2019s usefulness is extremely limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better solution would be to simply list a cost for individual magic items. What\u2019s especially odd is that <em>they did that<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"magic-item-prices\">Magic Item Prices<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Most of the items included in the alpha document have explicit prices. You can buy a 2nd-ring spell scroll 100gp. You can buy a suit of +1 full plate for 3,000gp. They even remember to include base item price, closing the 5e loophole which makes adamantine full plate cheaper than regular full plate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One DnD is allegedly planning to do this, too, but we haven\u2019t seen rules for it yet. It\u2019s supposed to be in one of the next two UA documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules also include a sidebar for adapting items from 5e, which also specifies that certain items should be priced on step higher. This includes items that grant flight (broom of flying is outright broken at its 5e rarity) and a few other specific effects with huge implications.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spellcasting\">Spellcasting<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-rings-spell-levels\">Spell Rings \/ Spell Levels<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Using the term \u201clevel\u201d for spells alongside a different scale of \u201clevel\u201d for characters has been confusing for as long as DnD has had spell levels, so ToV has replaced the term \u201cSpell Level\u201d with \u201cSpell Ring\u201d. The concepts are identical, but no more explaining that level means two things to new players.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-circles-spell-lists\">Spell Circles \/ Spell Lists<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Like Pathfinder 2e, ToV consolidates spell lists into four lists: arcane (wizards), divine (clerics), primordial (druids), and wyrd (I assume warlocks, but it remains to be seen), though only arcane and divine are addressed in the alpha document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These lists are called \u201cSpell Circles\u201d. I think this is going to confuse people alongside \u201cSpell Rings\u201d since circle and ring are synonyms.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ritual-casting\">Ritual Casting<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Ritual spells have been separated from regular spells. This allows characters to keep these spells available without cutting into your prepared spells, most of which are going to be combat options. In many 5e games, ritual spells are only available to wizards or after a long rest because players can\u2019t afford to commit limited daily resources to options that they\u2019ll only need when they have an hour to cast a ritual.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spells\">Spells<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Tales of the Valiant has made improvements to the way spell entries are formatted. The sentence of flavor text at the beginning of most spells has been separated from the rules text so it\u2019s clear that it does not have rules implications, and the organization of the blocks makes them clearer to read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The included spell lists for the Cleric and for the Wizard include many of the iconic spells that you\u2019ll recognize from the SRD, as well as some intriguing new options with names like Fire Under the Tongue, Gear Barrage and Pendulum. We also get some spells for other classes, though the classes aren\u2019t available yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ritual spells have been broken out into a separate spell list. Rituals usually take either 1 minute or 10 minutes depending on the spell, but otherwise their effects haven\u2019t changed much from 5e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Detect Magic is an interesting case. In 5e it\u2019s a ritual because the designers wanted it to be always available, but not available as quickly as a cantrip. Making it no longer a ritual means that preparing the spell and using a spell slot on it are a much larger expense than they were previously. I\u2019m curious to see if that will be a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upcasting information has been omitted from the alpha, but the mechanic isn\u2019t going away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other rules are largely identical to the SRD, but updated to use the new terminology.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"monsters\">Monsters<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"doooooooom\">DOOOOOOOOM<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Included as an optional rule, Doom gives the DM a per-encounter pool of points to support the antagonists. Doom is recommended as a way to make encounters more difficult beyond the baseline balance assumptions of the game. Essentially: My players are better than the math expects, so I need to keep up the challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a major improvement over the version presented in the preview document.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stat-block-changes\">Stat Block Changes<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Tales of the Valiant has made some structural changes to how stat blocks are presented. Creatures no longer list ability scores because those have only ever mattered for players. Condition vulnerabilities\/resistances\/immunities are listed on the same line as damage vulnerabilities\/resistances\/immunities, which feels like an obvious improvement. Every creature now has a Perception score, which is effectively the creature\u2019s Passive Perception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skill proficiencies have also been removed from creatures, instead defaulting to straight ability checks. I\u2019m less excited about this change than about the stat block structure improvements. Many creatures in 5e simply don\u2019t have skill proficiencies, but removing the possibility means that we can\u2019t have NPCs that are good at specific skills. The Goblin Chief isn\u2019t good at Intimidation thanks to its +0 Charisma modifier, which feels like a thing that a goblin chief should be good at. It\u2019s not a tool that\u2019s needed for every single stat block, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a tool we should give up.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classic-creatures-fresh-ideas\">Classic Creatures, Fresh Ideas<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest criticisms of 5e\u2019s monsters is that many of them are bags hit points with teeth. They\u2019re boring. Basically you can slide their CR up or down and call it something different and not notice. Kobold Press has long had a reputation for more interesting monster design, and it\u2019s on display here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick examples: The Tyrannosaurus now has a Bonus Action to throw a grappled creature and damage them, and the Hippogriff now has a dive attack. Previously I couldn\u2019t distinguish the Hippogriff and the Griffon, so this feels nice.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"included-monsters\">Included Monsters<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Among several fnatasy staples, the alpha document includes the new Void Dragon, a space dragon that breaths gravity and radiant damage. The document also includes the \u201cmicolid\u201d, not to be confused with the \u201cmiconid\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The art on everything is awesome, and every non-NPC, non-animal monster has art except for the Worg. You know what worgs look like, right? They\u2019re like\u2026 spicy wolves. Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conditions\">Conditions<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Mostly duplicated from the SRD, but there may be changes snuck in here. Invisibility has a new bullet which grants Advantage on Stealth checks, but I haven\u2019t spotted anything else obviously different.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There are some great ideas here! There are a few editing issues and balance issues, and there is definitely room for further improvement, but I\u2019m excited to see that Kobold Press is making meaningful changes without throwing out the parts of 5e that people really like.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since running a successful Kickstarter earlier this year, Kobold Press has been hard at work on Tales of the Valiant, and they\u2019ve recently released the public alpha version.
