That&#8217;s a wrap on the first season of the RPGBOT.Podcast. To every listener out there, we appreciate you tuning in every week and telling your friends about what we&#8217;re doing here. Yeah, it&#8217;s been really fast. And I mean, you know, when we started out, we&#8217;re like, Ah, yes; downloads, any of them. Brilliant! And, and now we&#8217;re up into a really staggering number of of, you know, like four digits a month, which is really gratifying to see, so thank you. Yeah, it was, it&#8217;s really exciting with like, in the beginning, you&#8217;re literally asking your friends like, &#8220;Hey, did you listen to the most recent episode?&#8221; Because we can actually tell if they listen to the most recent episode based on the numbers and versus now? Yeah, we really appreciate all of you, we appreciate you listening, and we know that you&#8217;re telling your friends about it, because we see the growth, you know, even week over week, and it really is amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this is honestly blown away my wildest expectations. This has been so much fun. And the messages people have sent, and the questions that people have sent in have been just wonderful to discuss. And I look forward to doing this every week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. All right. So Tyler, what is the state of the Pod?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think we&#8217;re on a really good track, we&#8217;ve done a good job doing what we set out to do. Exploring RPG mechanics, and helping people make those more of a fun part of their game. I know a couple people, including our DM in our ongoing game have talked about some of the episodes we&#8217;ve done and ways that they&#8217;ve put that advice to use immediately. So knowing, knowing that what we&#8217;re doing is helping people get more out of the game is really satisfying. So we&#8217;re keeping that that mission of helping people be better players so that they can play better games. So we also have something special planned for next year. I&#8217;m very excited about it. Do you guys want to say what it is?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No! no!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Random&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also very excited about it. And in particular, I, I will say that we&#8217;re going to get to flex something related to a question of the week that we had at one point. I&#8217;m very excited to get to show you more of the things that we do besides just talking. Yeah, I think maybe the best thing that I can say is I think we have a plan to finally really put on display. Yeah, character optimization, like what does it look like to explore a particular theme within a character? How do we leverage all the mechanics that we talk about every week to actually like, yeah, I don&#8217;t know, what&#8217;s good look like. The other thing I&#8217;ll say is that we&#8217;re gonna continue to do the RPGBOT.News, with new releases, new content as it&#8217;s coming out. We&#8217;re gonna make sure we cover these things because we think, Oh, we think you&#8217;re enjoying it. If you are, let us know. But we have a good time getting, getting together and actually talking about the new material as it comes. It gives a good excuse for us to all get on a call and make it happen. And you know, that&#8217;s not the only thing we&#8217;ve got going next year. We&#8217;re gonna keep doing this we&#8217;re going to, I mean, as Tyler mentioned, we are all having a fabulous time for season two. We are going to dig deeper, make it so that once again you can play better, have a better game and really get every single drop of fun out of whatever role playing game you&#8217;re enjoying that you can. How perfect Alright, so until then happy holidays and yeah, we&#8217;ll be in your earballs next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nailed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Randall&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfectl.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tyler&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three bullets in my part and I dropped the ball.
