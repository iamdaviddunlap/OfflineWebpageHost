Forcing that creature to reroll the d20 afterward doesn\u2019t change the fact that the save succeeded as a result of Legendary Resistance. No amount of rerolling will undo that success.https:\/\/dnd.wizards.com\/dndstudioblog\/sage-advice-book-updates<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"uses-and-abuses\">Uses and Abuses<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Silvery Barbs can be used in a wide variety of situations across the entire level range. So long as someone in the party has the spell available, your party has a massively powerful asset.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"negating-critical-hits\">Negating Critical Hits<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The triggering creature rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll. In response, you speak the verbal component \u201chow about no?\u201d and the creature rerolls their attack. They do still have a 1 in 20 chance of scoring a critical hit, but those are slim odds. This makes your entire party nearly immune to critical hits so long as someone can cast Silvery Barbs.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"negating-the-benefits-of-advantage\">Negating the Benefits of Advantage<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The triggering creature rolls an attack\/check\/save with Advantage. Silvery Barbs doesn\u2019t care. If they succeeded, Silvery Barbs forces them to roll and additional d20 and use the lower of the their successful roll and the additional d20. The second d20 rolled when they rolled with Advantage doesn\u2019t matter. Silvery Barbs doesn\u2019t care.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"save-or-suck\">Save or Suck<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Our spellcaster produces a save-or-suck effect, such as casting Hold Person. The target passes their save. Our spellcaster declares \u201coh no you don\u2019t\u201d and casts Silvery Barbs (remember that the limitation on leveled spells per turn only applies if you cast a spell as a Bonus Action). The target rolls a new d20 and uses the lower of their successful roll (after factoring in Advantage\/Disadvantage) and uses the lower d20 result, most likely reducing their total roll and frequently turning a success into a failure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is essentially as good as Metamagic (Heighten Spell), but you use it reactively so you only pay the cost if you need it. This case alone is too good for a 1st-level spell. If this was the only thing that Silvery Barbs did, it would already be too good.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spam-it-on-the-same-roll\">Spam it on the Same Roll<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Your party is all bards (or all classes that can cast Silvery Barbs at the very least). Bard A casts a save-or-suck spell. The target succeeds on the save, so Bard A casts Silvery Barbs. Tragically, the target succeeds again! But wait, Bard B casts Silvery Barbs, too! Roll again!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This nonsense can continue until the target fails or you run out of people who can cast Silvery Bards casting Silvery Barbs.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"counter-counterspell\">Counter Counterspell<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>You cast a spell. The enemy spellcaster casts Counterspell, but doesn\u2019t use a spell slot of high enough level to automatically counter your spell, so they must make an ability check. They succeed on your check, successfully countering your spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, you have Silvery Barbs! Normally you could Counterspell the Counterspell (yes it\u2019s allowed, and yes it\u2019s as silly as it sounds), but Silvery Barbs is two spell levels lower than Counterspell so it\u2019s a cheaper solution to the same problem, though potentially less reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the limitation to one leveled spell per turn only applies if you cast a spell with a Bonus Action casting time. If you used Action Surge to cast two leveled spells as an Action, you could still use your Reaction on the same turn to cast another leveled spell.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"empowering-skills\">Empowering Skills<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have time, resources, or Concentration to spare for Enhance Ability, Silvery Barbs can give you or an ally Advantage on one roll. It also doesn\u2019t require Concentration, so you can easily stack it with Guidance if that\u2019s an option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Triggering Silvery Barbs just requires that a creature you can see (likely not the caster, but even that\u2019s not explicit) succeeds on a d20 roll. Have party member A punch a wall (attack roll), cast Silvery Barbs, and give party member B Advantage on their next d20 roll.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"existing-limitations\">Existing Limitations<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There are some limitations on Silvery Barbs. It\u2019s not absolutely unstoppable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Spell Slots.\u00a0<\/strong>Players will eventually run out of spell slots. Sorcerers melting their spell slots into Sorcery Points to then create more 1st-level spell slots will be problem, though.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>One Reaction per creature per round.<\/strong>\u00a0A creature can only cast Silvery Barbs once per turn due to the limitations imposed by the action economy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Only 60-foot range.<\/strong>\u00a060 feet will cover most fights, but that archer who hates spellcasters that is standing 65 feet away is fine.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Must be able to see the target creature which targets the spell.<\/strong>\u00a0Being unseen is a huge advantage in 5e where so many things require you to be able to see the target, so invisibility, darkness, etc. all make a creature immune to Silvery Barbs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>One leveled spell per turn. The limitation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fixes\">Fixes<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The effects of Silvery Barbs are not inherently problematic. The issue is the spell\u2019s cost. For what it costs to use Silvery Barbs, its effects are too powerful. Adjusting the cost in one or more ways can make the spell considerably less problematic without altering the actual effects of the spell, though altering the spell\u2019s effects may still be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend applying one or more of the following changes. Discuss it with your group, and experiment until you feel like you\u2019ve arrived at a good solution. The hope is that Silvery Barbs is worthwhile, but not so incredibly powerful that it makes other options obsolete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Raise the spell level to 2 or 3.<\/strong>\u00a0Raising the spell level significantly increases the cost to cast the spell, and discourages sorcerers from melting all of their spell slots into Sorcery Points to cast Silvery Barbs all day long.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduce the range to 30 feet.<\/strong>\u00a0Forcing the caster to be closer to enemies limits how frequently the spell can be used and adds some risk to its usage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Remove the secondary Advantage effect.<\/strong>\u00a0This reduces the benefits of Silvery Barbs, which might bring it more in line with its cost.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The target rerolls the attack\/check\/save, applying Advantage\/Disadvantage if they apply.<\/strong>\u00a0This prevents Silvery Barbs from totally negative Advantage, but also makes anything rolled with Disadvantage borderline impossible if Silvery Barbs is around.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally I like it as a 2nd-level spell with no secondary effect that just forces a reroll. That\u2019s still a really great spell that I would strongly consider taking, but it\u2019s not so good that it would define my build.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Silvery Barbs is so good that we have arguably hit a state of the game where a save-or-suck caster is the only build worth playing. A party of bards, sorcerers, and wizards was already incredibly powerful, but now it\u2019s so good that no one else needs to show up to the game, and every encounter is a now a game save-or-suck rocket tag where whoever goes first wins outright.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a good thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in case it\u2019s not abundantly clear: Ban Silvery Barbs unless your group is willing to use it with some of the fixes proposed above.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos&nbsp;(affiliate link) gave use just 5 new spells, and for the most part they weren\u2019t a huge problem.
