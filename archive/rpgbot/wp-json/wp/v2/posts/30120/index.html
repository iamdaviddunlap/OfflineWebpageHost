With the impending release of the 2024 rules and the 50th anniversary of Dungeons and Dragons, the last few pieces of 2014 content were part send-off and part celebration of DnD\u2019s storied history.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vecna-eve-of-ruin-may-2024\">Vecna: Eve of Ruin &#8211; May, 2024<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The first high-level adventure published for 5e, Vecna: Eve of Ruin takes players on a plane-hopping adventure to foil a plot by Vecna, evil god of secrets, to remake the universe in his image. We reviewed it on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/vecna-eve-of-ruin-warning-spoilers-the-rpgbot-review-rpgbot-podcast-s4e56\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast<\/a> and liked it a lot. Facing a villain dating back to DnD\u2019s early days and meeting some major characters along the way was a fun romp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Spoilers] The reception to the adventure was middling. Many players felt that Vecna\u2019s extremely late appearance in the module was unsatisfying, and Vecna\u2019s stat block wasn\u2019t suitably challenging for a party of level 20 adventurers. I still think it\u2019s an exciting boss fight if the GM uses the battle map appropriately, but I haven\u2019t gotten to test it yet.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-july-2024\">Quests from the Infinite Staircase &#8211; July 2024<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A 5e update for 7 classic adventures dating back to DnD\u2019s earliest days, this was another adventure anthology in the vein of Tales from the Yawning Portal. Adventures are nominally linked together by travel through the Infinite Staircase, but they\u2019re functionally independent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among these updated adventures is Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, the first official DnD adventure to introduce science fiction elements like laser pistols and robots to DnD. We reviewed it on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-the-rpgbot-review-rpgbot-podcast-s4e85\/\">RPGBOT.Podcast<\/a> and had a lot of fun with it.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-dnd-players-handbook-september-2024\">2024 DnD Player\u2019s Handbook &#8211; September, 2024<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>After over a year of OneDnD playtest documents, people were nervous about the new Player\u2019s Handbook. The DnD design team took some big swings during the playtest, and responses were mixed. The final version made a lot of exciting improvements, and folks are <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-players-handbook-the-rpgbot-review-rpgbot-podcast-s4e87\/\">mostly happy<\/a> with the changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are certainly some rough edges, but there have also been some great improvements. If nothing else, Weapon Mastery is really fun, and the Monk is really good now.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-dungeon-masters-guide-november-2024\">2024 Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide &#8211; November, 2024<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The 2014 Dungeon Master\u2019s guide had a lot of issues, and most players rarely saw a need to open it for anything other than magic items. The 2024 DMG attempts to make it more of a go-to resource, and it certainly made some improvements in that respect. Initial responses have been largely positive, and the newly-added sections are excellent additions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the new Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide is <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dmg-first-look-the-dungeon-masters-guide-to-pandemonium-rpgbot-podcast-s4e132\/\">nowhere near perfect<\/a>. Most of the book is disorganized, a huge amount of content from the 2014 DMG was cut, and some frequently repeated promises were not delivered upon. Most notably, magic items prices are still nonsense, and the promised update to the monster creation rules is now just \u201creskin it, change a couple traits, and give it a new name\u201d rather than an actual robust solution for designing new monsters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, the 2024 Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide is also suffering significant delays with international shipping. Players in our Discord community outside of the US have reported that their local game stores had their promised supply of books repeatedly delayed, then had the amount drastically reduced to the point that stores couldn\u2019t fulfill preorders.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2025-dnd-releases\">2025 DnD Releases<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Much of the information below was announced in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s3RqehN6hS0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">D&amp;D Direct<\/a> video published in September of this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"flex-video flex-video-youtube\"><iframe title=\"D&amp;D Direct 2024\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/s3RqehN6hS0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2024-dnd-monster-manual-february-18th-2025\">2024 DnD Monster Manual &#8211; February 18th, 2025<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Monster Manual releases in 2025. According to the designers, we\u2019re going to see 80 new monsters, and all of the monsters have reevaluated to ensure that their stats appropriately match their CR. The variance in monsters\u2019 strength compared to their CR was a major pain point in the 2014 rules, so I\u2019m hoping that the math will be a little tighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen a few new stat blocks on DnDBeyond (the Dire Wolf was used to show the new stat block format), in the Player\u2019s Handbook (familiars), and in the Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide. So far, I\u2019ve noticed only minor changes to existing monsters, though the sample set is tiny and exclusively low CR.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dragon-anthology-summer-2025\">Dragon Anthology &#8211; Summer, 2025<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Going back to the game\u2019s conceptual roots, this adventure anthology is expected to include 10 adventures involving fighting dragons inside dungeons. That iconic scene has been a staple of D&amp;D art since its <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">early days<\/a>, and I\u2019m excited to see it return to prominence.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"new-starter-set-fall-2025\">New Starter Set &#8211; Fall, 2025<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Lost Mine of Phandelver is, to this day, one of the most widely-played adventures in DnD, in part because of the massive growth of the hobby since 5e\u2019s release. Despite publishing both the Essentials Kit and the Stormwreck Isle starter set, Lost Mine of Phandelver remains the go-to entry point into DnD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The designers have promised a return to the Keep on the Borderlands and the Caves of Chaos. The iconic adventure <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B2: The Keep on the Borderlands<\/a> was originally published in December of 1979, and has remained iconic since then. The Caves of Chaos (part of the B2 adventure) were used as part of the \u201cD&amp;D Next\u201d playtest leading up to 5e\u2019s release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a new starter set on the horizon, we may finally see something supplant Lost Mine of Phandelver as that singular introductory experience shared by a huge portion of the player base. The Keep on the Borderlands held that space for a long time, and it\u2019s entirely possible that it will do so again.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"forgotten-realms-player-guide\">Forgotten Realms Player Guide<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Prior to 5th edition, setting books were common. When a setting was brought into an edition, there would typically be a campaign guide, such as the 3e <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/product\/28474\/Eberron-Campaign-Setting-3e?affiliate_id=389627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eberron Campaign Guide<\/a>, then there would be a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/product\/29550\/Players-Guide-to-Eberron-35?affiliate_id=389627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">player\u2019s guide<\/a> and supplements would expand upon specific peoples, locations, and themes within the setting. DMsGuild lists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dmsguild.com\/browse.php?filters=0_0_0_0_45355_45348_0_0&amp;src=fid45348&amp;affiliate_id=389627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">21 3e\/3.5 products for Eberron<\/a>, and 3.x lasted just 8 years compared to 5e\u2019s 10. By comparison, settings in 5e got one book which often committed half of its page count to an adventure, as they did with Acquisitions Incorporated, Eberron, Ravnica, Spelljammer, and Strixhaven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DnD design team knows that setting books have been missed in 5th edition. Many players have no exposure to pre-5e content, and the only setting book we got for the Forgotten Realms, nominally 5e\u2019s default setting, was the Sword Coast Adventurer\u2019s Guide. One of the earliest supplements for 5e, SCAG was also the smallest book published for 5e. People have been asking for more for nearly a decade, and we\u2019re finally getting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Forgotten Realms Player Guide (which will likely have a more adventurous title) promises to include new subclasses, new spells, new types of spells (no further details on this yet), and information on factions in the setting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we have very few details, I\u2019m hoping that we see updates to the character options presented in the Sword Coast Adventurer\u2019s Guide. Subclasses like the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/subclasses\/sun-soul\/\">Sun Soul Monk<\/a> had some fun ideas, but were mechanically underwhelming. Giving them the 2024 treatment could make them playable. I\u2019m also excited to see what these \u201cnew types of spells\u201d are.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"forgotten-realms-campaign-guide\">Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Forgotten Realms is a huge setting. Ed Greenwood has been writing in the realms since 1987, making it slightly older than I am, and, with decades of lore and iconic characters, there\u2019s a ton to explore. Ed Greenwood has a very active <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@edgreenwoodofficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Youtube<\/a> account where he explores specific lore topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But exploring decades of novels, setting books from previous editions, and hundreds of hours is inaccessible to most players, and many of those legacy products might not hold up to today\u2019s sensibilities. A fresh look at the setting promises an entry point for players who haven\u2019t been in the hobby for 15+ years, plus a long-awaited exploration of huge portions of the Forgotten Realms that haven\u2019t seen attention in far too long.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"and-now-we-wait\">And Now, We Wait<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>With some exciting products on the horizon, but few specific details, I\u2019m excited to see what we\u2019ll get from WotC in 2025. For now, we\u2019re still hard at work exploring the updated <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/classes\/\">classes<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/species\/\">species<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/feats\/\">feats<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/2024-dnd\/\">everything else<\/a> that the 2024 Player\u2019s Handbook and Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide have to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look forward to reviews of all of the upcoming products on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/podcast\">RPGBOT.Podcast<\/a> as soon as we can get our hands on them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking Back at 2024 The 2024 release schedule was a little odd.
