This undead, CR 7 creature drags behind it using its third arm a sack of spare parts taken from its victims with intent to compose another Dissimortuum. A first Dissimortuum is created by a necromancer to slowly raise the undead, and this Dissimortuum is bound to obey the necromancer that created it. Subsequent Dissimortuums created are independent of this necromancer\u2019s control.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-141\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1b - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>The central feature of this creature is the nearly indestructible mask it wears. Even in death, this mask emits a magical aura. A creature that wears the mask, even briefly, may begin losing chunks of time. Perhaps they find evidence of macabre deeds performed during this time. Only too late do they realize they\u2019ve been assembling a new body for the Dissimortuum as it rises before them, animated again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would I do with this creature? A Scooby Doo one shot! The party arrives at a small village in the dead of winter when the days have grown quite short. At first the townsfolk are suspicious, explaining that recently a necromancer had cursed the town with this three armed creature. Luckily, the village was able to destroy him and his undead creature, but there are some who believe their ordeal is not over. I\u2019d provide clues such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-142\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 1c - mid_content -->\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Someone was digging at a fresh grave in the graveyard<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some of the necromancer\u2019s things are still in the burnt husk of the home he was living in<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first night in the village an earth shattering scream would wake the party; they rush to find a fresh victim missing limbs. Through their investigation I\u2019d expect them to piece together what is happening by interviewing townsfolk, reading a journal left behind by the necromancer, and&nbsp; looking for clues to the identity of the possessed in the graveyard and at the site of the murder. They would find their way to the Dissimortuum\u2019s mask just as it rose, alive again, before the terrified, innocent villager that unwittingly assisted it. Alternatively, let them find the mask and seek a way to destroy it as a step along the way to a larger campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-143\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 2a - mid_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"iconic-categories-novel-monsters\">Iconic Categories, Novel Monsters<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>In my homebrew arcs I like to world build through the creatures that I present to the party. If the party encounters a T-Rex deep in the heart of the jungle, then it only makes sense that they\u2019d encounter other dinosaurs in the region as well. Tome of Beasts 1 provides sets of monsters including dinosaurs, angels, demons, devils, clockwork creatures, giants, fey lords and ladies, and spiders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intelligent creatures such as the fey lords and ladies might serve as fantastic NPCs with stat blocks at the ready should the party try to press their luck. The various clockwork creatures would be home in any setting where engineering and magic have become interlaced such as Eberron.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 4c - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"surprising-experienced-players\">Surprising Experienced Players<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5a - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>My table tends to be a mixture of experience levels. When faced with a familiar enemy, my more experienced players will metagame a bit for their own character actions, but they\u2019ll leave the joy of stumbling into resistances and vulnerabilities for the less experienced players. This often leads to less intraparty talk in combat than during roleplay and puzzle encounters. At other tables, one player that knows the secrets of the creature might spoil it for the whole party. This is sometimes satisfying, but sometimes deflating for the party. It\u2019s also almost universally despised by the GM.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of my favorite combat encounters have been ones where no one in the party knows the details of the creature they\u2019re encountering. All of the Tome of Beasts books are fantastic for this, and Tome of Beast 1 (2023 Edition) is no different.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine I described to you a disheveled corpse crawling from the structure of a long forgotten ruin of a city. Its ashen skin flakes as it presses itself off the ground. It shambles towards the party, arms outstretched. You, savvy reader, may be thinking we have a run-of-the-mill zombie. It\u2019s not until someone takes fire damage after touching or making a melee attack that you realize something is a bit different. I describe the flame bursting from the point of contact enveloping the party member that struck it. Then it releases its Draconic Breath on the party. And more of these creatures begin crawling from the rubble. Many more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m describing the Ashwalker, one of the many monsters that were not published in the original Tome of Beasts, but added in this Tome of Beasts (2023 edition). Foes like this give even the most experienced player pause when encountering otherwise mundane creatures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 5c - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>Again, imagine the party walking into a cave and seeing evidence of kobold occupation. The party hears murmurs ahead and sneaks into a room containing a number of kobolds equal to the party. Everyone agrees: you like these odds. The fighter rushes into the room to attack the kobold wearing war paint. Instead of scattering, the kobolds rally. The fighter strikes the painted kobold who in turn reacts by shooting spikes from his shield at the fighter. The kobold releases a warcry that frightens half the party, emboldening the other kobolds to rally and fight. Perhaps you\u2019ve chosen the wrong cave.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kobold Chieftain, along with the Trapsmith and Alchemist, are three new kobolds that Tome of Beasts 1 add to the GM\u2019s arsenal. The CR 5 chieftain would be a formidable boss fight for level-appropriate adventures, especially if supported by Monster Manual kobolds and an alchemist or trapsmith. These kobolds can also liven up any published module via substitution.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6a - long_content -->\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-you-need-a-few-more-beasts\">Do you need a few more beasts?<\/h3>\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - mid_content 6b - long_content -->\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t own the original Tome of Beasts 1, then I\u2019d say picking up Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 edition) is an easy choice! The quality of these creatures is fantastic. The opportunities for the homebrewer to create fantastic one shots and story arcs around these creatures are enriched by the quality of lore. In a system that is close to a decade old as of this review\u2019s writing, the opportunity to provide new experiences for veteran players cannot be undervalued.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do own the original Tome of Beasts 1, it may be a bit harder to make the call. The added mechanical value comes as 12 new monsters, 6 updated monsters, and streamlined mechanics for many monsters after years of playtesting. As an example of streamlined mechanics take a look at the Bagiennik: an aberration that sits somewhere between Groot and the Swamp Thing. In the old version of the monster there is a long description that provides the option to stabilize a dying creature or act like a potion of healing or have the effect of a lesser restoration spell. The new description turns all those <em>ors<\/em> effectively into <em>ands<\/em> in about half the words. In the old version the action wasn\u2019t in the action section so on a quick glance a DM might not realize the ability is useful in combat at all.
