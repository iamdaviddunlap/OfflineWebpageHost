Building a party around a single class presents unique challenges often due individual classes\u2019 limited capabilities. DnD is fundamentally a game about a party of diverse characters pooling their abilities to become more than the sum of their parts. The single-class party flips that on its head, introducing fun new challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Druid is fantastically versatile and a ton of fun to play. With <em>wild<\/em>ly varied subclasses, a broad spell list, and a ton of built-in utility, Druids are among the easiest single-class parties.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-rules\">The Rules<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No multiclassing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>4 party members<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Must attempt to cover all <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/players\/party-composition\/\">party roles<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"strengths-and-weaknesses-the-alldruid-party\">Strengths and Weaknesses the All-Druid Party<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Druids are full spellcasters with a diverse spell list providing a ton of powerful options. Any spellcasting-based role is easily available to the Druid simply by changing their spell list, though they don\u2019t have as many direct Blaster options as the Cleric or the Wizard. The Druid really shines as a Controller and Utility caster, though they do have options for Blaster, Striker, and Support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wild Shape gives us a built-in Scout. By turning into innocuous local animals like bats, mice, and small birds, any Druid can effectively explore an area either unnoticed or in a form that leads enemies to ignore them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where druids fall short is their non-Wisdom skills. The Face and Scholar roles will be difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-party\">The Party<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-1-circle-of-the-moon-druid\">Member 1: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/moon\/\">Circle of the Moon Druid<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Circle of the Moon\u2019s natural tankiness makes it a great choice for our Defender. However, as we move into mid and high levels, our beast form\u2019s lagging attack bonus can put us into a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/the-tank-fallacy\/\">Tank Fallacy<\/a> situation. Wild Shape falls off offensively long before your giant pool of hit points stops keeping you alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we\u2019re reserving Wild Shape for combat, this is the only member of our party who will explicitly <em>not<\/em> serve as a Scout. We\u2019ll also reserve our spellcasting for self buffs, healing ourselves, and for preparing any situationally-useful Utility Caster options which our other party members don\u2019t have space for.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-2-circle-of-wildfire-druid\">Member 2: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/wildfire\/\">Circle of Wildfire Druid<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Circle of Wildfire adds several fire spells from the Wizard\u2019s spell list, curiously omitting Fireball, but otherwise giving us more direct damage options. We also get a cool pet that can shoot enemies at range and do some cool teleportation stuff. This adds some Blaster, some Striker, and some Support. We\u2019ll consider this our primary Blaster and Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This build is also very simple, leaving us plenty of room to pick up other roles. In this case, we\u2019ll take the Scholar role. We\u2019ll sacrifice a bit on Dex and Con to put some points into Intelligence so that we can support crucial knowledge skills.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-3-circle-of-spores-druid\">Member 3: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/circle-of-spores\">Circle of Spores Druid<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Our second melee character, Circle of Spores scales slowly and takes some time to become effective in melee. Conveniently, it becomes effective right around when Circle of the Moon stops being dangerous offensively. Once we hit this point, we can be a good Defender and Striker, especially with options like Polearm Master.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-4-circle-of-the-shepherd-druid\">Member 4: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/druid\/subclasses\/circle-of-the-shepherd\/\">Circle of the Shepherd Druid<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>With four druids in the party, there\u2019s a lot of room for pets and summoning. That makes Circle of the Shepherd a terrifyingly powerful prospect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll also make this our party\u2019s Face. A little bit of Charisma and a Background like Courtier or Noble will get us the skills we need, and we can make up the lack of Charisma with buffs like Guidance.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-report-card\">The Report Card<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We just barely managed to cover every role, but it\u2019s definitely a stretch for some of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><thead><tr><th>Role<\/th><th>Member(s)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Blaster<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Controller<\/td><td>2, 4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Defender<\/td><td>1, 3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Face<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Healer<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scholar<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scout<\/td><td>2, 3, 4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Striker<\/td><td>2, 3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Support<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Utility Caster<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-strength\">Biggest Strength<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>4 full spellcasters is a lot of power, especially with the ability to summon an army of superpowered cows to hide behind if the party\u2019s front line is feeling lazy. We can totally control the battlefield, slowing and restraining enemies, forcing them into dangerous positions, and wearing them down with area damage from afar. Even in melee, we\u2019re much more durable than our AC would suggest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-weakness\">Biggest Weakness<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Our AC is bad. Druids have terrible armor options and can rarely afford to max out Dexterity in order to boost their AC. Our best magic option to solve the issue is Barkskin, but it\u2019s awful. We\u2019ll need to rely heavily on temporary hit points and tactical positioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our skills also aren\u2019t fantastic. Aside from Insight and Perception, we\u2019ll struggle with a lot of things. Fortunately, we have Guidance and Enhance Ability readily available.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Druids are one of the easier single-class party options until something decides to attack you. Even with just d8 hit dice, though, a party of 4 Druids is still entirely capable of facing whatever the game can throw at them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this article, I encourage you to check out the other articles in the series:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-parties-oops-all-artificers\/\">Oops All Artificers<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-barbarians\/\">Oops All Barbarians<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-the-all-bard-party\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27059\">Oops All Bards<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-druids\/\">Oops All Druids<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-parties-oops-all-fighters\/\">Oops All Fighters<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-monks\/\">Oops All Monks<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-rogues\/\">Oops All Rogues<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/single-class-dnd-parties-oops-all-warlocks\/\">Oops All Warlocks<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Druid is fantastically versatile and a ton of fun to play.
