We love all of them, but some of our builds do something silly or unique in ways that we really love, and we want to take a few minutes to look back at some of our favorites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We promise that Tyler won\u2019t cheat and pick a wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bardadin-the-portable-punching-bag-bard-paladin\">Bardadin: The Portable Punching Bag, Bard \/ Paladin<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Random, Rocco, and I all decided to take one of the popular paladin multiclass combos: bardadin, hexadin, and sorcadin. I ended up writing two bardadins, but this was easily <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/bardadin-punching-bag\/\">my favorite of the two<\/a>. Building around Armor of Agathys and retaliatory damage, the build makes itself an absolute nuisance in combat, forcing enemies to kill themselves to attack you or leave you to your own devices while you kill them. It\u2019s also a bard, so it\u2019s a great Face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Tyler<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-got-a-rock-swarmkeeper-ranger\">\u201cI Got a Rock\u201d, Swarmkeeper Ranger<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Rocco absolutely surprised me with this one: he combined Druidic Warrior, a single-class ranger, and a sling, and somehow made something both effective and really fun for our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/ranger\/subclasses\/swarmkeeper\/#example-swarmkeeper-ranger-build-i-got-a-rock\">Swarmkeeper Ranger<\/a> example build. Combining the Crusher feat with Gathered Swarm allows you to hit an enemy and move them 20 feet (mostly horizontally), allowing you a lot of battlefield control at no resource cost. Relying on Wisdom also means that some of the Ranger\u2019s interesting but ineffective spells are suddenly really good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Tyler<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tam-bush-bugbear-fighter-monk-ranger-rogue\">Tam Bush, Bugbear Fighter \/ Monk \/ Ranger \/ Rogue<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>An absolute mess of multiclassing, Tam Bush was originally Random\u2019s idea, and then became one of the three example builds in our <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/bugbear-y-me-in-damage\/#example\">Bugbear-y Me in Damage<\/a> article after Random, Rocco, and I spent a bunch of time iterating and improving it. Of the three, it\u2019s the only one built for melee. It does enough damage to triple the \u201cDude Stop\u201d DPR range starting at level 12, and from that point on can solo entire encounters in a single turn unassisted. It\u2019s a monster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Tyler<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-launch-pad-way-of-the-open-hand-monk\">The Launch Pad, Way of the Open Hand Monk<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>While you might find many people online calling Monks the \u201cworst\u201d class, we firmly believe there is no such thing. It\u2019s definitely one of the hardest to optimize\u2026 if you want a traditional goal. If, instead, you\u2019re a content creator who is willing to lean into the fact that not everything is about numbers, you can be Tyler and put out the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/monk\/subclasses\/open-hand\/#example-build-the-launch-pad\">Way of the Open Hand<\/a> subclass handbook. Designed to be an impressive battlefield controller by virtue of the almighty power of yeet, this build shines for being something exceptionally fun to play while still having a meaningful presence in any party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Random<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"totembreaker-barbarian-paladin\">Totembreaker, Barbarian \/ Paladin<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>One of the very first things Karuma ever wrote for the site, this build intentionally throws away one benefit of Rage in a combination that is nearly equal parts Barbarian and Paladin rather than the usual dip we see in multiclassing. The end result is a <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/multiclassing\/totembreaker\/\">ludicrously durable<\/a> melee Striker that uses Reckless Attacks to fish for crits and then throws handfuls of d8s at the DM as punishment for allowing this monstrosity at the table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Random<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dioscuri-echo-knight-fighter-ancestral-guardian-barbarian\">Dioscuri, Echo Knight Fighter \/ Ancestral Guardian Barbarian<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The thing I am most proud of amongst all my creations on the site, yet another melee Defender rounds out my list (I maybe have a type [well, two types, but there\u2019s only so many times I can talk about Divine Soul]). This came about when I was doing research for the Ancestral Guardian handbook and read Echo Knight and realized <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/fighter\/subclasses\/echo-knight\/#example-build-dioscuri\">those things worked way too well together<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m actually playing this build right now (though without all the Fate references) because it was the thing I most wanted to run one of after building it. It abuses the fact that you\u2019re really not intended to make melee attacks from 30 feet away to lock down even the toughest foes at a comfortable distance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Random<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-hexblade-warlock\"><strong><em>The<\/em><\/strong> Hexblade Warlock<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You ever wonder why we\u2019re here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/hexblade\/\">the first article<\/a> on the site not by Tyler. It changed the game for RPGBOT. It led to Random suggesting I write something and see if it fit with what Tyler wants. So yeah, this is why we, the rest of the writing staff, ultimately ended up here instead of Tyler continuing to attempt his one-man show in what little free time a family man has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you want to hear about the actual build? A Hexblade Warlock with Elven Accuracy? It tops the Google search rankings month after month (and, like, every D&amp;D Youtuber has their own version of the idea too since this game is ten years old) so it\u2019s fairly reasonable for me to assume you\u2019ve already heard of this idea, but sure: Abuse Super Advantage with a Heavy weapon that qualifies for Great Weapon Master for an arbitrarily large amount of damage. That\u2019s not why it\u2019s my favorite Random article, that\u2019s just what it does in game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Rocco<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wrathful-leaps-path-of-the-beast-barbarian\">Wrathful Leaps, Path of the Beast Barbarian<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>We have plenty of grappling builds on the site because grappling is one of the First Order Optimal strategies for melee PCs. But <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/barbarian\/subclasses\/path-of-the-beast\/\">this one<\/a> jumps into the air, while grappling, allowing you to be Zangief (or Potemkin, or Iron Tager etc.) in D&amp;D 5e. There are a lot of ways to be a wrestleman (I\u2019ve written quite a few myself) but I just really like the way this one adds in the Jumping for fall damage because it\u2019s just very silly. There\u2019s not really much more to it: Tyler usually writes casters and I like grapplers so my favorite Tyler build is a grappler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Rocco<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"never-safe-from-water-the-fathomless-warlock\">Never Safe From Water, the Fathomless Warlock<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>My personal pick for <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/warlock\/subclasses\/fathomless\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"14992\">my own favorite build<\/a> is very simple: It\u2019s packed full of double entendre. It\u2019s all a bunch of \u201cif you know, you know\u201d dirty jokes. About Tentacles and Protection. However, while the presentation is very silly, it does a great job of being a hybrid supportive damage dealing Warlock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s what I like: being a silly player and laughing about the serious situations my serious character has to deal with while not being in on the joke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Rocco<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rpgbot-selfinsert-order-of-scribes-wizard\">RPGBOT Self-Insert, Order of Scribes Wizard<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Okay fine, I\u2019m cheating and picking a wizard. Wizards have been my favorite class for my entire 20+ year history with the game. They speak to my tastes and my personality on a fundamental level. But <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/wizard\/subclasses\/scribes\/\">Order of Scribes<\/a> takes that one level further and mechanically incentivizes my compulsive need to collect spells and then gives me the ability to use them to shock and horrify onlookers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s like someone had a direct link to my deepest desires and turned that into a subclass. I responded by taking a magical sci-fi robot and putting them into a fantastic magical land where they get to be a wizard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Tyler<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"honorable-mention-light-domain-cleric\">Honorable Mention: Light Domain Cleric<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Among our earliest example builds, the <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/light-domain\/\">Light Domain Cleric<\/a> is simple, yet effective. It doesn\u2019t do anything especially novel, but it\u2019s been a great entry point for a lot of players first finding their legs in character optimization. Combining the ability to cast Fireball with the Cleric\u2019s existing healing and support options is a ton of fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally know two people who have played clerics based on this build, and I take a lot of pride in the fact that they enjoyed their characters and survived for a very long time. Knowing that folks are getting value from our work gives me warm, fuzzy feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2013 Tyler<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This should be a shock to no one: we publish a lot of build guides.
