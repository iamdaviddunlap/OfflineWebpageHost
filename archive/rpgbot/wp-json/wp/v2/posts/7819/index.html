I&#8217;m Randall James, your carnivorous kaiju, and with me is Tyler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 00:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 00:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and Random.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 00:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good evening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 00:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome, welcome. All right, Tyler, what are we gonna do this week?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 00:33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to talk about kaijus. We&#8217;re going to talk about the kaiju. We are going to talk about the Tarrasque. It is the biggest. It is the baddest. It is the highest CR in the Monster Manual. And we&#8217;re gonna have a good discussion about all kinds of cool stuff about it. We&#8217;re going to talk about the history of the Tarrasque, both real world because there is some real world tarrasque stuff, and in the game, and then we&#8217;re gonna kill it at level one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 01:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, that&#8217;s&#8230; that&#8217;s a lot. Yeah, the first time I ever heard about the Tarrasque was when we had Colby on a few weeks ago. They talked about&#8230; Yeah, their experiences with it. So yeah, I&#8217;m excited about this. Random?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 01:14<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I have never had cause to actually end up in an encounter with a tarrasque, it&#8217;s practically its own running joke in D&amp;D. It is one of the original means second only to &#8220;rocks fall, everyone dies&#8221; is &#8220;Oh, no, it&#8217;s the tarrasque&#8221;. It&#8217;s going to be really interesting to see&#8230; Because most of my experience spending dozens of hours memorizing the stat block is from 3.5. So I&#8217;m interested to see what all Tyler has looked into for fifth edition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 01:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How far back does this go? And why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 01:47<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let me let me take you on a real wild tale. If you open up the Wikipedia page for the Tarrasque, the&#8230; the original story of the tasks&#8230; the Tarrasque goes back to 12th century France, I might be getting the year on that one wrong. So double check the internet. But it goes back to France, where you know, at the time, medieval Europe was super into their, like, their chimeric monsters where everything was like, let&#8217;s slap like eight beasts together. And that&#8217;s a new folk lore. And inevitably, as all of those stories end with, some saint comes along and either stabs it to death or splashes it with holy water. Either way, in this case, it was the holy water option. Saint&#8230; Starts with an A, I should have written this down, finds the tarrasque by riverbank, splashes it with holy water shows that the cross and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, I guess on the dog now&#8221; or something like that. If you look at the art on the Wikipedia page, there are some really, really stunning pieces. There&#8230; There&#8217;s one where she&#8217;s just standing with it on a leash and it has a dude, like, just legs hanging out of its mouth. And she just looks like &#8220;I&#8217;m so done with this.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 03:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 03:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I&#8217;m sorry, I just I have to take a second here. Because this suddenly makes something make a lot more sense. I&#8217;m going to switch nerd dems for a moment into the Fate nerdom. And Martha, as in St. Martha, one of the versions of her, her ultimate attack is &#8220;summons the tarrasque&#8221;. It&#8217;s like&#8230; and she basically kick flips it into the enemy. And that suddenly makes so much more sense. So thank you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 03:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay! I imagine that must have been very jarring to not have the context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 03:38<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So St. Martha uses holy water to befriend gargantuan monster and feed sinnerto it? Is that&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 03:46<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8230; that feels right.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 03:48<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 03:48<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That feels period appropriate. So, okay, so I&#8217;m going to post a thing in our group chat, and I&#8217;m sorry for the clicking noises. But everybody, I just want you to look at this picture and just enjoy it for a minute and tell me what you see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 03:51<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, for folks at home, we&#8217;ve been sent an outdoor&#8230; I believe marble sculpture?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 04:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is maybe the most cursed statue I&#8217;ve ever seen. What is its face? And why? And why does it have six legs?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 04:20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it looks like King Koopa has two front legs and like a cat face.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 04:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that&#8217;s like a human face.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 04:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like weirdly Asian features?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 04:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weirdly Asian feat&#8230; like&#8230; but then like maybe shade it 20% towards pug.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 04:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not see that one coming. Yeah, alright.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 04:45<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Armadillo tail, which I&#8217;m not even sure if armadillos live in Europe during the 12th century. So that&#8217;s a whole nother&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 04:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 04:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we can make that happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 04:58<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;. So the, the&#8230; the sorry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 05:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We needed to do the history on the real life fake monster before we talk about the fake life fake monster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 05:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the old Bestiaries&#8230; like way back when, there was a whole period of time where beasiaries were a thing where people would just make up monsters and be like, yes, this is super legit. And they were super into the chimeric monsters and that&#8217;s where we got a lot of things like chimeras and unicorns and manticores. So basically you just take like the scariest things and it&#8217;s like a child just like oh yeah, the coolest thing from this one animal is on this monster. So it has the face of a lion, the main of a horse for some reason, six bear-like legs, and depending on the source, the&#8230; the back nonsense is described as a double tortoise shell with spikes all over it and then a long tail like a serpent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 05:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, now that you say that I&#8217;m looking at it. Yeah, this is wonderful. Folks at home, go look at the Wikipedia article. That&#8217;s&#8230; that&#8217;s the advice. It looks like there are&#8230; it is a tortoise shell that is made of tortoise shells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 06:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly. And covered in spikes, because why not? So, so that is the real world origin of the Tarrasque. Now how that makes it into Dungeons and Dragons, I&#8217;m honestly not entirely certain. But I mean plenty of other real world legends have made their way into D&amp;D. So that&#8217;s not super surprising. So the Tarrasque makes its first appearance in D&amp;D in the monster manual to in first edition a D&amp;D, and since then, it has been this nigh-unkillable, legendary monstrosity that has stomped its way across editions for goodness, we&#8217;re looking like 50 years now. How old is D&amp;D? Goodness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 06:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s ask the question. Like in the original literature, in Dungeons and Dragons, so AD&amp;D, what was the mythos of the Tarrasque there? Did Martha also show up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 07:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think so. So this gets a little outside of the things that I know within D&amp;D, but it&#8217;s basically been just like, we need a big bad kaiju to pop up random places, eat mountains, and take no shits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 07:26<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I can&#8217;t tell you all the way back to a D&amp;D second edition, I can&#8217;t tell you about 3.x. So let me let me tell you about the magical thing that is the setting of Spelljammer. In the same way that Pathfinder is the Pepsi to D&amp;D&#8217;s coke. Spelljammer is the the sprite which spawned to this year, a mist of Sstarfinder. In 3.x, you have this, this setting where you can have all these wonderful, different planets. And so that allowed them to create the planet of FALX. F-A-L-X, everything sentient on Falx lives deep underground, and it&#8217;s mostly mind flayers. And that is because the surface of Falx is inhabited by 10s of thousands of tourists. It is in fact the place&#8230; it is theorized to be the place where tarrasques are from. It is their home planet. And on each individual world where there is &#8220;the Tarrasque&#8221; that is just one of the Falx tarrasques that has somehow been put there because a cosmic accident, a God was born, or the final justification for anything you need in D&amp;D: a Wizard did it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 07:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there is an item in Icewind Dale called a Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning so there&#8217;s there&#8217;s your answer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 08:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s your answer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 08:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I don&#8217;t think you should practice with that scroll very often. But so so Falx is a planet, and on the planet Falx, the core of it is filled with mines flayers&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 08:55<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the surface is filled with tarrasques. Don&#8217;t go there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 08:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the greatest thing to me is that right the mind flayers are afraid to go to the surface.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 09:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I don&#8217;t know that they&#8217;re afraid necessarily, although I think they levitate. So spoilers. We&#8217;ll get to why that&#8217;s a problem here in a moment&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 09:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not the Tarrasque. The mind flayers, just to be clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 09:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 09:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a whole nother level of terrifying. Okay, cause mind flayers normally do live underground, right? Like they&#8217;re an underdark type. Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 09:24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do. Yeah, they&#8217;re an underdark type. But I mean, a tarrasque is largely immune to a lot of the stuff that makes them so horrifying. You know, a standard mind flayer by itself is like as insincere like 10? Some&#8230; like somewhere between 8 and 12 I think, I don&#8217;t know somewhere in there.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 09:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 09:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s&#8230; it&#8217;s challenging. But it, mostly it&#8217;s, you know, whole shtick is like, I&#8217;m gonna stun you inside your brains out. Well, that doesn&#8217;t work if you&#8217;re a kaiju. So no matter how many of them work together, it just doesn&#8217;t care. So yes, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s why they live deep underground is because a planet full of tarrasques.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 09:58<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 09:58<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. If ever you There&#8217;s an excuse to live in a cave. There you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 10:02<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice. Okay. And so yeah, the&#8230; not&#8230; what&#8217;s right way to put it? Not every story has to say that there is this planet Falx. Some of the mythos is just that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, we live here and there&#8217;s a tarrasque sometimes. And sometimes it kills everything. Right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 10:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s about right. Pathfinder&#8217;s setting, Golarion, has a really good take on the Tarrasque. So in in golarion, there is a deity type creature called Rovagug, who is the God of Destruction. And basically at the beginning of time, all the other gods were like, We can&#8217;t have you messing up existence. So we&#8217;re going to chain you in place and bury you underneath the North Pole, like some kind of messed up Santa. And Rovagug, famously into just wrecking stuff. Bits of his body fall off in turn into kaijus, the biggest of which is the Tarrasque, which is nicknamed nicknamed, in Golarion &#8220;the apocalypse engine.&#8221; Which if you ever were going to have a nickname, pretty good. So I want to talk about the Tarrasque stats a little bit. Like if we can get into the mechanics. So Random, I think you know,the third edition version of the Tarrasque a bit better than me. You want to go into that for me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 11:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would love to. Um, so, I mean, the stats on this thing are ridiculous, right? Like, is it a CR 20? Sure, but you know, if you look at it, it&#8217;s gonna hit anything. It&#8217;s AC is, you know, reasonably low, but that&#8217;s because it has nearly 1000 hit points. So it kind of doesn&#8217;t care. But it also does fun things like it&#8217;ll crit on an 18 to 20 because it wants to and it does triple damage on the grid because it wants to. The couple things in here that are really interesting and unique: the carapace. This is the thing that I looked at this and went &#8220;oh my god, I want to use this in some fight&#8221; and then was sad, I never got to. Anything, it&#8230; their, their wording on this so that they can have some kind of justification is hilarious. The Tarrasque&#8217;s armor-like is exceptionally tough and highly reflective, deflecting, deflecting all arrays, lines, cones, and even Magic Missile spells. So any spell you target at it just has a 30% chance to bounce basically. Otherwise, it just doesn&#8217;t happen. And you check for the reflection before you roll against spell resistance. So it&#8217;s just a 30% chance to not be affected by practically anything, not single target spell. And then you have to get through it spell resistance, which is also high. But the important thing and&#8230; but my favorite thing here in 3.x, there was this concept of regeneration. It was like fast healing where you heal yourself a certain amount every single turn. But the important thing about regeneration is that with regeneration, except for generally one or two damage types that were explicitly called out, you took all damage as non lethal damage. There was some more mechanics but basically, you couldn&#8217;t ever kill something with regeneration unless you had the exact damage type you needed to overcome it. You can only knock it unconscious, and then it would keep healing. Well, the Tarrasque has regeneration and the thing that you can use to negate its regeneration is&#8230; just kidding, you can&#8217;t you can only ever knock it to sleep. And then you need to cast Wish, literally Wish or Miracle a ninth level spell while it is asleep. You have to wish that it stayed dead. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the only way to kill it. You just got to deal with it. And oh, also, just because why not? If you were flying, it would just burrow because it has a burrow speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 13:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I forgot about that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 13:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, once per minute, or no, I&#8217;m sorry. That&#8217;s the rush. I&#8217;m thinking of a different burrow. Once per minute, it will just run at 150 feet in a round. Kust you know casually traveled like 30 miles an hour to catch up to you. And then, you know other generic kaiju things like eating people and being scary. But yeah, that, that carapace and the regeneration, that was really the stuff that worked together to make this thing so truly terrifying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 14:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m reading now, so even story-wise, right, if it loses a limb it grows that limb back in 1d6 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 14:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 14:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 14:08<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, no, you largely didn&#8217;t kill this thing unless you were gearing up to kill the Tarrasque specifically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 14:13<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which&#8230; Okay, so talking about having Wish your Miracle available to you. So in in third edition, at what level would a&#8230; spellcaster have Wish or Miracle available to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 14:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same as fifth edition: 17.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 14:24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 14:25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they have straight-classed Wizard or Cleric, which&#8230; So by the way, bards were two thirds casters, bards did not get there. Druids also don&#8217;t get there. So you specifically needed a Sorcerer or Wizard or a Cleric to straight class and that was a lot less common in fifth edition. Er, in third edition, because of prestige classes. And a lot of prestige classes would penalize you some of your casting levels if you were trying to do something so like if you wanted to focus on abjuration maybe you be a initiate of the seven-fold veils. You know, that could take up some of your spellcasting levels to get you other cool abilities, which a lot of characters want. The the prestige classes were very powerful, but it would mean that you know, maybe you don&#8217;t get access to Wish or Miracle ever. And so you just like oh, that&#8217;s the Tarrasque. I guess I&#8217;ll leave because I can&#8217;t win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 15:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I&#8217;m gonna go hide in a hole now. Let me see if I can find some mind players to camp out with. Nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 15:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that or find magic items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 15:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did&#8230; how did that stat sheet change? Like, has it? You know, is the Tarrasque ever stronger now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 15:36<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, okay. Yes and no. So I&#8217;m going to take a quick dip back into&#8230; into Pathfinder world because I want to touch on the cool stuff that Paizo did with the Tarrasque. So. the tarrasque, CR 20 in third edition and 3.5. Has regeneration, all those things. Really hard to kill, fatal weakness of the Tarrasque, it can&#8217;t really jump, it can&#8217;t fly. So all you have to do is be about 30 feet off the ground and chase it and eventually you&#8217;ll kill it. Mate, basically, you put your party on a flying carpet and you just stay slightly out of range and shoot at it until it dies or burrows, or you get clever. Anyway, Pathfinder solved that by giving it a ranged attack, which feels a little bit like cheating. So if you&#8217;ve looked at the manticore&#8217;s stats, they have tail spikes that they can like snap at people is a ranged weapon. They just put that on the Tarrasque. It works. It&#8230; they also raise the CR to 25. Not that it needed it, but you know, you can no longer just cheat by flying, so now suddenly it&#8217;s an actual threat to a high-level party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 16:46<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So actually I want to ask about this. You were saying that you could just fly behind it and kind of you know pew pew with, you know, I assume magical arrows or whatever your ranged weapon of choice are because non-magical no piercing bludgeoning and slashing have no effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 17:03<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 17:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8230; I when I when I was studying up to to have this conversation I found on like the Forgotten Realms wiki, this idea that there was like a cone of suck around the Tarrasque such that creatures couldn&#8217;t fly above a certain height. Was that&#8230; was that something written in? Or is this something that like folks have added to the lore to actually make this make sense? like is that a homebrew&#8230; homebrew rule that&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 17:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s the the flight ceiling that Random put on me. That&#8217;s a different story. Honestly, I haven&#8217;t seen that in the mechanics. It&#8217;s entirely possible that it&#8217;s in second edition or first edition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 17:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, that makes sense.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 17:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just not familiar with those rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 17:46<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it wasn&#8217;t in&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t in the fifth edition monster manual. Certainly. And that Yeah, it definitely got the wheels going.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 17:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yes, is something that would make flight less of a problem for the Tarrasque is always the solution for making the Tarrasque more interesting. Second Edition Pathfinder didn&#8217;t really change anything basically just adapted, adapted the mechanics like hey, if it&#8217;s not broken, don&#8217;t fix it. One of my favorite things that we lost in the transition to fifth edition was third edition&#8217;s regeneration. A lot of creature&#8230; like regeneration fifth edition is basically just you regain hit points every round and that&#8217;s that. So like trolls, the Tarrasque, vampires, a lot of stuff, they just regain hit points, but yeah, okay, that will make it really hard to kill a creature unless you kill it quickly. But it can&#8217;t do weird stuff. Like, ah, you forgot to set the troll on fire. So the troll&#8217;s still kicking. And the Tarrasque&#8217;s weird ability to regrow stuff really quickly was actually the inspiration for a for a third-party setting called Salt in The Wou nds, which was kickstarted a few years back, and there&#8217;s an adaptation for fifth edition and for Pathfinder, but the basic premis is, there&#8217;s some city somewhere that somehow managed to capture the Tarrasque and is just mining it for stuff because it regrows everything in like 1d6 minutes, so there&#8217;s entire industries that are like no, my job is just I mind tarrasque narrow and that is all I do all day, and it just keeps coming back. Yeah, that&#8217;s so if you&#8217;re willing to eat kaiju food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 19:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not&#8230; not kaiju food, just&#8230; it&#8217;s you. We&#8217;re kaiju food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 19:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 19:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s terrible. So I the entire setting is&#8230; I have, like, I have captured the Hydra. And I&#8217;m just going to keep chopping off feet and legs and diving in. Like I&#8217;m going to tunnel in and set up&#8230; Yeah, of course you would literally mine. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the setting. Ho.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 19:51<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it solves the food scarcity problem, which is always an interesting philosophical question to ask. Like, Star Trek is like &#8220;hey, What do we do in a post scarcity society?&#8221; So Salt in the Wounds is like, okay, there&#8217;s no food scarcity. Now what happens? Because we&#8217;ve got this kaiju, and also we&#8217;ve got, like, wizards and stuff. Yeah, it&#8217;s cool, go check it out. They have some products up on Drive Thru RPG, we&#8217;ll have affiliate links down in the show notes. It is a very interesting premise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 20:24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s&#8230; that is interesting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 20:26<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s finally get to the meat of things. And let&#8217;s talk about what happens to the Tarrasque in fifth edition. So if&#8230; if you&#8217;ve played fifth edition for a while, at some point, you&#8217;re going to go in the Monster Manual, and you&#8217;re going to look at the highest CR creatures in there. And right at the top of the list is the Tarrasque at cr 30. It was 20 in third edition, it was 25 and Pathfinder. It&#8217;s 30 in fifth edition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 20:50<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which actually it would be worthwhile for folks at home CR rating, challenge rating, how is that supposed to scale? How are we supposed to think about a 20 versus a 25 versus a 30?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 20:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great question. So character levels run from 1 to 20 and always have in dungeons and dragons, basically. So a monster will have what&#8217;s called a challenge rating, which is a rough estimate of how powerful it is. So a party of adventurers of about four people, is expected to be challenged in a fight by a creature of the same challenge training. So let&#8217;s say if I had four level 10 adventures, a challenge rating 10 monster is usually a good challenge for them. So adventurers go up to level 20, and then like that is&#8230; that is as high as you can get. And then the Tarrasque is all the way up there at CR 30.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 21:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for even if we have our level 20 adventures, you know, decked out with all the best equipment, the idea of a level 30 is that this is beyond challenging. Yeah. So you need to bring additional adventures which is going to&#8230; to scale this correctly. Okay. Yeah, wow. 30 is a big number. That&#8217;s a big jump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 21:57<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And to put it bluntly, it&#8217;s a little overrated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 22:03<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won;t tell the Tarrasque that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 22:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So this was kind of a problem in third edition, but it&#8217;s way worse in fifth edition. If you can be above the Tarrasque just a little bit, it cannot hurt you. And all you have to do is follow it around with enough&#8230; with a bow and enough arrows and you can kill it and you can do this at any level. It&#8217;s&#8230; it will still take damage from non-magical weapons. It has resistance, not immunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 22:36<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, that&#8217;s actual immunity, isn&#8217;t it? Yep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 22:39<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, man. Did I? have I gotten this wrong for years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 22:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking for it right here. But with that said, I mean, you know, a second level or what a first level Cleric or maybe a third level Cleric can basically just enchant your weapon. And for an hour, you can, you know, shoot your bow at the Tarrasque which accomplishes the same thing. That&#8217;s true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 23:01<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just take shifts napping in whatever flying carpet that you&#8217;re using. And&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 23:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>okay, well, let&#8217;s let&#8217;s skip straight to the Cleric. Okay, we have a level one *unintelligible* aarakocra Cleric with Sacred Flame. If you look at reflective therapists, it notably doesn&#8217;t affect things that allow a reflex save, so Fireball, Sacred Flame all those things and it has a +0 bonus on reflex safes. Also notably absent from previous additions, the Trask no longer has regeneration. So you can turn a fight with the Tarrasque into the slowest war of attrition. All you have to do is follow it around and annoy it and it&#8217;s going to it&#8217;s going to reliably fail those reflex saves. So, like, it can&#8217;t rest to spend hit dice because you&#8217;re just following it around annoying it with the 1d8 damage per turn. It can&#8217;t jump more than five feet, which feels silly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 24:01<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 24:02<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that part&#8217;s interesting to me, because in previous editions in&#8230; so in the&#8230; if I look at the PF 2e one, which I just closed I think, one of the ones that I was looking at talks about it explicitly having an enormous, like, bonus to jump specifically to deal with that. Which is why I liked that idea of the flight ceiling. There it is. So the first edition Pathfinder one: powerful leap. It uses its strength to modify acrobatics made a jump and how the plus 24 racial bonus on acrobatic sex made the jump so it&#8217;s flying after you it&#8217;s just doing it, you know, in parabolic fashion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 24:38<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the falling with style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 24:39<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 24:41<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyranosaurus Rock Steady is going to jump straight at you. That was a ninja turtles joke for&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 24:46<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got it. Sorry, took me a second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 24:48<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s good. Okay, and so I&#8217;m looking at the fifth edition, we&#8217;re having across editions but so in AC of 25 is a pretty high AC. What&#8217;s our level one Cleric casting&#8230; casting Sacred Flame, I guess is that against AC or is that a saving throw? Dexterity save?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 25:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a dex save.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 25:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a dex save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 25:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 25:08<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dexterity save, Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 25:09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now admittedly it has magic resistance. So it has advantage, which means that so mathematically, it&#8217;s going to hit a 13.5. If I remember how advantage does math, right? So roughly, you know, that means that like, a 50% of the time, it&#8217;s expected to succeed at your your Sacred Flame. But that means 50% of the time, it&#8217;s expected to fail your Sacred Flame. You&#8217;re doing a d8 over two damage every turn. Are you eventually going to make it through the 676 hit points? Yeah, that&#8217;s&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 25:44<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s actually&#8230; I&#8217;m, let&#8217;s like run through this real quick. I think we can do this live and everybody&#8217;s gonna love it. So I&#8217;m going to get five hits a minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 25:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8230; Okay, so let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s do the math this way. So on one turn, you would do if you hit, you would do a d8 average, which is four and a half. Nine&#8230; Yeah, four and a half.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 26:05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 26:05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now we need to cut that in half. So it&#8217;s two and a quarter. Okay. So 676 over two and a quarter. It&#8217;s gonna take you 300 ish rounds. And 10 rounds is a minute. So 100 is 10 minutes. So it&#8217;s going to take you half an hour of chasing the Tarrasque Sacred Flaming it to death as a single aarakocra cleric. Okay, and it will be dead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 26:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp; And, and it has 40 foot land speed. So it is slower than an aarakocra and it only has a land speed. It can&#8217;t burrow away anymore. It has no tricks. All it can do is run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 26:45<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. How?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 26:47<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CR 30.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 26:49<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, okay, it has legendary resistance. So three times a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 26:53<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8230; You&#8217;re right, it will. I&#8217;m sorry. It will take exactly three more rounds, six more rounds. If we&#8217;re being generous with math.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 27:02<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s&#8230; That&#8217;s all I wanted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 27:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you that one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 27:05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can make a creature spend a legendary resistance to resist a cantrip. Like, get yourself a trophy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 27:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So what&#8217;s, how are we going to take this? What are we going to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 27:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve had this discussion online a couple of times, and the thing that people usually suggest me, why doesn&#8217;t the Tarrasque just throw a rock? And okay, reasonable question. All right. So let&#8217;s look at the same stats similar. It has an intelligence of three, which is as smart as a dog, okay, like not a smart dog. Like a dog. Like Charles Barkley if we can reference him again, Not the not the person: my dog, who occasionally appears on everyone&#8217;s audio. So he is what I consider a pretty typical intelligence dog, like responds to commands, can kind of learn thing, knows how to get into the trash, all those good things that dogs do. Could could Charlie figure out how to throw a rock? No, no, he could not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 28:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I watched Charlie try to put his head on a pillow the other day, and instead he fell off the couch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 28:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8230; that happened. That has happened several times, in fact. Again, typical dog. So there are animals who will throw rocks. Well, not rocks, but objects. Squirrels will famously like drop things from trees to drive away&#8230; I assume predators? I don&#8217;t know what a squirrels do? Like, primates, which&#8230; generally on the smarter end of animals, primates will frequently, like, throw for rocks and use tools but that&#8217;s probably a bit above intelligence three. If I remember correctly, like, apes are listed like five or something like that. So the Traskarrasque is dumb as dirt. It&#8217;s not smart enough to throw a rock. Even if it could, I don&#8217;t know that it would be very good at it. Yeah. Like Okay, you could argue plus 10 from the strength but..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 29:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it would be very good at accelerating a rock, whether or not it can you know, get the release point right, to you know, Nolan Ryan you straight down the straight through your face as a whole nother&#8230; I&#8217;m again reminded of our infinitely stacked centaurs. So, right, fifth edition, we talked about the grid and the grid is 2d. This is actually a tall beast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 29:33<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, technically, everything is cubic. Although that doesn&#8217;t come up very often, but like, you know, technically speaking, a human is a five-foot cube as far as D&amp;D is concerned, which, as someone who is taller than five feet, I am mildly offended by. But regardless, you know&#8230;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 29:50<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least you&#8217;re not wider than five feet though, right? Let&#8217;s&#8230; tiny, tiny miracles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 29:55<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, you know, is this thing maybe&#8230; what gargantuan is 20 by 20? So is this thing maybe 20 feet tall? We could argue that and you could then argue that the reach applies on top of that. But even so, if you&#8217;re going to get all of those attacks, I guess actually, it doesn&#8217;t have multi attack, so you really only get to choose once. That&#8217;s right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 30:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has multi-attack,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 30:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does. Lower-left corner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 30:19<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can use Frightening Presence, so make everything run away. Then five attacks: one bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, one with its tail. And if it&#8217;s already bitten, and therefore is grappling in the mouth, it can swallow you instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 30:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There we go. Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 30:36<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 30:36<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, if you&#8230; if you wanted to try and rule three-dimensionally, then I like your idea of a flight ceiling earlier, particularly because as I said, Yes, I have had to impose impose a flight ceiling in my games, because no, you can&#8217;t just fly 100 feet above the goblin army and drop alchemists fire and fireballs until they&#8217;re all dead. That&#8217;s dumb. Now, is that dumb from a military standpoint? No, that&#8217;s an amazing tactic. Everyone should do that. But it also renders the vast majority of content utterly pointless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 31:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, Pathfinder gave Call Lightning a range of like a mile. What was I gonna do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 31:12<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s what I get for letting you be a druid. Yeah, but I mean, I like the idea of just this thing is so reality warping that it has its own literal gravity, you can&#8217;t fly. Like, if you&#8217;re within, I don&#8217;t know, a mile of it, you can only go 50 feet off the ground, and then it can eat you from there. Or, you know, whatever the case may be. That&#8217;s that&#8217;s probably how I would fix it. Because if you do have to fight this thing on level ground, it is a terror. Yeah, no joke. Like, it will still give you a real hard time no matter how high level you are.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 31:48<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 31:48<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you fight it as it&#8217;s meant to be fought, which is that you&#8217;re not supposed to survive, the likelihood of you surviving. Not good.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 31:57<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dramatically reduced.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 32:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I liked the tail spike. I feel like that makes a lot of sense. Because even the creature would be giving up the multi attack potentially to use the tail spike. Or maybe as a DM, you just introduce like, yeah, you know, I get sick shots, and I can aim them as I&#8230; as I choose. But I also like even the idea that it can jump, like that solves most of this, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 32:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 32:21<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the range on Sacred Flame?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 32:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>60? 60 feet?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 32:25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 32:25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>60 feet.&nbsp; Okay. So you say Sure, I can jump that. And here&#8217;s the you know, like, I feel like there&#8217;s a conversation between DM and the players, you can go that route. If it manages to knock your level one Cleric out of the sky. That&#8217;s a long fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 32:41<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you just look at the straight damage on his stat block, any attack will outright kill a first level character. It&#8217;s gonna do double your hit points. You&#8217;re just dead. Yeah, like there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s no question.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 32:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you just have the the threads of any of these things, it didn&#8217;t become something that you actually have to approach at the final level. So I guess the the Tarrasque can be an effective 5e monster. I think there&#8217;s an interesting conversation. I think probably this is a longer podcast, but now the Tarrasque is probably not your BBEG. It isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re you know, this isn&#8217;t the culmination of a campaign. Although it could be where your campaign ends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 33:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would&#8230; I definitely think like you can have a lot of fun with because it is mindless. It doesn&#8217;t really have the character to be a big bad evil guy. (There&#8217;s your abbreviation, folks.) Right? It&#8217;s&#8230; it is not the thing that is pulling the strings, at least I hope not because, God a sentient tarrasque is not something I ever want to deal with. But you know, maybe your BBEG summons the Tarrasque accidentally or on purpose or you know, that&#8217;s the whole plot is I&#8217;m going to unleash this terror on the world. So you could find a way to work that in and work that encounter in or there is always of course, the fun, &#8220;Yes, you dream about a fight with the Tarrasque. Let&#8217;s play it and you wake up and we carry on without consequence.&#8221; Just if you want to experience the preposterous statblock in that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 34:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, honestly, that has to be&#8230; that has to be the best way to do it. But then, if your characters actually are successful, like in the dream, they have prophecy that they&#8217;re going to find loot. It happens to be under their pillow when they wake up. they go. Perfect. Nice. Alright, I think that was a good conversation. Right, folks? Okay, on to the question of the week. I&#8217;m going to look, you know, but behind the scenes podcasting, we&#8217;re going to do a or b.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 34:34<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 34:35<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 34:35<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B. Like, okay, hey, we&#8217;re gonna do next time. It&#8217;s gonna be great. Okay, this question comes to us from @knower85667267 on Twitter. The question is, &#8220;what are fun weapons to use?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 34:50<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool so&#8230; so for fifth edition, there&#8217;s not a ton of variety of in weapons, which is kind of a shame. Some pole arms have some cool stuff like lances. Nets are one of my favorites. They&#8217;re a huge pain in the butt to make them work. Like&#8230; immensely frustrating, but when you can make them work, real nice. That&#8217;s&#8230; that&#8217;s kind of it. Other than that it&#8217;s just damage. Oh, well, whips. Yeah, reach, finesse. Not a great damage die, But you&#8217;ve got a breach in finesse. What else do you need?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 35:20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, actually, I&#8217;ll go like&#8230; talk a little about that a little bit more. So we have our simple weapons, and we have finesse weapons. What&#8217;s the advantage of using a finesse weapon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 35:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finance lets you use dexterity for attacking damage, which is useful if you want to build around dexterity. It&#8217;s crucial for rogues. Whips are the only thing that you can sneak attack with using reach. Like, ranged weapons obviously, will have more range than reach, but you can use a whip and a shield. And that&#8217;s pretty great.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 35:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice. Yeah, I mean that from an RP standpoint, that seems like a lot of fun. I guess more generally, as DM is like, Are you are you willing to re skin you know, instead of a broadsword, I have the world&#8217;s largest meat cleaver, and that&#8217;s going to be&#8230; you know, I want Cloud Strife&#8217;s sword. That&#8217;s what I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 36:09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why stop at a Buster Sword when you can have a nine foot long Katana if we&#8217;re going full founder fantasy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 36:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh 100%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 36:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of speaking of katanas and reskins, actually, you know, it&#8217;s really interesting to see like, like I&#8217;ve talked about in other editions. Fifth Edition does&#8230; er, other episodes. Fifth edition does a really good job of being a framework. Even in 3.5, where we had a staggering array of nearly two pages of weapons. There was a&#8230; so that the samurai class eventually got introduced. And because there was Samurai we all right, we need rules for a katana and wakizashi. Well, it&#8217;s dumb to just introduce another thing when we already have 50 line-items of weapons. So Katana is a bastard sword and a wkizashi is a short sword and there you go. Just call them something else, even in the crunchiest editions are still happy to do that. And I, I think that in fifth edition, really, you know, as far as what&#8217;s fun to use, make whatever you want. I will say that the improvised weapon rules are probably way better in this edition, than they have been in 3.x. So like, if, if fun for you is yes, I&#8217;m going to tavern brawl, rip a leg off a stool and beat somebody with it. Or just beat somebody with the whole stool or if you&#8217;re strong enough beat somebody with the whole bar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 37:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But but the improvised weapon rolls in it just a d4?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 37:30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improvised weapons in 3.5. Were really bad. Okay, because bonuses, like because math was not bounded, like it is in fifth edition. In 3.5, you know, if you were swinging a table leg at something with an AC of 30. And, you know, we were just talking about the, the tarrasque with an AC of 30 and AC, AC of 25. An AC of 25 is enormous in fifth edition, right? You&#8217;re, you&#8217;re hardly ever going to touch that. But in 3.x, an AC of 25 was like a yes, I am a third level Fighter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 38:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 38:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&#8230; the improvised weapons, like one one prestige class was good with them: Drunken Master. A Monk prestige class. And everyone else just like, if I hit you with this, I&#8217;m probably not going to hit and even if I do hit, it&#8217;s going to deal like nothing damage and strength being the only&#8230; so there was a concept of finesse in 3.x, but like improvised weapons were never finesse. And a lot of times like anyone who had the strength to use an improvised weapon, I was just gonna be like, okay, but I have a sword. So why would I bother?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 38:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, RP-wise like there&#8217;s there&#8217;s no point unless for some reason you&#8217;re not holding your sword or isn&#8217;t available to you. Right?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 38:47<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 38:48<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a DM in fifth edition, would you push folks to use the improvised weapon rules or would you just push to reskin and say, hey, look, I&#8217;m gonna give your you know, instead of giving you a plus one weapon, I&#8217;m gonna give you your nine-foot Katana and say you have 10 foot reach, but other than that, it has the stats of a katana<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 39:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would definitely push the reskin myself. If this is something that somebody wants long-term if I&#8217;m gonna have this nine-foot Katana for a single legendary bossfight square by noble omatsu, great. You do that. And then it&#8217;s gone and who really cares what the rules are? If you want to keep your&#8230; your really cool thing forever, then yeah, we should work to figure out like okay, what is this most like? Then really, you know, make sure that you are having your fun with that weapon because that&#8217;s the theme of the character, right? Yeah, like the only really mechanically fun weapon is whips because it&#8217;s the only thing that has something interesting and like some of the polearms. Lances, you know, the the thing where you can like attack at range, but then if you&#8217;re mounted it, you don&#8217;t have the disadvantage on things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 39:56<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can fight one-handed with the wire mounted and then anything within five feet you take disadvantage, which it&#8217;s the only polearm that does that in fifth edition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 40:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 40:05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 40:05<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like, there&#8217;s there&#8217;s not a whole lot of crunch in fifth edition because there&#8217;s not intended to be a whole lot of crunch. So it really just becomes, you know, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s take the thing that is fun and scan it the way I wanted. Yeah, okay,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 40:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna push, we need the answer @Knower85667267&#8217;s question. What are fun weapons to use with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 40:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, mechanically&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 40:24<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna go, I&#8217;m gonna go. I&#8217;m gonna go first. I&#8217;m gonna give everybody a chance. Go for it. I am 100% I&#8217;m gonna go for the Buster Sword because I&#8217;m gonna RP the hell out of that. With my scrawny arms and my really tall hair. That&#8217;s gonna be great. Wonderful. Alright, Tyler, what do you got?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 40:39<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, mechanically, it&#8217;s real weird hit somebody with a whip. But it&#8217;s&#8230; weird to think about hitting someone with a weapon. Mechanically, very satisfying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 40:51<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no real fun that I&#8217;ve experienced, mechanically with weapon apart from what we&#8217;ve talked about. However, I&#8217;m just going to plug my DM and say, if you&#8217;re in a low-magic setting, and you therefore instead of getting a bunch of magic items, get granted something crafted for you. I have basically used&#8230; what if a Druid made me mjolnir as a weapon. That was so much fun. Obviously not something that you&#8217;re going to you know, find laying around, although I can. I&#8217;ve recreated it as homebrew in D&amp;D beyond. So I guess we can technically link it in the show notes. So there you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 41:27<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan, we should do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 41:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I&#8217;m suddenly reminded you talking about mjolbnir. So I ran a campaign where I gifted Azuredge in Waterdeep, which was an axe with the spirit of a fella sworn to protect Waterdeep to somebody who maybe wasn&#8217;t as interested. And so that was a fun weapon, because it had personality, and often was very disappointed in the player characters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 41:56<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were disappointing characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Random&nbsp; 41:59<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, man, sometime we should do an episode talking about sentient items across editions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyler&nbsp; 42:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great idea.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randall&nbsp; 42:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think if we&#8217;re excluding sentient items, we&#8217;ve given great answers. Better than all that might just be whatever sentient item. Because again, as Azuredge had the choice, it wouldn&#8217;t let you pick it up if it disagreed with you. So yeah, @knower85667267 maybe that&#8217;s the answer to your question. Azuredge, or any sentient item. All right. Well, please join us next time on the RPGBOT.podcast, we&#8217;re gonna do a crash course in character optimization. I hope everybody goes to RPGBOT.net.
