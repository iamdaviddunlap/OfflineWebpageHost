If this is your\n\tfirst time hearing about it, One D&amp;D is the upcoming &#8220;evolution&#8221; of\n\tDungeons and Dragons tentatively planned for release in 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the journey toward &#8220;One D&amp;D&#8221;, Wizards of the Coast is\n\treleasing monthly Unearthed Arcana documents to get feedback on potential\n\tchanges to the core rules of the game. These documents will be released\n\tmonthly with a feedback survey opened to the public two weeks following the\n\trelease of the playtest materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get in on the playtest, the documents will be distributed as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dndbeyond.com\/sources\/one-dnd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDFs on DnDbeyond<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"im-scared-please-help\">I&#8217;m Scared, Please Help<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I know how closely this community will be watching these playtest documents\n\tand feeling every emotion under the sun. I can&#8217;t make any promises about the\n\tfuture or about what WotC will do. But I&#8217;ve been through a few edition changes\n\tbefore, I participated in the D&amp;D Next playtest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still an idiot, mostly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve survived this before, and I think I&#8217;m a bit wiser now than the last\n\ttime, so I&#8217;m going to try and be a steady hand here. I&#8217;ll be publishing these\n\tblog posts every time we get a playtest document, and I&#8217;m going to dig into\n\tthe crunch with all the same spirit that I take to character optimization\n\tarticles. I&#8217;m going to break stuff, I&#8217;m going to fix stuff, I&#8217;m going to make\n\teducated (using that word generously here) guesses about what will happen to\n\tany given thing. I&#8217;m going to share opinions from the RPGBOT team, too,\n\tbecause they&#8217;re poring over all of this alongside me and they&#8217;re pretty\n\tsmart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that these will be both fun and informative. We&#8217;re in exciting\n\ttimes here, and we get to help shape the future of a game that we love.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-with-the-name\">What&#8217;s with the name?<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Wizards of the Coast is nominally doing away with the concept of &#8220;editions&#8221;\n\tand hoping to keep all players on a single compatible version of D&amp;D, thus\n\tthe name &#8220;One D&amp;D&#8221; rather than the inevitable moniker of &#8220;D&amp;D 5.5&#8221;\n\tthat the rest of us will almost certainly adopt. If you&#8217;re having flashbacks\n\tto XBox&#8217;s confounding naming scheme, you&#8217;re not alone. I&#8217;m sure the final\n\tbooks will just say &#8220;Dungeons and Dragons&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backwards-compatibilityasterisk\">Backwards Compatibility(asterisk)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>When the next evolution of D&amp;D was announced, we were told that it would\n\tbe backwards-compatible but we didn&#8217;t get details about what exactly that\n\twould mean. Currently, it means that the rules will be backwards-compatible\n\twith all of the published adventures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also likely that more recent supplements including Monsters of the\n\tMultiverse and Spelljammer: Adventures in Space will be compatible with the\n\tnew rules because they&#8217;re already updated to the new design philosophy for\n\tbackgrounds and races. We don&#8217;t have any word on other supplements like\n\tTasha&#8217;s, but I&#8217;m going to ask you to hold your temper for the time being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will hopefully be something in place to help adapt existing character\n\toptions to the updated rules. If not, I&#8217;m sure someone from the community will\n\twrite them. Maybe me, but my crystal ball is not that clear yet.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"origins\">Origins<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Every character&#8217;s &#8220;origin&#8221; includes their race, their background, and an\n\tadditional language that they know (for a total of three since you get Common\n\tfor free and one from your background).<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"races\">Races<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Yes, they&#8217;re still using the term &#8220;race&#8221;. Since all Humanoid pairings can now\n\tby the rules produce viable offspring, the term is technically inaccurate, and\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd-needs-to-re-think-race-design\/\">I&#8217;ve written before<\/a>\n\tabout how D&amp;D should move away from the term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen 5e evolve over time with the custom origin rules and the gradual\n\tshift in how races are designed, eventually landing on the new design method\n\tin Monsters of the Multiverse where every race used generic ability scores\n\t(+2\/+1 or three +1s), every race got 30 foot speed at minimum, and every race\n\tused the same height\/weight\/age ranges as humans unless noted otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability scores have moved to be a part of your background, but that&#8217;s a\n\tdistinction without a difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All races now explicitly specify their creature type. Since we&#8217;ve added\n\tseveral fey and some constructs, this is going to become more necessary over\n\ttime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All races now use the updated rules for innate spellcasting, allowing you to\n\tchoose a spellcasting ability and re-cast the spells using spell slots. No\n\tsurprise there. Innate spellcasting typically grants a cantrip at 1st level, a\n\t1st-level spell at your 3rd character level, and a 2nd-level spell at your 5th\n\tcharacter level. There are, of course, exceptions (see the Gnome, below).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subraces both are and aren&#8217;t a thing. &#8220;Cultural&#8221; subraces have gone a way in\n\tfavor of defining those cultural aspects with your background. Subraces with\n\tinnate physical effects have stuck around, following the model of the Aasimar\n\tpublished in Monsters of the Multiverse. Effectively, you have one trait that\n\tgives you a multiple choice option for your subrace which generally then gives\n\tyou one or more traits or a suite of innate spellcasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The playtest PDF includes a sidebar about characters with mixed racial\n\theritage. You pick one race to define your traits (the mechanical parts),\n\taverage the lifespans of your parents&#8217; races, and describe your character&#8217;s\n\tappearance how you see fit. I&#8217;m curious to see how this affects half-elves and\n\thalf-orcs, especially since neither are included in the playtest document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The races have updated lore entries, too. Where the 2014 PHB describes races\n\tas they exist in the Forgotten Realms and very similar worlds, this text takes\n\ta broader view of the DnD multiverse and describes settings and deities from\n\tnumerous official settings including Dragonlance and Eberron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the included races:<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"human\">Human<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The standard human was dropped (not that anyone ever played one), so all\n\thumans get one skill and one feat. You also get Inspiration on a long rest,\n\twhich ties into the updated Inspiration mechanics in the playtest document.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ardling\">Ardling<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>New race. Think Tieflings, but celestial, and instead of colorful with horns\n\tthey have animal traits. They can fly one turn at a time PB\/day and can cast\n\tsome cleric spells based on your choice of &#8220;Celestial Legacy&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what will happen to aasimar, but Crawford described ardlings as\n\t&#8220;cousins&#8221; of aasimar, so they may continue to exist alongside each other. But\n\tconsidering that the Heavenly Ardling has a lot of overlap with the Aasimar, I\n\twouldn&#8217;t be surprised if aasimar go away or are absorbed by the Ardling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wild guess: Something like the obscure Hellbred race from 3.5 or the Cambion\n\twill be added as the new opposite to Aasimar.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dragonborn\">Dragonborn<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Updated to allow breath weapon PB\/day, but it also went back to being an\n\tAction rather than replacing an attack. The damage scaling was also changed\n\tyet again, and everybody uses a 15-foot cone.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dwarf\">Dwarf<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Largely the same as the Hill Dwarf, but two tool proficiencies instead of any\n\tweapon proficiencies. Stonecunning is now Tremorsense for 10 minutes at a time\n\tand doesn&#8217;t give you anything around weird stone. Thematically different from\n\twhat Tremorsense has been for decades, but mechanically much more useful.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"elf\">Elf<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Elves use wording closer to the updated Eladrin and Shadar-Kai from Monsters\n\tof the Multiverse and the Astral Elf from Spelljammer. Fey Ancestry affects\n\tcharm, Trance affects sleep. Unlike those three varieties of elf, the base\n\tElf&#8217;s Trance doesn&#8217;t give you proficiencies. Otherwise, the core elf traits\n\tare unchanged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where elves saw the most change is in their new &#8220;Elven Lineage&#8221; trait (the\n\tsubrace replacement). Drow are mechanically almost identical to the 2014 PHB\n\tbut with updated innate spellcasting mechanics and Sunlight Sensitivity is\n\tgone. High elves add some leveled spells and can retrain their cantrip on a\n\tlong rest. Wood Elves are fast and get some druid spellcasting, including Pass\n\tWithout Trace to replace the nearly unusable Mask of the Wild.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gnome\">Gnome<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Gnomish Cunning now applies all Int\/Wis\/Cha saves, which is <em>huge<\/em> and\n\taccounts for most of the Gnome&#8217;s power budget. Gnome Lineage (the subrace\n\treplacement) offers the same Forest Gnome and Rock Gnome options as the 2014\n\tPHB. Forest Gnomes upgrade their ability to cast Speak With Animals so that\n\tit&#8217;s no longer limited to specific sorts of animals, but can only use it PB\n\ttimes per day. That feels like a loss of flavor, but it&#8217;s much more useful.\n\tRock Gnomes get two cantrips and can use Prestidigitation to replicate their\n\ttinkering ability for the 2014 PHB, though the effects have been reworded to\n\tessentially make the produced item single-purpose Prestidigitation is a\n\tbox.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"halfling\">Halfling<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Effectively identical to the Lightfoot Halfling in the 2014 PHB, but\n\tNaturally Stealth is now just proficiency in Stealth rather than the unique\n\tability to hide behind other creatures.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orc\">Orc<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Playable since at least the 3rd edition Monster Manual, the Orc finally makes\n\ttheir way into the roster of core races. Their traits are unchanged from\n\tMonsters of the Multiverse, which is strong evidence that those races will\n\twork unchanged in the updated ruleset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lore text describes Gruumsh briefly, but intentionally skips over how\n\tGruumsh lost an eye. I&#8217;m curious to see how WotC will handle that in the\n\tfuture. To make a guess: WotC will do something similar with orcs to what they\n\tdid with drow where they say that not all orcs followed Gruumsh into his war\n\twith Correlan, though some did just as some drow continue to follow Lolth.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tiefling\">Tiefling<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>We got a pronunciation guide for Tieflings! No longer will new players\n\tpronounce it &#8220;tye-fling&#8221; unless they skip over that bit of text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tieflings now get a &#8220;Fiendish Legacy&#8221;, replacing the myriad variants and\n\tsubraces introduced throughout 5e&#8217;s history. Tieflings all get Thaumaturgy by\n\tdefault, but you&#8217;ll also get a damage resistance and a full suite of innate\n\tspellcasting from your Fiendish Legacy themed to one of the three major &#8220;lower\n\tplanes&#8221; (hell, etc.). Infernal remains largely identical to the 2014 PHB\n\tTiefling, though Vicious Mockery has been replaced by Fire Bolt.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"backgrounds\">Backgrounds<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Backgrounds got a major update which we&#8217;ve seen coming for a while now based\n\ton the previous Unearthed Arcana documents for<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-news-call-of-the-netherdeep-and-unearthed-arcana-heroes-of-krynn\/\">\n\t\tHeroes of Krynn<\/a>\n\tand a few others, as well as the new backgrounds published in Spelljammer:\n\tAdventures in Space. We expected feats to become a part of backgrounds, but\n\tthe new playtest document goes even further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the 2014 Player&#8217;s Handbook had rules for customizing your background,\n\tmany players didn&#8217;t realize that the rule existed. Now, a custom background is\n\tthe default and pre-written backgrounds are there to serve as easy examples\n\tand pre-made options if you don&#8217;t want to do the work yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the Traits\/Ideals\/Bonds\/Flaws are absent from the new background\n\trules. I would say &#8220;they&#8217;ll add those later&#8221;, but the same change was made in\n\tthe new backgrounds published in Spelljammer. I always enjoyed those as\n\tinspiration or a character&#8217;s personality and they&#8217;re a great tool for quickly\n\tdescribing NPC personalities, but of every player I&#8217;ve spoken to on the\n\tsubject, very few of them can remember those parts of their character. Kobold\n\tPress saw the same challenge and tried to make them mechanically interesting\n\tin<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/kobold-presss-tome-of-heroes-a-review\/\">\n\t\tTome of Heroes<\/a>, so there&#8217;s a clear consensus that there&#8217;s an issue in the current\n\tdesign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your character&#8217;s background is now a much more defining part of your\n\tcharacter both thematically and mechanically. Every background grants +2\/+1 or\n\tthree +1 ability score increases, two skill proficiencies, one tool\n\tproficiency (which includes artisan&#8217;s tools, gaming sets, vehicles, and\n\tgeneral tools like Thieves&#8217; Tools), one language, a 1st-level feat, and 50\n\tGP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the published backgrounds, we see some familiar options like Acolyte\n\tand Criminal, but we also get some great new ones like Cultist and Farmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may be looking too hard, but Cultist feels like the easy go-to for warlocks\n\tand grants a +2 to Intelligence and a +1 to Charisma. This is absolutely a\n\tguess, but I&#8217;m curious to see if warlocks may be Intelligence-based in the new\n\trules. They were briefly Intelligence-based in the D&amp;D Next playtest, but\n\tpeople cried foul since they were Charisma-based when first introduced in DnD\n\t3.5.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"languages\">Languages<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Little has changed here except that characters will all know 3 languages by\n\tdefault rather than 2 to 4 depending on your choice of background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common Sign Language was added, which is exciting. A non-verbal language for\n\tcommunication is both useful tactically for stealth-inclined and a wonderful\n\tmove towards inclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"feats\">Feats<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Every feat has a level. The current playtest document only includes 1st-level\n\tfeats, but it covers many of the familiar feats from the 2014 PHB. The wording\n\ton feats and how they work is much more explicit and precise, and every feat\n\tspecifies whether or not you can take it multiples times (yes for Magic\n\tInitiate and Skilled, no for everything else in the document).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1st-level feats no longer grant ability score increases, so there&#8217;s no\n\tstarting at 18 in something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alert now adds Proficiency Bonus to Initiative instead of a static +5. This\n\tchange means it no longer stacks with the Harengon&#8217;s Hare Trigger trait, which\n\tis fine, but it also means that unless Reliable Talent is reworded, this feat\n\tallows all Rogues to do what Harengon Rogues can do. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s\n\tgood or bad for the game, but Harengon will need an update.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafter is new and it seems like a great option if you rely heavily on\n\tmundane items, especially expendable ones. However, if they don&#8217;t fix<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/crafting-rpgbot-podcast-s2e66\/\">\n\t\tCrafting<\/a>\n\tno one except maybe Thief Rogues enjoying Fast Hands is going to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healer is actually good now. Battle Medic spends the recipient&#8217;s hit dice\n\trather than providing an additional source of healing as it did previously,\n\tbut you can also use it repeatedly so long as the target has hit dice and you\n\thave an operable Healer&#8217;s Kit. You also get to reroll healing that you provide\n\tboth from Battle Medic and from spells if you roll a 1, so this is useful even\n\tif you have other sources of healing available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lucky now has PB\/long rest uses instead of a fixed 3, but what those points\n\tdo has also changed. Instead of rolling an extra die and picking which one to\n\tuse (which conveniently let you pick any of 3 dice if you had Disadvantage in\n\tthe 2014 PHB), you now grant yourself Advantage <em>after<\/em> rolling a d20\n\tTest. You can also impose Disadvantage on an attack against you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic Initiate got a major rework. You now choose from one of the three\n\tuniversal spell lists (see below) rather than from a class and you can pick\n\tyour spellcasting ability, so if you want to be a wizard and get Healing Word\n\tas an Intelligence-based spell, that&#8217;s an option. You always have the leveled\n\tspell prepared, which clarifies how it works with spell slots. I remember\n\tearly in 5e&#8217;s lifetime a lot of people (including me) were confused about how\n\tit worked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musician is new and allows you to grant multiple people Inspiration after a\n\trest, making it abundantly available to the whole party. Humans will get less\n\tbenefit because they already get Inspiration after a Long Rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savage Attacker, which was never a great feat, got reworded. It now works\n\twith ranged weapons, but now it no longer works with attacks made as a Bonus\n\tAction (so no two-weapon fighting), made as part of a spell such as the\n\tBooming Blade or Green-Flame Blade cantrips, or with attacks made as\n\tReactions; you can use it with more weapons, but it&#8217;s less useful. The\n\tlimitation on what weapons you could use was never the problem. The problem\n\twas that mathematically it adds almost nothing to your damage output and the\n\tbenefits become less relevant as characters advance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tavern Brawler is mostly the same, but you can both deal damage and shove a\n\ttarget at the same time once per turn, which involves changes to how Unarmed\n\tStrikes work (see below). That feels tempting since it makes your unarmed\n\tstrikes deal 1d4+Str damage, but rerolling 1&#8217;s on a d4 adds nearly nothing to\n\tyour average damage.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rules-glossary\">Rules Glossary<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conditions-grappled-incapacitated-slowed\">Conditions: Grappled, Incapacitated, Slowed<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Grappled condition ties into updates to Unarmed Strike, so see Unarmed\n\tStrike, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incapacitated does more stuff. It&#8217;s still conceptually the same, but the\n\trules are more precise and it breaks Concentration so it&#8217;s more impactful\n\tagainst spellcasters than it was previously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowed is a new condition. Movement costs double (you move at half speed),\n\tattacks against you have Advantage, and you suffer Disadvantage on Dexterity\n\tsaving throws. If you read the Grappled condition and you&#8217;re getting nervous\n\tabout moving grappled creatures, don&#8217;t worry: you&#8217;re only slowed\n\t<em>while moving the creature<\/em>, so as soon as you finish moving you&#8217;re\n\tfine. Don&#8217;t walk into anything that requires a Dexterity save, though.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d20-tests-natural-1s-and-natural-20s\">d20 &#8220;Tests&#8221;, Natural 1&#8217;s, and Natural 20&#8217;s<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is <em>all<\/em> d20 rolls: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving\n\tthrows. Having a universal term for that trio to use as a shorthand is\n\thelpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natural 1&#8217;s and 20&#8217;s now result in automatic failure and automatic success,\n\twhich is how a lot of people already thought it worked. This means that\n\tthere&#8217;s a remote chance that the world&#8217;s greatest pickpocket will still mess\n\tup, but it also means that there&#8217;s a 1 in 20 chance that a human peasant can\n\trip a door off of its hinges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolling a natural 20 now gives you Inspiration, which means that there&#8217;s an\n\teasy way to &#8220;farm&#8221; inspiration. Outside of combat you could make repeated\n\tpointless rolls until you roll a natural 20. Throw rocks at something until\n\tyou get a natural 20 on the attack roll.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical Hits are also <em>very<\/em> different. They only work for weapons\n\tand unarmed strikes (no more crits with spells, not that those happened much\n\tfor anyone but warlocks), they only multiply your weapon or unarmed strike\n\tdamage dice (no more multiplying Sneak Attack or Divine Smite), and they\n\tclarified that you do roll the dice twice rather than rolling once and\n\tdoubling it, which was ambiguous in the 2014 PHB.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"inspiration\">Inspiration<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Inspiration, 5e&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/rpgbot-podcast-episode-3\/\">\n\t\tmetacurrency<\/a>, has always been a pain. DMs forget to award it, players forget to use it,\n\tso it functionally doesn&#8217;t exist for many groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The playtest document makes some changes. You get inspiration on any natural\n\t20, providing a fixed, guaranteed source that isn&#8217;t subject to your DM\n\tremembering. You also lose Inspiration when you start a long rest, so it&#8217;s a\n\t&#8220;use it or lose it&#8221; situation. You can still only have one Inspiration at a\n\ttime, but if you get another you can give it to another PC so it&#8217;s not\n\twasted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like this, but I also fear that people are going to force pointless d20\n\trolls to farm Inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spell-lists\">Spell Lists<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>WotC followed Paizo&#8217;s example and now has three &#8220;universal&#8221; spell lists: arcane (wizards, etc.), divine (clerics, etc.), and primal (druids, etc.). It&#8217;s unclear how exactly this will work out in terms of spell availability, but we may end up in a world where bards can cast magic missile and fireball without resorting to Magical Secrets, clerics can (and often should) cast Compelled Duel, and wizards can cast Hex. It might get weird.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unarmed-strikes-grapple-shove\">Unarmed Strikes, Grapple, Shove<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Unarmed Strikes got a major face lift, and they now replace the combat\n\tapplications of the Athletics skill in addition to the ability to deal damage.\n\tHitting with an unarmed strike allows you to choose to deal damage, grapple\n\tthe target, push them 5 feet away, or knock them prone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grappled condition is now more of a problem for the subject because they\n\tnow suffer Disadvantage to attack anyone except the grappling creature. If\n\tyou&#8217;re grappled by multiple creatures, you&#8217;re in trouble. The rules for moving\n\tgrappled creatures got reworded, and, weirdly, tiny creatures can carry each\n\tother around without being Slowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creatures also get an automatic save at the end of each turn to end a grapple\n\twithout spending an Action to do so, and it&#8217;s always made against a DC (for\n\tplayers, it&#8217;s 8+Str+PB) rather than as an opposed check if it&#8217;s the player\n\tdoing the grappling. This means that players who aren&#8217;t built for grappling\n\thave a reasonable chance to escape a grapple without wasting a turn,\n\tteleporting, etc. but it also means that a creature can&#8217;t take an action to\n\tescape and then walk away because the save is at the end of their turn. If the\n\tMonk&#8217;s Martial Arts keeps similar wording to now with respect to Dexterity in\n\tplace of Strength, this change might make Monk grappling a legitimate\n\toption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real sleeper problem here is that shoving a target prone now only\n\trequires an attacker to beat the target&#8217;s AC with an Unarmed Strike, and then\n\tdeclaring Shove to prone. While the size restriction remains, this is really\n\tstrong. Especially with Inspiration flowing so freely now, there&#8217;s no reason\n\tto not just get Advantage on the Unarmed Strike so your whole party can have\n\tAdvantage to stab the target for however long it takes the target to stand\n\tup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, nothing is preventing an attacker from grappling or shoving a\n\ttarget as an opportunity attack now that these effects are simply riders on an\n\tUnarmed Strike. This has some interesting implications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes also mean that the<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/grapple\/\"> grapple\/shove<\/a> combo is seriously impacted. You can no longer make yourself an unstoppable grappler by heavily optimizing Athletics. Considering how annoying the grapple\/shove combo is for the DM, this is probably a good idea, but I&#8217;m still sad because I enjoy the grapple\/shove combo so much.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thoughts-from-the-rpgbot-team\">Thoughts from the RPGBOT Team<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Everyone added themselves in order of when they could get through the PDF.\n\tThis order is likely to change in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tyler\">Tyler<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I mostly like the changes to races. I hope that aasimar don&#8217;t go away; maybe\n\tthey become the Heavenly Ardling and the animal-featured Ardlings are just the\n\tones with the Idyllic legacy since that&#8217;s the one for the Beastlands. I also\n\thope that they&#8217;ll do something to make halflings more interesting. Maybe\n\tsomething around food?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the improvements to the wording on feats. I&#8217;m glad that WotC realized\n\tthat no one considers them an optional rule and they&#8217;re leaning into making\n\tthem both more interesting and more a core part of customizing your\n\tcharacter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect we&#8217;ll see a lot of gish builds around Shillelagh using whatever\n\tability score makes sense. Paladins and Rangers are going to be locked into\n\ttaking Magic Initiate if they want an optimized build, and having one clear\n\t&#8220;best&#8221; answer isn&#8217;t much fun because it makes any other option mean that\n\tyou&#8217;re giving up effectiveness to do literally anything else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musician doesn&#8217;t work as well for humans because you lost the Inspiration\n\tfrom a long rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savage Attacker is still weak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that there are class-exclusive spells which go beyond the universal\n\tspell lists. Bards having the exact same spell list as wizards would be really\n\tweird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing natural 1&#8217;s and 20&#8217;s to work on ability checks is a mistake. I&#8217;m\n\tgoing to throw 20 commoners at all of my problems instead of actually being\n\tgood at ability checks because on average one of them will get a natural 20\n\tand solve my problems for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players can &#8220;farm&#8221; Inspiration by making useless ability checks or attack\n\trolls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do not like the changes to critical hits. Crits now feel really\n\tunderwhelming even, but maybe I&#8217;m undervaluing Inspiration gained from a\n\tnatural 20.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grappling: What happens if multiple creatures grapple me? Do I need a free\n\thand? Does maintaining the grapple require a free hand? Can I grapple multiple\n\tcreatures? And if so, how many?<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"asher\">Asher<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I like the new race changes and that they add a stipulation that races can\n\tlook like anything but use these stats<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ability scores tied to backgrounds is a brilliant change. And the fact that\n\tthey are implementing feats as a baseline feature is great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I disagree with Tyler on the crit changes. Everybody has been ruling crit\n\tsuccess on skill checks and automatic failures on a one for years in both home\n\tgames and on actual plays. I don&#8217;t feel it breaks anything and if it bothers\n\tyou it can be ignored. I also think critical hits being limited to martial\n\tclasses is a decent choice as it gives more value to martial classes as\n\topposed to just making spellcasters better at everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, I hate that only weapon dice are doubled. That is a mistake\n\tand makes rogues way more underwhelming.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rocco\">Rocco<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This UA Playtest doesn&#8217;t actually tell us much about the direction of the\n\tgame going forward. This test is all about whether or not the new method of\n\tcharacter creation works right and feels right, and to that I would say yes,\n\tthis is fine. Attempting to speculate on anything beyond that narrow focus\n\tright now is a fool&#8217;s errand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can speculate on why certain rules are in this document though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Inspiration and the Lucky feat both mention \u201cd20 Test\u201d, the rules\n\texplaining d20 Tests had to be in the document, and it just happens that\n\tCritical hits are a subsection of d20 Test. Therefore we get the current\n\texperimental version of Crits without any context from possible class\n\tchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tavern Brawler feat mentions Unarmed Strikes so, naturally, the rules for\n\tUnarmed Strike are in here, which necessitates the new Grappling rules be\n\tprinted as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are claiming that this whole idea is a huge mistake. I think\n\tWotC&#8217;s only mistake in this playtest is context and pacing. The rules in this\n\tUA definitely rely on other changes that exist on their complete internal\n\texperimental build and we can&#8217;t see those dependent changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while I shouldn&#8217;t speculate on what they mean by backwards compatibility,\n\tIt&#8217;s not that hard to see what that looks like, they&#8217;ve already done this\n\tinside 5th edition. Did you forget the Beast Master rework in TCoE? Or the\n\tVolo&#8217;s races reprinted in MMoM? Instead of doing the core books piecemeal,\n\tscattered across a dozen splatbooks, just doing it all at once makes sense.\n\t\u201cOh no my PHB will be obsolete.\u201d Yeah, that&#8217;s the point, the\n\t<em>PHB, DMG, and MM,<\/em> but not Xanathar&#8217;s, not Tasha&#8217;s, not the setting\n\tbooks, and not the 5 or 6 books coming out in 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"colby\">Colby<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I echo the thoughts that all my colleagues have expressed, but find it\n\trelatively difficult to weigh in on a document that&#8217;s currently so unfinished.\n\tOf course the critical situation is interesting, but given the reaction, and\n\tthat they are asking for the community&#8217;s opinions, I assume a great deal will\n\tchange in that particular realm.<br><br>Instead of repeating ground that&#8217;s\n\tbeen well covered in the last few days since the announcement, let me\n\thighlight a point I hope gets a bit more attention. I&#8217;m excited for the\n\tupdates surrounding race and background, but I&#8217;d like to see a little more\n\teffort into mixed race children than how it currently functions. While it&#8217;s a\n\tgreat leap to come out and say that all races can mix, forcing players to\n\tultimately choose one collection of racial traits doesn&#8217;t seem to be the\n\tinclusive move they think it is. A goblin-elf who just has the mechanics of a\n\tgoblin or the mechanics of an elf just doesn&#8217;t seem to represent that heritage\n\twell.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve personally had multiple DMs homebrew mixed races (and this can be seen\n\twith Jester&#8217;s genasi\/tiefling mix in Critical Role) by choosing some blend of\n\tdifferent racial traits to better represent a character&#8217;s diverse heritage, so\n\tit would be nice if that was actually canonized in the rules. Since it seems\n\tthat WotC and Paizo are in a cycle of borrowing mechanics from each other, I\n\tcross my fingers for a system similar to Paizo&#8217;s PF1e \u201crace point\u201d values so\n\tthat this can be done in a way that makes sense. Perhaps instead the team at\n\tWotC will figure out a better way to do this that I can&#8217;t currently imagine.\n\tThe dialogue surrounding fantasy races and mechanics for them will probably\n\talways be fraught, especially on the internet, but WotC seems interested in\n\tmaking this work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"random\">Random<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I think Tyler&#8217;s note about the large increase in gish builds is very likely.\n\tIt&#8217;s the first thing I thought of when I saw how easily accessible Magic\n\tInitiate now was. I wish it wasn&#8217;t the case that the first round of combat for\n\tmany parties going forward is going to involve at least one casting of\n\tShillelagh, but it does actually open up some interesting possibilities for\n\tpeople who wanted to be Charisma SAD but were already including non-hexblade\n\twarlock levels (like my\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/paladin\/oath-of-conquest\/\">Oath of Conquest<\/a>\n\tpaladin).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Discord server, the team had a lively discussion on the changes to\n\tcrits and I come down pretty firmly on liking the fact that DMs won&#8217;t be\n\tcritting anymore. It personally always felt like killing someone because a\n\tnatural 20 decided it was their time to die rather than the character doing\n\tsomething foolish (or noble) cheapened the story, so this, combined with the\n\tdesign decision to focus more on the recharge mechanics, means that a death is\n\tmore likely the result of a player choice which feels good for agency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also miss the character traits\/ideals\/bonds\/flaws, but even more so, I miss\n\tthat the backgrounds no longer have any mechanical flavor. Many of them\n\tamounted to \u201cI can get my party a place to sleep somewhere for free,\u201d but just\n\thaving that be gone in favor of a feat makes them as a part of character\n\tcreation feel much less interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to see where this goes. There are some interesting ideas in the\n\tplaytest rules and it&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun to watch them evolve over\n\ttime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking at the playtest rules, too, be sure to send your feedback\n\tto WotC once the feedback survey opens on September 2nd.
