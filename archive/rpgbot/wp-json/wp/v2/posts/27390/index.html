In this episode of the RPGBOT.Podcast, we delve into the mechanics and features of this class, discussing its differences from the Artificer, its limited subclass options, and its powerful abilities such as Eyes of the Maker and Shard of Creation. Join us as we break down the augment system, its various effects and limitations, and the exciting Weapon Options feature. And stay tuned as we share our expert insights on building the Metalurgist and Spellrite subclasses, including tips and tricks for level 4 improvements and talents. It&#8217;s time to roll for initiative and discover the wonders of the Mechanist!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this two-part episode of the RPGBOT.Podcast, we begin the build of the Mechanist class from Tales of the Valiant. The team explores the differences between the Mechanist and the Artificer, noting that the Mechanist focuses more on building and enhancing items rather than spellcasting. The team also discusses the limited number of subclasses available for the Mechanist and the potential challenges of adapting Artificer subclasses to the Mechanist. We provide insights into ability scores, lineage, and heritage choices for the class; highlighting the Eyes of the Maker feature, which allows the Mechanist to identify magic items, and the Shard of Creation feature, which grants the Mechanist a ball of loose plasma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the Mechanist&#8217;s ability to inspire themselves and the scaling of their features with level. We\u2019ll move on to the augments, which are similar to infusions in the 5th edition artificer class; and highlight the adhesive, collapsible, detecting, empowered, elusive, and loading augments and their effects. We break down the limitations and scaling of the augments, and discuss the Augments feature of the Tales of the Valiant Mechanist class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we go through each augment and discuss its effects and potential uses and talk about the Efficient Action feature, which allows the use of augments as a bonus action, and the Weapon Options feature, which provides special attacks depending on the type of weapon. Tyler and Ash each will break down builds for the two subclasses of the Mechanist class, the Metalurgist and the Spellrite, briefly mentioning the level 4 improvements and talents.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"materials-referenced-in-this-episode\">Materials Referenced in This Episode<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/koboldpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Flag Reference Document on KoboldPress.com<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/bfrd.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BFRD.net<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Content From RPGBOT.net\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/tov\/transition-guide\/\">5e to ToV Transition Guide<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoy the show, please rate and review us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/id1580860988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple Podcasts<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/3pEIs8ff4CBezpwJyTZZtt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify,<\/a>&nbsp;or your favorite podcast app. It\u2019s a quick, free way to support the podcast, and helps us reach new listeners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love the show, consider joining us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/rpgbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Patreon<\/a>, where backers at the $5 and above tiers get&nbsp;<strong>ad free access to RPGBOT.net and the RPGBOT.Podcast, direct access to the RPGBOT.Team on the RPGBOT.Discord, and can join us every week for live-streamed recordings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support us on Amazon.com when you purchase products recommended in the show at the following link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3NwElxQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/3NwElxQ<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Find Us:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In-depth articles, guides, handbooks, reviews, news on Tabletop Role Playing at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/\">RPGBOT.net<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tyler Kamstra<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RPGBOTDOTNET\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@RPGBOTDOTNET<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rpgbotdotnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook: rpgbotbotdotnet<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/bsky.app\/profile\/rpgbot.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bluesky: rpgbot.bsky.social<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ash Ely<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/startplaying.games\/gm\/gravenashes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Professional Game Master on StartPlaying.Games<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/PdPtnWkSte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Join Ash&#8217;s West Marches-style PF2 Game<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GravenAshes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@GravenAshes<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@AshRavenMedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@ashravenmedia<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Randall James<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/amateurjack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/amateurjack.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AmateurJack.com<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JackAmateur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@JackAmateur<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Producer Dan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lzr_illuminati\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@Lzr_illuminati<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Step into the world of Tales of the Valiant with us as we embark on a two-part exploration of the fascinating and unique Mechanist class.
