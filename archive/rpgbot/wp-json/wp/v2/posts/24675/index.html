Tiles come in boxed sets with a thick stack of sheets with a huge number of tiles in them. The tiles are both wet erase and dry erase friendly, making them easy to do things like marking points of interest, numbering identical enemies, or marking status conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tiles are reversible and oriented so that the reverse sides will line up once cut out of the sheet. In many cases, the reverse sides presen an alternate view of the same building, such as a house both with and without the roof visible, or a wagon with the interior covered or revealed. Creature tokens typically have a color pallet swap, letting you distinguish groups of similar creatures or just pick a different aesthetic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/20231122_201914447_iOS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24676\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/20231122_201924623_iOS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24677\"\/><\/figure><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-ton-of-value-for-the-price\">A Ton of Value for the Price<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very accustomed to terrain tiles and other things like this coming with a small collection of pre-made tiles that you can arrange in various but generally you&#8217;re still going to get some variety of a dungeon because there&#8217;s only so much you can do with a small, expensive box of what is essentially a white board jigsaw puzzle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dungeon Craft is roughly the thickness of laminated paper, which means that they can cram a huge amount of content into a single box. I counted 53 sheets in the Hell and High Water box. Once you&#8217;ve cut out the tiles you plan to use, you can fit a whole session&#8217;s worth of tiles into a ziploc bag.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/20231122_201824484_iOS-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24679\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">This is one box of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/114461E5-0FEB-4CA3-ACBB-36ACA79045FE?ingress=0&amp;visitId=984e6642-9981-4cc9-8733-d7ec631df5ca&amp;lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&amp;store_ref=SB_A08853091OE9GSW6KFJ4G&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=rpgbot-20&amp;linkId=d070f5d92d4c03fda777e2596b5f967a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\">Dungeon Craft<\/a> poorly fanned out on a table to give a rough impression of how much is in one box.

These are two-sided mats with your standard 1-inch grid. They&#8217;re dry erase and wet erase friendly and made of the same material as the Dungeon Craft tiles. The mats are sizeable and fold up nicely. But, they will have creases from being folded and it may be difficult to get them to lie flat, making it difficult to keep your Dungeon Craft tiles in place. Try putting your rulebooks on top of the mats for a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/20231122_202504801_iOS-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24685\" width=\"840\" height=\"630\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dungeon-Craft-Battlemaps-Double-Sided-Laminated\/dp\/1733376658?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rpgbot-20&amp;linkId=81e5866da6ac39d99a7477827669e06f&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\">City Pack BattleMap<\/a> still mostly folded up.

The adventure began with a wagon from the Cursed Lands set which I then encouraged players to decorate with wet erase markers. The specific prompt was &#8220;make this look like it&#8217;s on fire&#8221;, and my players were perfectly happy to commit arson via marker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the adventure I rotated in two sets of monster tokens and several small pieces of terrain. I numbered individual monsters with a wet erase marker so that I could track hit points, and other than trying to write on red demons with a red marker (that&#8217;s on me. my bad.), everything went great!<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Dungeon Craft tiles look fantastic on the table, they help up well to being moved around and written on, and I&#8217;m looking forward to using them again the next time I can get an in-person game together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find more about Dungeon Craft and 1985 Games on their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/8C1A5AC4-7F64-4238-9724-8B722CCB23F4?ingress=0&amp;visitId=984e6642-9981-4cc9-8733-d7ec631df5ca&amp;lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&amp;store_ref=SB_A08853091OE9GSW6KFJ4G&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=rpgbot-20&amp;linkId=8d7a041242ac0301ca447bc5889025f6&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\">Amazon store<\/a> or on the <a href=\"https:\/\/1985games.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1985 Games site<\/a>.
