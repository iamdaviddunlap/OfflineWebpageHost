It provides hundreds of new alchemical and magic items, several news spells, and detailed new rules for crafting items and for researching spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-1 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The new items cover a range of types and uses. Ointments, potions, and permanent gear, all in a wide variety of item types which goes well beyond what\u2019s in the official rules. Tome of Alchemy contains no new weapons, armor, or wands (consider Frog God\u2019s Tome of Wondrous Items or Kobold Press\u2019s Vault of Magic if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for), but the nearly 30 pages of new alchemical items provide rich fodder for players looking to dig into crafting and using alchemical items which go beyond the exactly two such items in the official rules.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 1-2 - under_first_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>While the collection of new items is exciting, perhaps the biggest draw here is the item crafting and resource management system, as well as a system for researching magic item recipes which is conspicuously absent from 5e\u2019s core rules despite mentioning magic item formulas as a requirement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-1 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 2 details a system of \u201cessences\u201d which can be collected from slain creatures and used as requisite materials for crafting magic items. This encourages players to hunt appropriate monsters if they want to craft items in a way that goes beyond the method in Xanathar\u2019s which leaves the DM to guess a CR-appropriate monster that the players must confront to craft an item. Similar systems can frequently devolve into an unpleasant spreadsheet management simulation, but Tome of Alchemy also offers market prices for essences so that players can fill in gaps at the DM\u2019s discretion if the DM doesn\u2019t feel like improving a quest to hunt down a Death essence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n<div id=\"ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155\"> <\/div>\n<!-- End Ezoic - early_content 2-2 - under_second_paragraph -->\n\n\n\n<p>The book is a little rough around the edges with a handful of editorial and layout issues, but the concepts of Tome of Alchemy are well implemented and much of the complexity is written in a way that you can use as much or as little as you want to suit your preferences. If your group wants a better way to handle crafting alchemical and magic items in 5e, Tome of Alchemy is a great option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tome of Alchemy is available for both DnD 5e and for Pathfinder 1st edition. This review is based on the version for 5e, and Frog God provided us with review copies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tome of Alchemy is available both digitally and physically:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drivethrurpg.com\/product\/346229\/Tome-of-Alchemy-5e?affiliate_id=389627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/about\/faq#what-are-affiliate-links-and-why-do-you-use-them\">affiliate link<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Alchemy-5e-Courtney-Campbell\/dp\/1665600950?crid=3IFIMKL51L0IL&amp;keywords=tome+of+Alchemy&amp;qid=1660311724&amp;sprefix=tome+of+alchemy%2Caps%2C128&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rpgbot-20&amp;linkId=2921356d6a7bc14111b0fc3ebfabe6b0&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Physical<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/about\/faq#what-are-affiliate-links-and-why-do-you-use-them\">affiliate link<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/TURQUOISE_Brett-1024x650.jpg\" alt=\"Tome of Alchemy - Turqoise\" class=\"wp-image-14488\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"time-to-do-some-research\">Time to do Some Research<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The ability for wizards to write spells into their spellbook is a staple of DnD dating back decades, but, for all of the editions that I\u2019ve played, the process for finding new spells has always been incredibly vague and left entirely to DM discretion. While that\u2019s often fine, it does often leave DMs to swing to the polar extremes of \u201csure, you can have whatever you want\u201d or \u201cno one else within 100 miles has a spellbook for you to borrow\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tome of Alchemy\u2019s first chapter includes a section on researching spells and items that provides an objective way to handle the subject and includes rules for requiring skill checks to do the research. Players must first use Charisma (Persuasion) to gather information about the spell or item, then must find an arcane library of sufficient size to contain what they need, then they must make a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check to do the research. The DC\u2019s scale quickly, so players will need to invest in their Arcana skill and still expect to fail from time to time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This both provides an interesting downtime activity for artificers and wizards and places a limitation on how many spells a character can feasibly collect unless they manage to loot another wizards\u2019 spellbook. For wizard players looking to collect everything under the sun, this provides an objective limitation which will make it difficult to solve every problem by knowing every spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly, the DCs for checks to research items are low compared to those for researching new spells. It\u2019s unclear if this is intended to allow non-wizards to use the system reliably or if the authors just felt that wizards needed more guard rails. Either way, the numbers are difficult, and there\u2019s a formula for research time which I don\u2019t think is really necessary, so I encourage you to use these rules as a basis and adjust the math to your group\u2019s preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/MITHRIL-1024x650.jpg\" alt=\"Tome of Alchemy - Mithril\" class=\"wp-image-14486\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-essence-of-crafting\">The Essence of Crafting<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The \u201cessence\u201d system introduced in Tome of Alchemy provides a somewhat abstract way to provide materials for crafting items. Nearly all of the items in the book come with an alchemical formula which requires some set of essences. The authors were careful to steer clear of official items, so for anything official you\u2019ll need to improvise a formula based on the included items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most essences are collected from dead creatures using alchemist\u2019s tools and arcana checks, though \u201cmineral essences\u201d are literally just bits of metal or dirt. The book includes tables with monsters from the SRD and what essences they provide. Weirdly, this includes intelligent humanoids like drow and orcs, leaving the party the grim possibility of collecting that resource. Have a talk with your players about the philosophical implications there before they explore that option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules do mention using additional essences to reduce crafting costs, but I\u2019ve been unable to find&nbsp; a formula for doing so. Even without that option, the need to collect and store some essences to craft magic items can still add a fun mechanic to the game. The list of essences is detailed enough to feel meaningful without becoming overwhelming, but if you want to simplify it further you could forgo the subtypes of essences (flight, speed, fear, etc.) and stick to just the broader types (air, water, salt, etc.), allowing your group to opt into as much or as little complexity as you prefer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/onyx-orcus-priests-1024x778.jpg\" alt=\"Tome of Alchemy - Onyx\" class=\"wp-image-14485\" width=\"840\" height=\"638\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-lot-of-these-things-explode\">A Lot of These Things Explode<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Many of the items in Tome of Alchemy are deliberately dangerous. The \u201cHow to Use This Book\u201d section discusses the implications of the book\u2019s contents, and recommends allowing access to the book\u2019s contents sparingly. Many of the items included could be problematic if they\u2019re easily available, so using them as an occasional novelty can be fun without breaking things in a metagame sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the risk of explosion and other hazards doesn\u2019t stop there. Tome of Alchemy includes detailed rules for how fire spreads, how gasses dissipate, the specific effects of various real-world substances like chlorine and propane, a table of throwable alchemical weapons taking up nearly two full pages, and a similarly large table of alchemical mishaps for when your players inevitable fail to fail craft something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the included items (both alchemical and magical) have similarly explosive and dangerous effects. There are gloves that you trigger with alchemical substances like fire and acid and then use them to punch things and hope that it hurts enemies more than you. There are fancy goggles that give you eye strain (\u201ccusps\u201d). There\u2019s literally a flamethrower in here.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pain-points\">Pain Points<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge in Tome of Alchemy is its handling of math. Many of the included subsystems rely on a series of formulas which can make using the included rules frustrating. Parts of this math could be simplified or outright removed and none of the fun of the system would be lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, many items provide numerical benefits which feel more at home in Pathfinder than in 5e. The book also has a version for Pathfinder, so it\u2019s possible that some of Pathfinder\u2019s math bled into the 5e version. It\u2019s nothing that will stop you from using the book, but it may feel out of place among official 5e content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some parts of the book are strangely organized. Chapter one introduces the basic concepts of the book, and the section on crafting and research is inexplicably followed by the section on fire and how it spreads, which feels confusing and out of place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The selection of items notably omits armor and weapons. While that\u2019s perfectly fine in a book about alchemy, it does limit the usefulness of the crafting system. Including a table of items from the SRD with associated alchemical recipes would be a massively useful addition, even if it were just a small selection of items to give DMs a basis for their own recipes.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a lot to like from Tome of Alchemy. The core concept of the crafting system is great despite my minor complaints about some of the mathematical details. I really enjoy the essences system, and I appreciate the detailed examples of essences taken from various monsters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I bring this into my game, I\u2019ll likely make some adjustments to the math, and I encourage you to make those same adjustments to suit your party\u2019s preferences. I might also offer the players a few of the included items as treasure like a 6-pack of something fun like Alchemist\u2019s Fist so they can play with it a bit without it taking over the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a few rough edges, I\u2019m very happy with Tome of Alchemy. I would absolutely use this for players interested in crafting in 5e as a replacement or complement to the official crafting rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tome of Alchemy is available both digitally and physically:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.drivethrurpg.com\/product\/346229\/Tome-of-Alchemy-5e?affiliate_id=389627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/about\/faq#what-are-affiliate-links-and-why-do-you-use-them\">affiliate link<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Alchemy-5e-Courtney-Campbell\/dp\/1665600950?crid=3IFIMKL51L0IL&amp;keywords=tome+of+Alchemy&amp;qid=1660311724&amp;sprefix=tome+of+alchemy%2Caps%2C128&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rpgbot-20&amp;linkId=2921356d6a7bc14111b0fc3ebfabe6b0&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Physical<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/about\/faq#what-are-affiliate-links-and-why-do-you-use-them\">affiliate link<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Published by Frog God Games, Necromancer Games, and authors Courtney Campbell and Matt Finch, Tome of Alchemy set out to provide a more detailed ruleset for crafting items than that provided by the official rules for DnD 5e.
