I&#8217;ve really enjoyed their <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/1985-games-dungeon-craft-a-review\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"24675\">Dungeon Craft<\/a> tile series, so I was excited to see what their miniatures looked like. They were kind enough to give me to packs to review, and I finally cracked them open to take a look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forgive the poor lighting in the pictures below. I am not a good photographer.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-in-the-pack\">What&#8217;s in the Pack?<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Each pack contains 15 miniatures (11 medium sized and 4 large sized), plus matching bases for each so that you can use every mini in the pack simultaneously. The packs zip sealed, so you can also reuse them for storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The packs each contain a few duplicates, but you&#8217;ll still get a diverse set. I got one <a href=\"https:\/\/1985games.com\/products\/flat-pack-miniatures-orc-party\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orc<\/a> pack and one <a href=\"https:\/\/1985games.com\/products\/copy-of-flat-pack-miniatures-undead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Undead<\/a> pack. The Orc pack has a lot of duplicate mediums, while the Undead pack only has only one medium duplicate. I&#8217;m happy with the spread in both packs. If I&#8217;m using multiple enemies in an encounter, there are nearly always duplicate cratures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/IMG_0016-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-29422\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Orcs Flat-Pack Minies<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/IMG_0025-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-29424\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Undead Flat-Pack Minis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"minimal-setup\">Minimal Setup<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Each miniature comes with protective film on either face to prevent damage during shipping. Peeling the film off is exactly as satisfying as pulling the protective film off of a new phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/IMG_0010-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-29419\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Peeling off the protective film. It&#8217;s very satisfying.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve removed the film, grab the circular base of the matching size and push the tab at the bottom of the miniature into the slot on the base. The slots are a slightly tight squeeze to keep things from shaking loose, but a gentle tug will pull the miniature free for storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/IMG_0011-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-29421\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"standing-alongside-standard-miniatures\">Standing Alongside Standard Miniatures<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The scale of the miniatures is perfect for use on your standard combat grid. You don&#8217;t need to worry about collisions or snapping fragile parts of miniatures, and they don&#8217;t take up nearly as much space as my unpainted boxes of Bones miniatures. They also look nicer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\"  src=\"data:image\/gif,GIF89a%01%00%01%00%80%00%00%00%00%00%FF%FF%FF%21%F9%04%01%00%00%00%00%2C%00%00%00%00%01%00%01%00%00%02%01D%00%3B\" data-layzr=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/IMG_0019-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-29425\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Flat-Pack Miniatures standing alongsider a Hero Forge printed miniature.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At $14.99 a pack, you&#8217;re paying roughly $1 per miniature. Compare that to Reaper&#8217;s inexpensive Bones miniatures line, which starts at $2.99 for the cheapest miniature that they sell, and then remember that they&#8217;re unpainted. $1 per mini is a steal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably more fair to compare Flat-Pack Miniatures to standees or &#8220;pawns&#8221; like those produced by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pathfinder-Monster-Core-Pawn-Box\/dp\/1640785914\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paizo<\/a>. The Monster Core pawns boxed set costs $74.99 and comes with 450 pawns, which works out to about $0.17 per miniature. That&#8217;s cheaper, but it&#8217;s also card stock instead of durable plastic. I would expect them to wear down over time, but I&#8217;ve never put my hands on them, so I don&#8217;t know for sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently there are only two sets of flat-pack miniatures, so the diversity of options is very limited, but it&#8217;s also a new product from a tiny company. I&#8217;m excited to see future packs expanding the line.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"another-hit\">Another Hit<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very happy with the flat-pack miniatures. They use 1985 Games&#8217; consistently excellent art, the plastic feels sturdy, and the form factor is great for a DM or GM who might need to haul their miniatures to their games or who might not have a lot of space for bigger, bulkier miniatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flat-Pack Miniatures are avaiable on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/1985games.com\/products\/dungeon-craft-fallen-kingdom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1985 Games online store<\/a>.
