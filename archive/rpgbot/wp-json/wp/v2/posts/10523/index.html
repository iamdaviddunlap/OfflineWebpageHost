Well, settle in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time, <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/author\/harlequin\/\">Random<\/a> (RPGBOT.Podcast co-host) was starting up a Rise of the Runelords campaign. This was my first introduction to the Golarion setting, and somehow I landed on the idea of playing a lawful-good paladin devoted to the god of wealth and commerce. Very &#8220;I would like everyone to be financially stable and comfortable&#8221;, best-case capitalism idealist. 8 Wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted and extra Trait for my build, and PF1&#8217;s rules recommend taking a Drawback to offset a third Trait. I wanted the Flaw to actually be impactful rather than another excuse to min-max, so I let Random pick for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, he picked Avarice, and that turned my whole character concept on its head. Suddenly my lawful-good, pro-social, optimistic capitalist paladin was also greedy to the point that it was a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started looking for a solution. How could I come up with a way to justify to the party that I need 10% more loot than everyone else? Well, first I needed to know both how much loot everyone was getting and exactly how much 10% would be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the Quartermancer. I appointed myself the party&#8217;s Quartermaster, declared that I would keep and manage a portion of the party&#8217;s fund dedicated to mutual benefit (wands of cure light wounds, paying for shared costs, etc.), and built the Quartermancer to ensure that everyone got an even split (adjusted for the &#8220;party fund&#8221;).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got some side-eye from the party about the arrangement, but it worked out. My paladin had a lengthy adventuring career, got married, adopted some local goblin children, and eventually retired to a quiet life as a bureaucrat in Sandpoint after having dying twice about half-way through Rise of the Runelords.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An unfortunate casualty of last year&#8217;s move to WordPress was that most of our tools broke.
