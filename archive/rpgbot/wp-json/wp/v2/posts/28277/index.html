Building a party around a single class presents unique challenges often due individual classes\u2019 limited capabilities.

They do have very limited skill options, and Charisma-based skills are especially difficult, but even that can be overcome.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-party\">The Party<\/h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-1-forge-domain-cleric\">Member 1: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/forge\/\">Forge Domain Cleric<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Of all four of our clerics, our Forge Domain Cleric is the only one with heavy armor, so they\u2019re a natural choice for our Defender. Adding Booming Blade from either Magic Initiate or from our race (High Elf, half high elf, etc.) will be very helpful here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blessing of the Forge and Soul of the Forge can both get us a +1 bonus to AC, letting us hit 22 AC with a shield. Normally I would warn you about the Tank Fallacy here, but, if you cast Spirit Guardians and Booming Blade, that stops being a concern.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-2-light-domain-cleric\">Member 2: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/light-domain\">Light Domain Cleric<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>While all clerics have offensive spellcasting, the Cleric\u2019s spell list lacks the good instantaneous area damage that we expect from a Blaster. Light Domain addresses this by giving us Fireball, as well as giving us a good single-target damage option in Scorching Ray, allowing us to claim the role of Striker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Light Cleric\u2019s build is the simplest, so we\u2019ll make this our Face. This is a back line caster, so we can afford to slack a bit on both Dexterity and Constitution, leaving plenty of room for a bit of Charisma. We can get Insight and Persuasion from our class skills, too, so it\u2019s easy to fill out all of the Face skills. We can complement our skills with Guidance and with Enhance Ability.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-3-knowledge-domain-cleric\">Member 3: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/subclasses\/knowledge-domain\/\">Knowledge Domain Cleric<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Our party\u2019s Scholar, the Blessings of Knowledge feature gets us Expertise in two knowledge skills, immediately setting us up for success. We can likely afford to invest in a little bit of Intelligence, too.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-4-trickery-domain-cleric\">Member 4: <a href=\"https:\/\/rpgbot.net\/dnd5\/characters\/classes\/cleric\/trickery-domain\/\">Trickery Domain Cleric<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The closest we can possibly get to a rogue, our Trickery Domain Cleric will be our party\u2019s Scout. We\u2019ll need to rely on spells to compensate for our lack of Expertise, and a race which provides additional skill proficiencies is essential.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-report-card\">The Report Card<\/h2>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><thead><tr><th>Role<\/th><th>Member(s)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Blaster<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Controller<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Defender<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Face<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Healer<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scholar<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scout<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Striker<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Support<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Utility Caster<\/td><td>Everyone<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-strength\">Biggest Strength<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Cleric\u2019s spellcasting remains a dominant part of the party\u2019s capabilities. Abundant healing, defenses, buffs, and utility options allow us to address many challenges magically.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"biggest-weakness\">Biggest Weakness<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>The Cleric is limited only by their spell slots. While they can technically use weapons, they\u2019re usually terrible at doing so, so any serious challenge will involve spending spell slots. If you run out of spell slots, you\u2019re going to run into trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>How many flavors of \u201cI cast Spirit Guardians\u201d can you come up with? Because a lot of your encounters are going to start with the party discussing whose turn it is to do a beyblade impression.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction We\u2019re taking a look at building single-class parties.
